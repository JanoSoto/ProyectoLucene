At first, I couldn't figure out why I kept revisiting D.C. when it showed up on cable - it's not a cinematic wonder or a work of art (something it doesn't strive to be, by the way), not even a story that you can say it's really original. But as I became more familiar with the film, I could see why it always pulled me in it's a triumph of story-telling, of the WAY and PACE the story is revealed in small precise doses much like slowly completing a puzzle, the kind of film you can only let go when the last missing piece (Selena's final flashback) fits into place. How the story manages to make such initially repulsive characters (all of them!!) develop into sympathetic (or at least pathetic) ones is of course Stephen King's special talent, expertly translated by the fine jobs by the screenwriter, actors and director of Dolores Claiborne. The cinematography is kind of obvious in its distinct color treatment of past and present, but the entire cast is inspired, including Kathy Bates' best-ever performance (she has stated so herself), especially in the flash-back scenes; delightfully virtuoso Judy Parfitt (you just keep hoping along for more Vera's scenes, and each one of them is a knockout); and reliable pros Christopher Plummer, David Strathairn (such an underrated actor!) and John C. Reilly. Even Jennifer Jason Leigh for once has her irritating mannerisms fit perfectly to build her terribly tormented character.That's what good story-telling is all about even if you already know the plot from A to Z, you just want to see once again the way it unfolds, like a good scary fairy tale. Dolores Claiborne is not without faults, but it's certainly worth your time, and even more than once.

But showy (and fun) as that role was, it wasn't really much of an acting part--the real heavy lifting in that film was done by James Caan in his quieter, subtler role as the object of Bates's affection.In 'Dolores Claiborne,' Bates finally gets a King role fully worthy of her range and subtlety. She pulls off the age transformations beautifully--I actually wondered at times whether young Dolores or old Dolores was closer to her real age. She still gets to have fun with King's trademark Maine dialect ('Now you listen to me, Mr. Grand High Poobah of Uppah Buttcrack!' is a line that gets me every time), but she never goes too far, and her every gesture tells of her great loves for her daughter and her friend, without ever exaggerating or sentimentalizing them. It's a remarkable performance, and the actress is probably right to remember it as her best role.The rest of the film into which the performance fits creaks a bit in places (the final melodramatic scene at the hearing is pretty hokey), and it's complicated somewhat by Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance, which may be *too* good--her Selena comes off as so angry and selfish that we don't particularly *want* her to reconcile with her mother. But overall, the film's an artistic success, done in a classic American style, and using the simple but effective device of changing the color scheme to ease us from the present to the past. The supporting cast more than stands up to Bates, too. Judy Parfitt is all too believable as Vera Donovan, especially in her younger incarnation--those of us who grew up in tourist towns are very familiar with this kind of harpy queen who comes to town and sets up shop for good. But the part isn't a simple caricature--those tears of anger and pride that Vera cries for Dolores and her daughter feel very real indeed. Christopher Plummer, with his mushy red nose and schoolteacher's diction, overdoes it a bit, perhaps, but it basically goes with the character he's been given. And David Strathairn's Joe St. George surely deserves a high place in the canon of Stephen King movie villains. Strathairn makes him as bad as can be, and yet there's occasionally a playful touch that *almost* makes us see why Dolores married him in the first place.In the end, a rather underrated film, successful on many levels. 8.5. out of 10.

Her acting is so strong, deep, and subtle, it's outrageous that she wasn't even nominated for the Academy Award. I think it's because the film was released early in the year and was out of theatres already when the nominations were made. She's better here than about ten Oscar-winning actors I can think of, put together -- a one-woman textbook of how to act for the screen.Bates won an Oscar for MISERY, but she's better here, because the story and the character are more interesting, complex and challenging. With flawless technique, and great depth of feeling, she delivers one of the finest screen performances of the 1990s.Okay, the denouement's a bit strained, and there's a sprinkling of stilted, hokey lines (Stephen King was never good at writing believable dialogue, and his addition of forced scatology and cussing doesn't make it any less stilted.) But overall the complicated story, which flashes back and forth over a period of twenty years, is extremely well-told. The constant shifting from past to present is never confusing -- an achievement in itself!This film never found its audience, somehow, and even some critics missed how good it was. I notice Maltin's book now raves over the film, giving it 3 1/2 stars, the same rating he gives to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. The violence here is more psychological than bloody, but DOLORES is every bit as good a thriller as LAMBS, and Bates, quite frankly, can act circles around Jodie Foster.

Horror elements are best left described rather than shown - so that the darkest recesses of our own imaginations can fill in the details. The horror visions of others may or may not affect us the same way - more often than not, they fall short of true terror.But DOLORES CLAIBORNE is the exception - a masterful condensation of the Stephen King novel of the same name. More compact and deeply psychological than the novel, the film focuses almost exclusively on telling the story (in both present-day AND multiple flashback story lines) of Dolores Claiborne and her daughter, Selena.Charged with murdering her wealthy but crippled employer, Dolores (Kathy Bates) is reunited with her estranged daughter, Selena (Jennifer Jason-Leigh). Sullen, brilliant, but deeply disturbed by a past that still obviously haunts her, Selena returns to the lonely and isolated Maine fishing village to help her mother face the legal and familial issues raised by the murder accusation.We learn that Dolores had previously been suspected of killing her abusive and alcoholic husband. The same detective who had been unable to press the case 17 years earlier is now assigned to the new investigation. And as his work proceeds, secrets from the past reveal themselves, through brilliant use of flashbacks.The acting by all concerned is first rate, with Bates giving probably her finest non-Oscar-nominated performance. Jason-Leigh is spot-on as the psychologically damaged and cynical Selena - more a victim than even she knows. Christopher Plummer is excellent as the detective.Taylor Hackford's direction is absolutely brilliant - as is the use of color saturation and creative scene blending and transition to move seamlessly between present and past.This is an outstanding film - well worth the Oscar nominations it received (as well as those it did not!).

Released at a time when a drama, even a dramatic thriller, coming from Stephen King would be known more for being a drama from the master of horror than anything else, Dolores Claiborne is still a surprisingly capable legal thriller with a remarkably intricate story. Dolores Claiborne is an unskilled housewife living in Maine with her abusive husband and abused daughter, and things get progressively worse until she finds herself with an sexually abused daughter and a dead husband on her hands. The indictment for the murder of her husband doesn't stand in court, and years later she is again faced with the capital charge as the woman that she has been working for as a maid for so many years falls or is thrown down the stairs of her house to her death, and it's up to the town's Detective, played brilliantly by Christopher Plummer, to prove that it was not an accident. Oh no, not an accident at all. Detective Mackey (Plummer), let Dolores get away once and damned if that nonsense was going to happen again.Unfortunately, Jennifer Jason Leigh, a genuinely gifted actor, is saddled with a part that forces her to play within the confines of a tortured soul, making her performance come off as forced and unconvincing, meanwhile Kathy Bates once again fills the screen with her powerful presence, delivering what has to be one of her best performances. The story takes place in cold Maine weather that is so effective that it almost makes you want to put a jacket on, and in a house that is so gray and lifeless and empty that after watching the movie I had to go to the supermarket and buy a steak. That may not make sense, but here's something that does, the characters in this movie are so well rounded that it almost seems like a documentary. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're living so far in the past that you still rent from Hollywood Video and pay their late fees. Don't miss this one!

How often do you get a good movie with such subjects. Not very often, because most of the time these are awful TV-movies that seem to be written at a rate of at least one an hour. Always following the same concept, always trying to make the poor viewer cry his eyes out while saying that that poor woman / child didn't deserve to be treated that bad. Now don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not saying that it should be tolerated. Men who do such awful things can't be punished hard enough, but the movies that are made about this subjects are complete crap most of the time.Dolores Claiborne tells the story of a woman who is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she worked for as a maid in Maine. When her daughter Selena finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she immediately returns home from New York, leaving her job as an important reporter behind for a while. But she doesn't return to support her mother as you might expect. No, she's almost certain that she did it and she seems to try to get a good story out of it. But gradually she finds out what really happened and in the meantime some awful things about Selena's troubled childhood, the awful family life,... come floating at the surface again.I know that I said in the beginning of this review that most movies with such a subject are plain crap, but there are always expectations to every rule and Dolores Claiborne certainly is one of those exceptions. It was written by Stephen King and it shows. The man knows how to build up suspense and certainly can give you an uneasy feeling while reading his books or watching one of 'his' movies. And Dolores Claiborne has a lot more depth than you might expect at first. The only thing is that they have managed to disguise it, not giving away too much information at a time. Only at the end of the movie you'll fully understand what has happened and what the reason was for both women to react the way they did.What I also liked, next to the story, was the way everything is shot. All the scenes in the present are shot in those cool blue tones, but these blend seamlessly into the flashbacks that were shot in vivid colors. This gives an extra touch to the story that certainly works. You know exactly what is the present and what is the past, but those colors also add a lot to the drama. But the way a movie was shot alone doesn't make it good of course. That's what good actors who do some excellent things are for. And that's also exactly what you'll get from Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Christopher Plummer... Jennifer Jason Leigh is nice as the daughter, but it's Kathy Bates and Christopher Plummer who give away the best performances in my opinion. Bates is stunning as the tormented woman who's personality seems so strong, while in reality she is a broken soul who wishes for nothing much but to die as soon as possible, so all her misery can end. And I also loved Plummer as Detective John Mackey who's hate against Dolores is so big, because she is the only spot on an almost spotless career. He has solved all his cases except for one and he'll not rest until he can send Dolores to jail.All in all this is a very good and suspenseful movie that never tries to become a tearjerker, despite the heavy subject. It offers some great acting, nice photography and a good story. That's about all I can wish for in a movie and I give it at least a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.

This is also adapted from a Stephen King horror novel and it might have been assumed that Kathy Bates was just re-visiting her familiar Misery territory.   That assumption is very unfair here, just as the assumption that this is a horror movie.All the acting is great but special mention must go to Kathy Bates.

She dominates virtually every scene she's in, shows tremendous range, from tender to sour and bitter, to borderline maniacal, and leaves you wondering who else on Earth could possibly have pulled it off.That's not to belittle the rest of the cast. The other actors are  adequate at very least, and Judy Parfitt puts in a performance as the bedridden Vera Donovan, which is the one time that Bates is slightly overshadowed.Briefly, a middle-aged, working-class widow (Bates) in a small Maine town (where else, for SK?) is suspected of murdering her rich, elderly employer (Parfitt) in an apparently open and shut case. Christopher Plummer is the nasty lawman who is convinced she also killed her husband years before. Meanwhile, her estranged daughter from New York comes up to cover the story for a newspaper, and... well, you don't really need to know any more details before seeing the movie.It's adapted from a Stephen King novel, and being a drama rather than a supernatural story, it has a flying headstart, being in the company of 'Green Mile', 'Stand By Me', and 'Shawshank Redemption' rather than 'Christine' or 'Salem's Lot'. Whereas it isn't in the exalted league of those movies, it's miles ahead of most of the horror adaptation of King stories. Take Bates out and it might be rather ordinary, but as it it, Dolores gets a very solid 7.0 from me.

So it is with Dolores. A co-worker, who is a Stephen King aficionado, cited this one shining example of a movie version of one of his books that she actually preferred to the novel. Right away, as the viewer, you are thrown into a car with a broken family, an unstable mother and her estranged stand-offish grown daughter, glimpsing a small, isolated, suspicious island community on the way to the old family home full of painful, bitter memories - and you spend the rest of the movie discovering their hidden secrets. Kathy Bates is once again equal to the task of the marvelously enigmatic title role character but I found Jennifer Jason Leigh spell-binding as the spiteful, lost, embittered daughter. It is her slow, slow shedding of this bitterness towards her mother that is the essence of this movie. There is a scene between the two that I consider one of the best scenes in all of film - period. How JJL failed to garner attention for her performance here is incomprehensible. The film's use of flash-backs throughout places you 'back' and enables you to get a feel for Dolores and her thoughts and actions for yourself as well as her family, her marriage, her home, and her small community. YOU get to decide if Dolores is guilty of murder. Christopher Plummer is also well cast as the thorough, relentless investigator who pursues her and who has his own secrets. Lastly, I have put a spoiler warning here because I want to mention the last scene. Fittingly, it is between mother and daughter. Earlier in the film, Dolores had told her daughter I don't CARE what other people think (about what she did)! It's what YOU think that matters! At the end, JJL solemnly declares I'm not sure how to feel about what you did. Maybe I never will. But I know you did it for me. I recommend this film to anyone who has ever suffered because of, or ever been hurt by, the ones he/she loves. It's a gem.

Ironically, all three books (and the movies) don't belong to horror genre. They are the combination of many genres, including crime, drama, and thriller. Dolores Claiborne which is the story told by its main character explores many difficult subjects &#150; failed marriages that result in dysfunctional families, relationship between a mother and a daughter and how far would mother go to protect her child.Dolores Claiborne works for many years as a maid for wealthy and demanding Vera Donovan and after Vera's suspicious death is accused of murdering her employer. Det. John Mackey (Christopher Plumber), the shrewd investigator is absolutely sure that Dolores not only murdered Vera who left her a fortune but is also guilty of murdering her husband many years ago but never was charged for that crime. Dolores's daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a successful reporter who had not talked to her mother for years comes from New York City to cover the story. Who is Dolores &#150; a greedy monster and a murderer or an unhappy woman for whom an accident is sometimes a best friend? Kathy Bates received the Oscar for her portrayal of a psychotic nurse in another King's adaptation, Misery but I believe that Dolores Claiborne is her best role. She carries the film and I don't think that any other actress could fit the part as well as Bates did which brings the question &#150; maybe King wrote the book with her in mind, who knows? Judy Parfitt is extremely well cast as Vera Donovan, an arrogant ice queen, who was capable of understanding and care for Dolores and her daughter and who knew too well about loneliness and despair.

Inspector Mackey leads the investigation, however his view is tainted as he failed to convict Dolores for the murder of her husband Joe, almost 20 years ago - his only unclosed case.  As the present murder is investigated the truth about the past is slowly revealed.How many Hollywood films give good roles to women.  Not many - certainly not older women.  This stands out because it has three good roles for women and a very strong supporting cast.  The story is compelling, the present murder is slowly revealed, while the back story between Dolores, Selena, Joe and Vera is slowly spun out in memories.  The various strands are all gripping - the level of detail and back story is excellent.  The way the past is weaved into the present is well handled and you never feel like there's too much going on - each strand compliments the others.The flashbacks are well filmed - each memory is painted bright with sunshine and gaudy colours.  Like Selena's memory, it all seems better in hindsight.  The present is filmed in pale greys, not even flesh colours come across  - everyone looks ashen and grey.  The director also deserves praise with the way he blends the present scenes into the past - the camera moves slightly revealing past action.  At the end, every story is revealed and it's very satisfying.As I said, the cast are excellent.  If Bates got an Oscar for Misery then she more than deserved one here.  She is superb in older and younger roles.  She has some annoying habits, mainly the phrases she uses - but she brings out so much hurt, so many layers and so much resentment really well.  Jason-Leigh is as good as always and is suitably disturbed - she is very well matched by her younger version, Ellen Muth, who matched Leigh's manner and speech well.  Parfitt is an excellent Vera, she has a smaller role but deals with the changes very well.  The support cast are all excellent - three stand out.  Strathairn is excellent as the abusive Joe, Plummer is great as the cop, who turns out to have as many unresolved issues as Selena.  The cast is rounded off by John C Reilly, who is always great.Overall this is a well-acted compelling story.  It lacks the sudden horror of Misery, but is a much more fully developed character piece.

Many critics unfairly panned this film as merely Kathy Bates' second attempt to earn an oscar, by comparing her work in this film to her performance as Annie in Misery. Unfortunately, this comparison would preclude much of the nuances of inner turmoil that Bates adds to her exceptional turn as the film's title character. The open-minded viewer will come to feel a remarkable depth of sympathy for Dolores' plight, and this is a direct function of the quality of Bates' performance.Equally as impressive is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Delores' sullen daughter, Selena. Brooding and Tortured is a character type the Leigh does better than just about anyone (re watch her performance in Georgia), and very few cinematic characters carry the emotional trauma of Selena. As the film progresses and Selena comes to confront the demons of her past, her character becomes a victim of her past, and the image of a resentful daughter that is so prevalent at the outset of the film fades away.The character of Vera, the invalid that Dolores is accused of murdering, is also mutifaceted. Judy Parfitt conveys all of the blase and patronizing attitudes of the affluent, but as her character deteriorates, she, like Dolores and Selena, reveals the extent of her own victimization. When she says that sometimes being a bitch is the only thing a woman has left to hold onto, (which is STILL one of the best lines EVER) it is perfectly evident that she has earned the privilege of making such a statement, although she may not have previously seemed to have that much depth.Rating 9 out of 10. Absolutely brilliant acting, with fascinating, engaging characters and intelligent dialogue. The plot and the direction progress effortlessly towards the eventual, horrifying conclusions that each woman must face.

Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Gabriel Beristain.Plot sees Leigh as Selena St. George, a big-city reporter who travels to her home town island in Maine when her mother is accused of murdering the elderly woman that she was caring for. Her estranged mother, Dolores (Bates), is also widely suspected to have killed her husband and Selena's father some 20 years earlier, even though that was ruled as an accident. As mother and daughter come together, secrets of the past merge with the harshness of the present.A terrificly well acted and well mounted drama doing justice to a great book, Dolores Claiborne thrusts family trauma to the front of an on going murder investigation. King adaptations are well known for being very hit and miss, but this is certainly one of the better ones, it sees a shift from standard horror monsters, to monsters of a different kind, the human ones. Played out to a perpetually dank backdrop of rain, grey skies and a sea devoid of beauty, film unfolds to reveal the sadness of one family's roots, where emotional discord hangs heavy, constantly. The structure is well handled by Hackford, as present day scenes merge into those from the past, giving off a perfectly ghost like feel to the plotting. Plummer's weary detective John Mackey is a bit too underwritten for my liking, and the time afforded the pre-trial debate and inquest is simply not enough to make the required impact once all the revelations come tumbling forward. The latter unforgivable given the film runs at over two hours.However, slight irks aside, this is still great stuff and if only for the trio of lead lady performances then this is a must see for the drama seeking film fan. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Great performances from two great actresses","Date":"22 July 2009","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" While this isn't a film I'd watch often because of the subject matter it is none the less a brilliant film starring two great actresses on top form.

Somebody in the town sends a fax of the local newspaper report to Dolores' estranged daughter Selena, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is working as a reporter in New York, when she gets this she returns to Maine.What follows is a gripping story which not only includes the present case but the death of Selena's father many years before. The police officer who investigated the earlier case was certain that Dolores had murdered her abusive husband but couldn't prove it, now investigating the second death he is determined that he will convict her. Much of the story is shown in flashback to when Selena was a child before her father died.The acting to top notch throughout, not just the two leading ladies; David Strathairn as the abusive husband, Ellen Muth as the young Selena and Christopher Plummer as the detective stand out in particular. The juxtaposition of the grey and wet present with the bright and sunny flashback scenes means we are never in any doubt about which time period we are watching even when both periods are on the screen at the same time.

As an actor, they seem to make everything so easy and natural! And you never know where they are going with their characters. This is becoming more a review of the actors rather than of the movie. One of the reasons I haven't seen this movie until now is actually because of the dreadful title and cover! But it is another great Stephen King-film! As the movie goes on, what you think you knew isn't as simple as that, and your judgement of the characters might seem to be made to soon. But the storytelling and the acting is just perfectly done! I can't believe this film didn't win or at least was nominated for more awards?! The acting is just great. Wish there were even more scenes with Vera, all of her scenes were amazing and you never could see where it was going, which I think is great! The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is the lighting. I find it to depressive, even though I understand it is a deliberate choice it doesn't serve the movie. Just a little brighter would have been fine by me. But King is a truly great storyteller and the actors are masters of their craft!

Campy it is, and to a great extent due to some friendly motifs a mother/daughter dysfunctional relationship (borrowing from Hitchcock's Marnie, in a way, also venturing into Bergman territory); two women living together in an isolated house, one of them incapacitated, the other one the carer (shades of Baby Jane, n'est-ce-pas?); a lurid family secret and childhood trauma involving (or not) sexual abuse (Marnie, again, and others), an so on. On top of that, Dolores Claiborne is heavily filtered and moody, has two strong central female performances (three, counting Parfitt, who flees into mannerisms a little too often but has her moments) - and features a very efficient male bitch (Christopher Plummer). It contains a very descriptive fully blown symphonic score by Danny Elfman, and Taylor Hackford cuts back and forth in time and narrates the story slowly and with elegance and style. The dialogue is on a high note, but fits in well in the atmosphere, and fans of both Bates & Jason Leigh get united here for a special treat from both actresses - one-liners fly like knives in Carrie, words are bitter and feelings deep. The pivotal scene of the film - the one revealing the event which triggered Jason Leigh's neurosis in adolescence - is memorably directed and genuinely unsettling to watch time and again.

Yes, the movie will blow you away, yet&#x1B; in a very divergent way, DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a majestically hatched harangue to the male-dominant society with a pungent tint of misandry, and miraculously, as a male audience, I am not repelled at all, because a trio of actresses thoroughly win me over with their powerhouse rendition, they all act like a bitch to survive in the inequitable world, the undertone oozes with bone-chilling malignity which as if we are reaping our own consequences to disparage the worth of womanhood. Director Taylor Hackford (Mr. Helen Mirren) maximizes the juicy script (adapted by Tony Gilroy with superb grasp on verbal tit-for-tat) with contrast palettes (seamlessly segue between bleak present and balmy past) to channel us into two unsolved death cases. 15 years later, Selena (Leigh), a young reporter in New York, reluctantly revisits her mother Dolores in remote Maine, who is accused of murdering the aforementioned Vera, a rich widow and the longtime employer of Dolores, who works as a maid in her house for over 20 years. Local detective John Mackey (Plummer) keeps his suspicious eyes on Dolores and steps up offensively, while the friction between the mother-daughter pair exacerbates since there is an irreconcilable one-sided estrangement (Selena to Dolores) or even hatred standing between them. Soon what really troubles all these people comes to light, it is many many years ago during an eclipse day, Dolores' domestic abusive husband Joe (Strathairn, heinous, smug, but dangerously sexy) accidentally (or not?) fell to his death near their home, and Dolores gets away with it (and thus ruined Mackey's perfect career record), but the truth is never that simple, the justification and motivation behind a premeditated murder is converted to a self-defensive protection, it is a familial harassment with a much dark and more reprehensible secret, but the repercussions haunt and torture the pair for so many years although the maltreater bit the bullet long ago.Firstly Kathy Bates is robbed for an Oscar nomination say the very least, compellingly affectionate and decisively bold as a desperate mother who will do anything to offer a better prospect for her daughter, a selfless love which she asks no recompense, even though Selena completely cuts her out of her life, she is just contented to collect her newspaper articles and be as proud as a mother can be. Bates is simply a nonesuch to be a big-screen diva with her killing bearing fluctuating between a vulnerable housewife and redoubtable matron. Jennifer Jason Leigh, the most under-appreciated actress among her coeval, strikes as an unthankful and wayward stuck-up hipster at first, but she slowly unwinds her wound with aching perseverance and she is pretty amazing too, we are all fully aware there must be a reason behind all the bickering and rebuffs, then we discover her deepest trauma which she wholly obliterates, it hits like a big bang, and she generates wonderful luster of compassion no lesser than Bates. The biggest surprise is the lesser-known theater actress Judy Parfitt, a bona-fide scene-stealer, plumb pivotal to the sinuous storyline, who registers unsettling incarnations during two different time frames, the younger Vera who is haughty and fastidious on the appearance, far-seeing and astute underneath; then the elder Vera, paralyzed and miserable, death is her only salvation and she wants to culminate it in her own way for the last time. Although the She is my current win for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS of 1995 while Leigh comes strong as the third. Last but not the least, Christopher Plummer never fail to attain the limelight with his incisive gaze and lucid utterance, even the character is not particularly interesting. DOLORES CLAIBORNE radiates phenomenal visual potency by juxtaposing the eclipse marvel with the accentuated action set piece, only when the sun is blocked by the moon, as if it symbolizes, that's the time the cold-blooded retribution can be consummated with heightened sentient venting! A truly remarkable movie and let's not diminish the merit of the perfectly aligned score by Danny Elfman.

The story revolved around the relationships between Dolores Claiborne (Bates) and the people in her story her drunken, abusive husband (Strathairn), her overbearing employer (Parfitt), her estranged but feisty daughter (Leigh), and the tough local cop (Plummer). I particularly liked Judy Parfitt, a star of the British stage and screen, the elegant but exploiting employer, who counted the number of clothespins on the line and who became a bedridden tyrant. Plummer was at his best as the sheriff out to nail Dolores. Jennifer Jason Leigh was the offspring of Dolores and her husband Joe St. George who carried the scars from childhood of their strained relationship. The movie was shot in Nova Scotia, not Maine, and there are a number of dead giveaways that a Nova Scotian or Canadian would notice. The Josua Slocum, the ferry running to the island, is one of the ferries off The Digby Neck. There are great shots of the Lunenburg Academy and the scrubby coastal landscape of the south shore of Nova Scotia. The visuals add to the pleasure of this well acted and smartly scripted movie.

It's a long but heavily engrossing story of damaged people affected deeply by the past and living in a dreary present, and a story of the fractured relationship between a long estranged mother and daughter with differing memories of long ago events. Eventually truths are revealed and they are able to finally able to make some sort of attempt at coping.Kathy Bates, who'd performed so superbly and memorably as the villainess in the previous King adaptation Misery, here plays a more sympathetic person, the title woman who's had to put up with a lot of garbage during her life. In the present day she stands accused of murdering her longtime employer, Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt). This brings Dolores's bitter daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) home for the first time in a while. Selena still hasn't forgiven Dolores for the past, and a weary old detective bearing a grudge (Christopher Plummer) is determined that this time he will prove Dolores to be a killer.Set on a fictional Maine island dubbed Little Tall Island, this was filmed in Canadas' province of Nova Scotia (which is close enough to Maine geographically), and there's plenty of atmosphere to be enjoyed in the presentation. The films' biggest visual hook is the way that director Taylor Hackford and director of photography Gabriel Beristain differentiate points in time, by having the '75 period be bright and sunny and well lit to having lots of overcast skies and a somber mood to permeate the '93 scenes.The tale itself is one of Kings' best, and it receives respectful treatment from Hackford and screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who with the assistance of some very good actors create a rich gallery of personalities. Bates, Leigh, and Plummer are all wonderful; David Strathairn is very much slime personified as the worthless husband / father, Parfitt is a delight as the rich society type with more heart than she likes to reveal, Ellen Muth is touching as the teen aged version of Selena, and John C. Reilly is likable as well meaning constable Frank Stamshaw.Everything is further enhanced by a haunting and emotional score composed by Danny Elfman and good visual effects; the climactic solar eclipse is well realized on film.Those King fans disappointed with the quality of some of the films based on his work need only check out or revisit this resonant gem.

Unfortunately, many of them are quite bad, fortunately this isn't one of those. I hadn't got round to reading the book before seeing this, but I don't think that affected my enjoyment of it. King invents such great characters and this is a case in point, some really well rounded characters and a mystery thriller to boot! Who couldn't ask for more? Here's a brief summary before I give you my take on it.We begin with the death of Vera Donovan, a rich old lady who lived alone with her carer, Dolores Claiborne. We find Vera at the bottom of the stairs with Dolores standing beside her, arms raised with a heavy rolling pin in her hands. She expires before Dolores uses it, but on that evidence, it doesn't look good for her. In New York, Dolores has a daughter, Selena, a journalist, who is faxed a copy of a local news report about the case. She arrives in the small town on an island off the coast of Maine to find her mother at the police station. Detective John Mackey, who is running the investigation is keeping here there because the house she was living in, Vera's, is now a crime scene. Dolores decides to stay in her own house, the one she had shared with her abusive husband, Joe St. George and Selena, before he died many years before. Detective Mackey had investigated that death too, and had been suspicious that Dolores was responsible, but couldn't prove it. There is a lot of tension between Dolores and Selena, both have secrets. Secrets that are about to be revealed&#x85; I'll leave it there so them Spoiler Police don't try to throw me down a well or something.This is a very well made film that obviously had a decent budget. The sets and locations match the mood perfectly. I admit I was a little disappointed at how dull it all looked at first, but I soon realised that all of the flashback scenes, and there's quite a few of those, are all in vivid colour. As far as performances go, well I can't fault Kathy Bates as Dolores Claiborne, she hardly put a foot wrong, a masterful performance! Jennifer Jason Leigh also put in a good turn as Selena St. George, as did Judy Parfitt as Vera Donovan. I should also mention Christopher Plummer as Detective John Mackey and David Strathairn as Joe St. George, both also put in fine performances. John C. Reilly had a minor role as Const. Frank Stamshaw and finally a special mention for Ellen Muth, who did an excellent job as Young Selena in some of the flashback scenes.I really enjoyed this film with its intriguing characters and a plot that always keeps you guessing. It has quite a slow pace and is quite melodramatic, but I didn't mind that particularly, I was more interested in the characters and the plot. If I have one criticism, it is that it is a little too long and, because of this, it does seem to drag on a bit towards the end. Over all though, a film I very much enjoyed and one I can recommend to you.My Score 8.4/10 IMDb Score 7.3/10 (14,832 votes when this review was written).

Five years later, once again in a King adaptation, she gave arguably an even better and more multi-faceted performance in the title role of DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a non-horror story about a woman's past and the daughter she will do anything to protect. She is aided and abetted here by great performances by the ensemble Jennifer Jason Leigh as the adult Selena, Dolores's daughter, a pill-popping, hard drinking investigative reporter who dresses all in black and whose entire affect is one of leave me alone; Ellen Muth as Selena at thirteen (a particular coup; much of this movie is told in flashback and the resemblance between Muth and Leigh is astounding); Judy Parfitt as Dolores's imperious employer, Christopher Plummer as a detective with an axe to grind against Dolores for something in her past; and the great David Strathairn as Dolores's alcoholic husband Joe. Yet this move failed to garner a single Oscar nomination, something I shall never understand.The flashbacks in this movie are perhaps the most arresting thing in it the story is memory, and what makes this film special is that the now is filmed in unrelenting shades of grimy grey, while the flashbacks are in brilliant color, a stroke of genius for director Taylor Hackford, as it delivers a powerful message that the past shapes us more than we even realize.Running through this film is the leitmotif Sometimes being a bitch is all a woman has to hold onto. Spoken by the adult Serena, Dolores's employer Vera Donovan, and Dolores herself, this is in many ways the central theme of the story the ways in which women are mistreated, judged, and often abused by the men around them. It is probably the most feminist story King ever wrote, a gritty and realistic tale about women taking care of one another and bonding together in defense against the various cruelties inflicted on them by the men in their lives.Bates is sensational in the title role; in many ways this is an even better performance than that which she gave in MISERY; it requires her to play a great deal many more notes, age something like eighteen years, and create a woman who is has become her own person through blood, sweat, and tears. Dolores is cranky, has a bit of a temper, and is eccentric in that there's always one in every small town kind of way. But not crazy. She is as sane as you and I (assuming of course that we are sane, but eye digress), and when faced with an abomination, she takes matters in hand out of sheer desperation. Yet to call her simply a victim would not be correct; she's tough, and she fights back. Fights dirty, too, when the need arises.Judy Parfitt as the snooty Vera is terrific; she gives the film a few laughs at unexpected moments despite the fact that at the end of the day she turns out to be the most tragic figure in the film.Perhaps the only member of the cast who can truly be called a victim is Selena at thirteen; Ellen Muth, a brilliant young actress, delivers the goods with a powerful performance that dovetails seamlessly with Leigh's portrait of the same character grown up. The adult Serena is better termed a survivor; she may overdo the booze and the pills, but she's still standing. Leigh is virtually flawless here.Special mention must be made of Christopher Plummer as the detective, so certain that Dolores has committed a murder that he enters the film with his mind made up. Condescending in the extreme, his final showdown, when it comes, is not with Dolores, but with Selena.And last but by no means least, the marvelous David Strathairn as Joe. Joe is a hateful character; he abuses Dolores both verbally and physically, and gets meaner when he drinks.

He is out to get Bates for the murder of her husband as well some 18 years before.Bates plays a housekeeper to a very vicious, perfectionist woman for many years. You have to wonder why she stayed with her that along, especially when the woman becomes bedridden. The surprise of the lesbian angle between the 2 women must have come as a jolt to the audience.Go know that Leigh was physically abused by her father as well.These interlocking problems certainly serves this movie quite well.Bates, as a victim of circumstances all around, is terrific here.

Adapted from King's novel, the screenplay by Tony Gilroy is very different from the novel but tight and clever.Kathy Bates gives a fantastically rounded performance; with fine support from Jennifer Jason Leigh, David Straithan, Christopher Plummer, and Judy Parfitt.The direction by Taylor Hackford is suprisingly good. And the movie has a unique visual impact on the viewer. Scenes in the present filmed in cold stark blue, while scenes from the past in vibrant brightness. Images of the sky and clouds dominate the movie, with the clouds either blood-streaked/dark/grey/white and fluffy - as befits the current mood of the upcoming scenes.A joy to watch, I highly recommend this movie. It's just a shame it has been so underrated, ignored at the Oscars; perhaps it was marketed too much as a follow-up (but not sequel) to Misery rather than on its own merits...

The love Dolores has for her daughter Selena gives her the conviction to withstand years of hard living so that her daughter's life could be better.This is one of Kathy Bates' best roles.  The oppressive employer Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt) is more than just the one dimensional character she initially appears to be.  Vera and Dolores, though living quite different lives, realize they have much more in common than they thought.  I was totally engrossed in the storyline and the depths of all the characters. The movie switches between the present and the past as the layers of each character's story and motivations unfold, showing a deeper side to Dolores and enabling Selena to finally grow up and see her mother for the resilient woman she is.

For starters, I am shocked that nobody received Oscar nominations especially Kathy Bates, the excellent Judy Parfitt, Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Jason Leigh, John C. Reilly, Ellen Muth, David Straitharn just to name a few all provide excellent support in telling a story of a lifelong Maine woman Dolores Claiborne St. George who has an abusive husband played well by David Straitharn and a daughter Selena equally played well by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ellen Muth. The death of Vera Donovan opens the movie to reveal flashbacks to the past. The unlikely bond of two very different women like Dolores and Vera is fascinating to watch over time. Vera is a difficult woman who expects everything to go her way. She is one of the most difficult employers too but somehow Dolores understands her ways. Despite their backgrounds, they become the closest of female friends. Vera says Sometimes being a bitch is the only thing a woman has is a classic line from the film. I love Kathy Bates and Judy Parfitt in this film. The director Taylor Hackford does an excellent job in depicting Maine's beauty in the fall. The solar eclipse is also inviting to see and the drama that occurs during it. King keeps getting better with his work. Bates' narrating over the action allows us to understand the character's harsh working conditions bestowed by Donovan. Plummer plays a district attorney bent on proving Claiborne's murderous ways in this film. The film allows the audience to determine how we view Dolores Claiborne, a simple Maine woman with a complicated life who made fateful decisions in a male dominated world. We leave asking ourselves what we would have done in that situation and that is what is makes it a great film. Not only that, we enjoy watching these actors and characters over and over again.

Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall (and Scatman Crothers) are great, but not as great as Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judy Partfitt, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly, Eric Bogosian and David Strathairn together!  What an incredible ensemble cast--excellent performances all!Although this is from one of the few King novels I haven't read (yet), I think it's fitting that the most thrilling suspense in a King flick would come from his one major non- supernatural outting.  This is rough territory, folks--if Sigmund Freud were to see this film somehow, they'd be dragging his sweaty, passed-out body out of the theatre about two thirds of the way through!  It only works because you care about the richly- developed characters.  (Any veteran King fan will tell you the spooks are icing on the cake--the characters are what matters.  King's love-affair with the American character, warts and all, is what makes him a national treasure.)And the plot?  I'll say nothing about the specifics, because (like Resevoir Dogs and Memento) the narrative structure, the very order in which the plot is unfolded, is the central pleasure of the film.  (Along with Kathy Bates' alternately chilling/heartwarming preformance, that is!)  One little thing this film has the best visualization of memories being superimposed on present-day vision that I've ever seen in a film.The less you know about this film, the better; don't even read the blurb on the back of the video or DVD case.

Dolores Claiborne shows that we humans can be terrifying in and of ourselves just being who we are.The title role is played by Kathy Bates. She's a widow suspected in the death of wealthy widow Judy Parfitt for whom she was housekeeper and general factotum. Parfitt fell down a flight of stairs in her home and the authorities in the person of Christopher Plummer think she had help from Bates.Plummer several years ago investigated the death of Claiborne's husband David Strathairn who was a drunken lout and something even more sinister I won't reveal. He couldn't make the case, but he's determined to get Bates and make up for the fact this was the one case out of 86 homicides he did not make an arrest.Jennifer Jason Leigh who is the daughter of Strathairn and Bates who is an investigative reporter working in New York. She comes in to town to see if she can help her mother. It's between Bates and Jason Leigh that we learn about how everyone is keeping secrets and as the secrets are revealed we see how the characters true nature is.The climax of the film is the coroner's inquest where Jason Leigh and Plummer go head to head. The last of the secrets are revealed and Jennifer who covered enough homicide cases rips the arrogant Plummer into shreds. As they dialog, Kathy Bates sits by and watches and does some of her best acting with her eyes. It's a touching scene with highest quality of acting all around.In fact Dolores Claiborne ought to be required viewing for potential thespians.

Dolores works for this horrid rich woman named Vera Donavan (Judy Parfitt)who is very particular about how the chores around her huge mansion are done (i.e., mildew is grounds for firing, 6 pins, Dolores!--for when Dolores hangs the laundry on the lines in front of the house. Dolores has no relief at home. Joe St. George, her alcoholic, brutal husband talks in a strong Maine accent with a slur to his speech. He abuses her by smacking her with a piece of wood. Dolores can't take it anymore and smashes him in the face with a vase. Selena sees this and her mother tells her to go to bed. Dolores defends herself with an ax and neither of them want to use it on the other. Dolores's misery doesn't end. After years of being Vera's housekeeper, she is demoted to being the woman's nurse. Vera is stroke ridden and she falls down the stairs. Vera begs Dolores to finish her off with a rolling pin and the mailman comes by thinking Dolores killed Vera. Detective Mackey played by the always great Christopher Plummer and an officer played by John C. Reilly come to Vera's house and put everything in plastic bags to keep the evidence intact.Pretty soon, Selena comes over because of a fax about the alleged murder she receives in New York City where she lives now. Selena is a prescription-drug abusing, chain smoking, troubled journalist who is quite bitter and wants nothing to do with her mother and past life on the island. Soon, it is revealed that Joe St. George was probably murdered by Dolores during a solar eclipse in the 1970s. Dolores found out he was stealing money from their daughter's bank account and that is not the real catalyst for Dolores's rage. She finds out from her their daughter that the father has been molesting Selena. Dolores makes Joe chase her across the lawn and he falls to his death in a hole in the yard the two of them didn't know about. Vera's death was also an accident because she fell down the stairs after a physical altercation with Dolores.All of the performers were excellent in this movie about trauma and coming to terms with the past. Dolores is played to perfection by Kathy Bates and JJL as Selena is also very good! Christopher Plummer as Detective Mackey is determined to see justice done and John C. Reilly in a dramatic role is a surprise as well. I was amazed by David Strathairn as Joe St. George. One year earlier he was Meryl Streep's wimpy, studious husband in The River Wild and now he is a complete total opposite as Joe St. George.

It really does screw up when it turns from a greatly constructed thriller from the mind behind the most terrifying novels that have sold million. Turns into a badly leaded, and cheaply constructed court room movie. A girl has to go to her hometown. In small pieces of sea-bedded land, in a small community. Where her hardworking mother has been arrested for killing someone. But when she returns, she opens a door to old memories, about nasty little things she had forgotten that had really happened. She hated and judicated her mother for it. Its a dramatic movie, that moves, loses and scares the viewer in ways the contemporary audience would'nt have expected from a King inspired story. Its ending is its only flaw. It dribbles on too long when the film should finished, but it had to tell what happens to the protagonists. Before that, it feels like a film directed by Sam Raimi with close ups and inventive shots of painted scenes and dark subject matter scenes have the contrast liquefied. And the film is always jumping into the past with injecting the colorful years back into the shot as it tells its story non-linearly in flashbacks.Its story is its attraction. So I will not spoil it in this review. But give you idea of what you're going into; get ready to be uncomfortable, both for an old film that has a slow start; and pathetic characters who wont be easy to like. Now to contradict that, this must the best casted film I've seen in awhile. Kathy Bates as Dolores Claiborne; she showed how good she is as a frighting number 1 fan in Stephen King's Misery and she is just as phenomenally entertaining in this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh is probably the worst casted member, she falls through most scene and makes it when its counts.But to be honest she playing a pretty messed up and broken, conflicted young woman in world where she has no control over what she wants or has any idea how bad thing really are. Christopher Plummer is easily the best performance and Judt Parfitt. But more memorable is the supporting role by John C Reiley; he's easy to dislike but makes the final scene a bit more bearable when his character finally makes sense.It has a cut-off small town in New England with each actor giving away that, with a borderline accent. It has two main plots, one about the past and redemption and revelation and the present that is like I said always coated in a dead dark and dramatic aesthetics that makes the well tolled tale more moving. A long time housekeeper is the main suspect to a murderer, but of course its not all that easy; its find by Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh) that in fact they loved each other and even help each other in terrible moments in the past. Then the second plot is about Selena herself taking control of her life by reciting her abusive alcoholic father and accepting her mother has always been there for her. A very sweet film when you don't think about some moments that are really dark, but King and the director Taylor Hackford; mash up their story telling talent with some really great filmmaking. with scenes like this; when the character is effortlessly looking into the past without prompt to whether the audience is ready. Or this scene when the mirror resembles how ruined their lives are. And this just amazing looking transcendence scene from the second act to the final act with a polarizing moon eclipse.But again; the only thing that would stop me from watching this stylish mystery drama is the ending. It could have ended somewhere before the final moments, before Jason Leigh gave the whole second degree in an unshabby courtroom scene and makes the other actors seem like they're saying your ruining this film. But I digress, a nice film is a nice film. And Dolores Claiborne is a Stephen King film made by Sam Raimi -- that's what the film felt like for me. But more seriously its a drama film for dramatic narrative. And looks way too nice not work on some less hardhearted viewers.

Like King's other works, Shawshank and Stand by Me, this book/film is firmly grounded in reality and details an tragically familiar tail of a woman (Dolores Claiborne played expertly by Kathy Bates) forced to make impossible decisions because of an abusive husband. Though the book the entire story is told entirely in flashback by Dolores to the police, the script writers decided for Dolores to tell the story piecemeal to her daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) as they are forced to reunite after Dolores is named a suspect in a murder. This provides a different focus to the plot, of mother and daughter reconciling, that is absent in the book. The acting overall is excellent (though it is sometimes a bit hectic) and the locations and setting are gorgeous and make the film visually interesting. Also, having a full-blooded, involved score from the great Danny Elfman works well for the film, though at some moments I found the music a bit too strange.

The thing she cares for more than anything else is her only child, Selena. She works as a housekeeper for a bitter snobby woman, Vera, to raise some money for Selena's schooling. Then one day she finds out that her abusive and alcoholic husband Joe has stolen it to buy booze and gamble. She also learns of a horrific secret, Joe has been molesting Selena. Vera suddenly becomes caring and kind for a few moments when alone with Dolores, and Dolores confesses the molesting to Vera. Vera answers, with tears in her eyes, husbands die all the time, maybe even now while you're here crying... they die, and leave their wives their money... I should know, shouldn't I? Sometimes they drive home with their mistress, when suddenly their brakes fail. She secretly helps Dolores with a plan, and Dolores murders Joe during a rare lunar eclipse. Several years later, Dolores is working with Vera, taking care of her in her old age. Vera has become depressed because of her old age and loss of her high status, degraded to wearing ugly cotton old lady nightgowns and diapers. She attempts suicide, and the postman assumes Dolores killed Vera. Selena, hearing of the news, travels home. Selena, after Joe's death, became deranged and depressed, relying on what Dolores calls happy-pills (most likely Prozac), to stay sane. She denies the past with Joe but Dolores still wants the truth to come out, to make it up to Selena once and for all. Amazing movie, (my aunt made the teapot featured in the scene where Vera attempts suicide). I watched it because it was filmed in my home province, Nova Scotia. I'm also a fan of Stephen King. I have to say it was a very intriguing film, I'd read the book and not really enjoyed it, but the movie was amazing! There was the scene right after Joe is killed, where Dolores looks up at the lunar eclipse, it was a beautiful scene, the one scene where it shows Dolores' true motives; to help her child lead a better life than she ever could. It was very sad, especially the scenes with Vera, she seems like a horrid old snot until in one scene she admits to Dolores the murder of her cheating husband, also helping Dolores with Joe's removal. In the end it turns out that Vera and Dolores loved each other, having nothing going for them, both being alone in the world and hated by all the neighbors. Yet they both want Selena to not have to live as they did. It wasn't really a horror film in my view, more a drama film from the point of view of the oddball women we see every day.

The horror of this film is on par with King's best -- except this time its real, and believable. With stunning cinematography of the (typical King) New England coastal town, and fine performances by supporting actors Leigh, Plummer, and Parfitt, this film kept me on the edge of my couch until the end, where, sadly, the plot seams begin to stretch and fray, a bit. Even so, the strength of the story, and performances carried it through for me.

After a few flashbacks, when Dolorles was crying in front of Vera, I began to realize that Very was telling in a quiet way, the her husband's death was no accident when the brakes failed. Vera's eyes had an indication of evil all the way through the movie. Delorles worked for Vera for 22 years and saved her money, but her husband stole it. It was never known why Vera left her $1,600,000 in her will, and that is what kept the detective going, trying to prove Delorles murdered her.

I like Stephen King (I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it - even though the fact that I read it on a sunny beach will colour my recollections). I like Kathy Bates and John C. Reilly. And I really like Jennifer Jason Leigh. Things are looking good for this movie so. And it delivered in almost every aspect. Almost. The film relays the story of a tough woman trying to get through her bad marriage, abusive husband (both to his wife and his daughter) and her penchant for being suspected of murder not once but twice in her lifetime.Dolores (Bates) is accused of murdering the wealthy woman she works for as a maid. When her daughter Selena (Leigh) finds out that her mother is accused of this crime, she returns home from New York. Not exactly to support her Mom - she is a reporter looking for a story. The fact that Dolores was a suspect in her husband's demise some 19 years earlier hasn't helped her in this particular case or in her life in general.The problem with most King adaps - is they can come across as trite and simplistic and what works on a page does not translate to the screen. There are exceptions of course - The Shining, The Dead Zone (terrific film), The Green Mile and of course The Shawshank Redemption. But for every Shawshank there is a 'Riding the Bullet' or a 'Maximum Overdrive'. Dolores Claiburne fits in the middle of these extremes.The story is good, the acting is good and the direction is good (I particularly liked the way that the flashback scenes are in vivid, bright colours whereas the scenes set in the present are in cold, blue tones).Bates is another Annie Wilkes type character here and she handles it just as well. She truly is a great actress and her portrayal of being a tough cookie with a strong heart was totally believable. Leigh is as intense as she always is. Her usual good looks washed away by the cold colours used by the lens to correctly depict her character as a washed-up, drugs-laden, hard drinking, lonely, bitter, sullen young woman. She has been eaten up by all sorts of insecurities buried so deep that even she has forgotten them over the years. Yet, in some way she still blames her mother. For Leigh (a beautiful woman IMHO) to allow herself to be shot in this way - pale face, lank hair, bad skin, chain-smoking - is testament to her commitment to the project. i.e. TOTAL. Strathairn is excellent as the evil husband - a truly unsavoury part. Plummer too, is good as the dogged, not-to-be-denied detective. As is Parfitt as the bitchy - yet ultimately generous - Vera.The only gripe I have with the whole movie is the ending. The inquest seems tacked on, too short and not at all believable. And the last scene as Selena departs on the ferry is an anti-climax of the highest order.Other than that - well worth a watch....7/10.

Given that Dolores was found standing over her alleged victim with a rolling pin raised above her head, the future looks bleak for her.Based on one of Stephen King's least typical novels, Dolores Claiborne is a leisurely paced study of the self-deceptions practiced by the mind in order to survive an unmentionable childhood trauma, and of how such self-delusion can push away well-meaning loved ones. In its way it's every bit a horror story as King's more typical output. Only this is the quiet horror of within, the type that can visit even the most ordinary of people.Bates is entirely believable as the no-nonsense mother who has become something of an outcast in her small Maine home-town since her alcoholic husband died after falling down a concealed well in their garden. Christopher Plummer's tenacious detective was convinced of her guilt, but she proved to be the only case out of 86 that slipped through his fingers. Now, more than fifteen years later, his determination to put right what he believes to be a mis-justice blinds him to his own impartiality. Plummer's performance is equal to Bates', and it's interesting how the story essentially paints those who have killed in a better light than those who seek to make them pay. Jennifer Jason Leigh is Dolores' daughter, a highly-strung neurotic, dependent on pills and alcohol to get her through. Her performance is OK, but the character itself is slightly too annoying &#x96; even though her mental fragility is entirely understandable.Taylor Hackford is the director. He's not generally recognised as one of Hollywood's better directors, but he had a couple of sizable hits in the 1980s and 90s. He does a good job here, keeping a talky film visually stimulating, and emphasising the link between the present and the past by seamlessly introducing brightly coloured flashbacks that emphasise the relative innocence of both Dolores and her daughter when compared to the relentlessly grey palette of the present.

Bates is truly incredible, with one of the richest, most multi-faceted performances you will ever see. How her face reacts to pain, displays dawning knowledge, hardens into crackling Maine sarcasm is a revelation.Hackford is a truly great director Officer + a Gentleman is one of the best films ever made, + this has the same elements- perfect casting (except for Plummer, who with his British accent never rang true for rural Maine), magnificent location scenery, roundly superb performances, and a gripping story about real people with real problems. His use of flashbacks, morphing from the dreary cloudy black + white to the sunny color of yesteryear is masterful + moving. Like To Kill a Mockingbird, flashbacks emotionally suck the viewer into the movie, and he does them well characters are snapped back into previous versions of a scene, even walking around and watching their earlier self. The effect is magical + wonderous, heightened as step by step he strips back the layers of time + mist that cover the truth.An underlying theme is one of class divisions and the hard plight of Maine's poor working class. Dolores's fortitude, will + patience are awe-inspiring, but to her there is no choice. Jennifer Leigh is excellent as the neurotic pill-popping writer daughter- I've known women just like her (who had suffered the same abuse).

Stand by Me, The Shawshank Redemption, and now Dolores Claiborne are great films that have gone mostly ignored.  There is no better advertising platform than the Academy Awards, and no doubt these three movies have all done dismally in the box office.But thats beside the point.  Kathy Bates, who I'm beginning to like a lot, did win an Academy Award for a King portrayal in Misery and gives a solid performance here.She is a tough-as-nails woman who has crafted some sort of image as the town she-devil as she was once accused of having murdered her husband.  It doesn't help much that she has spent most of her life working in solitude with a decaying old rich woman, far away from a daughter who hasn't visited in fifteen years.Although Dolores' comedic ability is overdone a bit in the beginning, we are taken through a series of flashbacks that reveal the terrible events that have brought her here to where she is now once again the prime suspect in the murder of someone who is in the position to provide great life insurance benefits.I thought the handling of the script was ingenious.  The characters are presented to us, the situation established, and then the director proceeds to completely turn everything upside down as we dive beneath the surface and discover what really was  going on here.  One scene that stands out in particular was the one between Dolores and Vera, her strict employee, as they discuss methods to handling a deviant husband.  More than just a plot device, there is a reaction created between the two and you can see the bond that is growing there that will hold them together for those fifteen-plus years of solitary confinement.If there was any fault within the film, it has to lie with the incompleteness of Detective John Mackey.  He seems very driven to crush Dolores, but why?  There never was any inquiry by the flashbacks as to what was the history between the two, and there fore the character lacked a little something to make him believable.  He is the only cardboard character in the movie.Most of the so called chick-flicks are unbearable movies.  This one, however, is a classic.  Add it to your collection, next to Shawshank.9 of 10.

Most of the photography is somewhat stark, but that works well for the story and the location; the photography during the eclipse is quite stunning.I rarely give an 8; my rule for that is that it has to be something unique.

These family secrets are the subject of this film - and director Taylor Hackford handles it with skill and a blunt, straightforward manner. Christopher Plummer plays a lawyer out to get Dolores not just for the murder of Vera, but also suspects her of being involved in her husbands death decades earlier. Plummer is a bit over the top in his performance, and struggles with the New England accent, and Leigh at times seems stiff and not natural, seems to be reading her lines.

Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt) had most of the best lines in this powerful Mother and Daughter film, which had a cast list in single figures, and was mostly shot on one location, unlike Oscar winner Braveheart. Not a coming of age film, but a story of a mother (Dolores / KathyBates) and daughter (Selina / Jennifer Jason Leigh) who should have been so together, but were so far apart. (I see too much of this in life.) Flashbacks are becoming so common in films nowadays that I'm beginning to think they are compulsory. However, in this film,they are very relevant to the story line, and are done extremely well. A film that I wasn't expecting much from, turned out to be a very good film. The last ten minutes, when Leigh is at her best, beats many of the great court room dramas that I have seen lately. Many of the one liners are brilliant, but I just have the feeling that this should'a been a contender.

Instead this is really an excellent drama since it focuses strongly on human relationships with a fair bit of a thriller emphasis thrown in.The acting is simply faultless, with Kathy Bates in her best role, amply supported by all the other actors. Judy Parfitt is particularly good as Vera Donovan, the wealthy socialite and employer of Dolores Claiborn. Later on her failing health, her sad plight and her ever closer bonding and dependence on Dolores, provides the key to the whole film.What makes DC work so well is the empathy one develops towards the characters. Dolores, who at first appears as a well-weathered and hard headed, stormy individual, gradually reveals to us the circumstances that led her to behave the way she does. Vera, who at first appears to be a cold-hearted, fastidious snob, who treated her former housekeepers more like slaves, is eventually shown to have a warm heart, and genuinely cares very strongly about Dolores, her long term and last housekeeper. Dolores's daughter, Selena comes across as an uncaring, bitter and selfish girl, but as the story unfolds, again we learn why and understand. The cynical detective, John Mackey is intent on nailing Dolores for the death of Vera, having failed many years earlier to convict her for the suspicious death of her husband. Again, we can see why he has become so frustrated, cynical and bigoted, and that perhaps he got hold of the wrong end of the stick, regarding the death of Dolores's husband's, or did he? Only Dolores's abusive and drunken husband, convincingly played by David Straithhairn fails to arouse any sympathy.All in all, a wonderfully gripping drama with some heart rendering moments and urging you to discover the truth behind the deaths.

One does not need to be familiar with the plot. The film presents an easily-understood format, the characters are fully developed and all of the cast were stellar in their performances.Kathy Bates (Dolores) was her usual best in that role. I'm not sure why people make such a comparison to Misery (I'm unfamiliar with that movie), or feel Ms. Bates was looking for something better to star in. For me, Fried green Tomatoes certainly gave her a great venue, again providing her with a chance to use all of her talents. Claiborne did the same, and she made good use of its doleful story. Jennifer Leigh-Scott (?) was excellent as the repressed, abused daughter upon whom Dolores lavished such love. Judy Parffit was a wonderful, cynical ice-queen; to me, there wasn't enough filmage to show how she got from queen to nut. However, Dolores had to have some person to lavish her strong love upon without her daughter and an abusive husband.Christopher Plummer (Det. John Mackey) certain shouldn't have to again prove his acting ability in any role. He was fabulous, although cold, for which the role called-for. Jesus of Nazareth should have convinced any viewer he has star-power. I'm unfamiliar with David Strathairn (Joe St. George) - although I'm sure I've seen him in other roles - was perfect for that scoundrel. I'm not sure what role Eric Bogosian (Peter) played, but the entire movie was gripping and convincing. I agree the difference in present-day cinematography and full-color, the flash-back action was extremely effective.I also agree Ms. Bates was overlooked for Oscar considerations in this role. Perhaps the film's plot prevented it from being nominated for best picture. At any rate, this film will remain great entertainment for many years, as it's a tale of what happens in real life.I had never heard of Dolores Claiborne - but I have watched it several times in a week, so it's a winner with me. I gave it a 10 for its clear telling of a story that happens to many people. Character-development and a good story is all a movie needs.

The film concerns a woman, Selena (played by the underrated Jennifer Jason Leigh), who returns to her hometown island off the coast of Maine after her mother, Dolores (the brilliant Kathy Bates) is convicted of the murder of an eccentric woman she took care of for many many years. Selena, who suffered a rough childhood with her abusive alcoholic father, Joe (David Strathairn), isn't happy to be back, and she holds a grudge against her mother, suspecting it was Dolores who was also involved in the death of her father. While Selena stays at the dilapidated home which used to be hers as a child, confrontation and memories of both their troubled pasts cause the two to clash, and the horrible memories of what they suffered through years before come back to them, all amidst the murder investigation where Dolores is the prime suspect.Wow, this was one great movie. The acting here was the most powerful point in the film, Kathy Bates was perfect, she and Jennifer Jason Leigh had some great chemistry together. Both of their performances were as believable as one could be. The story to the movie is actually quite good, and the disturbing flashback sequences with Selena and Dolores that take up a huge part of the movie were very well done. While the murder investigation is taking place, the flashbacks are incorporated in to represent Selena and Dolores' past, and are intermingled very naturally. The pacing is good, not too quick but not too slow either. The direction by Hackford was great, the whole contrasting tones of the film (between the present time, which is very dark and grey), and the flashbacks which are much more bright. The color schemes were quite interesting. Christopher Plummer plays a detective investigating Dolores' case, and David Strathairn plays the abusive, drunken husband very well, making the audience really not like his character.Overall, Dolores Claiborne is an excellent adaptation to the novel by Stephen King. For some reason (to me at least), many of his novels don't translate well into film very well, but this one was perfect, keeping the viewer intrigued and interested the whole way through, topped with pitch perfect performances. A highly underrated psychological thriller/drama. 10/10.

Director Taylor Hackford, who's other accomplishments, An Officer and a Gentleman, Against All Odds, and most recently Ray, have established him as a Hollywood legend, creates a visually and emotionally stirring dark drama about evil, struggle and living a painful life with dignity.Hackford's ability to create a visual image, through his actors, the photography, the colors, settings, and locations, is, in my humble opinion, no more better showcased than in this film.If you are a fan of Steven King, Taylor Hackford, Bathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh or dark family dramas, this is a MUST SEE film.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the exceptional performance by Judy Parfitt.

I'm sure you already know this is a drama, not a horror movie. What is so wonderful about this movie is what's unspoken/unseen. So let me elaborate. It helps if you already saw this movie. And for the record, I haven't read the book.***** The Untold Stories *****Dolores is a very heartbreaking character who had to live with a mountain of sorrow on her shoulder, yet she never cried (except in one scene) and always an insult-cracking tough lady who can handle herself even in front of the big guys. She hadn't seen her daughter for 15 years. Why? Because she felt guilty, she felt responsible for her daughter's torment. She did what she had to in order to save her daughter, yet it's what she did on that faithful day that caused Selena to have a nervous breakdown, and had to send her away. For 15 years she lived with this guilt, so much that she couldn't even hop on a ferry to visit her daughter, who lived right across the water. She let her daughter blame her, never tried to explain what happened, because she already thought herself was guilty. That's the punishment she made for herself -- to possibly never see her only child ever again. That's the incredibly deep sorrow that she lived with, for 15 long years.Kathy Bates communicated that, not with dialogues nor gestures or even body languages, but simply with HER EYES.I've never seen so much sadness and sorrow in an actor's/actress' eyes. Her performance was unbelievable, 10x better than she was in Misery.And then there's Selena. For 15 years she blamed her mother, believed what everyone else was saying about her mother and what happened that day during the eclipse. She did it simply because it was the only way to erase the OTHER part of her childhood memory -- the one that of her father. At the end of the movie, when she said, I never want to lose you again, it was Selena realizing that the love of her mother was there all along on the island all this time. A love so much deeper than she ever remembered, yet for 15 years she thought it never existed. She denied it and erased it and rewritten the past for her own comfort and sanity. She did what she had to, at the expense of her mother.Those were the untold stories. While the flashbacks were filmed and edited beautifully and displayed fluidly as the story unfolded, you only get to see the present and what happened 15 years ago, you can only imagine what's in between those 15 years -- the eternal guilt of a mother, the (wrongful) grudge of a daughter, the loneliness of 2 aging women who are universally hated by everyone, who ultimately developed such a bond that they'll probably die for each other. If you haven't thought of them when you saw the movie the first time, see it again now with those untold stories in mind. Try to get into each character's shoes, you'll realize that there's a whole other movie in each and one of them for their lives during those 15 years. You'll see how much deeper the chracters are, how much more fanastic the performances are, and how faithfully the picture translated all that history of sadness and unfolded it into a heartbreaking story of a broken family. The movie did a very good job of hinting at those passing years and let you use your imagination. Though I think it's a frequently overlooked aspect of the film because of how emotionally over-the-top the movie already is.***** The Flashback sequences *****The flashbacks were not simply plot devices and cinematic icing, it's crucial to the storytelling. Neither Dolores nor Selena had set foot in the old house for 15 years, and for those 15 years they did everything they could to lock up their painful past and forget it ever existed. We see the flashbacks as soon as they walked in the house, much like how they began to be reminded about the past as soon as they arrived. They were literally haunted by the past, for the first time in 15 years. So, naturally, it came in pieces. We see the past as how they would see it -- fragmented, disorienting, vivid, and inconclusive. It was the best use of flashbacks as a method of storytelling in a film, until Memento came along.***** The Screenplay *****The screenplay is superb, the emotions ran deep and complex, the characters were very realistic (despite the extreme circumstances surrounding them), the way the flashbacks melted with the present was, at the time, truly original and integral to the story.The movie also addressed many social issues in those days how women were treated, class division, the helplessness of a mother against a abusive father. It's a rather novel achievement considering how drama-filled the movie already is.***** The Performances *****Kathy Bates was undeniably extraordinary in this picture. It still bugs me that she won an Oscar for Misery but wasn't even nominated for this.On the surface, Jennifer Jason Leigh played a rather typical role for her, but it's a role that had a lot more deep background and emotions. She lacked the depth in the beginning of the movie I think, but by the very end of the movie she exploded into this multi-layered performance that Kathy Bates was carrying throughout the entire movie.They both showed incredible restraints in their performances, more the reason why their emotions screamed out of the picture, even though they barely showed on their faces or in their dialogues.***** Conclusion *****This movie, ultimately, is an extreme dramatization of how family members misunderstand or misread each other, yet nobody has the nerve to communicate and reconcile the situation, and continue to let it deteoriate to the point of unrecoverable, until the family falls apart.This is an incredibly human story that many can relate to, told with inventive storytelling. For anyone who grew up in a less-than-perfect family (especially if your family went through a messy divorce in your childhood and you happened to have blamed one of your parents for it, and later reconciled), this movie will ring VERY DEEP in your heart.-----P.S. I'd have to say that considering how multi-faceted the central characters (Dolores, Selena and Vera) were, the husband and the detective really feel like cardboard cut-out characters. That's unfortunate. Though it doesn't take much away from the film since they 3 women are such deep, rich characrers, especially if you put yourself in their shoes and imagine what their lives had been in those 15 years that the film didn't get a chance to show.

Many of his novels have hit the big screen and I have over a dozen of his books in my bookshelf. Dolores Claiborne was also made into a movie and when I saw it recently I was thrilled and wanted it for my DVD collection.I guess most of the audience was unsure if the protagonist Dolores Claiborne were guilty or not for quite a while, and so was her daughter Selena in the story. So there is the excitement on two levels, one can say. The strongest aspect of this movie is the female actors, especially Kathy Bates as the main character. She is very credible as the wounded, bitter - but strong Dolores, and this peculiar love/hate relationship between the snobby Vera and hard working Dolores is a great interplay between Bates and Judy Parfitt. One other great performance is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Selena - the nervous, stifled and pill eating daughter of Dolores.The screen version of this superb book has become an absolutely great movie. Kathy Bates is at her best. She has earlier said that King's novels made her a superstar and she proves it here; she shines! And with the presentation of the beautiful environments of Maine, which is almost a standard in King's novels, I was really pleased with the outcome.Something to put my finger on? Unfortunately, yes. Leigh's character became too indistinct at times, it's difficult to figure out if that was the purpose.

I can understand why men get somewhat agitated when watching Dolores as in this story they are definitely the villains. At their best, they are just guilty of adultery, but at their worst, they are violent child molesters. In fact, you almost get the impression that John C.

But if you can get over what is arguably some blatant guy-bashing, you'll find yourself enjoying this film. It is wonderfully written, brilliantly acted, and you will not be able to keep yourself from cheering Dolores on, as she watches her husband fall down that pit.You can look at this film in two ways-- as a blatant misandry or as a drama about one woman who will do anything to protect her child.

That sense of colour, during the murder sequence, was the work of an art director who has seen an eclipse and registered its exact look, and recreated it precisely for this movie., with a perfect sense of colour.What has been praised as the symbolic was, in fact, a brilliant approximation of a visual reality rarely seen.My other observation, much more modest, is how people tend to absorb the speech patterns, and witticisms, of those most important in one's life. Notice Vera saying Dolores has a hair across her ass -- guess whose repertoire that expression came from. Then, notice how many of Dolores's big statements are essentially paraphrases of Vera's grand bon mots from the past, as we find out in flashbacks. (Sometimes all a woman has left is being a bitch...) A huge part of these women's unlikely friendship is a mutual intellectual fascination.

The fact that Stephen King wrote the original novel immediately sparked my interest. The synopsis also sounded intriguing and different from what we are used to seeing Stephen King do. From the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to this dreary and dark atmosphere in a cold island of Maine. The first few scenes are reminiscent of a classical film noir - where you have your typical opening murder scene that leads to an interrogation scene in a police department's office. That's just what you have in the beginning of Dolores Claiborne and it was indeed the perfect way to start off such an amazing movie like this one. We are introduced to a mystery that only paves way for other mysteries in the plot. The setting of the movie goes perfect with the story. We go back and forth with very colorful scenes of the past and very dark scenes of the present. As a viewer you almost become scared of finding out what really happened. Is Dolores a murderer or no? and also, What other secrets can she be holding? Kathy Bates gives an amazing performance and throughout the movie you realize only she was able to pull of the role of a strong, long suffering woman. I was BLOWN AWAY by Judit Pafitt's performance of the demanding boss. We begin to see her as a strong self-assured lady, and back and forth through the flashback scenes we can see how vulnerable she really is. Her chemistry with Bates is truly unforgettable. The only slight problem I had with the movie is Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance, which gradually gets better throughout the movie but is definitely not up to par with the rest of the cast in the first half. In the last half of the movie, we become more sympathetic with her character and at the same time we can detect that she understands her character better.Overall, a 9 out of 10 for this amazing movie of secrets, redemption, but most of all the many layers of a woman.

Some of the motivation needed to drive a few of the minor characters is lacking, but that too can be forgiven when seen in the light of the total story.In all, the story keeps you interested and deserves repeated viewings.

The supporting roles too are in the capable hands of actors like CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER (as a detective who is convinced of Claiborne's guilt) and David STRATHAIRN as Joe St. George, Bates' abusive alcoholic husband.Just as Grace Metalious' PEYTON PLACE was transferred to the screen from a rather trashy novel and improved considerably by a more tastefully written screenplay, this Stephen King story benefits from the expansion of character and development as a psychological tale of an abused wife and daughter.KATHY BATES gives one of her most heartfelt performances as the victimized woman suspected of murder.

When she is explaining to Dolores how husbands die every day after she finds out about Dolores' home life, it is heartbreaking and almost terrifying how convicted she is about the subject.

Thefilm then takes two courses a modern day mystery, as Dolores'relationship with her employer reveals the death not to be cut anddried; and what really happened on the day of the eclipse eighteenyears ago when Dolores' husband fell down an abandoned well.A basic plot summary cannot do justice to such an outstandingfilm.

David Strathairn isone of the most evil characters of all time, becoming a domesticnightmare, but not in the TV movie sense. His first initial act ofviolence with Bates is both disgusting and shocking. John C.Reilly is also good in an early role as a constable.Placed in Maine, and filmed in Nova Scotia, the location isabsolute perfection. This is the cold ruddy setting of all of King'snovels, and the best east coast small town since NeedfulThings.

Kathy Bates as Dolores ably faces down the whispering town, yet remains helpless in the face of the past, manifested in her estranged daughter. Jennifer Jason Lee is as great as ever as the bruised, vulnerable, passive-aggressive daughter; while Christopher Plummer extracts subtle pathos out of a fundamentally unsympathetic role.Judy Parfitt is simultaneously demonic and regal, while David Strathairn demonstrates artistic bravery in convincingly playing a man with no virtues further than his own mortality.I would stick my neck out and say that this is the best Stephen King adaptation. The Shining is overblown, slightly dull and not the least bit scary; The Shawshank Redemption and (particularly) The Green Mile are too twee. Misery and Carrie are great tense shockers, but seen once, some of the attraction fades slightly.

They tried to go in at a good angle, I'll give them that, but to turn something good into something as putrid as the movie, well it should be against the law! The ONLY reason to watch this movie would be to witness Kathy Bates, she is, as always GREAT! If you don't like Kathy Bates then, not only should you get your head examined, you should read the book.

All I know is, without a PennyWise the Dancing Clown or Andre Linoge present, this is kind of a lackluster movie, which was too bad, considering the talented cast and sort of interesting looking commericals(with the lovely music ripped off from Ordinary People). While not my favorite actors, Kathy Bates, David Straitharn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Christopher Plummer are all considered talented in my book and they all play their parts well.Maybe I just didn't like the characters, or something. Dolores is sort of interesting as a poor maid who is accused of murdering an old woman and is a probable suspect, since she is also accused of killing her husband. It all spins into a web of flashbacks and present, concentrating mostly on Dolores's relationship with her husband(who is oh-so-creativly abusive) and her troubled daughter(who grew from a beyond annoying child to a so-so adult). While it makes for an interesting character study, there are lots of plot holes and confusions and some parts were, well, quite dull. I survived my viewing, though. So that's nice, at least.

I haven't read the original source material, but judging by this film it is safe to say that it wasn't meant to be horror-per say, as the film follows more of a psychological thriller pattern when it comes to plotting; despite some blatant horror influences. The style of plotting is relatively exciting, and it shows both the current events, which it then intertwines with flashbacks of the past. This sort of film can easily get muddled, but you have to give credit to Dolores Claiborne as it successfully manages to keep itself on the straight and narrow with regards to plotting. The film follows the story of a housekeeper who has allegedly murdered her employer by throwing her down the stairs. The plot thickens when her daughter, who still blames her mother for the mysterious death of her father, comes to town to see what's going on with her parent.Kathy Bates, who impressed in the 1990 Stephen King adaptation of 'Misery', overacts here, it has to be said, but in spite of that she still brings believability and a relative degree of sympathy to her character, and it's very easy to see why director Taylor Hackford would have cast her in the title role. She is joined on screen by a woman who is one of today's most underrated performers; Jennifer Jason Leigh. Leigh impresses throughout the film and although her character is definitely second to Bates' in the film's hierarchy, Leigh still delivers the best performance in the movie. While the film is always good enough to be called interesting, it is overlong and had the action have been compacted, the resulting movie would have been far more thrilling and as it is a thrillers' main aim to be thrilling; shortening the movie down would definitely have been a good idea. While this movie isn't exactly a fine example of the genre, it's a solid thriller and if you find yourself with nothing better to do one night while this film is on television; you could do a lot worse than watch it.

Never liked any of her movies at all. Not just because she is unattractive, but just because she just sounds dumb altogether. I don't think she is acting at all. She is mostly being herself.Not trying to be an arse, but just can't stand her, and she just looks evil on every single movie she is in. It is like she does not care about anything at all. Now that I said how I feel about Kathy Bates. The movie is one long boring movie that just takes forever to get somewhere that gets no where at all.These kind of movies are for the bored that want to stay bored. Nothing pulled me in this movie at all. Want to watch a movie to actually lose concentration on, this is it. Jennifer Jason Leigh is not attractive to me either, but is better looking than Bates. I was disgusted watching Single White Female with Jennifer.She took showers, but she still looked as if she was right off the streets she lived for many years. She had mold on her feet. Single White Female was way better than this crap.

And with Jennifer Jason Leigh playing an alcoholic, you can certainly not accuse the director of casting against type. As always in King's tales, the plotting is efficient but mechanical, with each character playing a clearly defined role in the story. But strong performances from the two leads add a dose of depth and humanity not often present in such adaptations. In the end, the final solution is just a little too neat, but the film deserves credit for making the most of its starting material.

Basically Dolores Claiborne (Kathy Bates) is the woman working in remote Maine as a maid for the rich, elderly and paralysed Vera Donovan (Judy Parfitt), and she is caught after possibly pushing her down the stairs and ready to finish her off with a rolling pin. The old woman dies and she arrested for her suspected murder, and her daughter Selena St. George (Single White Female's Jennifer Jason Leigh), now a big-shot reporter, has returned from New York to support her. Dolores insists she did not kill Vera, but the entire town believe twenty year ago she murdered her husband Joe St. George (The Bourne Ultimatum's David Strathairn), so she has little sympathy, especially from Detective John Mackey (Christopher Plummer) who wants to put her away for life. Selena also believed the suspected murder of her father, and through flashbacks we see Dolores suffering abuse from the alcoholic Joe, as well as him stealing from Selena's family account, but worse was her suspicions that he molested his own daughter. There is an argument after the will from Vera claiming she left her a fortune is shown and Selena refuses to help her mother, and Dolores decides to finally reveal the truth. Through flashback we see Vera being mean giving Dolores too many housework and chores, but she softens when they bond through home troubles, and she decides enough is enough. The past reveals Young Selena (Ellen Muth) was sent away, and during a total solar eclipse Dolores gives Joe some whisky and she tells that she knows about his stealing and the molestation, and she makes him fall into the well to die at the bottom. In the end, after remembering a suppressed memory Selena confirms that she was indeed molested by her own father, and she confirms Dolores is innocent, Vera wanted to die, and the case is dropped. Also starring Eric Bogosian as Peter, John C. Reilly as Constable Frank Stamshaw, Bob Gunton as Mr. Pease and Roy Cooper as Magistrate. Bates, who won the Oscar for Stephen Kind based Misery five years before is great, even with the dotty possibly Canadian accent, and Leigh is also really good as her daughter who is not sure what to believe for a while, it is a film with some eye-catching moments and an engaging story, a most watchable mystery drama. Very good!

Unfortunately, this King-derived plot verges on the ridiculous, concerning ornery woman in a tiny Maine community who was once involved in the death of her abusive husband and is now the suspect in the death of the rich old dowager she cares for. Stuffed full of sub-plots, the picture almost drowns in melodrama. Bates gives a colorful, involving, multi-layered performance, however, and has some well-written, big show-off scenes to sink her chops into; Jennifer Jason Leigh has far less to work with as Bates' estranged daughter, but Hackford does a good job at slipping in and out of the present, and although the story is overwrought, his fluid work commands attention. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"A bloated Lifetime movie conceived under a full moon and best viewed during menstrual cycles","Date":"2 November 2008","Score":"7 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" In other words, extremely overwrought melodrama with wronged women who act like they desperately need to get some action.Honestly, it's one of those movies where everyone screams their dialogue, no matter how banal it isWhere's the damn Sweet & Low?It's going to rain today and tomorrow!!!There's no MORE Tide!!!!! But this being based on Stephen King novel, who's not known for his subtlety, the overly-wordy dialogue makes this turgid melodrama almost unbearable. No one and I mean no one talks like the way these characters talk.The highlight of the film is the eclipse scene, which makes me laugh nonstop. The whole moment is so artificial. Seeing Kathy Bates jump over the abandoned well is too much. Watch out Indiana Jones, here comes Dolores to take your place.In fact, the entire film feels artificial and forced. Director Taylor HACKford wouldn't know how to create realism if his life depended on it. To make things even more cringe-worthy, the music apes every dramatic moment as if the overacting and the overwrought dialogue weren't enough to clue us in over what's going on.As a work of dramatic fiction, DOLORES CLAIBORNE rates a tiny 2 stars but as a It's so bad it's good film, well, it is good for a constant stream of giggles and will be viewed in the future as pure camp, like THE BAD SEED or MOMMIE DEAREST.

Surprisingly, a pretty awful movie. About the only redeeming thing about this movie was the acting. Other than that, it was quite unbelievable. I guess if you are an alcoholic in a small town that automatically makes you a psychotic. If only we could all be prim and proper country folk - in Stephen King's bourgeoise paradise. Dolores Claiborne (played by the usually excellent Kathy Bates) is a woman who was the prime suspect in the death of her alcoholic husband (Straitharn). Now, she is the prime suspect in the murder of her employer - a wealthy widow. So, what horrible thing happens to Dolores Claiborne. The authorities allow her loose in the community. Along comes her daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh). After being away for many years from the small Maine community, she is a reporter. Somehow that makes her qualified to be a defense lawyer. In a ridiculous, improbable ending, she defends her Mom successfully, somehow bypassing the need for a trial. This movie was hopelessly bad.

This film was unpleasant in other ways because topics in the movie dealt with trashy people, alcoholism, wife beating and included tons of profanity, child sex and more.....so be forewarned Leigh's role - playing a defense attorney and defending Bates - seemed very improbable.
