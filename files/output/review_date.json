[{"date":"27 July 1998","review":" As a paranoia thriller, this mostly works as far as it goes, but it really needed more depth to the plot to sustain a feature.

Well acted (again, especially by the teens) and affecting, though the family doesn't seem as screwed up as the one in Buffalo '66.  Those looking for a straightforward script that resolves everything logically will be disappointed. "},{"date":"29 July 1998","review":" This movie is one of the worst I have seen in a long time.  The want to be horror movie just is not scary and the incredibly lame dialogue leaves something to be desired.  I can sum this movie up in one word, pitiful.  It just wasn't scary.  The only saving grace was that Katie Holms is very hot, yet her lines are not good.  I give it 3 stars out of 10.  "},{"date":"30 July 1998","review":" This movie really was the epitome of terrible.  The only good thing about it is that it only lasted 1 1\/2 hours.  Truly horrible.  I'm ashamed for these actors and actresses, because if this doesn't scar them for life...  "},{"date":"31 July 1998","review":" This is another Zucker film in the grand style of AIRPLANE. The story is generally fast-paced. The jokes just keep coming -- and most of  them work. Plus, we get the most passionate screen kiss between men since  IN & OUT. What more could you want?

But I think that they made a good choice on putting Katie Holmes in the movie I hope she gets into more movies and more better horror films! The movie was still good for me even if some people say it was dumb! At least it had a point to it!  "},{"date":"2 August 1998","review":" Everyone seems to think that this movie didn't have a good plot or story line but I think that it is irrelevant. The movie did it's job it was a thrilling movie with some funny dialogue. It also had some bonuses which were the fine actors. I especially enjoyed the performance of the actor who played Chug Roman. In my mind it is worth it to see the movie for his performance alone. I recommend this movie to anyone who still goes to the movies for fun and not to analyze movies that were never really intended to be analyzed. I loved it and everyone else did too the are just too silly to admit it.  "},{"date":"3 August 1998","review":" David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. Like his previous efforts which include Airplane!, Top Secret!, and  Naked Gun, the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take Mafia!, please), this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes, sports announcers, and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries. By the way, stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker has achieved, in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports, a home dunk. "},{"date":"4 August 1998","review":"  Just saw the movie BASEketball last night and my first thought was what  were they thinking?. When I say they I mean Bob Costas, Al Michaels, Tim McCarver, Robert Stack, Reggie  Jackson, et al. Did they get to see a script before they signed on to this  poor excuse for a movie starring two goofballs that couldn't act their way  out of a wet paper bag. It seems to me that the only reason they would do it is so they could swear on the big screen. Trey Parker and Matt Stone may  have some talents but acting cetainly isn't one of them. They should  stick to their show South Park which I find hilarious. They have practically no screen presence. All in all the movie, although it does provide a few laughs, is a total waste of time.  It looks like it was made by total amatuers from the cheesy sets to the skimpy plot. And to think  Premiere magazine picked this as a 100 million dollar summer blockbuster.  What were they thinking?          "},{"date":"5 August 1998","review":"  Could there be a more unfunny comedy this year?  Oh yeah, Blues Brothers  2000.  Okay, well this one comes close.  Comedies this year are just not  doing so well, and this one just adds to the list.  The box office receipts  prove it.  I got so extremely bored with this movie that I was hoping to  see more of Jenny McCarthy, who was the funniest thing about the film.   McCarthy played the character very seriously, and that is the key to  laughter in these types of films.  Leslie Nielson was a genius because he  played everything straight-forwardly.  It's like he just wasn't in on the  joke, such as when a woman asks him if this is some kind of bust... he  replies, Well, it's very impressive, yes.  That's funny.  BASEketball is  not.  I just hope there aren't any of these films coming out for a while.   Please, see Mafia!  It is so much funnier than this boring film.  "},{"date":"6 August 1998","review":"  I don't care if many (ok, most) of the jokes were raunchy and politically  incorrect, this movie was laugh-out-loud hysterical.  Parker and Stone  prove to be as efficient an on-screen duo as they are a writing team, even  going so far as to crack a joke (more or less an insult) against  themselves.  They were great in their roles because they are two genuinely  likeable guys, even if their characters are immature and a little on the  rude side.  This is a very funny movie for anyone who can handle a little  good-natured grossing-out. "},{"date":"7 August 1998","review":"  Can't Hardly Wait is the worst movie of the year for myself.  Even I, a teen , didn't find one single joke funny.  And after about 2 minutes, you'll say  to yourself I can't hardly wait to get out of here. "},{"date":"8 August 1998","review":"  Although it sometimes seems that Hollywood is catering to the lowest common  denominator of everything, The Truman Show is proof that there are great  ideas that are able to be turned into great movies.  Jim Carrey plays an  excellent role as a man with whom you can emphasize as well as be  entertained by.  The film's surrealistic nature is frightening when the  viewer realizes the legal feasibility in today's society, and it offers a  great message about who or what we assume God to be and how He (he?) would  react to our personal drives for discovery to challenge a world we treat as  an aquarium.  Some things to note and ponder The way the real-life viewers  ignore the real lives of their compatriots and customers while focusing on  a false life on screen; whose life is more real and whose is worth living?   Also, note that Christof does not have his name listed among the real world  in the credits, but in Christof's World.  His high-profile media-driven life  is no different from Truman's!

The one final secret, the one  final I've been meaning to tell you, the one final hug, laugh, cry, and  that one final good-bye--they're all here. Although it may seem to be a  teen movie it reaches anyone who can remember the high school days. Each  character is portrayed brilliantly and everyone can relate to someone. You  really get to know the character, their motivation, what they're about, and  their weaknesses. So go see it with a friend--one that you'll be graduating  with (if you already haven't). You'll look back on the years of high school  and think that they've gone by way too quickly--so do all the stuff you've  been putting off now, before it's too late.

More acting work should definitely be in their  collective future. "},{"date":"11 August 1998","review":"  This movie was great. It's not blockbuster, but it wasn't made to be. It was  something geared towards teenagers, so older folks beware. I would not go  see it if you're out of your twenties. It was funny, it was sweet and that's  about it. The two best performances were given by Ethan Embry and Seth  Green. Ethan was male lead, Preston who convincingly yearned for Jennifer  Love Hewitt's character, Amanda. Ethan pulled his role off wonderfully. The  second awesome performance was given by Seth Green who was the local  gangsta-wannabe Kenny. This one had me rolling on the floor laughing  because sadly, most of the guys i know are just like him. So, if you just  want something to entertain, make you laugh, and not think to hard, I'd go  see this movie. "},{"date":"12 August 1998","review":"  Geez, after reading all the thumbs-down reviews, I feel almost embarrassed.   I _liked_ Wishmaster.  No, the idea of wishes-gone-awry isn't particularly  original, but there are still some interesting elements done with it  a  guard says he'd like to see the Djinn go through him and...it does (heh).   Tammy Lauren is adequate as the spunky heroine, and Andrew Divoff (mostly  consigned to minor B-villain roles - check him out in the Highlander TV  series) makes a chilling threat.  Jenny O'Hara makes the most of her role  as resident supernatural expert.  Yes, the gore is excessive, but I'm not  sure if that's a concession to the 90's audience, or a directorial conceit  - I'm willing to assume its the former.  For a supernatural thriller\/horror  (as opposed to a Scream-type slasher\/thriller), Wishmaster strikes me as one  of the better efforts to come along since the last Nightmare and the first  Candyman. "},{"date":"13 August 1998","review":"  OK, think me strange, but this is my favorite type of comedy.  The whole point of a Comedy is to Entertain, and this movie goes above and beyond the call of duty to do just that.  This isn't a movie for the weak of stomach, no, but that's half of the fun.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone do much better jobs than I could have imagined, and David Zucker proves again that he is one of the great comedy Directors. "},{"date":"14 August 1998","review":"  I think the script-writer and directors must be absolute morons. There are  so many parts they should have cut out, cause it makes the movie look like  a parity on horror movies. The only thing they were missing to make it a  true spoof was Lesly Nelson.  It is fun to watch, not very scary but damn  funny.  Try not to analyze this movie or you will end up crying For the  Love of God. Shut off the movie and unlock the theatre doors.  Not much of  the movie is Scary, but there are a few good parts in the movie that really  get you going.  The movie is so short those few parts seem to last forever  ) "},{"date":"15 August 1998","review":"  LOLA RENNT is simply one of the best german films ever made. It's innovative , funny and clever. Like in his last movie WINTERSCHLÄFER director Tom Tykwer reinvents the german cinema with superb and intelligent dialogues. The whole movie is like a videoclip. Fast, colourful and very entertaining. Lola's friend Manni is a thief and a money-courier for a car pusher. But this time everthing goes wrong. Manni leaves the money in a subway and now Lola has twenty minutes to bring him 100.000 DM. This movies has everything a movie should have A brilliant camera with astonishing ideas. The story has lots of turns and twists and even the humour is fabulous. The soundtrack (mostly TECHNO with the actors singing) fits perfectly! I loved this movie and I think that everyone should watch it! A 10 is not too much for this little jewel. This film expresses the feeling of this generation and I think nobody can demand more from a movie...  "},{"date":"16 August 1998","review":"  There is real scheme to put this movie in, it's a bit of a road movie, much  of a video clip, bit of animation, much of Bonny and Clyde, bit of  Groundhog Day, much of excellent actors. All sounds very weird, but is  really worth watching it.  Best movie I saw last 3 years. "},{"date":"17 August 1998","review":"  'Lola rennt' by Tom Twyker is the final step for German film-making towards a professionality and technical perfection that used to be Hollywood's alone.80 mins. of brilliantly shot action will keep the viewer enthralled with the love story of Manni and Lola who have to fight against time 20 mins. to be exact. It is 11.40 a.m. and Manni who is into smuggling diamonds across Eastern European borders has to turn over 100.000 DM at 12 o'clock sharp to Ronni, a 'gangster' par excellence, who would kill anyone for stealing a bottle of beer from him.Unfortunately, Manni forgot the money in the tram and is now more desperate than ever. He calls the one person who has always taken care of him the love of his life, Lola. She asks Manni to wait for her as he is going to rob the 100.000 DM from one the shops in town as he knows that turning up at Ronni's without the money would be his immediate death. Lola starts running immediately thinking of a million different ways how to help the man who is the most important person in her life and she runs and runs.....The quality of cuts and camera shots, innovative techniques at the top of modern filming practically unknown to German viewers up to now will hopefully make 'Lola rennt' a blockbuster in the cinemas as it fully deserves it.Like 'Der Himmel über Berlin' (City of Angels', Ryan, Cage') and 'Bandits' this film is surely to be copied by Hollywood. A symbol of the emerging new strength and innovative qualities of German film-making. You HAVE to see it )) The world-premier screening on 15th August, Cologne, Germany at the chocolate-museum Open-Air-Cinema had a 1,000-strong audience screaming and laughing, breaking into applause on several scenes as the story unfolded. The director and the actors and actresses were present and will have been delighted by the spontaneous reactions of the audience proving this film to be one modern masterpiece of film-making.

Awesome movie!  "},{"date":"19 August 1998","review":"  After all the attention the movie got, and with the strong cast, I expected a great movie.

It was very entertaining, funny, and the truth that there probably are people like this walking around our high schools made it great. People had high hopes and THEY were crushed but I LOVED IT.

I feel this movie will lose a lot in the translation to the small screen.PARENTS  Nudity, one sex scene, some violence.  Remember, many people died aboard Titanic, and the vivid images of frozen people floating in the ocean may be enough to give smaller kids nightmares.  After much consideration, I did take my 10-year-old daugher to see this and do not regret it.  The much -ballyhooed nude scene is actually quite beautiful and sensitive. Truthfully, it's my favorite part of the film and just thinking about it can bring tears to my eyes.Why so beloved?  Some are touched deeply by the tragic true events, some by the fictional love story.  In a good theater, the movie makes you feel as if you are right there  I found myself moving my arms as if to swim and shivering with cold while sitting in my seat.  There are some beautiful seagues between Titanic past at full steam and Titanic present at the bottom of the ocean.  It's true, there are some legitimate criticisms of the rather lame, anachronistic dialogue, but, as a whole, this movie still rates very high.  "},{"date":"30 August 1998","review":"  This film was made soley for laughs, but fails dismally.  Maybe one Zucker just can't do what two can do.  Airplane! is one of my all time favourites, and I've seen every episode of South Park (despite not having a TV), so it isn't an issue of style.  It just wasn't funny.  There are a couple of guffaws, and Trey Parker appears to have some latent talent, but it tries too hard and usually misses the mark.  The best moments may have been the unexpected cameos by Mr. Garri-san and Cartman, but there wasn't enough good stuff to even be worth the two bucks I paid for it.  "},{"date":"31 August 1998","review":"  There are two types of people in this world - those who have seen The X-Files on TV and those who haven't.  This is, however, completely irrelevant in relation to the film, as either way you're quite likely to be fairly disappointed.For those who fall into the latter category and need some background, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are FBI agents, assigned to investigate (but apparently never solve) paranormal cases, classified as the X-Files.  Mulder, nicknamed Spooky by his colleagues, is a firm believer in all things weird and is convinced that The Truth is Out There ever since he watched his sister being abducted by aliens in his childhood. Scully, a qualified doctor and a firm believer that all things weird have a rational scientific explanation, was assigned to the X-Files to debunk Mulder's paranormal explanations (most of which revolve around some sort of government conspiracy or other) but has been swayed by her experiences with Mulder that perhaps something unexplained really is going on.Anyways, for filmgoers who didn't know the above, after about half-an-hour or so through the film they're brought up to speed with some standard contrived let's tell everyone what's going on type scenes (including the old get-drunk-and-tell-the-barman classic). After which things don't really improve.There's a distinct aura of deja vu around the rest of the film, especially since it breaks very little (if any) new ground. Any seasoned sci-fi addict will instantly recognise the origins of most of the material (spot the references to The Abyss, Aliens, Species, The Thing and perhaps even Total Recall - it's not hard) which has appeared to have been cheerfully ripped off.For those who know and love The X-Files already, it's fairly standard recipe with double the dough so it spreads over two hours instead of one, some large dollops of unpleasant gory detail, sprinklings of bad language and a larger budget all added to the mixture to give it a 15 certificate and that big screen flavour.  But what leaves the sour taste in the mouth is that it's the fans that are being had.  It had so little big screen impact that watching the film just gave me the impression I was sitting too close to my own television.Duchovny and Anderson put in a reasonably decent but rather plodding performance with a good supporting cast - but then so they should, they've been doing little else for nigh on five years.  Acting in The X-Files must be like putting on an old pair of slippers.My advice is wait 'till it gets to video and watch it then.  Scaled down to the small screen, you'd be hard pushed to notice the difference from the regular TV series and less annoyed by the lack of decent cinematography and small-town scenery handling.Three out of ten - and that's mostly for the special effects. "},{"date":"1 September 1998","review":"  Hmmm... Two hours and nothing really happens. Sure the duo uncover a Government  conspiracy, go to a few nice locations, and come close to the truth. But as Mulder said How many times have we been here before Scully?. The film is entertaining but it treads no new ground, and ignores a lot of the threads that have built up over five years of TV series. It should have been made into a three hour epic, one that concluded all the plot threads from the TV show and be done with the franchise. Instead it was made as a two hour teaser for the next series. "},{"date":"2 September 1998","review":"  The Film Wild Things is an awesome movie in that PLOT DOES MATTER Even in Singapore where everything is cut to shreds it is a great plot twister and guilty pleasure. The acting is average and the settings are gorgeous. For sure a movie to watch a second Time to catch all of the hidden tricks.

See any movie from the 40's or 50's, and you'll see how much they're all influenced by  Kane.

"},{"date":"8 September 1998","review":"  What can be said for a movie that throws cliche'd, often vacuous caricatures into a film (I use the term loosely), fuses the edges with quasi-hip dialogue, and then passes the final product off as entertainment? What disturbs me the most is that people actually buy into this, and empty, hollow films like this one are being pressed off the Hollywood assembly line every year. I'm reminded of the great teen sagas of 70's (American Grafitti, Cooley High) and the mid-80's Hughes fare (you know them by heart ;-)). Those movies worked because of their earnest, honest, and often satirical edge; the characters were genuine, and sexuality wasn't given a paedophile's eye view. No amount of toilet humor, pop music, or cleavage-thrusting can take away from sharp characters, sharp dialogue, and sharp direction, none of which are to be found in Can't Hardly Wait. If this is the direction that teen-oriented filmmaking is headed, please lead me astray.

The two main leads, Brendan Gleeson and Peter McDonald, are both new to starring roles (McDonald is in his first role in films) but it never shows in either performance. The whole cast works with extreme confidence and style and with the material, why not? There are more memorable scenes in I Went Down than in the average cinematic year. This is possibly one of the top films of all time. Unmissable.

You can bet we'll see a lot more movies starring Edward Furlong after this movie...his performance was really real. "},{"date":"13 September 1998","review":"  Brilliant film which can be both very funny and very disturbing (usually at the same time).  Apart from the protagonist, the film never lets you be totally sure who to trust. What the film is most successful at conveying is the all-too-easy disregard for human life.  People are killed on the spur of the moment, without any thought for their lives or their families. "},{"date":"14 September 1998","review":"  Lulu, as I prefer to call it, is a sentimental, yet mysterious movie. One  has to feel that this is Auster in a nutshell, covering humans dark sides  as well as their fabulous way of finding meaning.  Auster has done a good job when it comes to the actors and actresses, they  are perfect. The soundtrack is perhaps the factor that makes the darkness  of the movie even more conclusive. Whenever the CD is out, I have to buy it!  Overall, Auster did a pretty good job with Lulu. Recommended, also for non -Auster fans.  "},{"date":"15 September 1998","review":"  Don't be put off with reviews that knock Rounders for lack of plot or  suspense.

"},{"date":"16 September 1998","review":"  Well crafted, and entertaining. But why was it selected in  competition at the 55th Venice Film Festival? It's the classic Miramax feature, good for Saturday nights and cable TV,  balancing between independent appeal and mainstream big bucks structure. Malkovich's performance, however, is worth the ticket. As intelligent as he is, he realized he  could revitalize a career next to agonizing recycling himself as a wonderful supporting actor. Kudos. "},{"date":"17 September 1998","review":"  I think this has been put in the wrong genre in IMDB. It is more of a black comedy. Gun-toting nuns in Minis ?The first half of the film was really tedious, especially the scenes at the party. The second half started to get more interesting, if a bit bizarre. The title became obvious so early in the film that it was something of an anti-climax when he finally worked it out for himself.Don't waste your money on this film - there's bound to be something better on. "},{"date":"18 September 1998","review":"  Matt Damon stars in this likable story about poker. The story is engaging and refreshingly -- the film does not talk down to the viewer. There are many poker terms bandied about and time is not taken to explain each and every one -- something that you don't see often in the movies. The film is well-written and you are carried along with the action. Damon does an excellent job with a difficult part -- how do you act the part of someone whose best asset is that he doesn't react? Damon nails it. The supporting cast is tight -- standouts are Edward Norton, John Malkovich and John Turturro. The female characters are more weakly drawn and tend to be a bit one-dimensional, but the parts are handled ably by Gretchen Mol as the girlfriend and Famke Janssen as a rounder. Janssen does an especially nice job -- it would have been nice to see more of her character. Overall, I highly recommend this movie.

I did not see the depth in it, I saw some card games, just didn't click with me.- The Mad Prince of Denmark princeoden@aol.com "},{"date":"22 September 1998","review":"  Matt Damon plays another kid who is really good at something in another film written by first-time screen-writers (David Levien and Brian Koppelman) in John Dahl's  ROUNDERS.On one track, and one track only, this movie plays an adept hand When the action is focused on a decent card game, or the surrounding accoutrements of the rounder subculture, the often incisive writing and first-class acting (especially, by Damon, Norton, Malkovich, and Martin Landau as one of Damon's law professors) ROUNDERS hits its stride.  But, almost everything else surrounding -- and ostensibly, supporting -- this drama lacks luster, is cheap, clicheic, and ultimately one big bluff.Part of the reason ROUNDERS fails is that the conflict is weak.  The way that it is presented to us, the conflict is between Matt Damon having to choose between his law school career (and the girlfriend that goes with it, Gretchen Mol, just as dealt out of the game here as she was as DONNIE BRASCO's wife) and the cards.  But, the problem is that the screenwriters stacked the decks such that there is no real choice or conflict involved; the law school scenario is so thinly written that it's tedious.  All the characters associated with that world are forgettable, such that even Martin Landau cannot pull off a completely misplaced and tortured scene in the middle of act two in which he attempts to flesh himself out in a lengthy dialogue scene that was, at best, reminiscent of a similarly ill-placed soliloquy by a superfluous character in the middle of SCREAM 2.  "},{"date":"23 September 1998","review":"  John Dahl (of The Last Seduction and Red Rock West fame) delivers another flick about the seedier side of life in the new character study card-shark movie Rounders. Starring Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting and SPR) and Edward Norton (chilling supporting actor nominee for Primal Fear) with a superb supporting cast including John Turturro as Kinish, John Malkovich as KBG and Martin Landau as Professor Petrovsky, Rounders follows a card shark on the rounds from one poker game to the next in New York's underbelly back halls and clubs. Known as a great reader of people, Damon (Mike McDermott) has made his money for his law school education by using his skills at the poker table. His patient girlfriend (played convincingly by Gretchen Mol) has had enough of his late night\/all night rounds, so, to keep her, he hangs up his deck, gets a regular job and becomes a full time student. That is, until Worm (Norton) is released from prison and must pay back a loan made prior to his incarceration. He enlisted Mike's help and out of gratitude for Worm's keeping him out of jail, Mike helps his old friend and in the process estranges his girlfriend and his poker friends as well as Worm builds up more debts under Mike's good name while trying to score big to pay off the loan.At times chilling and always entertaining, Rounders delivers a full house of good acting and great story.  Norton and Damon make a good team and Malkovich (always superb) outdoes himself here while Landau could well earn a supporting actor nomination for two of this year's films - X-Files The Movie and Rounders.Rounders will make you think twice about ever sitting down at a poker table again. And with good reason. Catch this one now and see it again soon. There's a lot more here than meets the eye and it will be just as enjoyable, if not more, on the second go round as the first.

The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters  Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places.  Edward Furlong does well in the lead, but the best performances are by his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious cameo) and, of all people, Patty Hearst.  I think the reviewers are way off base on this one.

It's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch!  I haven't laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom.  I loved seeing old friends from the Dreamland  days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' camera.  The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton).

It should be Baltimere "},{"date":"29 September 1998","review":"  Ronin is a great action film that seems to want to be a character study and doesn't quite make it, but it remains a great action film nonetheless. De Niro plays a former American government agent who has been hired by an Irish woman named Dierdre (McElhone) to obtain, as part of a team of other shadowy folk, the film's McGuffin, a briefcase with an unknown valuable something in it, a la Pulp Fiction.  What follows is a number of rather amusing, but not very deep, dialogue scenes interspersed with some magnificent action sequences.  The longest car chase in the film (there are several) has to stand as one of the finest examples of this action-movie mainstay.  It is notable for its impressive technical proficiency, its high excitment level, and for the great joy that the director seems to have taken in making it; the number of destroyed automobiles left in its wake reach almost Blues Brothers-esque proportions.  There are a number of other impressive action scenes, all set in very scenic parts of France, and together they form the real core of the movie.  The De Niro character is given quite a bit of development time, but I at least never felt that I learned that much about his true motivations and feelings.  No matter; the visceral aspects of this movie are more than enough to make it well worth seeing.Overall Rating 8 (out of 10), or 3 1\/2 stars (out of 4) "},{"date":"30 September 1998","review":"  I had the opportunity to get into a press screening of this film and it kicked my ass!

But I'm also one of his biggest critics (Although as my buddy says Not liking in 'In The Mouth of Madness' does not make you a critic.

So maybe there will be changes between the August film and the final release, but for this version I must say that I liked it. It is about a bunch of vampire hunters going after what turns out to be the master vampire of all vampires. It is most definitely not the romanticized vampires that have been in vogue lately but are the gruesome, blood covered, tattered vampires that have more in common with the vampires of Near Dark. Like so many other John Carpenter films, this one combines a rebellious attitude with action and enough of a plot to carry a story. Though according to my best friend who saw it with me, the vampire hunters' motivation should have been displayed sooner. And I do agree with him, just not as much. The whole film is wrapped with a soundtrack by Carpenter himself which sounds really good; it's on my list to get once it comes out. I would definitely recommend seeing the film!

Christina Ricci is good, but her performance is wasted on a cliched, uninteresting plot and boring and unbelievable characters. It is dubious in that it is ridiculously absurd and inane while not at all funny. I can't remember a 90-minute movie ever seeming so long.

In comparing this to Serial Mom, Mr. Waters has gone back to his grittier side.  This is not nearly as polished.There is a dark side here.

This is truly his finest work. "},{"date":"6 October 1998","review":"  John Dahl's Rounders portrays (whether accurately or not is beyond me) very vividly the world of underground poker in the United State's upper east coast through a story not-so-typical of the archetypal hero.  Mike McDermott is a reformed gambler who turns in his chips for a degree in law, only to be forced back into the clutches of the game when he vouches for his best friend.  The parolee in turn leaves him high and dry with a $25,000 debt and a poker game with the KGB as his last resort.  It's a high stakes thriller combining a fancy poker glossary with some true professional history and a plot so thick that even Matt Damon's charm can't slice it.But I wish to comment on Dahl's portrayal of Levien and Koppleman's masterfully written script as an anti-hero-tale released in a time when happy endings and big budgets seem to gross more than good movie making does.  This unpredictable and yet very powerful plot manifests several identifiable depictions of anti-Hollywood inferences, all of which can be divided into `plot-determining' or simply `authentic.'  I'll focus on just one example of each, in an effort to keep this article brief (and under 1000 words!).`Authentic' refers to small, sometimes unnoticeable parts of the movie that, although they make no difference in the plot, disclose the attitude of the movie.  It's clearly not a Top Gun or Titanic by any means&#133;the good guys don't wear white hats, and he doesn't always get the girl.  Another poker movie of the decade was Maverick (Gibson, Foster), a western comedy about a card shark bound for the big game.  For Hollywood's sake, Maverick wins the final game with, what else, a Royal Flush, when he dramatically tosses the final Ace of Spades onto the chips&#133; after having played it blind of course. But Rounders depicts a much different final show down.  McDermott is at the table not because he needs to win his money, but because he's in a pissing contest with KGB (Malcovich).  He wins not on a royal flush, but by outplaying his opponent and knowing the game, and by winning the `staring contest' that proves to be so dramatic.  This authenticity provides a more credible plot, while at the same time produces a certain aura about the viewer; that this is not a Hollywood film, this is a film for rounders, who can respect (italics) that win, and can appreciate the depth of the game. It is this authenticity that unfortunately sometimes turns viewers away (my date was bored out of her mind because she just didn't get it, though she loved Maverick), but at the same time adds a dimension to the film that is unparalleled by any box office smash with tuxedos and gold chips.On a larger scale, the `plot determining' authentications truly make Rounders sit alone amidst few other movies of our time.  Like Good Will Hunting, the hero does not fit the mold precedented by Beowulf, or, in more modern vernacular, Star Wars.  Hunting doesn't go to college, or take the six figure salary, or clean up his act; he gets in his car, and leaves it all behind to go get the girl.  Granted, it is a crowd pleaser, but the scholarly likes of Sylvia Rousseve or Mike Mason would disagree with the depiction.  All the same, McDermott should (italic) cash in his chips, grab the girl, graduate, and head for the altar.  But, to the surprise of at least this viewer, he heads for Vegas in search of the World Series of Poker.  Looking back, one realizes `of course he does, that makes the most sense.'  But that is not the type of writing that Sister Mary Sunshine teaches in grade school, and unfortunately is often overlooked by public critics.  Writers, a tip keep it up.  Titanic gets boring, focus on the tragedies.  Will Hunting once said, `hey, whatever blows your hair back.'

It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated motions and emotions. Pecker becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved-ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art manager. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth--kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day--and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made the whole thing more profound and critical. It is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms...and everything else this country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu) "},{"date":"9 October 1998","review":"  The story is a simple one, well acted and produced. It is a touching script and deals with grief and loss and the images are striking.  Robin Williams a fine cast of strong characters well directed.  What Dreams May Come is beautiful to look at and uses colors inside music and painting technics to illustrate the emotions along with the emotions of the actors.   I noticed many in the audience wiping away tears, as did I. I wish it had offered more real world recovery from loss, but it offers a view of the afterlife rarely seen in films.  "},{"date":"10 October 1998","review":"  It is a good thing that I could not get tickets for the screening of Pecker at the Toronto Film Festival. I was embarrassed enough without John Waters even being present when I saw the film at my local theatre. There was nothing original about this film and all of the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting. His earlier films were not well written either but at least they dared to show us something new and had an certain honesty even in their campy style. Edward Furlong wins the award for the most wooden and dull title character of the year. Christina Ricci who was brilliant in Buffalo 66 walks through this picture wondering, as we are, why she ever agreed to do this film (something she should have asked herself before doing Billy Zane's horrible I Woke Up Early the Day I Died also). Mink Stole, the only real hope for some good camp, was given nothing to do - yawn. Martha Plimpton's role as Pecker's sister was simply not funny. And the Virgin Mary gag was funny the first time but was repeated over and over like a Saturday Night Live skit that has gone on way too long. I only hope that Mr. Waters will return to the less mainstream and more honest world of life on the far fringe in his next film.

Photography lends it's power along with the very impressive scenography and costumes to conveying the mind boggling powers which compressed the life of the most powerful in that primeval society. Usually we feel very distant from those times ... but is it really true that human nature and it's environment have changed in the last 1000 years ? ;-> PS As any decent human being I fell in love with the actress impersonating Elizabeth after the first 20 frames of the movie 8-> How sad that the only escape she found was becoming the Virgin Queen !!! "},{"date":"13 October 1998","review":" There are some awfully hot hands in Rounders, but the story is ice cold and there's nothing we haven't seen before. Matt Damon is a card shark with a bright (and legal) future. Just as soon as he kicks the habit of playing for thousands a night (a mostly lucrative gig) an old friend (Ed Norton) is paroled and the wily duo ante up their very hides in order to pay off Norton's growing gambling debts. Any half-awake viewer knows from the first deuce that what will follow will only be a series of cheap highs and lows. John Malcovich and John Torturro turn in typically memorable performances and make this over-long flick a little more bearable.  "},{"date":"14 October 1998","review":"  Although more could have been done with the plot development, the producers did succeed in creating a movie with a truly dream-like quality. It's true that the concept may seem  trite to those of us over 40 who have read and seen countless attempts at related material, but that should not spoil this film for those still fairly new to these concepts. If you recall how incredibly thought provoking and marvelous Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land was to you at age 18 you will get the point. Several years ago I picked up the book for a re-read and found it trite, unimaginative and sexist. Both responses were honest and real, but from different life\/time perspectives. The same could be true for this movie. Only to those of us jaded by the genre would this film seem silly and less than spectacular. I think the movie was beautiful. It is sappy, true, but sap is what keeps old and young trees alive. When our society becomes too sophisticated to enjoy a good old fashioned sappy love story it is evidence of a withering soul. Time to stop and smell the roses again.... Or in this case, get back to the art museum and spend some solitary hours moving inside the paintings again, like you did when you were younger and more amazed at the talents and visions of the world.

Although there is bad language which spoils it slightly - the storyline and acting are superb. It is based in Northern Ireland, so it will probably get a bad review from English viewers - who would be jealous of such a good film being made here.

The movie's shot in Berlin and though I've been living here for just three months I almost know any of the shooting locations.

Underneath the special effects there were points where it seemed as though the director didn't care enough or maybe, cared too much. The dialog was weak and long winded, far below the talents of Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding. The story seemed to wander aimlessly for the first forty-five minutes and got a little goofy at points(i.e. Robin Williams daughter turning Asian and his son going Black).Technically this movie was decent, but that's all it was, a poor attempt at a look at what Hollywood can do with special effects.

She was no way as good as Sarah Michelle in the role of Julie's best friend.Another thing the film lacks is its script & story.

Adds several bizarre shots, makes one or two attacks at the music industry, and plays out gay fantasies of the reporter.  Could have been more interesting but it turned out being the most boring film I've watched since Motal Kombat Annihilation.

This is the most accessible  of any of John Waters' movies I've seen and I like that,  doesn't hit you over the head with weirdness. Waters is so good at taking a normal situation and making it appear just slightly off kilter. There are some great characters here...Ed Furlong is wonderfully wholesome and believable as Pecker, Christina Ricci is terrific in a very intense way as a too normal no frills small city girl. This movie is just plain good fun, it's easy to laugh at everybody and not feel mean spirited. Oh yeah and good  to see Patty Hearst having some fun.  "},{"date":"26 October 1998","review":"  This film, posted as a bodice ripper, was in fact tame to the point of dullness. Even worse, I felt that details of the plot and action were sometimes hopelessly absurd for example can you imagine the Queen fornicating in view of her ladies in waiting? or a priest committing violent murder even in England of the 1550s? or that Queen Mary Tudor really was so ugly? To make a film of this sort dramatically effective, it must be convincing in its detail, and this Elizabeth was not.However my major grievance is the music. We are long accustomed to lush string tone attempting to summon up the atmosphere of Olde Worlde Englande, but Walton did it so much better (Touch her sweet lips and part - this was real music). Here we have a pastiche of a pastiche, with all the lumbering dullness of so many bad period costume dramas of the past. For example, the Volta was a dance thought lascivious at the time - not a hint of this from the music here! The quotation from Elgar's Enigma (with a wordless female chorus - bless us) seemed hopelessly inappropriate and the pseudo-Handelian chorus at the end nearly had me falling out of my seat.Film music CAN be good - for example, that of Prokofiev and Walton, good enough to stand alone - but so rarely is. "},{"date":"27 October 1998","review":"  I enjoyed this film, the acting was brilliant, the costume was rich, but I was a little confused. Henry VIII left a son to reign after him before Mary, but there was no mention of him.  Elizabeth's death warrant was signed while she was in the tower - but not by the Queen, this was not mentioned.Henry Darnley had a wife who 'fell' to her death, was this the wife that was mentioned in the film? or did they mean his second wife?  The death of his first wife was certainly not mentioned. The Duke of Alencon was a prospective husband for Elizabeth long after the Norfolk plots had been discovered.  The Duke of Norfolk plotted to marry Mary Queen of Scots, Mary of Guise her mother had been dead for some time, the historic inaccuracies go on.  It makes it very difficult to see how old Elizabeth is supposed to be.Also I don't like the way the film makes out Elizabeth to be very naive on her ascension to the throne, after surviving her brother's reign and her sister's reign, and being highly educated it's very probable that she was most apt and qualified to be a very succesful Queen, which is what she achieved. "},{"date":"28 October 1998","review":"  Medem has been trying for years to show how two solitary beings can glimpse at each other's solitude. His three previous films are all interesting, but on the verge of being uncomprehensible and even pretentious. Los amantes del Circulo Polar is as beautiful as Tierra, as suggestive as La Ardilla Roja, as moving as Vacas, but so much better. Coincidences lack the mystical character they have in his other films. What Otto and Ana can see of each other, what Otto and Ana make of each other, is not a result of destiny, but of our constant attempt at not being alone, at finding meaning on a meaningless world. When you come out of the cinema, your life seems fuller and more significant. And, somehow, one wonders whether the lives of those already gone is not also meaningful from the life of those who remember them.

I saw it at a preview; I told the distributor rep that the best thing they could do was pull it now.There is not one redeeming scene, line, note of music, or sequence.Save your money. "},{"date":"31 October 1998","review":"  John Carpenter is America's greatest living director of westerns.  Although Vampires is his first literal western, JC's been turning out 1st rate original westerns from Assault on Precinct 13 to They Live and Escape  From New York to The Thing.  Even though these movies don't take place in the west, they have all the ingredients of a good western the lone hero\/outlaw, the seige or attack, the showdown, and plenty of action. Vampires takes place and was filmed in the southwest (filmed in Sante Fe, NM).  Carpenter's DP Gary Kibbe captures some nice wide John Ford-ish western vistas, and Carpenter's minimalist score capture the desolate, hard nature of the place.  The real asset of this film is its cast, especially James Woods as the insanely tough and foul-mouthed slayer Jack Crow.  He really does some inspired improvised riffs, and when he's not kicking ass Woods has a lot of fun with it all.  Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter hero all man, flinty eyed & completely alone, and Woods plays this unsympathetic character with such a quick wit you can't help but admire the guy.  Thomas Ian Griffith plays a great Valek, the master vampire whom Jack has sworn to slay.  Griffith plays the character completely straight, and it works extremely well.  Griffith is an imposing figure, and you get a real sense of the nobility & savagery of Valek's character.  Compared to Woods, Griffith underplays his role, but still commands a very real presence of power & evil.  Carpenter stretches the $20 million dollar budget well, but you can sometimes see the zipper down the monster's back.  Despite a few fake looking wounds or rubbery stakes, Carpenter delivers a polished & stylish film, on par with movies costing 10 times as much (better in some cases).  I believe Carpenter works best with a little larger budget, but he should stay away from the typical Hollywood giant budget, he works best with a smaller production.  Vampires is a treat for any Carpenter fan, and hopefully marks the beginning of a new standard in his films.  "},{"date":"1 November 1998","review":"  Vampires (Vampire$) is an absolutely atrocious flick.  Perhaps the only redeeming quality of this movie is the unintentional humor.  Was it supposed to be funny when the heads were being hacked off?  Of course not.  And yet, the entire film was so poorly done that the audience bursts into laughter. The same goes for the ridiculous aforementioned scene with the cross.  In fact, the movie as a whole is bearable only because it is so absolutely horrible.  How can one not laugh at a crossbow only Nerf could have made?  "},{"date":"2 November 1998","review":"  I am confused it seems that movie may be about time travel. The court of Elizabeth seemed to be crowded with hip extras from Priscilla in the Desert. Everybody seemed to be arrested whilst engaging in sexual intercourse or other private functions. With this stuff and assorted historical inaccuracies the interesting story of the early reign of the Virgin Queen has been trivialised. A poor movie. "},{"date":"3 November 1998","review":"  Elizabeth has just the right running time for a film of this genre. When Compared to Nixon, JFK and other reasonably historically based conspiracy films, Elizabeth emerges as easily the most watchable, in one sitting. Clever use of editing during the scene in which Elizabeth is working out how to address parliament, alludes to a Taxi Driver style insight into another's mind.The whole story draws interesting parallels with The Godfather, Part II, as a ruler wanting to emulate his\/her father's successes, slowly destroys all those around him\/her. The film concludes showing how lonely such an achievement can be in reality, leaving Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen and Don Michael Corleone isolated from the remainder of his family, sitting on his throne, by Lake Tahoe.

"},{"date":"5 November 1998","review":"  Pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in Baltimore whose daily, humdrum routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who takes pictures of real things. No pretty models, no gorgeous men, just hard living. This wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain. There is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at Pecker's mom's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the Whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. This just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have, you might not always have taste.      Yet again John Waters sends you into a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities, but give me a Pecker or a Hairspray (another excellent John Waters film) over a Titanic or a Godzilla anyday!!

"},{"date":"7 November 1998","review":"  If Mr Kapur only wanted to tell the audience about the nightmare Elizabeth went through, he has brilliantly succeeded. However, almost everything else seems wrong about this movie. Most obtrusive is the soundtrack with its extreme examples of ugly singing.  The choice of the music, for example Mozart's famous Requiem, composed at least 250 years later, is also very unfortunate.The storytelling does not make sense either. The movie starts as abruptly as it ends, and despite Cate Blanchett's great performance, one cannot feel involved with her or anyone else.At the end of the movie most of Elizabeth's impressive career has yet to come. As the movie ends when there's no more blood to show, one is left puzzled about the intentions of the director. Can anyone imagine a movie about Churchill which ends in 1939? "},{"date":"8 November 1998","review":" This movie shows how the United States Government and Civilians react to terrisom acts.

The actors do a good job but Bruce Willis is only in the movie briefly.  "},{"date":"11 November 1998","review":"  Having heard a lot of negative comments about this film, I went along purely on the strength of the largely British cast and what I knew of their previous work.  I wasn't disappointed.  Kapur's direction is a little irritating at times (a few too many overhead shots), but the film looks fantastic and the music, although perhaps not always from the right period, fits the visuals perfectly.  Cate Blanchett is a stunning Elizabeth, although I feel the insistence of the film to focus on the early part of her reign is a little disappointing.  And why no mention of Essex, Drake, or even Mary Queen of Scots, except in passing?  Best performances come from Chris Eccleston, Geoffrey Rush, and Richard Attenborough, but everyone has their moments and no one lets the cast down.  Well worth seeing.

The killer is gonna be a suprise to many people. If you wanna know who the killer is, u will have to study the first 20 minutes of I Know What You Did Last Summer. It's a scream and great to see if you like killing and gore. Brandy and Jennifer acted real good in the movie. Too bad Jennifer sang and not Brandy. Anywayz, the plot to the movie is sorta hard to explain, and some of the almost killing scenes could've been prevented.Jennifer, if you are stuck in a tanning booth tell your friends to turn it off and then help you get out.I give I Still Know... an 8.  Don't really listen to any of the comments, go see it and judge it for yourself.

The follow-up film has no story, just your standard slasher stalks and kills teens....as well as anybody else in the film.However, that said, it still was fun to watch, although maybe a little too graphic for my taste in a couple of spots. Unlike many of the other posted comments, I found Brandy's performance to be very natural and entertaining and of course Love Hewitt is nice too look at too.The Mekhi Phifer character was too much of a boor and I kept hoping he would get the hook sooner than later. The surprise twist at the end did catch me off guard although others have commented that they figured it out in advance.The movie supposedly takes place on a Bahamian island. Having visited the Bahamas many, many times, the first view of the so-called Bahamas in the movie was a little bit of a shock since these previously perfectly flat islands had now grown mountains and hills along with rock formations jutting out of the ocean. And then when I saw the Bahamian resort I was further shocked to see that Mexican architecture had been exported to the Bahamas.It seems the film makers should either have gone to the Bahamas or made the location in the film be Mexico, where it was actually filmed. Of course Mexico has no remote, lightly populated islands like the Bahamas does so I guess that wouldn't have suited the story. And the Bahamian government probably wouldn't let them film there due to the potential bad impact on tourism.Despite these quibbles, the movie held my interest and had enough eye candy to keep me watching the screen. I would rate this movie about a 7.5 on a scale of 10. "},{"date":"16 November 1998","review":"  This is a lovely fictitious work about Queen Elizabeth.  Go see it, but don't believe any of it is historically correct.  Costumes are lovely, but also wrong, everything from 1700's to Victorian fashion.  The costumer should do research and not fantasize what she thought the fashion should be. And the writer should have at least opened a history book.  Only the names remained the same.

ITs I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.Once again a movie company under-estimates the movie goer and tries to inflict a recycled plot upon the audience.  This time it is in an exotic locale and still as predictable.  Personally me and the group of people near me predicted the end within 5 minutes of the opening scene. People around me however thought it was scary.  I thought it was somewhat, but how many times can you see a shadowy figure pop out of behind a door or shadow before you get the picture.  The script lines were recycled and cliche as well as predictable.  The film was not worth the 8 dollars I spent to see it.

That would be fine if the film were a travelogue, but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry, that is not good enough.  The theme of inter-species respect and co-operation ventures timidly into the forbidden world of inter-species love, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species.

I Went Down is a refreshing release from this trend.Having read the 'net reviews it seems my fears have been realised.  This movie doesn't hold back when it comes to Irish accents, figures of speech and wit.

"},{"date":"24 November 1998","review":"  Pakistani Shekhar Kapur is perhaps the perfect director for Elizabeth, as he brings to the table an outsider's perspective on the 16th-century ascendancy of England's Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII and his sometimes-reviled second wife, Anne Boleyn.  This sumptuous historical drama stars Australian Cate Blanchett in the title role. Blanchett brings girlish fragility and abundant womanliness to a character who history too often portrays as the distant and unassailable Virgin Queen, who spent over forty years keeping a court of suitors and yes-men at bay by refusing to marry (and therefore align with) any of them.  `Elizabeth' focuses on the first years of the queen's reign, while she was consolidating her power, and when it seemed likely that she would marry, sending England into political disarray.The men and women orbiting Elizabeth's sun are well portrayed, too. Geoffrey Rush, the star of `Shine,' plays Sir Francis Walsingham with the same kind of Machiavellian cunning that Charlton Heston brought to the role of Cardinal Richelieu in Richard Lester's 1974 `The Four Musketeers.' Christopher Eccleston (Duke of Norfolk) and Joseph Fiennes (Robert Dudley) portray courtiers admirably.  And veterans Fanny Ardant (Mary of Guise), Richard Attenborough (Sir William Cecil), and John Gielgud (The Pope) round out a capable cast.  Kapur's lush direction and sharp pacing keep `Elizabeth' a highly watchable historical drama in a genre that is too often burdened by plodding, interminable storytelling. "},{"date":"25 November 1998","review":"  The main reason I wanted to see this film was for Cate Blanchett, who blew me away with her performance in Oscar & Lucinda.  She acted well in this movie, depicting a vulnerable Queen who doesn't (at first) fully realize the dangers of her position, but Christopher Eccleston and Geoffrey Rush impressed me the most.Eccleston is extremely versatile; he is like a creature unrelated to his Jude from a few years ago.  Geoffrey Rush was strong and enigmatic as Walsingham, Elizabeth's protector. I half wish the movie had been more about HIM.  I am not familiar with the actual history; did either of these men exist?  I would have liked to have seen more about them; I liked the glimpses we were given into their dealings with others.  Fascinating characters.In any case, these were the major stand out performances.  John Gielgud (as the Pope) was not memorable because he was on screen for no more than a few minutes and his lines were hardly quotable.  Eric Cantona as the French Ambassador had an amazing sort of presence; I remember him quite clearly ... and I had no idea he was a soccer player til I read it here on IMDb.  Also, the woman who played Elizabeth's first handmaiden (or whatever they are called) was very expressive and is worth mentioning.Joseph Fiennes' character was irritating beyond belief.  I consider myself to be a person of reasonable intelligence, but I could not figure out whose side he was on or why by the time the end credits appeared. The writers (or editors) really screwed up with this character; a lot of his behavior was not clarified.  I believed him when he told Elizabeth that he loved her, but then ... why was he having sex with one of her maids?  What did he have to do with the poison dress?  Why did he seem shocked to see her writhing in agony if he knew nothing of the poisoned dress?  Why would he want to see Elizabeth assassinated if he loved her?  He made no sense to me.  Not to mention I could not understand why she adored him so much; he struck me as being a fop.  Leonardo DiCaprio would have been just as suitable for this role (probably more so, since he's played the type before) ... this character was listless, lolling, lazy, and a priss.  It lowered Elizabeth to even be attracted to this man.  I found myself wondering, Where is that fiercely handsome Duke of Norfolk? every time Lord Roberts showed up on screen with his puppydog eyes.On the positive side, the film is quite lush and colorful.  Visually, it's stunning and deserves some sort of award for that.  But, as others have mentioned, the use of music was atrocious.  The music didn't always match the mood of the scene, and sometimes it would actually detract from the scene.I think this movie is supposed to be about how a woman sacrifices her own happiness and personal convictions for the good of her people and the stability of her position.  Nice attempt, but it doesn't quite pan out.  In the end, Elizabeth comes off as a freak of nature - how exactly does caking your face with white powder make you like the Virgin Mary?  That was never explained.In any case, the music in the final scene was so obnoxious that I couldn't even reflect on the poor Queen's hideous transformation.  I just wanted to cut out of the auditorium as quickly as possible.I think I'll be checking out that Elizabeth R series that everyone keeps talking about. "},{"date":"26 November 1998","review":"  This movie was better then the first one. It was more scarier, it had more twists in it and I had no idea of what people would die. They made it like the first one, like at the end how the fisherman was still there, and in the first one she was in the shower. But previews to this movie where not in the movie, like it had her on the computer, and then she was talking to a therapist, that was misleading. The acting was overall pretty good, Love Hewitt tried to act tough, but you could tell Julie was scared. Brandy did a very good job as well as Freddie Prinze he was my favorite character, trying to save the day. Overall I would give this 9\/10.

Follow this advice and you will thoroughly enjoy this film.  It follows a young queen -- vibrantly portrayed by Cate Blanchett, who was so wonderful in Oscar and Lucinda -- as she matures from an impulsive young girl who wants to follow her heart into a strong, charismatic ruler with the courage to kill her enemies.  Joseph Fiennes smolders prettily as her only true love (don't all costume dramas require a good smolderer?); once she realizes that she can't have him, and that any other marriage she might undertake would only be for political gain, she chooses to reinvent herself as the Virgin Queen.  Lots of brutal executions, torture, battle scenes, and lots of palace intrigue, religious persecution, and debauchery... all in all, a most entertaining film centered around a riveting actress playing a fascinating woman.  Don't think too hard about whether the historical details or costumes or music are perfectly accurate... just pay attention to the story and you'll have a great time.

This is not only one of the best dramas of the year, but also, it is the best thriller, the best romance, and it harbors some of the year's best performances.Cate Blanchet leads this stellar cast with an Oscar worthy performance.  She is elegant, fragile, sophisticated, and transparent--she produces the best performance by a lead actress this year.  Geoffrey Rush and Chistopher Ecleston are excellent supporting characters and deserve nods of their own.Appart from the acting the best thing Elizabeth does for the audience is create a horrifying sense of fear, danger, and solitude.  With enormous empty rooms, assassination attempts, blood red costuming, and characters ducking in and out of the shadows, the audience is treated to the feeling of the violent uncertainty so appropiate to the time.Many critics and viewers have disagreed with my consensus, but nevertheless, this is a film worth seeing twice.  It is biting at the heels of the exhalted Saving Private Ryan and surpasses the likes of The Truman Show.  Indeed this is one of the year's best pictures, and certainly one of the year's best performances. See Elizabeth, even if you hate costume dramas, this isn't your ordinary period piece.  This is an exciting, suspenseful (you can forget Psycho), sexy, heart-tearing film. Elizabeth will not disappoint you.My grade A "},{"date":"1 December 1998","review":"  History pix are impossible to get right 100% and they're subject to the director's and the time's interpretation.  So I won't go into the details here;  suffice to say this was a well-made movie.And well-acted.  It's a big break for Cate Blanchett but my concern is that she may have done this role only too well; i.e., that she ends up remembered only for this role -- worse yet, that she ends up in Elizabeth-esque roles (tough, regal, remote, &c.) the rest of her career.

First off, the chronology is incorrect and some of the events depicted did not even occur until mid-way through her reign (like Norfolk's execution) and this movie only covered the beginning of her reign (but it's not very clear). Dudley was NOT her love at the time she ascended to the throne - Thomas Seymour was (and lost his life for his close proximity to her) and he never even got a mention! The threats against Elizabeth's life (i.e., poisoned dress, the darts on the boat) didn't occur.  In reality there were so many plots against Elizabeth, (and they were all as deadly and just as 'hollywood-exciting' as the two covered in this movie), so why weren't factual ones used instead?  Also, Elizabeth's 'transformation' into the virgin queen was a bit ridiculous.  The white paste make-up was simply the fashion of the day, NOT an attempt to turn herself into an earthbound-diety. And her virgin status was a political tool she used to connect herself with purity since half the known world at the time considered her a bastard and a heretic.  This movie could have been SO much better had anyone remotely connected with it taken the time to crack open a history book first! Elizabeth I was one of the most exciting monarchs to ever sit on a throne, let alone reign supremely and successfully in those turbulent times as she did for 45 years.THE GOOD  The casting is brilliant.  I got goosebumps during the coronoation scene - Cate Blanchette looks like every portrait I've ever seen of Elizabeth R's coronation.  The acting is wonderful.  And the costumes are glorious - eye candy for those of us fascinated by Elizabethan England.  The sets were beautiful, but a bit confusing.  Looked like most of it was filmed in a cathedral, however Tudor England is known for incredible woodwork craftsmanship (including walls, ceilings, furniture) and all we saw was stone gothic arches.  Where was Whitehall Palace, Hampton Court or Hatfield? I loved that when candles were lit, the entire room didn't 'magically' light up as in most period movies, so it really helped created a sense of those times.  The scenery was beautiful.  I want to know where that huge old tree is located (in the scene where Elizabeth is told that Mary is dead and she is now queen).  Even though I didn't enjoy the gross historical inaccuracies, I'd recommend the movie for these reasons alone (as long as you can suspend your knowledge of Elizabeth R's history). "},{"date":"8 December 1998","review":"  I went to this film not expecting much.. and that's what I got.. this cash-in of a sequel doesn't do the first one justice.. the plot is so bad, and the ending is worse... The film wouldn't have been SO bad if they cut the ending off, I mean, it would have been bad.. but not THAT bad. Trust me.. (the entire cinema groaned when they saw it!!) if you've seen the first film you've seen the end of this one. It's more of an inferior remake than a sequel, it copies from scream 1 & 2 a lot, and the first film. I really enjoyed the first film, I HATED this one... Only see it for a joke.. don't expect a good sequel.. "},{"date":"9 December 1998","review":"  Unfortunately the film depicts Elizabeth as someone to whom the crown descended as a surprise. Nothing in her characterization reveals the depth of her previous learning or that she was indeed schooled to become queen. She was not a country lass frolicking on the hillside. Likewise, William Cecil, Lord Burghley is depicted as little more than an errand boy to Elizabeth, whereas in reality he was a very powerful shaper and mover of events, with constant interaction between himself and other powerful lords.. Sir Francis Walsingham is at least revealed as the cunning, determined and decisive man that he was (as the originator of the British secret intelligence service); but his motives in promoting Elizabeth never appear. As a consequence of these hollownesses, the characters, clad in all the finery possible, remain shallow. On a more technical level, there are some cute and pointless camera tricks and blinding moments, such as when Elizabeth hears of her ascension or when she dances, that draw attention to themselves without advancing the story or the characters. The nice thing is that there will still be other opportunities to tell this story and do it better. "},{"date":"10 December 1998","review":"  Take the time to see this movie.  It is fascinating.  it is also easy to follow, even for one not familiar with British history. "},{"date":"11 December 1998","review":"  I´m from Germany and I love the mvovies.

Ethan Embry, Jennifer Love Hewitt,Seth Green, Charlie Corsmos, and just about everyone else shine like the stars they are. A great storyline and character development.  "},{"date":"13 December 1998","review":"  PATCH ADAMS can best be described with one word....EXCELLENT! Robin Williams' performance takes us through a whole range of emotions and back again.  It's the first movie I've seen in *years* where the audience applauded at the end of the movie.  You can see Robin's true human spirit and compassion in scenes with the 'cancer ward' kids.  He is a wonderful person...the best choice for such a role.  Dr Adams is to be commended for all he went through to get where he is today.  Watch this movie, and you'll know why. "},{"date":"14 December 1998","review":"  Although occasionally diverting and sometimes innovative, it is still a small-time-crooks-run-rings-around-their-problems. I was bored to tears. "},{"date":"15 December 1998","review":"  England. 1555. Henry VIII has snuffed it from gout or syphilis, it depends on who you read, Bloody Mary's got a tumour and the Catholics' greatest fear is Anne Boleyn's daughter Elizabeth. Director Kapur has brought to the screen some of the most intriguing moments in English history and the result is dazzling.Following recent grandiose French historical epics, such as the glorious Ridicule, Elizabeth more than holds its own as a no-holds barred, gripping English extravaganza. Historians across the land will no doubt pick holes in the accuracy, but it hardly matters.The opening scene signals the film's intent. Protestant heretics are burnt mercilessly at the grisly stake, accompanied by proclamations that they should burn in Hell. It's clear that England is in a pretty gloomy state and ruled by a humourless zealot, Mary (the ubiquitous Kathy Burke), who is hell-bent on converting or murdering Elizabeth My sister was born a whore of that Ann Boleyn.Cheery Mary rules a poor, remote island that is very likely to become the next possession of the growing empire of Spain. She is surrounded by rebels who want to place the Protestant Elizabeth on the throne. So, Mary gets her trusted Lord Norfolk (Eccleston cuts an impressive presence; you can imagine this man swishing on the battlefield) to arrest Lizzy and dispatch her to the Tower of London.The camerawork and the pace of this film are breathtaking. Kapur directs with ambitious panache, whilst supplying more than a wink to Coppola's The Godfather in the process. Two scenes in particular reek of the Mafia masterpiece one in the Vatican, the other a succession of assassinations sparked by the majesty's demand, let it all be done. Pure Pacino.If you shimmy past the slightly silly inclusions of the likes of Eric Cantona (the IKEA School of Acting) and Angus Deayton, and the fact that Dickie Attenborough (plays a fussy sidekick who sniffs the Queen's bedsheets and claims, her body belongs to the State) is starting to resemble an Ewok, the acting is otherwise splendid.Cate Blanchett not only resembles the great lady, but imparts her with enormous affection (her love of Lord Dudley, played by Fiennes, is tenderly dealt with) and delivers her lines with a steely intelligence, I do not see why a woman must marry at all and I'm no man's Elizabeth . Her performance is a revelation and if it weren't for Geoffrey Rush she would have stolen every scene. However, the Shine star, playing her demonic sidekick Walsingham, delights in creeping in the shadows and pulling the devilish strings. A positively Machiavellian turn and worthy of another Oscar.This is a history film made at its very finest and the equal of A Man For All Seasons. Elizabeth could have unfolded in front of me all day and I would have remained enraptured. Intoxicating imagery (English blood on French colours the wicked Mary of Guise, Ardant, proclaims), naughty shenanigans, dastardly deeds, an epic tale and a superb cast. Stunning cinema. "},{"date":"16 December 1998","review":"  This movie featured an excellent young cast that proved to be highly effective in delivering the laughs.  With a few exceptions (Eve 6, Smash Mouth) the soundtrack, drawn from the 70's, 80's and 90's, added to the appeal.  All of the requisite teen emotions were presented convincingly the crush, break-ups, partying, trying to score, etc.  High quality pop in the vein of Dazed and Confused, Better Off Dead and All the Right Moves.  "},{"date":"17 December 1998","review":"  What's not to like?   The music in the soundtrack is wonderful, especially the four songs performed by the late Harry Nilsson. The dialog is witty, the story is charming, NYC has never looked better, and Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks are at their best. Great supporting cast, too.  It's nice to finally find a movie that I can see with my entire family! "},{"date":"18 December 1998","review":"  A film that opens with Protestant heretics being burnt at the stake and makes you feel like you're there too. Elizabeth combines the best of historical drama with the passion and colour of Bollywood. Why is it the best film of 1998? For everything acting, costumes, cinematography, script. The performances of Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are particularly outstanding. "},{"date":"19 December 1998","review":"  You've got Mail is a very good romantic comedy. The chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan is very apparent. They should make at least one movie together every year. As in Sleepless in Seattle the pair don't get together romantically until the end although in mail they appear on screen together much sooner. It's a delightful movie and you wish it would continue a little longer. "},{"date":"20 December 1998","review":"  The plot was overly dramatic.  The graphic violence was not necessary.  Many plot details were not believable.  The acting and casting were excellent. Cate Blanchett shimmered in practically every scene.  The movie dragged at the end.    "},{"date":"21 December 1998","review":"  I love this movie to the point of pathology.  It stands alone in my movie-going history.  I will never forget Jason Schwatzman's performance as long as I live.  Can't wait to see it again. "},{"date":"22 December 1998","review":"  Having not seen Sleepless In Seattle for quite some time, I was not in a rush to compare this movie with its predecessor. Because of this, I was impressed and charmed by the film's cute sense of humor and interesting story line. It kept me interested and laughing the whole way through. I was impressed to see that the writers did not go overboard about the Internet scheme (though AOL sure did with the advertisements), because it actually brought it out realistically and believably, mixing the reality and virtual reality together nicely. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were the perfect duo again, and I particularly enjoyed how Hanks made his character one you would love one minute and hate the next...but feel sorry for him at the same time. I was not thrilled on going to see it, but I made a mistake. A must-see if you're into cute-romantics.  "},{"date":"23 December 1998","review":"  Funny movie, really, but not really gay. And not the kind of movie you would await from John Waters, so a bit disappointing also. "},{"date":"24 December 1998","review":"  I saw Elizabeth and I enjoyed every bit of this royal masterpiece.  The riveting cinematography and the acting in it was outstanding.  Cate Blanchett who delivered probably the performance to beat for the Oscars for best actress was so mesmerizing as the Virgin Queen.  Blanchett showed how a blind and carefree young woman and grow up to be a strong and fearless leader of England.  There were excellent performances also by Geoffery Rush, Joseph Fiennes, and Sir John Gielgud, This movie was excellent and I hope that Cate Blanchett walks home with the gold for it!! "},{"date":"25 December 1998","review":"  The lavish costuming and sets and good performance by Cate Blanchett could not overcome the grossly inaccurate depiction of history.First, the Catholics were all uniformly depicted as sexual libertines, murderers, and\/or hypocrites.  The portrayal of the Jesuit priest as a murderous 16th century commando was especially disgusting.  St. Edmund Campion, one of those Jesuits, was martyred by Elizabeth for ministering to the faithful in England and refusing to renounce the Catholic Church for Elizabeth and the Church of England.Second, William Cecil - Lord Burghley, was also seriously misportrayed. Cecil, in fact, was Elizabeth's closest advisor for a lengthy period of time; Sir Francis Walsingham was a subordinate to Cecil.  Cecil was not the milksop portrayed in the movie.Third, many of the cast looked like members of a 1990's Los Angeles street gang instead of characters from 16th century England.I believe the high overall ratings given the film are a result of ignorance of history. "},{"date":"26 December 1998","review":"  God only knows how historically correct Elizabeth is, but I enjoyed it. The overall feeling was that a lot of effort was put into this movie. The actors were well chosen and they played their parts well. Many of the characters were intriguing and if it hadn't been for them, the movie wouldn't have been as interesting. I especially loved Geoffrey Rush as the Queen's special advisor. And Cate Blanchett was the perfect choice for the title role. I heard rumors about Oscar nominations for best female lead, but only time will time. My favorite part of the movie was the ending. It was just perfect following the preceding events.Lula "},{"date":"27 December 1998","review":"  I liked this movie a lot, until the ending. The ending was pretty weak, almost anti-climactic. I was expecting more of a tear jerking, romantic ending. Unfortunately, that is not what I got. I think that having Hanks' character do something incredibly romantic for Ryans' character, as far as the situation with their bookstores went, would have made for a much better ending.I guess if you can overlook the fact that the movie is the longest infomercial for AOL that you may ever see (the AOL logo appears less than a minute into the film) and the very weak ending, it is a very engaging and enjoyable film.Did anyone else notice that Hanks was using an IBM Thinkpad and that Ryan was using an Apple Powerbook? I am not sure if this is supposed to reflect their characters as far as Hanks being the businessman and Ryan being the creative writer-type or if it is supposed to reflect Hanks as being Big Blue to Ryans' much smaller market share. "},{"date":"28 December 1998","review":"  This film was visually spectacular and was performed by some of the greatest actors of our time.  For someone who isn't bothered by the lack of explanation of the intricacies of the underlying politics which surrounded Elizabeth both in England and worldwide at the time, this film is very satisfying.However, as a British history major, I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of world political and historical perspective.  But then again how much can one film cover?The casting, costumes, acting and cinematography were amazing.I highly recommend it to anyone.  However, I suggest a quick brush-up on early Elizabethan history before viewing.    "},{"date":"29 December 1998","review":"  This was a very strange film- I guess dehydration on the desert can cause someone to go slightly insane. Yet the leopard was beautiful and somehow connected with the soldier. There are stories about animals that befriend humans- the most famous is Incident at Hawks Hill by Eckert- where a badger protects a young boy- that is why Passion can be a believable movie. the cinematography is gorgeous and though the acting, not all that good, the leopard makes the story. Independent films like this give the audience a wider view of the filmmaking scene and this is a unique story set in a unique time.  Worth a glance.

"},{"date":"1 January 1999","review":"  This movie was beautiful to look at, but someone should have been in charge of making sure that there was a story! There were lots of possibilities, but nothing to grab hold of or to care about.  Are we so enamored of royalty that we only have to see a queen to honor the movie? Blanchett's performance was excellent.  Too bad it didn't come in a movie with a point!  "},{"date":"2 January 1999","review":"  As a story, the movie had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the camera work made me dizzy to the point that I had to close my eyes. Also, I found the very dark scenes annoying. "},{"date":"3 January 1999","review":"  Elizabeth, the story of the first stormy years of Elizabeth I's ultimately gloriously successful reign, is a masterpiece.  Without being too untrue to the period, it manages beauty, suspense and great dialogue.  Cate Blanchett is Elizabeth in a way that few actors manage to portray real people.  I was overwhelmed by the richness of the values and the intelligence and complexity of the story.  This is a movie for adults - go and see it right away.

"},{"date":"5 January 1999","review":"  When I went to see ELIZABETH this past weekend, it was because a friend of mine desperately wanted to see it.  Frankly, I am not a history buff and expected to be completely bored.  Boy, was I wrong.  The movie was tremendously engaging and the time flew by.  In fact it reminded me of how TITANIC didn't seem to be 3 hours and 15 minutes because of the action. Well ELIZABETH didn't seem like a two hour movie, and I was truly disappointed when it ended. And on top of that, I learned something about history in the process.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!  "},{"date":"6 January 1999","review":"  Nora Ephron should be spanked for this tasteless rehash of Sleepless in Seattle. Same dependence on film references, same cute delayed meet--but with the addition of an apologia for the takeover of independent bookstores by chains. AOL, Barnes & Noble, Starbucks, IBM, Apple all get prominent displays--what is this, a feature-length infomercial? And aren't Ryan and Hanks a bit old for this?   "},{"date":"7 January 1999","review":"  I enjoy the talk about this movie and 'Sleepless' because bothmovies are about falling in love with a person.  Who cares ifHanks is getting old?  Ryan is still radiant but their physicalbeauty is not the focus of the story.  These people fall in lovewith each other's souls.   Love in spite of fault and wrong.And like sleepless, this love is never consummated on screen.  Itis encouraging to see so many people declare this a romanticmovie despite our society's increasing obsession with sex.  "},{"date":"8 January 1999","review":"  I found this film wonderful in scope, costumes, music, editing and cinematography, however, at the core - was too melodramatic for me - with the exception of the very talented Geoffrey Rush.  I found the film too straight forward, and with no subplots and an annoying lead as Elizabeth, I was disappointed overall in the film. "},{"date":"9 January 1999","review":"  Cate Blanchett rocked in the role of Elizabeth.  She had one of the most convincing and powerful presences I have ever seen on screen.  The film was pretty dark, which took a bit away from the overall experience.  I liked the scenes with her and Joseph Fiennes, of the magnificent Shakespeare In Love.  His eyes are so intense, he's a perfect match for her.  This is one of the best films of the year.  "},{"date":"10 January 1999","review":"  If you can get past your fear of hearing the English language with a totally undiluted Irish accent (which you should get used to, if this movie is an indication of things to come), you'll find an odd little gem.  Hilarious scenes like the weapon\/ski mask scene.  Quirky characters leading the charge into unknown situations.If for no other reason than the scene descriptions, you should see this movie.  "},{"date":"11 January 1999","review":"  I think Can't Hardly Wait is the best movie I have ever seen! All the Actors fit their roles. Also, I'm a little impartial to Jennifer Love Hewitt, she's my fav actress, and very beautiful. Peace!!!  "},{"date":"12 January 1999","review":"  I truly did love this film for the colors, costumes, dancing, & how the characters *moved*. It was close to the most beautiful film (in that sense. Literally) I've ever seen. Cate B is so very captivating. It was easy for me to see how she evolved into such a strong & intelligent force. I was unfamiliar with the actual history of the subject matter. The presentation of plot was just not A+ but the movie overall was a must-see. I can't wait to go again (and I'm not a repeat viewer-type).  M.B.  "},{"date":"13 January 1999","review":"  In true John Waters form, Pecker offers a pure glimpse of human nature. Being human entitles us to our own unique quirks and eccentricities that make us individuals. When we 'seemingly' normal people are influenced by our ever-changing society, that is when the humor begins.I think the true beauty of this movie is in the acting. Waters guides his cast into committed characterizations, adding layer upon layer of sub-text until they blossom before your eyes. Waters approaches his characters the way a painter approaches his easel and taking a mental snapshot, paints his perspective. Add all these factors in and you see why I say Pecker is a great movie!Bravo, John. I always enjoy your work, thank you for sharing your art and perspective with the world. "},{"date":"14 January 1999","review":"  Gorgeous cinematography, art direction and costumes.  Adequate leading lady. Thoroughly muddled screenplay.  Amateurishly florid direction.

Sleepless and Mail both work, though, with unique dignity.  So fine.  "},{"date":"16 January 1999","review":"  I didn't love this as much as some people, (see above) but I did like this one a lot.  Lots of great lines like ...you sneaky f***in'... in-the-bath- fella! Plenty of deadpan humor. Reminds me of Midnight Run crossed with Pulp Fiction and just a little Miller's Crossing.  I rented it twice, check it out.  "},{"date":"17 January 1999","review":"  Knowing some background of the Elizabethan age did not prepare me for the realistic portrayal of life in and around her court.  The film was well-done (though the Godfather-like climax was not as well done as Coppola) and well-cast, but it seemed somewhat unfocused to me at times. The 27 year old main character conveys a great presence, as do Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Unfortunately, we did not get to see enough of Elizabeth and her advisors in the war room preparing to plot strategy, and I'm convinced that had I not taught this age many times, I would have been thoroughly lost.  An A for effort, but definitely an E for editing.  "},{"date":"18 January 1999","review":"  It's hard to take these films seriously, because they are so patronizing to both women and men.  Give her a brewski, put her in a Hummer, and be done with it.  I don't ask for historical accuracy, but I don't ask to be set up with an un-believable premise. "},{"date":"19 January 1999","review":"  Elizabeth should be marketed as fiction because that is what it is. It captures the feel of the time and Cate Blanchett and the whole cast do an excellent job of portraying what they were given.However, the history is all wrong. There are several points that do not match up with what actually happened-Elizabeth knew that Dudley was married - she attended his wedding before she was Queen-while Mary I ruled, Elizabeth was not addressed as Princess, but Lady; Mary I refused to recognize her as heir to the throne-Marie of Guise was not wicked; she did not go to bed with Sir Francis Walsingham; she died of natural causes-Sir William Cecil was made Lord Burghley; however, he was not given this title until 1572 and was an excellent advisor until his retirement at a much later date than is shown-nothing is mentioned of Elizabeth I's run in with smallpox, her tremendous intelligence (it is hinted at briefly), or her amazing linguistic ability-also, she never ruled with her heart, but with her head - always (that is not to say she didn't have a heart, she did, but she was very shrewd)The characterization depicted of Elizabeth I really belongs more to her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots (who did rule with her heart).  "},{"date":"20 January 1999","review":"  In this offering of the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I the emphases are on early suitors for her hand in marriage and on the struggle between the two factions of the Protestant and Catholic clergy. Although the film was completely a masterpiece of film art, it misses the mark slightly with it's obvious anti-catholic bias and it's habit of ignoring historical fact. Although many films such as this do use a good deal of artistic license, it would be just as interesting - perhaps more so, to portray the events that shaped a future world accurately.If one remembers the makers have played havoc with history, it surpasses mere entertainment. It is a joy to watch.  "},{"date":"21 January 1999","review":"  There are some films where you wish....no let me rephrase that....demand that time that the film makers stole from your life....this film is one of them. I hated everything about this film, from its title Can't Hardly Wait (bad english) to its end credits, which were the only good thing about the movie.There are millions of people who love this idiotic film filled with stupid cheap and immature laughs......and I hate to think that those millions of people are the ones taking over the country one day.Which leads me to my next statement.......if ever a person wrote that all people under 21 should see Can't Hardly Wait......this person should be put on trial for trying to make the world dumb....This movie is the kind of film everyone who watches Dawson's Creek like because its stupid, it has no moral, no story, no sense of humor, no right to be screened even to the dumbest people....This film would be ideal for torture, ten seconds of this and the prisoner would be in agony! They would be spilling their guts about everything....The acting is woeful, the humor is missing, the director is wanted for making a terrible film, the writers were babies, and the fans are simple minded.Can't Hardly Wait is on the screen for about 90 minutes, and that's 90 minutes too long!  "},{"date":"22 January 1999","review":"  Rushmore is hands-down the funniest movie of 1998.  It is an amazingly original and smart piece of filmmaking, and there is not doub in my mind that it will be with us for years to come.  Director Wes Anderson has more than fulfilled the potential that he displayed in his debut film Bottle Rocket. Everything about Rushmore is totally first rate.  The script (co-written by Anderson and Owen Wilson, who played Dignan in Bottle Rocket) is as sharp as they come and defies any sort of genre classification.  The performances are top-notch.  Jason Shwartzman gives the most memorable debut performances I've seen in a long long time and Billy Murry totally shines in a role that he was born to play. Rushmore stretches beyond being a simple high school movie and moves way past those sappy coming of age dramas where the only emotions seem to be laughter and tears.  People are going to be watching this one for some time to come.  If there is any justice in this world Bill Murray will be given an Oscar nod for this film. I can't wait to seen what Wes Anderson (who is well on his way to becoming one of the best filmmakers of his generation) does next. "},{"date":"23 January 1999","review":"  Anglophiles who demand fact over good drama might blanch at the substantial creative license that littered Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth with historical inaccuracies, but lovers of texture, tone and mood will undoubtedly champion the flick for its exciting depiction of political intrigue.  Cate Blanchett leads a great cast of noteworthy talents like Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston and Fanny Ardant (John Gielgud even shows up as The Pope) through a sumptuous depiction of 16th century life re-imagined through costume and production design with a decidedly Indian spin.  The transformation of Elizabeth into The Virgin Queen is a show-stopper which Kapur daringly swipes directly from the legendary baptism scene in The Godfather.   "},{"date":"24 January 1999","review":"  It takes quite a bit to threaten Armageddon and Godzilla for the year's worst films, but Patch Adams manages to do it.  There are a few bits of comedy, mostly provided by Robin Williams' always zippy one-liners, but the rest of this is mauldin, manipulative, and extremely sappy.  This is unfortunate, considering the usually reliable Williams (and such great character actors as Phillip Seymour Hoffman and the extremely likable Monica Potter), but the direction is slow and steadily predictable, and the dialogue more hokey than imaginable.  Williams even seems out of it for the duration of the film (one reason being he's twice as old as anyone else in the movie... this really threatens the film's credibility), and it's Williams in hyper-sensitive mode -- not a pretty sight. "},{"date":"25 January 1999","review":"  My opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases.  I tend to lean toward the artsy, imaginative, and different.  This movie was reminiscent of Frances Ford's The Black Stallion wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural.  Unlike those nature films, this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars (the cat) on the screen.This fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier (he is very nice too) lost on the Egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned Egyptian temple is mesmerizing.  I bought into it wholeheartedly. If you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace, beauty, power and sensuality of the feline, you should enjoy it.The only flaw in my book was the ending.  It was a perfect set up for a Romeo and Juliet finale - that would have taken me over the top. "},{"date":"26 January 1999","review":"  A very funny film from one of the gifted Farrely brothers. Great soundtrack, but have we seen this before? Yes, but we might not have laughed as much as one is likely to in Outside Providence. I saw this film after it had been roughly assembled and screened before a test audience at the University of Rhode Island. Fortunately for those who will rush out to screen it they are likely to see a completely different film from the one I witnessed. Rumor has it that an entire new ending was formulated due to the misgivings that my fellow testers agreed upon. After the final cuts have been made the film will no doubt have some very strong performances by the likes of Alec Baldwin and George Wendt which will contrast strongly with much poorer performances by some of the newfound talent that dominates this film? However, the clear winner will be the the music and humorous writing that almost equals much of the qualities found in There's Something About Mary.  "},{"date":"27 January 1999","review":"  I was only disappointed with the erratic editing sequence with Elizabeth prior to her addressing the bishops.  It's resemblance to Woody Allen film techniques was not very Victorian at all, and it was extremely jarring. Dissolves might have been better or even just voice-overs of broken attempts to formulate the sentences, while fluid motion on screen of her getting ready might have accomplished an underlying theme of the film.  It would have lent more to the idea of people in high authority positions, as Elizabeth was have a tremendous amount of conflict and confusion going on inside of them, but do not, or attempt to not let other people see them sweat.  Probably would've been more fitting.I really enjoyed the whole cleaning house sequence in the end of the film. Really reminded me of, but not near the caliber of the end of The Godfather, in which Michael Corleone rids himself of the obstacles, people though they may have been, that pose threats to his rule.  I say obstacles because their deaths were as cold as they come- with no room for negotiation; offers they couldn't refuse.The sequence at the end of the film with the whiteness, I saw as less of a virginity\/purity thing and more as her emulation of a white male (the whiteness coupled with the cutting of the hair) so as to illicit the maximum amount of respect.  Perhaps this is way off, especially considering the working title of the film was The Virgin Queen, I just found it interesting that in cutting her hair, she looked less feminine and perhaps, in the eyes of Victorian England, more masculine, and appropriate to rule the country.All together a very good film, with solid acting performances from Geoffrey Rush and especially Cate Blanchette, who with her Golden Globe nod, probably (and I believe, rightfully) forged her way to the front of the pack for the Oscar race.  And finally, not to spend too much time on the apparent, the costume, set direction, and score were extremely well done. "},{"date":"28 January 1999","review":"  What a fun movie!

It's not even pulling very good video rentals.  It now seems to me that one of the only thing that keeps any one (especially guys) going to Jennifer Love Hewitt movies is the possibility that she may have a nude scene in a R rated horror feature. Alas, she probably will never opt to do this, thinking she actually has talent as an actress. A good actress needs to evoke emotion in the viewer. While she is nice to look at, about the only emotion she's ever evoked in me is disgust at how dumb her character is in whatever movie she's in. I foresee either a career nosedive or a continued future on TV. I can't decide which is worse. As for the movie itself, I couldn't watch most of it because all I kept seeing was a board meeting of producers trying to figure out how to sell to a teenage audience. Apparently blatant stereotypes and annoying characters no longer pull in the kids like they used to. A John Hughes movie (though it shares some of the stupidity of those films) it ain't. "},{"date":"30 January 1999","review":"  This movie was funny in parts, and kudos to actors Ethan Embry and Charlie Korsmo.  The camera-work is also unique. But, the performance (dare I call it that?) of Jennifer Love Hewitt is cardboard, at best.  Another disturbing fact is that this movie tries very hard to imitate another, much more noteworthy film  Dazed And Confused.  The setting of the movie, (a big party on the last day of school) the way it wraps around to the next day, and even the tone of Can't Hardly Wait mimics Dazed And Confused.  There is also a direct quotation from D&C, identical in the way it is delivered as well.  (She was a hip, hip lady.)  I can see why many teenagers would enjoy this film, as it perpetuates all their fantasies about (the movie definition of) high school. "},{"date":"31 January 1999","review":"  I enjoyed 'Elizabeth' a great deal.  With these dark, violent and sex charged period pieces, I can ignore plot more than usual.  I loved the contrasts of dark and light. The sets and costumes were wonderful.  This is a very entertaining movie.The plot is fairly weak, particularly near the end.  Except for Walsingham and Dudley, I couldn't really connect emotionally with the characters. Elizabeth clearly invited sympathy, but as the plot worked towards it's climax, I found myself fairly distant.  There were too many themes, too may characters and too little time spent developing ideas.  What was the central issue?  Was it love?  Religion?  England? Survival?  I never could decide.Violence is an important element for 'Elizabeth,' but it is a bit too modern for my taste. At times, I felt the script writers had simply put 15th century clothes on a modern gangster plot and hoped no one would notice.I wish the movie had done a better job recreating the times.  Old fashioned period pieces seemed to focus on the way &#145;good manners' conquers all and I don't mind any movie that abandons that plot line.  On the other hand, I do respect movies that manage let us experience the past in a realistic way.For example, violence permeated every aspect of life during the Elizabethan era. The 'noble' leisure time activity for men was hunting down animals, with particular interest in dangerous varieties. It is hard for us to imagine, as moderns, just how important &#145;the kill' was to the 'noble' class. Hunting\/killing skill was the key measure of success for a &#145;noble' male. They didn't watch TV or read good books in their free time.If you found 'Elizabeth' intriguing, I strongly advise checking out 'Queen Margot.' 'Queen Margot' does a better job of portraying the ups and downs of surviving Elizabethan times.'Queen Margot' is a mid 90s French movie that covers a famous royal wedding in the Louvre where the bride's side decided to massacre the groom's side during the reception. If you visit the Louvre, you can walk down the hallways where the murders were performed. The massacre was predicated upon religious fears and thus connects powerfully to 'Elizabeth.'  In fact, the story covers the activities of Duc d'Anjou after giving up his attempt to marry Elizabeth. If you liked Elizabeth and want to get a more coherent view of the times, rent &#145;Queen Margot.'  It is not for weak stomachs, though.

Don't care who die, live alone is the worst thing in the world.   "},{"date":"2 February 1999","review":"  I knew Cate Blanchett had talent after OSCAR AND LUCINDA, but even I was blown away by her performance here.  Only Billy Bob Thornton in A SIMPLE PLAN, Gwyneth Paltrow in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN come close.  She captures the heart, drive, intelligence, vulnerability, and ruthlessness of the Virgin Queen.  I think my favorite scene is early on when she is summoned by her sister, leaves, and is afraid she's going to be executed by the soldiers around her, but instead bluffs her way past, overhears Norfolk chewing the soldiers out for letting her bluff her way through, and then laughs.  She deserved the Golden Globe, and I hope she wins the Oscar.The rest of the film is excellent as well.  I think some people were looking for a stuffy costume drama, but I liked how modern the technique was; all those dark rooms and moving camera shots added to the intrigue.  Geoffrey Rush may get a nomination for SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but he's much better here, trully Machieavellian as her closest and most ruthless ally.  I wasn't a fan of Kapur's THE BANDIT QUEEN, but this is excellent filmmaking.  "},{"date":"3 February 1999","review":"  Elizabeth I has always been one of my all-time favorite historical characters.While this film is visually stunning the historical accuracy rates a Less Than Zero.Cate Blanchett was amazing as Elizabeth -- truly an amazing performance; and the FACES -- the casting director had a field day -- (almost) everyone looked just the way I thought they should look.The sole exception was Sir Richard Attenborough...  He looked terribly out of place for some reason.One VERY annoying feature of the film was the constant shifting from VERY dark to VERY bright fades.  Also the fading not to a soft haze but just BLURRY.  The person sitting next to me took off his glasses to see if they were dirty or if it was his eyes.It was extremely distracting and added nothing.Also everyone looked just too darn clean. They all had perfect manicures and haircuts.This was an age when women wore puppy urine as perfume because it smelled better than their unwashed bodies.Bathing was an annual affair and soap, as we know it, did not exist.But, in spite of its faults, the overall look was magnificent.

I do not know if the director intended his film to be an exposition of the extremes of religious intolerance (still rife in India and other areas of fundamentalism as well as in Northern Ireland)but this film was a timely reminder that  our own history (I speak as an Englishmen) is littered with the corpses of those slain (sometimes horribly) because of their beliefs or those of their neighbours.  Kate Blanchett as Elizabeth was compelling, Geoffrey Rush was a chilling Walsingham (Peter Mandelson eat your heart out) and Joseph Fiennes was good as Leicester both cutting a dash and defeated at the end. Christopher Eccleston burned throughout the film as the driven but evil Norfolk and Amanda Ryan as Lettice Howard aka Lady Macbeth was also memorable in a relatively minor part.  See it. "},{"date":"5 February 1999","review":"  Very rarely can a director evoke so much awkwardness and kindness from his\/her silent moments in their films. Wes Anderson is one filmmaker who can. His characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain. Young Jason Swartzman gives a fantastic performance.  Even nicer is the surprise turn by Bill Murray, who manages to play a good guy and a villain at the same time. In one scene he  is wearing Budweiser boxer shorts on a diving board. He is smoking a cigarette and jumps, doing a cannonball into his sewer-ridden pool. We see him curled up at the bottom of his pool, drowning himself in misery. Is this a connection to his future lover's dead husband? Who knows. But what we do know is that Anderson has crafted his film to star the most unlikely of heroes. They are the oddest of the bunch, but at the same time we know what they are going through. Their oddness aside, what we learn to see more of, is their hearts. It is obvious Anderson has wiped his heart all over this piece, and it pays off more than I'm sure he ever could have imagined. "},{"date":"6 February 1999","review":"  It started off as a film about a professional student, detoured into an anarchic comedy, and never resolved a single issue. I couldn't tell if Bill Murray's character's wife was cheating on him, whether he was cheating on her, and why the English teacher did anything at all. And I would have slugged Max in the nose on a regular basis. This film did not realize its potential and wandered all over the place. In the end I didn't care about any of the characters and can't even remember how it ends.

If only they had underplayed it, or shown a degree of subtlety, then this might have been so much better.  Such a shame to see great old actors like Richard Attenborough embarrassing himself, and great younger ones like Christopher Ecclestone so over the top.  Joseph Fiennes is just bad!The most serious problem is that this movie is just tediously boring.  No plot, and nothing to hold my interest for so long.I can't see what the fuss is about this one, and think that the makers must consider themselves very lucky they got away with some acclaim out of this one - let alone their careers!

If you don't have a good reason for watching this film don't.The cast is undoubtedly fabulous and they all seemed to relish their roles.  The direction and production are technically capable or better.  The problems are the story and the screenplay.  The story is awful with too many essential points left unexplained.  A bit like the suitcase with the golden glow in Pulp Fiction, except there's no sense of wonder.  And the screenplay seems to pick up on the lack of wonder, as it is dry and banal.  The only reason I stayed until the end was that parts of the film were set in Dublin (which was fairly faithfully represented).

"},{"date":"11 February 1999","review":"  Larry Clark's version of Another Day in Paradise is very different from the book it was based on, and he did a lousy job directing and scripting his interpretation of the story, but it still is a powerful and distinctive film about the seamy side of drug abuse and crime.  None of the individuals, outside of the four main characters, are given more than cursory attention. They show up, fumble their way through a short sequence and disappear.  The scene where Rosie and Mel's nephew Danny help the injured Bobby appears to have been totally adlibbed.  Clark has said that he knew exactly what he wanted but that his cast did not.  Unfortunately, the lack of structure left a strong but incoherent final cut.There are so many laughable scenes that the strong performances by the principal actors are almost lost. The dialog appeared to be a pastiche of juvenile sex jokes, plot explanations thinly masked as conversation, and snippets from Eddie Little's book.  Mel is supposed to be a professional thief, but there is no evidence of this in the film.  The plot careens from one chaotic escapade to another interrupted by Mel blaming everyone else for his problems.  Nonetheless, Woods, Griffith, and Kartheiser provide emotionally intense and complex performances.  Natasha Wagner's version of Nadine in Drugstore Cowboy is more appealing than the original, but there is not much for her to work with.  James Woods takes over every scene he has with the other actors.  By default, the picture hangs on the quality and depth of his performance.  Melanie Griffith does a better job playing off him than Vincent Kartheiser, but both do an excellent job within the limitations of the script.Ultimately, Clark does succeed in providing a gritty drama about drug abuse and crime, because nothing is glamorized or hidden.  There is no grand denouement and no one comes through the film redeemed in any way.  The violence is real and unchoreographed,   the private cheap and vulgar actions of the characters are displayed,  and the only nobility present is fleeting and generally ineffectual.  Even with Clark's leering excesses, he still provides a more honest picture of this life than most of his contemporaries. There are certainly better films about addiction and abuse (Nil by Mouth for one) and Clark completely gutted a first-class book in order to tell his story rather than Eddie Little's, but the main performances and Clark's unsparing camera make Another Day in Paradise worth a trip to the theater.  "},{"date":"12 February 1999","review":"  Every once in a while a movie captivates me, even though I have some fundamental issues with it. Elizabeth is one such movie. It tells the story of Elizabeth I's coming to power, and her ensuing attempts to secure and consolidate her position.One of the first things you notice about this film is that medieval England was a very dark place. As the characters wander from room to room, the few candles (candles were very expensive and Elizabeth was broke) seem to create more shadows than light. If you ever visit a medieval castle or palace, you'll appreciate electricity and central heating like never before. Some of the scenes are reminiscent of old vampire movies, full of arches of blackness, and deep wells of shadow. The interior dark makes the few outside scenes, full of sunlight and green meadows, stand out in extreme contrast.Fortunately the cast bring their light with them. The performances are all very solid, and Blanchett is especially good. Dressed in dazzling costumes, the actors come across as real people rather than mannequins. The film's conflicts between Catholic and Protestant, and between various political factions, feel very real, very intense. The film has rightly been noted for borrowing liberally from The Godfather. The intrigues of the Pope are cast as the cutthroat maneuverings of a Mafia Don, complete with spies, assassinations, and paid informers. In this case, imitation is the highest form of flattery.The film also achieves a gritty realism in depicting medieval England. Heretics (non-Catholics) are burned at the stake; the castles seem dark and cold; and one gets the sense, as my friend put it, that it was a smelly place. This is not the sugar coated England of The Seahawk, that Errol Flynn classic, but the grubby, dirty world of Braveheart or Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The film's organizing theme is the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. Dudley is Elizabeth's lover, and their romance, prior to her coming to power, is full of charm, affection, and love. Their relationship serves as the primary bellweather of Elizabeth's changing nature, as she assumes the role of Queen.The growth of Elizabeth's sense of power and independence comes gradually, and believably. By using many subtle clues, such as her hairstyle, and manner of treating her advisors, we see this young woman become a powerful and dominating person in her own right. Her hair, for example, starts out as long, loose red hair. Later it is piled on top of her head in the manner of the court. As Elizabeth harden, it is cropped short and tightly curled. The Elizabeth of the closing scenes, white-faced, girdled, and grim is a shocking vision compared to the charming young princess of the film's opening.My primary dissatisfaction with the film is that we never get much sense of Elizabeth the politician. By all accounts she was a strong and shrewd monarch, but Blanchett's Elizabeth seems more lucky than good. The Machiavellan maneuvers that secure her throne seem entirely the work of her advisor Walsingham. The one decision Elizabeth seems to make is to approve the purge of many of her opponents. While it is true that her supporters were loyal to her family and religion, rather than her person, she seems more of a tool, a passive head of a powerful political machine.

Never having been a history buff, and preferring almost any other topic for a film, I was completely involved. Although the plot is simple, the film does keep one's attention with an excellent pace and breathtaking shots. The acting is excellent. Queen is outstanding. The costumes and scenery are fine.

I have seen every version of this story that has ever been filmed yet this was the best.  Joseph Finnes was more beautiful here even than in Shakespeare In Love.Elizabeth herself was cast to perfection.  The fabrics were sumptuous.  The castles were mysterious and monumental.  The scenes of sex were among the most lovely I have ever witnessed on screen.Although there were some grizzled scenes of torture and beheading, the scenes of beauty and monarchy were far more lasting in my mind.The story is confusing and the more one studies the actual history the more confusing the story becomes.  The Earl Of Leicester seems to have been the perfect cad\/charmer.  Elizabeth had his number but still could not resist him.  In the end she could listen only to herself and that seems to have been enough.  "},{"date":"17 February 1999","review":"  This was a major disappointment.  I couldn't wait for this movie to be over and that's a rare, rare reaction to a movie I don't like.  It's the one movie in recent history that I almost felt I should get up and leave.  The only reason I didn't was the high price of admission and the fact I had made a special journey into New York (dragging a friend along with me) to see it on a big screen.Cate Blanchett is wonderful, but she is surrounded by a movie gone astray. I don't expect an historical film to adhere slavishly to historical accuracy, but this screenplay pays only lipservice.  Elizabeth's own story is filled with the most wonderful drama, intrigue and romance. This film treated it as overwrought soap opera. It never takes advantage of the real words and events of Elizabeth's life.The film tries to do too much and never finds a cohesive story line.  Your left floundering with characters dropping in and out with little explanation of their importance.  Major characters such as William Cecil and Robert Dudley are badly cast and played even worse.  They little resemble the fascinating and intriguing actual characters of history.What a waste of the opportunity to bring Elizabeth's story to the big screen and get Cate Blanchett to play her too!

I've been a Malkovich fan (Well at least for the most part) since Empire of the Sun.  I've seen him dish out wonderful performances amidst poor movies, but what we have here appears to be the opposite.  I really liked this movie, but Malkovich and his terrible accent almost ruined it for me.  I can only imagine when this movie was being made the directors, producers, and all involved probably stood by, but didn't have the guts to tell Malkovich that his accent wasn't working.  C'mon, you can't tell me they didn't notice it. They should have said something, but I'm sure they didn't want to insult the great actor.  Some guys just command too much respect.  Like no one was going to tell Williams his Boston accent wasn't cutting it in Good Will Hunting. I don't know, maybe it was intentional.  Maybe Malkovich made this movie and did this accent just to see if anyone would actually say anything. He's probably sitting back and laughing about it with friends.  It was way too flagrant to be unintentional.  He was flaunting it for crying out loud. He even fell out of the accent at the end with that final outburst. Watch it again.  Either way I've lost a great deal of respect for the man.  No one should get paid that kind of money for such a ridiculous performance.

This movie was not a best picture nominee by any stretch, but was exciting, thought provoking and intense.  Woods, as always was excellent, and Melanie Griffith played her role to a tee.  This movie invokes musings about our own role models, and the true rewards of living a morally corrupt lifestyle.

Rushmore, the second film from writing team Owen Wilson and director Wes Anderson, proves that not only was the charm of Bottle Rocket not a fluke, but also that even the best can get even better. Watching Rushmore was an almost transcendent experience. This near perfect film works on every conceivable level, from the brilliant script to the incredible performances by all of the actors, all of which is directed with a flawless grace and style. Rushmore very well may be my new favorite movie. I can't wait to see what Wilson and Anderson come up with next.  "},{"date":"23 February 1999","review":"  As a student of Tudor-Stuart history, I was most anxious to see this film, and was able to do so in New York at Christmas, since it was not playing locally until recently.Elizabeth Tudor was one of the most fascinating and pivotal characters in the 16th century.  Her life was fraught with danger from the day of her birth until her death in 1603.  It needed no embroidery, no fabrication, no Hollywood excesses, but the screenwriters unfortunately seemed to feel that poetic license was required to lend interest.I felt that the treatment of Elizabeth was lacking  here was a woman fluent in six languages, a student of the sciences of the day, mathematics, and extremely well read for a man - amazingly so for a woman.  Yet she was portrayed as vacillating, unsure, and somewhat flighty, rather than the strong opinionated woman she in fact was.  Being in the shadow of the axe for the majority of her life had taught her to trust no one, and to rely on her own counsel.The love scenes with Robert Dudley were almost blasphemous.   Dudley was already married, the son and grandson of beheaded traitors, and NOT a candidate for the royal hand.I objected to the portrayal of Cecil as rather insignificant.  His guidance was essential to Elizabeth, both before and during her reign.  To religate this character to a minor role is a grave injustice.The suggestion of any English participation in the death of Mary of Guise is bizarre.Notwithstanding my concerns for the historical inaccuracies or liberties taken, I thoroughly enjoyed the visual spectacle of this movie.  The film was beautifully costumed and the cinematography was outstanding.  The dark tenor of the film was expressive of the period, and the depiction of the various palaces and royal houses was credible.  The acting was excellent, notwithstanding the weak character development by the screenwriters, and praises go to all the actors.I only wish that the writing staff had chosen to portray Elizabeth in a truer way, without embellishment and imaginary assassination attempts.

This movie is so timeless. The music and the overall feel is that it could almost be set in 1950..Some of the best moments are the quiet moments between Schwartzman and Murray.

Her and the rest of the cast basically wander through the movie aimlessley. The acting was terrible, mostly because of John Water's jumpy editing style. Conversations don't really match, hesitations are too long. The actors appear uncomfortable, as if they're being fed their lines through beltones. The movie's attempt to establish a plot turns out uninteresting and unrealistic, and Edward Furlong being cast in the lead role was a big mistake. He looks out of place in his role, and he's annoying (especially his voice). I personally didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them in the end. The only bright spots for me were Brendan Sexton III as Matt, the shoplifting friend, and Jean Shertler as Me-mama, the catholic granny obsessed with her Mother Mary Doll. Neither were particularly interesting characters, but they added some comic relief to an overall boring and seemingly endless movie. It's the longest 82 minutes I've ever sat through.

I did not like the way Matt Damon's girlfriend, was jumping to conclusions and making him into some gambler that he wasn't.  He clearly gave up that lifestyle for her. I was happy when she left. I think that Matt Damon was fantastic. It is pretty hard to believe that an actor can play a part as well as John Malkovich did. This guy is probably the most underrated actor that I can think of. The last scene is a classic, and in the mini rampage that Malkovich puts on is unreal.  To think a man with that accent played Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men.

In fact, Mr. Waters seems to be getting even better- his previous film Serial Mom was fantastic. Pecker is also good - I think it's his only film besides Hairspray that could appeal to a real audience as much as the John Waters audience. Some scenes go on too long, but the characters are so agreeable that you really won't mind. Plus, it's got two rats having sex! What else could you ask for?Full of grace! Full of grace! "},{"date":"2 March 1999","review":"  Born and bred in Baltimore- a denizen of Fells Point and a fan of John Waters for years, I really enjoy seeing his metamorphoses - I also like how he uses actors like Patty Hearst to spice things up--. Pecker is a film that moves along nicely and develops the characters well. My husband usually doesn't like him- (My best friend went to school with JW) but even he enjoyed this. Pecker and his family and friends are a strange but loveable lot.  It was nice to see Mary Kay Place again too. don't go to this expecting guffaws- just a pleasant film with oddities... of human nature.    "},{"date":"3 March 1999","review":"  This is not a history film, it is England in a parallel universe.  The film is enjoyable, and the motivation for Elizabeth's making herself a living icon of virginity is plausible.  But the true historical facts in the film could be listed on the fingers of one hand.One reviewer said that Walsingham was too Machiavellian to be real, but in fact he was like that, and more so.  He didn't kill Mary of Guise though.The real reason why Elizabeth never saw Robert Dudley alone was because he was implicated in the murder of his first wife.  He would never have betrayed her, and she loved him till his death.  The film took events from the whole of her life and crammed them into a short period.The costumes were good, the script nice and the backgrounds picturesque, but an Elizabeth like this would never have ruled a male dominated society for 45 years, as she did. "},{"date":"4 March 1999","review":"  The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was that I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie remotely resembling this one.  It is very hard to categorise and I can understand those people used to hyperbole in movies not getting this.  It is very understated with absolutely captivating characters.To categorise broadly, I would say it is in the same quirky, weird characters vein as a Coen brother movie (Fargo, Big Lebowski etc).My vote for best scene is when Bill Murray dives into the pool holding the bottle of scotch and is watched underwater by the kid.  Nothing really happens but infinitely captivating.  Sort of symbolises the rest of the movie.My if you liked these you will like this guide is - Any coen brother movie, Six degrees of Separation, As good as it gets. "},{"date":"5 March 1999","review":"  This movie really surprised me.  It was way better than I expected.  Great performances all around, even though Gretchen Mol could have been written out without affecting the movie.   Extra Kudos to Norton as scumbag Worm, Turturro as career gambler Cannish, and to Malkovich, who eats more scenery than Godzilla.  The dialogue is fast and full of more poker terminology than I could comprehend (I had to watch twice to figure out what they were talking about).  The movie's fatal flaw may be its terrible story (which I've seen a million times before) where good guy gets defeated, rests up for a while, and comes back to defeat evil.  Yawn.  What ever happened to the Good Old Days, where the hero was a total loser and didn't always come out spotless in the end (like Paul Newman in *The Hustler*, or anyone in any Scorcese film, for that matter)?  It's too bad that everything nowadays has to be Shiny Happy, or this movie could have gone from being good to great. Well worth a look, despite its flaws. "},{"date":"6 March 1999","review":"  I found this movie playing in a cool little theater in Bar Harbor ME. Had never heard a thing about it but it sounded fun. What a great time.  I can`t believe it hasn't gotten more attention.  Definitley worth checking out.   "},{"date":"7 March 1999","review":"  Come on. Stop being soooooo serious and enjoy this funny look at absurdist art world celebrity.  A Cinderellaesque rags to riches story of a local boy making good, via the eye of his thrift shop camera.  But do we really want to see ourselves reflecting back at us with all our faults and frailities?  Another Waters' feel good movie about celebrating our differences and making the world a better place, at least for as long as the party lasts! And if you don't like it, he'll teabag ya! Peace.  "},{"date":"8 March 1999","review":"  This movie is not a simplistic morality tale.  Is the main character a gambling addict, or is he just 'following his own path'?  I believe it is a combination of both.  However, the filmmaker does not make a 1-dimensional movie.  This added to the masterful performances of John Malkovich and Edward Norton makes Rounders an interesting movie, although not being familiar with poker (or whatever card games these people were playing) may leave the uneducated without a full appreciation.  Also, the film has a great score.  Though I would like to say that the set designers had a major lapse in judgment.  How does that couple afford that apartment?  On a non-cinematic level I harbor a latent resentment against gorgeous heterosexual males, and Matt Damon with his blue eyes and color-treated blond hair playing another self-sacrificing good-guy role (cross-reference Good Will Hunting) was a bit of a turn-off.   "},{"date":"9 March 1999","review":"  I'm a fan of costume dramas, so I was only mildly disapointed with Elizabeth. I found the dark period candle\/torch lighting to be pleasingly realistic (much more realistic than the historically innacurate plot). Generally, the acting was pretty competent, highlighted by the performances of Blanchet and especially Rush. Strangely, I found Joseph Fiennes a little miscast in his role, though I thought him superb in Shakespeare in Love. Without the benefit of reading the other comments on this site first, I was reminded a great deal of The Godfather during the scenes of rounding up and punishing the conspirators. As costume dramas go, I almost prefer Lady Jane, an equally historically inaccurate film that just seemed to come together a bit more cohesively and provide a bit more compelling story while being somewhat more entertaining. Still, I suppose it's a great deal better than most of the other dross on offer most of the time. "},{"date":"10 March 1999","review":"  In charting the odd career trajectory of auteur John Waters, I am always amused by how his later works have been lighter and somehow... friendlier than his trash classics.  Pecker is a thoroughly enjoyable trip through some of Waters' typical types of obsessions teabagging, pit beef, the irony that alcohol cannot be served at strip bars featuring complete nudity, Virgin Mary shrines, and much more.  Waters hangs his observations on the familiar story that once one is discovered and made famous, the compromises are sometimes too much for friends and family.  I enjoyed Edward Furlong as the title character, a budding photographer whose lowbrow shots are seen by a New York art dealer who thinks he is the next big thing.  Christina Ricci, as Pecker's laundry-mad girlfriend, is also delightful.  I have yet to be disappointed by the truly unique Waters -- I only wish he would direct more frequently.     "},{"date":"11 March 1999","review":"  This movie is a clear example of how trailers looked much more attractive than the film itself. The trailers show us how splendid the color and cinematography is, which is not always consistent through out the movie and in many spots, seemed unrelated to the plot. The trailer show us how intriguing the story line could be, but in the movie, it drags and not very well or clearly told. Two things bother me a great deal in the movie are 1.The opening credit goes on and on and on and well into the movie. It's so distracting. 2. The scene of Elizabath preparing the very important speech before meeting the Catholic priests was shot in a way with many re-takes. I believe the intention was to show us how serious and nervous she was. However, it reminds me of a TV commercial of opera singers started doing Rock &#145;n Roll on stage in the middle of a very classic performance. It's silly. "},{"date":"12 March 1999","review":"  In the fine tradition of films like Johnny Suede, this movie made me smile a crooked little smile from the opening shot to the final curtain.Let's hope this stays posted on IMDB for a while, because I want to look back at in in a few years, and remember saying that this is the type of film that I would like to make.  Not necessarily the genre or tone or anything so nearly tangible, but rather the entire feeling one takes away from it, and how the aftertaste lingers in me, inspiring me to bring my own work up a notch.Famous last words, or a brave new beginning, we'll have to see!  "},{"date":"13 March 1999","review":"  As many have predicted, when Oscar nomination time came around, this film was quickly overlooked.  Not surprising, though, this is not the type of film the Academy likes to give awards to.  Bill Murray is fantastic - he shows the depth of his acting ability as he does a fine job demonstrating the complexity of his character.  He is eccentric, humorous, greedy, lustful, jealous and fatherly, all in the film's two hours - and he does a great job at it.  Jason Schwartzman also does a fantastic job in his major motion picture debut.  Finally, Olivia Williams rounds out the lead trio with a touching portrayal of a character both emotionally sensitive, yet strong. There is humor is almost every part of this film, but it doesn't take away from a real plot with wonderfully developed lead characters.  Even the supporting roles are developed well and are neatly brought into the spotlight at various times throughout the film.  The director and the actors do a great job telling the viewer real stories about their respective characters, which help give us a full understanding of each one's complexity.  Not only are the characters complex, but they are also quite unique, which gives you a true respect for what the actors had to do to make their final coming-together seem realistic.  Under-rated and overlooked, this film is easily one of the best from 1998. "},{"date":"14 March 1999","review":"  EDtv is The Truman Show lite.  A product of the mass-media culture it pretends to abhor, it raises the same questions about media inundation and the decay of privacy, but with none of Truman's ingenuity.  Truman challenged the audience, while EDtv panders to the easily entertained.Like Truman, the main character is a man whose entire life is broadcast on television; the only difference is that Ed knows it.  In fact, he dimwittedly signs a contract allowing a film crew to document his every move.All of the clever wrinkles that made Truman one of 1998's very best films have been ironed out of EDtv for the sake of mass appeal.  Instead of Peter Weir, the Australian auteur who has puzzled and provoked audiences with daring films like Fearless, EDtv offers Ron Howard, the Hollywood pro who puts no personal stamp on his movies.  Instead of Jim Carrey defying expectations and expanding his range in a brave dramatic performance, EDtv gives us Matthew McConaughey doing what he does best, the only thing he *can* do being Matthew McConaughey.  Like Truman, EDtv features cutaways to loyal viewers, but unlike the delightfully quirky collection of Truman-philes, Ed's fans consist of a politically correct cross-section of America--an African American couple, a gay couple, a trio of Latino chefs, and a dormful of girls at the University of Iowa.What's worse, EDtv offers no subtext.  Truman was a multi-layered film Aside from commenting on the power of television to shape our views and dominate our lives, it also explored humankind's relation to God (if there is one) and questioned the implications of living in a created universe. EDtv contains nothing beneath its explicit surface message that the phenomena of instant celebrity and the destruction of privacy are B-A-D T-H-I-N-G-S.Ultimately, the film fails to engage the viewer.  Howard's slick direction and McConaughey's superficial acting turn Ed into little more than a genial presence on the screen.  Some viewers may care about what befalls him, but I wanted to grab the remote. "},{"date":"15 March 1999","review":"  This cute little film not only has an appealing (if typical) storyline, but is absolutely loaded with cameos from the hottest teen stars. I had to watch it several times to recognize everyone, but they're there Clea DuVall (The Faculty), Melissa Joan Hart (Sabrina), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions), Sean Patrick Thomas (Cruel Intentions) and Jerry O'Connell (Scream 2). The only one missing is Sarah Michelle Gellar, which is surprising since she seems to needlessly jam herself into a lot of films. Anyway, JLH and Ethan Embry are fabulous as the couple fated to be together, although Seth Green and Lauren Ambrose steal the show as the most unlikely and amusing pairing. Perhaps the best date movie in years.   "},{"date":"16 March 1999","review":"  This movie is a nightmare.  Nobody in the story reacted to anything. Somebody needs to warn this filmmaker that some audience members don't like clueless oblivious characters. Or maybe not, plenty of people seem to eat this movie up. But if you want to see a poor kid among the rich where there are some stakes, check out A PLACE IN THE SON.  If you want to see a misfit in a rich school, watch IF, or even ANOTHER COUNTRY. If you want to see a funny dork grow up, check out ANNIE HALL.  But if you want to revel in immaturity -- immature drama, immature understanding of character motivation, an immature sense of human reactions -- then RUSHMORE is for you!  If someone else forces you to see it, cling to the few over the top stage plays in the story supposedly created by the protagonist kid. They are just as unreal (and I don't mean surreal) as the rest of the movie, but they are production designed and shot in a way that makes them fun, despite the rest of the movie. "},{"date":"17 March 1999","review":"  I saw Desert Blue at the premiere at SXSW here in Austin.  It was great! Brendan Sexton did a great job with his character, and he was backed by some wonderful acting from the rest of the cast.  The best line of the movie I was trained as a navy SEAL. -Casey Affleck.  Watch for the makeout scene. A hilarious movie about a quirky small town with great characters ranging from the girl who's an explosives expert (Christina Ricci) to a guy who's the defending ATV racing champ (Casey Affleck...Kelly, this is Pete.  I'm number one!...and when my brother learns to drive, you'll be number three!!)  Definitely see this movie when it comes out in June!  I plan on seeing it at least three more times. "},{"date":"18 March 1999","review":"  I saw this movie four times, when it first came out. Three nights in a row, and then later in the summer. I can't tell you how much I connected with it. Not only is it the story of my life right down to the pop-tart thing- I swear to God, that almost the exact thing happened to me, with blueberry Bi-LO genera-tarts Add that to the fact that I had just graduated, and it takes its name from a replacements song, and I was lost in this film. I saw it with a friend that is just like Seth Green's character, it was weird.  It was one of those moments when you just wanted to stand up, in the theater and proclaim how much you loved a movie but we all know how cool that would come off. Nothing new, but definitely worth making. I'm sorry, but the angst of a teenage boy, is a story worth telling a thousand times over especially, when you are one. We've even joked about the Guns and Roses song, before. The last time I felt so connected to a film, was when I saw Mallrats. Even without my perspective, you should enjoy this movie. All these teen flicks should do, is keep you interested, and this one does. The more teensploitation movies that come out, the more I appreciate Can't Hardly Wait. I'll always remember this one as the most dead-on perfect movie for where I was in life, when I saw it.  "},{"date":"19 March 1999","review":"  An inspired choice of director for this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst on the scene with the budget-free tale of NY Dykes, _Go Fish_ brings a gently Jaundiced view to this tale of a Londoner choosing the slightly inappropriate milieu of a male bonding society to declare his lust for a fellow seeker of masculine truths. The highlight for me is a scene where the society try to revert to being primitive hunter-gatherers but end up ordering a take-away. The film as a whole is wonderfully acted and Troche, who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film, relishes the bigger budget by indulging in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with _Go Fish_'s grainy hyperkinesis. A really enjoyable film  "},{"date":"20 March 1999","review":"  Wow, there has never been such a great cast for a film who meets their potential head on.  Julianne Moore is stunningly original, and is worthy of an Academy Award nomination in this taker!  Glenn Close is also maginificent in this story of a suicide turned murder case in a small town in Mississippi.  An old woman dies in search of her recently deceased husband, and the prideful niece (Glenn Close) will do anything to save the family name from the shame.  Awe-inspiringly clever and unparalleled, no doubt deriven from a brilliant script and potentially extraordinary group of actors.  This is the first Oscar-worthy film of the year. "},{"date":"21 March 1999","review":"  Elizabeth is a perfect film. Some of the shots are the most well-blocked I've ever seen. A lot of my friends said that they didn't like the film's pace and that it has an anti-climactic ending. I disagree, but pieces of its plot structure were obviously borrowed ... from The Godfather -- another perfect film. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. (I hope that doesn't spoil it for anyone.)  "},{"date":"22 March 1999","review":"  I thought Elizabeth was so well done.  It made me want to go back and relearn my Elizabethan history.  I wish the movie could have gone on and on, I was sad when it ended.  It deserves Best Picture of 1998. "},{"date":"23 March 1999","review":"  The film portrayed The Golden Age as I always thought it would be. It portrayed gorgeous music, gorgeous costumes, and an essentially unblemished world.  Still, Elizabeth lacked credibility. Where were the physical and mental handicaps so common during the period.  What happened to the filth, garbage and rats.  Why weren't the characters infested by fleas and lice?  And for goodness sakes, why didn't the characters display a single wart?  What, indeed, happened to the pox? "},{"date":"24 March 1999","review":"  The reviews for this movie have been largely negative, but I'm not really sure why - for a horror film, it manages to come off with an original plot, brilliant photography and a soundtrack that catches the whole frontier-horror of the film perfectly. I was just happy that it didn't follow the conventional one-guy-picks-off-the-rest formula. See it alone, preferably during a matinee, and watch it for the photography alone. "},{"date":"25 March 1999","review":"  Rushmore is that kind of movie you just don't see enough of. In fact, it is kind of difficult to put a finger on, but from the opening until the end I had a smile on my face. Without a doubt, Rushmore is in my top 5 favorite flicks of the year. Rushmore was fantastic! I laughed more than I have in a long time. The key is that you have to appreciate dry, subtle, and deadpan humor. I assume you have all seen the film, so you know how great the whole Bill Murray poolside scene is. These kind of sight gags are what separate Rushmore from all the other comedies out there. The acting is superb, and the characters' idiosyncrasies are what make them so lovable. Max Fischer is blessed with a confidence many only dream of, and we become convinced that he could do anything he sets his mind to. The soundtrack is great too, having dug up many long forgotten british invasion groups that fit the film perfectly, like the kinks and 4+2. And Bill Murray deserves recognition for his performance. In short, I think that the majority of the US public has been subjected to low class, base, toilet humor for far too long, as is evident by those who hated this film or don't have the mental capacity to understand humor beyond fart jokes and semen in a woman's hair. Just look, There's ....Mary was a box office bonanza, while Rushmore is out of theaters in one month.That should tell you where America is at, and it should scare you too. Us Rushmore lovers need to stick together. For everyone else, it shouldn't be long before Adam Sandler cranks out another piece of garbage to quench your thirst. "},{"date":"26 March 1999","review":"  Can we please place a permanent injunction on improvisation in films? This movie, an incomprehensible hash of bored, shocking casual drugs-and-sex-and-violence and limp criminals-as-surrogate-family themes carelessly thrown Pollock-style across the screen, almost nudges The Daytrippers and (the worst offender) Blue in the Face as the most irritating example of shameful, self-indulgent cinematic improv.  Keitel and De Niro's sublimely playful guy-banter in Mean Streets has given way to a steady stream of desperately babbling pretty faces trying to fill silences with big emotion.  Of course, it isn't such a terrible problem if you have great actors, tight direction, and a strong story, which you don't here. Yes, James Woods is electric as always (though his mid-film transformation from role model to abusive dad is as annoying as it is baffling) and heck, I'll pay 8 bucks to look at natascha gregson wagner for 2 hours.  But as a movie, it's a joke. "},{"date":"27 March 1999","review":"  I haven't seen Bottle Rocket so my opinion of Wes Anderson as a filmmaker is solely based on Rushmore and what a wonderful film it is.Had it just been a cynical view of the ultimate outsider and his triumphs, it still would have been funny, but not nearly as resonant.  Max isn't an outsider because he wants to be, he just can't help himself.  He's a boy with too much potential, but without the resources to realize it. Initially, he plows through life saying and doing things without concern to those around him that he proclaims to care about.  He's heartless and cruel. It's only through losing all that he holds dear (Rushmore Academy and Ms. Cross) that he begins to evaluate himself.  He doesn't have any major epiphanies, or life-altering experiences, he just grows up.It's in the third act that you realize how thoughtful Anderson is.  I won't give it away, but the final scenes are both unexpected, and the perfect ending to a story that doesn't just reward the outsider, but shows how, when given a chance, he can enrich both his own life and those around him. "},{"date":"28 March 1999","review":"  Rushmore should become a cult classic, but is good enough to inspire something in the masses as well. A very well-casted, well-written and superbly acted story that is different from anything I have seen.Jason Schwartzman is great as the main character, determined to stay at his private school, Rushmore, forever; that is until he meets the woman of his dreams, Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). Bill Murray is classic, though not like he was in Stripes; more like he was in Kingpin.I just saw this movie again and have to say that the music selections are so great. I am buying the soundtrack for sure. I would recommend this movie to anyone (but not young children). It is unique and refreshing. "},{"date":"29 March 1999","review":"  A film about the relationship between a man and leopard that's very reminiscent of The English Patient, even down to a scene similar to when Ralph Fiennes' character carries the body of his lover across a desert-rock cliff.  In A Passion in the Desert, the main character carries the body of the leopard across a desert-rock cliff but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?).  Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the film is not perfect but a treat no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 of 10) "},{"date":"30 March 1999","review":"  As evidenced by the other comments here on this film, movies can make people believe anything.  I anticipated this movie was great excitement, only to leave the theatre appalled beyond words.  Do NOT believe what you see in this banal attempt to entertain.  Grammercy has the nerve to bill this, what could have been an amazing film, as historical.  Nobles were not killed en masse, Norfolk did not have that kinds of power over the court, Walsingham did not play seductive games with Mary (de Guise no less!), etc.  Even much of the costuming was wrong! Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush are all fine actors, I wish not to debate this.  But the facts are, history has enough excitement and fascinating stories, there is no need to embellish...or completely change...the facts. I beg people, pick up a book and learn the facts before praising this disappointment of a movie. "},{"date":"31 March 1999","review":"  With a cast like this, you know you're in a for a cinematic treat.  Patricia Neal should be nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Cookie. But, she is not the only one who turns in a superb performance.  The cast is full of familiar faces and Director Robert Altman has pulled every ounce of emotion from each of them.  You can identify with each character's feelings. It's that good.  I hope that it gets the needed media attention to make it a box office success.   "},{"date":"1 April 1999","review":"  Today I went to see this film for the second time.  I first saw this film in the second week of December 1998, after reading a short article about it. Back then, I was anxious to see the film starring the then unknown (to most people) Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes.  This time around, I was once again mesmerized by Cate Blanchett's performance as Elizabeth I, and I was enthralled by the film's stunning beauty (particularly its cinematography). The film itself seems somewhat flawed--I don't know why.  Yet, it's still an impressive and enjoyable film to watch.  The cinematography of this film is spectacular and unprecedented.  I love the use of bright light and of bold color in certain scenes  in the film.  My favorite scene in the movie is the moment when Elizabeth has just found out that her sister Mary has died, leaving Elizabeth to become the new queen.  That scene is probably the best example of the cinematographer's use of bright light and bold color...I love the look of the green color of the hills in that scene. But more importantly, this is Cate's film.  She's amazing in this, her star-making performance.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth I was brilliant.  I will always consider this to be one of the best performances ever. "},{"date":"2 April 1999","review":"  Though I expected it to be a lot better it was still good. It was a very funny movie. Especially Little Chrissy, who made the movie with her addiction to sugar, then Ritalin, then vegetables. She ends up snorting peas up her nose like it is cocaine. A very odd and at times has lame acting. But overall I give it an 8. For being very funny. I recommend this movie highly. Not John Water's greatest film but then again I have only seen 4 of his films. I liked Serial Mom better.

One of the best comedies of the 1990's, if not the best. The story of a boy, overachiever in everything but academics, and his unrequired love inside the school he sees as the whole universe, is as fresh as it is interesting.The characters are incredibly colorful and their emotions beliavable. Their dialogs, while quite odd at times, are carried with extreme naturality. And that's what makes the movie so funny. There's not enough praise to describe Bill Murray's performance as an unhappy millionaire who becomes the boy's partner and love rival.Rushmore is like nothing you've seen before. Yet the feelings behind the plot are universal.  "},{"date":"6 April 1999","review":"  Robert Altman gets wonderful performances out of a wonderful cast in this delightful, goofy, entertaining tale of murder (?) in a small southern town. Patricia Neal and Glen Close are aging belles and Liv Tyler is the free spirit who is the daughter of we are not sure quite whom.  Charles Dutton is an old family retainer and Ned Beatty a local cop.  All are splendid, as is Anne Rapp's witty script.  A languorous and altogether pleasant experience.

And rest of the movie...well, it`s SO basic plot. OK. Maybe (as a twenty and little more) I wasn`t the ideal watcher (this is more of a movie for people around 40`ties). And the movie is also way too long. At the end you don`t care what happens. Just that it ends! But I still say - Tom Hanks is good like always.

"},{"date":"9 April 1999","review":"  I saw this movie with limited expectations which were greatly exceeded. While the film started quite slowly, almost getting in the way of its own character development, in the end the pace of its early sequences mirror the pace of its small town Mississippi setting.  Once the characters were set, the movie took off as Altman seamlessly weaved the plotlines together until all was resolved.  Glenn Close plays a woman we all love to hate.  Liv Tyler is wonderful as the seeming bad girl, who turns out to have a heart of gold. Charles Dutton is outstanding in the most well rounded roles of his varied career. An excellent film! "},{"date":"10 April 1999","review":"  Actually, I didn't expect much from this movie, but Liv Tyler & Charles Dutton are such great performers that I really shared the whole feeling Altman tried to create. The story relies on excellent music (just as present as it needs to be) and smart art direction. Two regrets  Glenn Close is no more performing Disney's dog hunter. Still, she seems to feel it all along the movie. On the other hand, I felt at least 2 little ends before the real one. Prepare yourself to continue attending a new scene, even when everything tells you it's over... "},{"date":"11 April 1999","review":"  Charles Dutton, who appeared in one of Fox TV's more underappreciated shows (Roc) is always a performer to watch (see his uncredited performance in Last Dance) But Patricia Neal and Julianne Moore's performances are the ones to watch for here. Neal, in particular, surprised me, as she was never a particular favorite of mine, but was a perfectly cast Cookie.  "},{"date":"12 April 1999","review":"  Robert Altman has assembled a perfect cast, as usual, to tell a slow-moving tale of denizens of a sleepy southern town. Cookie's Fortune refers to Patricia Neal (Cookie) who lives with Charles S. Dutton (Willis) as her aide and confidante. The other characters, and I do mean characters, are the members of her family. Her niece is Glenn Close (Camille) who is fantastic as the most idiosyncratic of her relatives. Julianne Moore (Cora) portrays another family member subtly. She will be one of the great actresses of the coming years. Liv Tyler is Amy, Cookie's grand niece. If this sounds complicated, it is. But don't worry, it all comes together in the end. Other fine performances come from Ned Beatty and Chris O'Donnell as local sheriffs. Altman, as usual, has his eye on characterization rather than plot. However, his setting of the mood and the magical relationship between Cookie and Willis, and Willis and Amy are the warm core of the film. Count on Altman to have a few surprises in store, even though he sort of runs out of steam toward the end.  "},{"date":"13 April 1999","review":"  I can only echo the praise of other reviewers. I have already seen it twice, and plan to see it a third time. The last film I saw three times in the theater was The Age of Innocence. Bill Murray fully deserved an academy award nomination, and he was, in short, robbed'( though Coburn deserved to win).I will only note five features of this film that were little commented on, though I enjoyed them. 1. The excellent performance by first Hannibal Lecter, Brian Cox, as Doctor Guggenhiem.2. The  imaginative use of obscure British invasion  tunes (and Django Reinhardt!) on the soundtrack.3. The incredibly fluid camera work and editing-reminiscent of Scorsese at his best.4. The wonderful moment when Max tells Blume what his father really does for a living...that is when Max is, finally, redeemed.5.Finally, the dance at the end, which reminded me of the great finish to another film about frustrated genius, Eight and a Half.

Anyway I think that he just keeps getting better, and while this is a small movie, it is completely surefooted. I can't think of a single false note in it -- even the kid is good.It's a very low-key ensemble piece that manages to evoke the feel of a small Southern town (idealized, of course). The performances are all excellent, with the star being just wonderful.  "},{"date":"15 April 1999","review":" Robert Altman's films are always a gamble.  Either you get the focused Altman of `The Player', `M.A.S.H', or `Short Cuts', or you get the dreadful Altman of `Ready To Wear' and `Kansas City'.  What `Cookie's Fortune' reveals is a kind-hearted Altman. An Altman who wants to be a little silly and yet shows us his typical array of colorful characters. As with all the director's films, it's the actors that sell the movie best.  Like the aforementioned Andy Garcia, Charles Dutton is another actor of far-reaching talent that keeps picking crap to spend it in. With `Cookie', Dutton is used perfectly.  He brings a sweetness and gentle charm to the role, and with co-star Liv Tyler (also as good) the two share the best moments of the film. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Ned Beatty (who is hysterical), and - God help me - Chris O'Donnell all make such a wonderful collection of performances. I really enjoyed just watching these people.When the story kicks up, my interest waned a bit.  The end of the movie is this mosh pit of names being thrown around, it is all very disorienting.  It's mutes the film's final impact, which up till then was fairly solid. Basically it was just neat to sit and watch this simple story unfold in a wonderful location, and with a ensemble that knows how to have a little fun. After `Gingerbread Man' I was a bit worried that Altman was going to become a parody of himself. But if this is the new Robert Altman, I welcome the change.------------ 8 "},{"date":"16 April 1999","review":"  Went to see Cookies Fortune only because I'm an Altman fan, and I'm even more so now. Wonderful cast (we needed Lyle and the caboose, folks). Remember the tracking shot that opened The Player? I loved the way Willis himself tracked the opening of Cookies Fortune. Altogether a totally satisfying, totally put-together, funny, wonderful film. Thank you, Mr. Altman.  "},{"date":"17 April 1999","review":"  I hated the first 10 minutes of this movie because it was such an obnoxious advertisement for AOL and Starbuck.  I don't mind product placement in a movie if it's subtle.  This was terrible.But then, once the commercials were done, the movie became a very nice romantic comedy.  Yes it's a lot like Sleepless in Seattle but so what. It was fun.Why did they have to pollute the beginning with the ads?  "},{"date":"18 April 1999","review":"  There is a lot to like about Rounders. Edward Norton is the most original young actor around today. He has great energy and sets up some interesting problems for the Matt Damon character. The world of high stakes poker depicted in the film at times seems exotic, dangerous and for a while felt somewhat realistic. Yet, I felt unsatisfied with this movie.Good pictures about gamblers such as The Hustler (1961) and The Grifters (1990) tackle tough issues head on. Do you play by the rules and if not what danger are you in? How can you have a love life if you make your living this way? Compared to these films Rounders is gambling lite.Except for Edward Norton's role, I did not care very much about any of the people in the movie because we don't get a chance to know them. The film does little with the girlfriend or the other friendly characters and then there are the stereotyped bad guys.Rounders' biggest problem I chalk up to the Rocky Effect. After the Rocky films, most pictures that are kind of realistic or gritty had to have a Rocky type of ending no matter what the odds. At the finish of Rounders the story becomes so obvious, routine and unrealistic that it was almost not worth watching.Rounders had the elements to be good but typical formula plot twists spoil a promising beginning.  "},{"date":"19 April 1999","review":"  It's hard to believe a film this sunny came from Robert Altman, and is also this good, but there you go.  While I love some of his films, like M*A*S*H, MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER, NASHVILLE, THE PLAYER, and SHORT CUTS, there are times when I feel he has a fundamental contempt for his subject matter, like in THE LONG GOODBYE and POPEYE, and for his characters.  But while this movie, well-written by Anne Rapp, is essentially a Tennessee Williams drama turned inside out (Glenn Close's character is the only one who seems like a refugee from Williams territory), we instead feel a great deal for each of the characters.  Even Close's Camille, whose machinations end up in the temporary jailing of an innocent man for a crime that never was, is somewhat likable.When Altman is on, we really get a sense of community and place, as opposed to movies which are just a triumph of production design, and this is no exception.  The best example of this is how Lester(Ned Beatty), a deputy sheriff, sums up his reasons for why Willis(Charles S. Dutton), that innocent man referred to earlier, is innocent of killing Cookie(Patricia Neal); I fished with him.  In another movie, that line of reasoning would be ridiculous, but since you feel all of these people have known each other for years, it seems just right.  And the rhythms of the town feel right as well, so you don't feel like you're just watching a filmed set.Casting has always been a hallmark of Altman films, and this one is no different.  Charles S. Dutton is as good as they say, being more restrained than usual, Close shows great comic timing in her role, and Julianne Moore is very good as her put-upon younger sister, who has a lot more to her than meets the eye.  And Altman regulars like Beatty and Lyle Lovett are quite good as well.  The most surprising turns came from Liv Tyler and Chris O'Donnell.  I've liked Tyler before(in HEAVY, EMPIRE RECORDS, and THAT THING YOU DO!), but to imagine her with shorn hair playing a rebel who skins fish for a living was a bit much, to say the least, but she's utterly convincing. O'Donnell has always seemed too callow, but here he's quite funny as a deputy sheriff who's seen way too many cop shows.  And he and Tyler have nice chemistry together. "},{"date":"20 April 1999","review":"  Cookie's Fortune is Altman at his very best. Altman weaves a story in and among a motley collection of small town southern characters, which at the hands of a lesser director would become nothing more than caricatures of southern stereotypes. However in the hands of Altman they become real people, good, bad, or indifferent. Altman has always been known for his ability to weave multiple characters into a tapestry held together with just a touch of a story line and Cookie's Fortune is no exception. The plot is really just a framework, which Altman uses to support a profile of a small Mississippi town and showcase how its citizens interact with one another.Cookie's Fortune moves at a leisurely pace that may seem slow to someone who hasn't grown up listening to southern storytellers. The story weaves in and out of the lives of the residents of Holly Springs a small Mississippi community whose main industry appears to be catfish farming. We are introduced to Jewell Mae `Cookie' Orcutt played believably by Patricia Neal. She is the elderly matriarch of southern family of declining means, and is so believable that she immediately put me in mind of every great aunt on both sides of my family with a bit of both my grandmothers thrown in. We are also introduced to Willis Richard played by Charles S. Dutton in an Oscar worthy performance; he is Aunt Cookie's live in handyman. For the first half hour the film lets us get to know them and understand and love their relationship; a relationship that is quite similar to the one between Tandy and Freeman in Driving Miss Daisy. Then the film takes an Altmanesque turn when Cookie commits suicide so she can rejoin her husband who passed away some years back. This is where the plot of the film really begins.The plot of Cookie's Fortune moves at the same relaxed pace as we meet various residents of Holly Springs. Like a good southern tale told by a master storyteller, Altman lets characters come and go without feeling the need to explain their purpose in the story. For example, Lyle Lovvett's character in this film appears at the beginning as sort of a menacing person. At this point, traditional Hollywood film rules would normally dictate that he pop up later in the picture as a surprise bad guy. He doesn't, he just exists harmlessly on the periphery of the film as this guy who adds color to the whole story without having to play a traditional role of bad guy or good guy. He is like a real person just a guy Altman doesn't throw a character up on screen and say, `here is the hero look he is doing heroic things to establish who he is. And here is the villain look how evil he is, he just kicked a dog. Instead Altman lets his characters do there thing and their nature and purpose is revealed at its own pace, at the same time you learn their past as you would in real life, gradually in little snippets. The only criticisms I can levy at the film is that the ending is a little confusing and hard to understand. Too many revelations flow one after the other, and so much is revealed in the exposition that I had a little trouble keeping it straight. The other problem is Glenn Close. She is so effective in her role as a self-obsessed evil overbearing old maid that she is almost unpleasant to watch on screen.One performance that must be mentioned is Ned Beatty as Lester Boyle the small town sheriff. Beatty gives a beautiful and believable performance as a local deputy sheriff who is better able solve the crime better than the big city detectives, simply because he knows the residents of his town. In one scene Beatty is able to believably pronounce Charles Dutton's character on the basis that he has fished with him. A lesser actor would have had trouble selling a line like that, but Beatty makes it believable.Believability is at the core of what is good about Cookie's Fortune. Too often films set in the south portray southern towns as hot beds of racial intolerance and ignorance, populated with psychotics, criminals, and corrupt officials. Cookie's Fortune shows the true nature of a specific type of rural southern community without malice or condescension. It is one of Altman's best films, and easily his best effort since The Player. Definitely a must see for Altman fans and fans of southern fiction in the vein of Truman Capote, Oscar Wilde, Tennessee Williams, or Ferral Sams. "},{"date":"21 April 1999","review":"  Election has all the charm and edge of contemporary high school comedies, but rather than simply flattering teenagers with hip lies about themselves, this extremely well written and imaginative story combines realistic detail with intersecting neurotic fabulations--that of the overambitious, driven teen, and the under-achieving, midlife crisis-inflicted guidance counselor (played brilliantly by Matthew Broderick).  "},{"date":"22 April 1999","review":"  The first ten minutes of Rounders were excellent. We watch a poker stand off between Matt Damon and John Malkovitch that is really tense. I was really excited then, cuz I figured the movie would rule. However, the film's story doesn't provide for that type of pacing, and even though it loses that moment, it is still an excellent movie. Matt Damon, whose Good Will Hunting made him a star, proved to us once again that Best Actor nom was no fluke. Not that much prove was necessary. Eddy Norton, Martin Landau, and John Malkovitch even though his accent kinda sucked were terrific. As was Famke Janssen and Gretchen Mol and most of the other peformers. The only person who annoyed me was John Turtorro. It wasn't him, but the character. I really liked this movie, though. No one makes movies about card games. This showed the genius of it. However, even though I am a poker player, the terminology can be confusing. "},{"date":"23 April 1999","review":"  This mess of a film was bad until the very last scene when it became ridiculously bad.  The bad guy walks (not runs) after his victims. And shouldn't the title be I Still Know What You Did THAT Summer?  The title to the third installment should be I Sort of Recall What You Did That Summer.  And the one after that should be I Completely Forgot What You Did That Summer But I Still Want to Kill You.

Revel in the characters who people the town of Holly Springs.  Savor the details in the set decorations. Cherish this little gem. Lyle Lovett stands out in a (mostly silent) role that's almost a cameo. But everyone is terrific, although Glenn Close plays the character of Camille almost -- but not quite -- over the top and too broadly. "},{"date":"25 April 1999","review":"  Election, though not a film receiving excellent press or publicity in the shadow of the Phantom's Menace's release, could quite possibly be the best satire seen so far in 1999. The movie bears a striking resemblance to the allegorical Primary Colors, invoking all the cynical and disturbing references to the American political culture. Indeed, as the story is set in a Middle-America high school, where convention is the norm, here it seems is the best place to demonstrate that no place is safe from dirty pool.Each scene is rife with some perverse allusion or innuendo. The actors all cultivate the appearance of victims while being predators to each other. Director Alex Payne has taken all that we as Americans hold dear about democracy and subjected it to our inner fears. The result is hilarious, disturbing, and ultimately too familiar. That being said, Election deserves the classification of satire as much as any movie certainly in this decade.  "},{"date":"26 April 1999","review":"  I've seen almost every film John Waters has made, and Pecker ranks among the bottom third.  There is little here that is interesting, shocking, or funny. The characters are typical Waters' white trash, but they, as well as Waters, seem to be merely going through the motions.Maybe I'm just jaded since my introduction to John Waters was a double bill of Pink Flamingos and Desperate Living 15 years ago... "},{"date":"27 April 1999","review":"  When I saw  Cookie's Fortune commercial it instantly registered in my mind as a must-see. I liked everything about this 3-min `leader'. Altman is one of the best US directors. His individual voice, unyielding to the pressures of market,  deserves respect and excites high expectations. I really love some of his movies  --  Short Cuts and The Player first come to mind.In this commercial I saw Glenn Close in a part that could give this terrific actress on opportunity to shine. It looked like it had good plot, a sound mixture of interesting character studies, social observations, etc. It promised to give you a satirical depiction of provincial life, combined with warm optimistic note of good people prevail and the system works.So what went wrong? It was unbearably boring!!! Nothing worked. Good actors were creating realistic and sometimes funny characters, the plot line was moving along, Glenn Close was in her Cruella De Vil mode and shining. Nothing went wrong, except that it was unbelievably slow, predictable, illogical, syrupy, and, from time to time, plain stupid.  All comedic elements were overused and beaten to death. I've seen already quite a few dumb but good cops, talentless but devoted amateur players, horny young men jumping on horny young women and copulating obsessively, unable even to unbuckle their belts, etcetera ad infinitum.It was a huge load of dusty cliches, coming from the director who used to make fun of those cliches. This was really sad.The audience seemed to enjoy the movie, at least nobody were leaving. I was bored to death. When in the end the authors threw in some revelations about the character's past, it did not change anything, just increased my bewilderment.I would compare my disappointment with Cookie's Fortune with the similar one I had a couple of years ago when highly acclaimed and Academy decorated Slingblade left me baffled in a similar way what did people see in that boring stupid movie that I did not?All in all I am capitally disappointed. It is one of those movies that you'd better enjoy it's commercial and keep it indefinitely in your list of possible future video rentals. At least you'll have the advantage of the FastForward button!  "},{"date":"28 April 1999","review":"  I have read with growing consternation the positive reviews and user comments for this film. For the record, Glenn Close's over-the-top performance is depressingly debilitating to this film. Honesty in this role would have made the film (perhaps) ultimately touching and moving. As it is I had to restrain myself from actually yelling at her on the screen to just go away - or perhaps for Chris O'Donnell to shoot her. The plot, of course, makes no sense. Willis, Cookie's companion, is held for Cookie's murder - even though the fake trail at the house is obviously breaking and entering. For God's sake - Willis lives in the house. Even the stereotype stupid bozo Mississipi sherrif's in this film could figure this out. And do we really nead to see Chris O'Donnell jumping on Liv Tyler constantly - it's dumb, just plain dumb. This is a film made by a great American director who is obviously lost as we approach the 21st Century. The film is feebly plotted, and a clone of all sappy, patronizing films about those zany, eccentric Southerners. I lived in the Deep South for 18 years, and I can promise you these Eudora Welty-ish characters are in the minority.If the entire film were made up of performances of the reality and dignity of that given by Charles S. Dutton, this film might have been very different.Put a bag over this one.

While I was watching Cookies Fortune I completely lost myself in another world that was peopled by extraordinary characters. The performance of Patricia Neal was beautiful and Ned Beatty was a joy to watch.  I totally fell in love with Willis, superbly played by Charles S. Dutton. It's possible that this movie meant so much to me because I am a native Southerner and have known people like the characters in the movie. "},{"date":"1 May 1999","review":"  I saw Cookie's Fortune only because it was the only film I could get into at the local multiplex (everything else was rated R), but I'm very glad that it was.  It's probably my favorite of all the Altman films I've seen.  By the end of the movie, you feel like you've known the characters all your life and you've lived in Holly Springs since you were born.  All the performances are great.  Liv Tyler, who irritated me in her other roles, proves to be very likable and talented.  And unlike a lot of cynical and dark pictures I've seen recently, this one has its heart in the right place (another commenter called it sunny, which is really the perfect adjective to describe the film).  Seeing this movie was a warm, delightful experience, and I suggest you go out and experience it too. "},{"date":"2 May 1999","review":"  Seeing the excellent film, Elizabeth, answered one question I had but left me with another. Elizabeth shows that a reasonably accurate historical dramatic film can be interesting and even exciting. This story in a way is a feminine contrast to Braveheart. Instead of blood and guts and nonsensical romantic situations, Elizabeth is always intelligent, subtle and clearly shows without distorting history that as a leader Queen Elizabeth was at least as capable as any man. I very much liked the director Shekhar Kapur's stylish use of having the camera look through gauze and scarves; an excellent metaphor (about people never being seen clearly for what they are) for the deception and conspiracy that surrounded the young Elizabeth. The sets, costumes and supporting cast are also top notch.My unanswered question is how could Cate Blanchette not have won the Academy Award for this role? This mystery about the Academy goes back a long time. For instance, have you ever seen a movie starring the actress Judy Holiday? I doubt it. Yet Ms. Holiday won the Academy Award in 1950 the same year as these two fantastic performances, Gloria Swanson (Sunset Boulevard) and Bette Davis (All About Eve). Incredible. Now, I have already praised Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love. Paltrow is developing her craft and may be a great actress someday but Blanchette is already there. Her acting in Elizabeth ranks with any female performance of an historical character on film.Simply, Blanchette makes a good movie a great one.  "},{"date":"3 May 1999","review":"  John Waters is a genius!  Not only has he been successful at the box office but has managed to squeak out a few films that fall into the 'Art Film' category and are still funny.  Pecker is one of his art films and is a real hoot. In the film the title character is one of those movie stereotypes, a guy who is known and loved by everybody in his neighborhood.  But then you realize that everybody else is a kind of stereotype, happy people.  The characters are all pretty two dimensional but that's OK when its intentional and it really does make them funny. So Pecker goes around taking pictures of all of these happy people who are thrilled to see their pictures at his first art show which just happens to be on the walls of the sandwich shop where he works.  Of course, a New York gallery owner walks in and 'discovers' Pecker which means fame, fortune, and ridicule of his neighbors by the outside world.  Of course this now makes all of Pecker's neighbors unhappy! The ending is pretty 'John Waters' but carries a nice message....Screw you! I don't need your permission or approval to be happy!!! "},{"date":"4 May 1999","review":"  This is not your mother's costume drama.  From the very beginning, when the opening titles run over a psychedelic montage of religious iconography, you know that something different is happening here.and it isn't Masterpiece Theater.  Dark and brutal, lurid and violent, this film unfolds like bloody flower.  Religious intrigue, political machinations, sexual scheming--it's like an Umberto Eco novel.  Cate Blanchett is an astonishing actress, a truly startling screen presence.  She inhabits the body, mind and soul of the Virgin Queen with an ethereal grace underlain by steely resolve.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth's inevitable transformation from a clear-eyed, idealistic girl with love in her heart to a coldly practical monarch who will be married always and only to England is heart-breaking--all the more so as the practicality is born only out of absolute necessity.  Joseph Fiennes is dark and brooding, smolderingly sexual as the poor, sincere, doomed Lord Robert, who does all the wrong things for the right reason his love for a girl who has become a woman.  But that love is returned to him by a woman who has become a queen, and, as Robert himself says, That love could corrupt the soul of any man.  In the end, Robert's corrupted soul undoes them all. "},{"date":"5 May 1999","review":"  A combination of Southern gothic and comedy...sounds impossible but Altman manages to pull it off.  Cookie (Patricia Neal, looking TERRIBLE!) commits suicide.  Her witchy daughter(?) (Glenn Close) tries to cover it up and make it appear a murder.  Unfortunately this implicates Cookie's live-in handyman (Charles S. Dutton).  Then things get complicated.The cast is great, especially Close.  Even Chris O'Donnell (who's usually just very cute and very bland) is good.  Altman tones down his usual hatred of women (although he treats Julianne Moore here almost as badly as he did in Short Cuts) and turns out a pretty good film.  There are a few complaints Why did he do this?  This is miles away from his previous work. It seems like he enjoyed working in the Deep South so much with The Gingerbread Man, that he decided to do it again.  Liv Tyler's character is criminally underdeveloped (she's still quite good). Seeing Patricia Neal so old and infirm was scary.  And I never thought I'd see product placement in an Altman film!  (If 1 more person had asked for a Coke or if there was another shot of the Coke machine in the police HQ, I would've screamed!) Not great Altman (that's Nashville and MASH), but not bad (that's Ready to Wear and the godawful Popeye).  Hopefully next time he can move out of the Deep South and stop the product placement. "},{"date":"6 May 1999","review":"  When I went to this film, even the females that came didn't like this, how can anything which has the same actors and director, only more modern keep anyone interested.

"},{"date":"7 May 1999","review":"  When one writes a biting satire, it logically makes sense that the person who is insulting should know his or her topic.  This is why high school life has never truly undergone an appropriate cinema vision.  We either get The Substitute or High School High.  Either way, it's a sad collection of overdrawn clichés that don't work anymore.This is where Election drawns it's thin line.  Every character in this movie is a person (or persons) that you know.  We've all met a Tracy Flick, Paul Metzler, or had a teacher like Jim McAllister.  Although each character may be taken to extremes in this movie, you feel for them cause you know them.Hands down, Reese Witherspoon has proven herself an incredible actress. She can play all the roles she wants, without typecasting herself, be it school slut(Pleasantville), innocent virgin (Cruel Intentions), or, as Election shows, Conniving Overachiever.  This may be her best role yet as she makes you both hate and love Tracy.  You can't stand the fact that what would be typically a very flat character has so many levels to her.  It's so refreshing.Matthew Broderick is the most underrated actor of our time.  He needs recognition already!  And don't give me any of that Ferris Bueller and Glory stuff.  And don't mention Road to Wellville and Godzilla either. For such a horrible person as his character tries to be, you can't help but feel sorry for him because he fails at everything and you know that streak just isn't gonna stop.I will confess, I am a gifted student in my high school, and I know a lot of Tracy Flicks.  My classmates are Tracys.  My best friends are Tracys.n In fact, I'm a bit of a Tracy myself.  So this movie was so refreshing cause it was so accurate.  Right down to the clubs she was in.  And several of my teacher's are McAllister's too.  Giving all their time to the school and then getting nothing but gray hairs in return.  It's really quite sad.As for the writing and directing, I'm no expert, but the odd way of telling the story through 5 or 6 different character's and yet also from an omnipotent point of view, just may be the funniest thing ever.  What a work. Freeze frames, little notes on the screen, stock footage...I want to see more works like this.  This is great movie making at a new point of finesse.Bottom line is this school has never looked so real on the silver screen. MTV Films needs to stay independant and stay in the present (to avoid any 200 Ciggarettes disasters again).  I swear, this movie is practically a real life documentary.  Even the bathroom pass made of wood that Tracy has rings true.  At least to me.  But then again, exiting the movie you seem to learn something about morals and ethics.  Maybe we all have a little Tracy in us after all. "},{"date":"8 May 1999","review":" Election This is what high school films should be  not about high school.Alexander Payne's new film is a real treat to watch - at times. A funny, but plausibly impaired, comedy that begs the audience to think for itself.Matthew Broderick might be a dream on the Broadway stage, but lately the film career seems to have been working against him.  With Election, Broderick proudly returns to the performances we all love him for.  As a sex-starved high school teacher, Broderick and Payne make sure to form the character about as real as cinematically possible.  This is a comedy, but Broderick does a great job showing the character's many colors. Reese Witherspoon is no favorite of mine.  Repeatedly, I have winced at her performances.  She's certainly one of the least talented of her peers. Yet this film actually asks Witherspoon to stay within the confines of a character.  She does a nice job as Tracy Flick - perpetual overachiever. She plays with Broderick well, and she creates a memorable performance. The real star is director Payne.  With Citizen Ruth, Payne displayed a rare gift for satire and originality.  Election continues this streak with inventive camerawork, bright performances, and a distinctly sour screenplay.It's nice to see typical characters like the high school jock (a wonderful Chris Klein) and the blossoming lesbian treated with a slight spin.  They turn out to be the two sweetest characters in the whole movie. It's also nice to see actors and extras with imperfect beauty.  Zits, bad teeth, scary hair, it's all delightfully here. What makes Election quickly turn ugly is the refusal to end.  The movie has about 19 climaxes, 18 more than it needs.  I wasn't fond of the resolution of the film, only for the movie to take forever to finish. I doubt we needed such a lengthy summation. It damages the film's final impact. Payne has a bright career ahead of him.  I look forward to his clear vision in the future.----------- 7  "},{"date":"9 May 1999","review":"  This movie can't have been very  popular with the cineaste wannbes who've been chuckling knowingly  over Waters' work for 25 years  only to find out in this movie  that they never knew anything and  the chuckle's been on them all  along.

It is well known that he lets the actors have free reign, and in this case, that's not for the best Glenn Close has found interesting mannerisms, but her performance is over the top; Patricia Neal and Charles Dutton work together as if they were onstage somewhere, and Every Line Is Pregnant.  Lyle Lovett is awful -- why does Altman continue to hire him?  He only worked in THE PLAYER, and that was just at times.The camerawork here is shoddy, and some scenes are staged as badly as a high school play.  Other times, a camera cuts quickly to an inappropriate close-up, giving a weak line (or line reading) too much weight for its own good.Liv Tyler, however, does very well.  The one moment of authenticity throughout the film is the scene with Dutton on the police station's stairs. Something very real happens here, and it makes the viewer long for when an entire Altman movie hit such emotional honesty -- McCABE AND MRS. MILLER, NASHVILLE, even THE LONG GOODBYE.  Sorry.  This film is as fake as the stupid bit Tyler's character has to do with her truck -- parking on the sidewalk, getting a ticket, crumpling it. Hogwash.

"},{"date":"13 May 1999","review":"  I went to this film not knowing what to expect, in which case my expectations were not very high - this was a good thing.  This movie fell very short of anything to be even remotely expected.  There was not one character in the whole move, with perhaps the exception of the lawyer, who's IQ would even register on a pez despencer.  Near the conclusion of the film one can also notice that the Boom mike found it's way into the frame several times.  If you've got some time on your hands then see the movie, but not in the theatre - you'll feel like your money was stolen. "},{"date":"14 May 1999","review":"  Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive, is the theme of Robert Altman's deliciously funny -- and telling -- Cookie's Fortune.  Nobody does a better job of investing unlikable characters with humanity and unconscious humor than Glenn Close. The film is a study of the problems that Camille's deception create, both for others and herself.  This is a warm and appealing film that is filled with fine performances; it is the best from Altman I have seen in years.   "},{"date":"15 May 1999","review":"  Choices- this is what distinguishes Election from the spate of teen comedies and failed satires to which it has been compared.Unlike the majority of films today, Election hasn't been homogenized to make it more palatable to general audiences.  This isn't a high school in the vein of 90210, the actors wouldn't make it in Tommy Hilfiger ads. Shot almost entirely on location, it appears that almost nothing was changed- no repainting, building or reimagining of the buildings, no designer outfits for the actresses, no extras from central casting.Alexander Payne carefully injects the venom of the script, employing a smattering of techniques  aspect ratio, stock footage, freeze-frames, titles, split-screen, camera angles and framing.  The narration, intermittent and from several characters, is the most effective in a movie since Badlands, serving as ironic commentary (as opposed to unnecessary summation  ie, Gattica).  Thanks to these elements- and owing a debt to some superb editing -the film's multiple points of view enhance rather than detract.Election is more than a great high school comedy, though- it's an indictment of hypocrisy as lived out by middle America.  None of the characters are fully conscious of the consequences of their actions, and they all pay a price for being so oblivious.But something about the movie, brilliant as it is, troubles me.  While it does retain sympathy for its characters, my suspicion is that the audience is permitted to feel superior to them.  Election seems to be a confirmation of, not a challenge to, common perception and stereotype.  Waiting for Guffman, another brilliant film, gave me the same feeling, Both movies produce in their audiences laughter derisive and, ultimately, dismissive of their characters.Still, not since Guffman can I remember being so wonderfully uncomfortable at the movies.  Election is, at once, terrifically shrewd, splendidly funny, eerily sad. "},{"date":"16 May 1999","review":"  I never ran for student council, but I had friends who were in it. I'm glad I never partook of such madness. What Election can show the world, is a portrayal of raw teen emotion and biting satire so on-the-money, you'll think it was written by teenagers with adult shells.I quite enjoyed it's novel approach, and by that I mean it's story telling structure resembling that of a novel. Freeze frames with voice-overs hold the moment so we can reflect on it in retrospect with our characters, delve into the history and pick up our story later on.Reese Witherspoon shines as the outrageous Tracy Flick, the psychotic over achiever who seems to want nothing more than to be high school student council president. A clever sound effect is employed each time Tracy begins to lose her temper, giving us the feeling she's capable of anything in revenge. I never knew anyone remotely like her character, but if I should meet someone like that, I most certainly wouldn't take the time to get to know them better, but rather put some distance between them and myself. Having said that, I'm sure there are a lot of Tracy Flicks out there, with low self esteem and a confident, self assured veneer.Matthew Broderick's character is more realistic and therefore more engaging. He plays his part to near perfection. I unfortunately found myself wondering if the gray hairs added in were indeed fake, or simply let out for authenticity in the role, as Matthew does seem to be getting older.For teens watching this film, don't worry, it'll soon be over. You'll laugh about how stupid things were in high school soon. For those of us who jumped that hurdle already, we're laughing at Election now.

MTV helped produce two of the worst movies of last year--The Waterboy and Varsity Blues.  How could this be good? Well, I was shocked.  This is an ADULT, VERY black comedy about teenagers, teachers and school elections.  Yeah, it's sick and yes, they make jokes about adultery, statutory rape and lesbianism, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh.  Also the cast was excellent.  Reese Witherspoon was, by turns, funny, frightening and sad--just like a typical teenager.  Matthew Broderick was totally believable as the teacher.  Still, he's played this victim role once too often.  Let's see him try something different--like a villain for once.  So, great cast, believable story, sick humor--this might be too much for some people, but I loved it! "},{"date":"20 May 1999","review":"  I just saw this film tonight at the Seattle International Film Festival, and was very favorably impressed.  I think, while it's not a great movie, that it's a very good one, and well worth seeing. *** The title is a bit misleading, in that there is a lot more lost than innocence in this movie.  There is loss of life, loss of control, loss of personal focus, loss of illusion.  And while there's a lot of innocence lost as well, it's not just sexual innocence.  In fact, if the title were just plain LOSS, it would fit perfectly-- though admittedly it wouldn't sell as well! *** The visual style reminds me of Bergman's *Wild Strawberries*, as does the constant interleaving of various time periods.  This is a tale told visually, rather than with narration or dialogue.  Figgis is no Bergman, but he succeeds to a very large extent.  The only fault I find is that the Adam-Eve symbolism is rather heavy-handed.  Other than that, this is excitingly different from the ordinary, and should provoke lots of discussion. "},{"date":"21 May 1999","review":"  I loved it.  While watching the movie, I was taken with Reese Witherspoon's facial contortions, the sweetness of the football player, the iconoclasm of the sister, the self-deluding idealism of the teacher.  I could identify with them all.  And I particularly appreciated that each had a sympathetic side, as well as an over-the-top aspect.  At first I thought too much was crammed into the movie -- and it did continue just a little too long.  But I keep thinking about it.  Why do we all hate the kid that is so eager to answer the question (even if we respond the same way ourselves)? When is it OK to sabotage what is our perception of evil? Does any of it matter?  "},{"date":"22 May 1999","review":"  Yes, I know that this is a walking contradiction of a movie, but it still should be seen by everybody.  This is almost what not to do with a movie. I am not so callous as to say that I did not laugh, but I did not laugh much. I think that some parts dragged, and some other scenes were forced.  When the movie was not totally focusing on their neuroses, or taming those down with others' neuroses, is when this movie shines.  Otherwise, it should be thrown away.  For instance, when Goldie Hawn, and Steve Martin lose it to the line of Give me a break, it seems that they are even tired of it by then.  However, they have real chemistry when they are surrounded by nymphomaniacs.Acting Only John Cleese shines in every single one of his scenes, which are too few.  Sure, it is a rehash of his Fawlty Towers character, and it seems totally Pythonesque, but he always makes it work. However, Hawn and Martin have never seemed worse than in this movie.  They only click in a couple of scenes, and they only clash in a couple of others.  The rest of the screen time together is exactly that, they see each other, but as friends, not as lovers, and so their tempers and emotions never quite go to extremes because they realize that they are just acting.  Good actors become their roles, or at least seem like it.  The only times that they really click is the scene after the mugging, and the scene with the nymphomaniacs.  Otherwise, they are just blah.  Tim Robbins had a nice cameo, and I think he was better than the main characters.Plot\/Script I came out of this movie feeling like I had seen this movie before, and it was very familiar.  I have never seen the original, and never want to.  They took bits and pieces from popular movies that people have laughed at, and tied them together with a flimsy, rehashed plot.  Planes Trains and Automobiles seems to be the biggest influence in this movie. The writer never knew exactly what to have the characters say, and his slapstick was very inappropriate.  In a comedy, one of these characteristics need to be present.  He also thought that he should make the characters as dumb as possible.  Getting mugged by Andrew Lloyd Webber, give me a break. I feel that the characters were very superficial, and stupid; but sometimes they were very scheming and quick.  I think that Hollywood needs to make new movies, not adapt movies from novels, plays, or especially OTHER MOVIES. How blah and unoriginal.This is a movie that appeals to older folks, and is aimed at the lowest common denominator.  However, the old folks feel insulted, and the LCD goes to see movies that are better like Star Wars, The Matrix, and Go, all of which were much better than this movie.  I have seen teens of the LCD buy tickets to this movie and see another.  I have also seen teens skip buying tickets to this movie to sneak in to another, in case they are forced to watch this drivel.  But, see this movie for what not to do, and for John Cleese.  But, even he couldn't save this movie enough for recommendation----------4, "},{"date":"23 May 1999","review":"  John Waters has been called the master of trash cinema. Pecker, his latest, is trash cinema well done. Waters characters seem oblivious to the outside world and they are proud of it. This film is full of interesting characters, characters that are just being themselves. I especially enjoyed Pecker's father and his girlfriend played by Christina Ricci. Pecker's mother is also very interesting, because even though she seems off center, she is always lending a hand to the homeless. John Waters isn't afraid to offend anybody and that makes him a cinematic artist. Pecker is one of his better films.

Maybe you can introduce John Waters to the uninitiated among your friends or whatever.  I know he doesn't like to make movies over 90 minutes long, but I felt that this one could have been a little more fleshed-out, if you will.  Add some extra scenes, maybe more of Christina Ricci, who is underused, imho.

I read the first ten comments or so and was pleased with what I saw; therefore, I expected wonderful, or at least good, things from the film.  I was disappointed.  To be fair, the portrayal of high school antics was mildly amusing, but the humor was too blatant for my tastes.  Nothing was left up to the imagination, nothing was a surprise, and all of it seemed a bit convoluted.  The storylines were rambling and seemingly without end.  The links between the elements were disjointed and frankly, uninteresting.  I would have appreciated something that required a little more thought to comprehend, simply because I entered the film with hopes of novel wit and sarcasm.

"},{"date":"27 May 1999","review":"  I can't remember being more puzzled by any film. Just what is the plot, purpose or message, if any? Election appears to be nothing more than a string of porno clips pasted together, with the actual 'election' merely a speed bump in the bed-hopping. What we see is the beginning of a semi-interesting theme, with three very eclectic individuals running for the office of student council president. But instead of developing that plot, which would be logical given the title, moviegoers are instead treated to a diorama of every sexual encounter the candidates have ever had.I still have no idea what the overall message was. Matthew Broderick can't act? Sleeping with your campaign manager is a good way to lose an election? Having a lesbian sister means you'll never be dateless on Friday night?Seriously, this movie is so poorly put together, I was visibly embarrassed to be in the theatre. There are only 30 watchable seconds in the flick, when Tammy and Lisa liplock. Unfortunately, that's midway through the film, so you have to go through hell before getting to heaven.What disappoints me most is the fact Reese Witherspoon had anything to do with it. She was the only reason I went anywhere near the theatre for this one, and I feel betrayed. Reese, honey, how could you do this to me?

You'll either love the dark, often gothic overtones of this mysterious world, or hate the seemingly gaping holes in the plot.

Enjoy it, and don't ask too many questions. "},{"date":"29 May 1999","review":"  I'm sure that you've heard Election being endlessly touted as wicked, edgy, brutal, dark, blah blah blah. These are all just meaningless buzzwords unless a movie has genuine feelings behind it, and Election, despite all appearances, is really a soulless, uninvolving product. The direction by Alexander Payne is certainly very clever, and Witherspoon and Broderick are effective in their two-dimensional roles, but don't be fooled Election is just another self-consciously dark comedy with unlikable, cardboard cutouts instead of real characters, content merely to wallow in its own cynicism. "},{"date":"30 May 1999","review":"  The kettlesful of style Mike Figgis ladles on his movies--melancholy romanticism, wailing saxes, neon reflected in puddles--in his first works seemed effortful, piledriving. But in his last three--LEAVING LAS VEGAS, ONE NIGHT STAND, and his newest and best movie, THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE--the Figgis style is starting to look like a deeply felt, hard-won achievement. This impressionist prism-movie about man's uncertain relationship to his body, and nature in general, is probably too lofty, too self-serious and too splintered in its storytelling to connect with a mass audience. But though the audience seemed split between titters and yawns, I find the movie improbably moving--and as obsessively, rambunctiously personal as a James Toback or an Abel Ferrara movie.A series of autobiographical fragments and symbolist fantasias, the movie takes as its metaphor eviction from Eden--and makes it radiate out in all directions, encompassing both the shame that adheres to human sexuality and the demolition of the earth's environment. There's obviously something moss-headed in the notion that sex was once, Blue Lagoon-like, free and pure, and is now polluted by human neuroses and power plays. Where does Figgis think human neuroses and power plays came from--an alien hovercraft? But the kaleidoscope Figgis generates around this material is intoxicating and sometimes shockingly poignant--as with a moment when two supermodelly twins, separated at birth, chance upon one another in the Rome airport. It's like a lost moment from a late Fellini movie (but sweeter, and with humility). Everything silly about this diary-movie is swept away in the last sequence--a Paul Bowlesian shocker that might literally steal your breath. "},{"date":"31 May 1999","review":"  The recent composition of teen films is almost unbearable. Already this year there have been countless inserts into the genre that completely fail to entertain. I can count on two fingers the number of those films I actually  enjoyed. Election, is a one of a kind production, not necessarily fitting into the adult or teenage category.I refuse to call this a teen based movie. However, teens may enjoy the film just as much as adults. It is not limited in its point of view as many are seen only though the eyes of teenagers in a high school glamorizing sexuality, drugs, violence and profanity. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of sexual content, profanity and some drug use in the film, along with rebelliousness and disrespectful attitudes. But what I rave about is the fact that this movie isn't about how cool it is too do unmoral things, it's a movie of profundity and the message that there are indeed consequences for actions.Election is a smart, razor sharp satire with much in common with the 1997 comedy Wag the Dog Both movies take a serious subject and turn it into a comical situation with enough wit to success several movies. Wag the Dog was a little on the political side, however, and Election is focuses more on the life of a particular man rather than an entire nation. Never before has a movie contained such an easy to relate to thought line of events, understandable character motives and an involving script with such naturalness. Election, is one of this year's best films. "},{"date":"1 June 1999","review":"  Anyone out there who has written a screenplay but is not convinced it is good enough, there's hope.

All of these elements are foreign to the makers of this film.  The story is slower than molasses in January.  The characters smoke in every single scene (no kidding!).  Half way through the movie I thought they were going to die of lung cancer. There doesn't seem to be any other life threatening presence in the movie until the very bitter and long end.

"},{"date":"2 June 1999","review":"  This is the worst film of 1999 so far.  Runs like a very long Calvin Klein ad, ridiculously unconnected stories of Adam and Eve and pretentious filmmakers.  Taught me once again the lesson to stay away from anything starring Julian Sands. "},{"date":"3 June 1999","review":"  As soccer legend Eric Cantona's former colleagues might say this is a film of two halves. Despite an intimidating opening scene, the first half soon settles down to establishing who everyone is - the bad guys drip malevolence, while the good guys dance in gay meadows. It is not until the second half that the politics and intrigue really get going.The film opens in England, circa 1550s. The country is divided, half of the population pledging allegiance to the childless catholic Queen Mary who is dying, while the other half attempt to place their protestant liege, Elizabeth, on the throne.Mary dies before providing an heir so the monarchy automatically passes to Elizabeth. However, she inherits a rebellious court keen to see her removed and a catholic monarch installed. Fortunately for Elizabeth, there are not enough candidates for the job. While, the evil Duke of Norfolk plots to put himself and Mary, Queen of Scots on the English throne, Elizabeth's supporters rush around trying to find her a suitable international king.The crux comes when she declares she is only interested in her English lover, Lord Robert Dudley. When her enemies learn of this, they try to drive a wedge between them. And from this premise the real intrigue flows.In terms of characterisation, the film scores some hits and some misses. Some curious casting decisions undermine a few of the characters - working class mainstay Kathy Burke moves to the opposite end of the social spectrum to play Queen Mary, Brit comic Angus Deayton has an unnecessary cameo, while Eric Cantona seems an odd choice, although his performance seems adequate.As to the main characters, Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett) is well charted from gamboling youth to ice-hard queen. The black loyalty of Sir Francis Wolsingham (Geoffrey Rush) is tested time and again and never found wanting, allowing him to grow from mistrusted bodyguard to Queen's adviser.Unfortunately the Queen's enemies are so numerous it is difficult to focus on one. Michael Hirst, the writer, chooses the Duke of Norfolk as the chief villain but we never really learn why,  or what his plans, beyond unseating Elizabeth, are. Christopher Ecclestone plays the Duke with the right amount of menace but we are never truly intimidated by his smouldering glare. Lord Robert (Joseph Fiennes) is an equally confused character. Is he guilty of the crimes he is accused of? Does he love the queen? Some of his behaviour suggests he does not, yet he constantly returns to her claiming he does. The uncertainty generated by Lord Robert is compounded by the fact that Joseph Fiennes does not belong in this film.Beyond the characters, many of the films finest moments come in the form of the brightly coloured set pieces - when the court takes to the boat lake, the arrival of the french prince and the coronation. Some of the blacker scenes also serve very well - the aftermath of the battle, the plotting in the Vatican.Despite the fine art direction, what we are eventually left with is a sumptuous, well made film let down by a slow start and a few undefined characters.

They claim that this movie is the reason Sir Anthony Hopkins is considering retirement.I believe very strongly in the notion this film puts forth.  My belief, however, comes with the knowledge that most people will not delve any deeper into the movie.  They will see it for its two leading men, some laughable lines and a few tear-inducing scenes.  That is obviously not the intention of the director, writers, or cast.This movie *does* take a bit from 'Gorillas in the Mist,' but how could it not?  It *is* about a brilliant man who goes to Rwanda to study primates. He *is* taken 'into' the group of gorillas, just as Diane was.  But that is where the similarities end.  Ethan's distinction is that he was 'a human that was allowed into a group of gorillas.'  He never became an animal himself.This movie stands fully on its own two feet, while crediting the book 'Ishmael' as having put forth the suggestions contained within the film.It is well worth the money and time. "},{"date":"5 June 1999","review":"  Desert Blue With Hurricane Streets. director Morgan J. Freeman burst onto the film scene with a sharp portrayal of bored inner city kids.  Motivated by stealing, disarmed by love, the film was highly entertaining if a bit flawed.  Desert Blue is Freeman's second film and represents his attempt to reach the opposite end of the spectrum. This time, instead of a population of millions, we now get a population of 97. The film is set in fictional Baxter, California, the home of the world's largest ice cream cone and the factory of burgeoning cola company Empire Cola.  When a truck carrying Empire's secret ingredient has a massive accident and subsequent spill, the town in quarantined and put on alert for possible toxic contaminants.  The town locals, who never thought about leaving their boring town before, now become antsy and think about life outside of Baxter.  Kate Hudson (200 Cigarettes) and John Heard play two travelers who were passing through Baxter during the spill.  They become part of the quarantine and befriend the locals. Brendan Sexton III (Hurricane Streets), Casey Affleck (Good Will Hunting), Christina Ricci (Everything independent), and Ethan Suplee (Mallrats) play the local kids.  The ride around all day in ATVs and spend their nights drinking by the long aquaduct.  Each kid harbors a long standing resentment to Baxter, and each kid expresses that uniquely.  Ricci by anarchy, Affleck by ATV racing, Suplee has a long dream of becoming a deputy, and Sexton tries to keep the family business alive, thought it died a long time ago. Desert Blue is somewhat a comedy, somewhat a drama, and somewhat a commercial for poor actors.  While it's nice to see old faces like Sara Gilbert (Roseanne) and Michael Ironside (Total Recall) in small supporting roles, the rest of the cast is laughably bad.  I do understand that they might be trying to conveying boredom, but they do it just a touch too realistically.  That leaves the film with a very awkward static atmosphere. The best moments of the film come when Freeman lets his actors and the plot get a bit silly.  The film comes alive in scenes of Orange baseball, potato guns, and an ad-lib by Casey Affleck that made me laugh the rest of the picture.  Desert Blue could have worked better if Freeman would have lit a fire under the plot.  Too many scenes include drunken ramblings, proof that a film isn't trying.  While I came out of the film with a good feeling about it, I wished the movie could've taken more advantage of it's possibilities.  ------- 6 "},{"date":"6 June 1999","review":"  Ambitious Reese Witherspoon stops at nothing to win the high school student council presidency in Omaha, Nebraska, while Matthew Broderick is a history teacher with a grudge who throws obstacles in her way--namely, a dough-headed jock (Chris Klein) and miscounting of votes--and is sidetracked by an awkward affair and bee-sting to the eyelid which end up destroying his marriage and career until he meets his fate as museum tour guide in NYC.

The narrative is suffused with magical details which propel the story along, keeping the viewer thinking all the time. The two main actors give engaging performances that succeed in creating the film's intimate atmosphere, well-supported by beautiful cinematography.

"},{"date":"9 June 1999","review":"  If a picture is worth 1,000 words, Mike Figgis, need not worry about expanding his vocabulary. Without reservations, I loved this film, but I also love a challenge for the mind and the senses. Maybe that is why The Loss of Sexual Innocence pressed all the right buttons for me.Like the 1983 film, Koyaanisqatsi, a Hopi Indian term for loss of harmony with the natural environment, this movie is also about losses, dysfunction, and mortality -- the separation of twins, loss of childhood innocence, marital indiscretion, loss of appreciation for basic human values, and the most primal loss of all, man's fall from paradise and separation from the divine.With such cosmic issues to explore, and without a coherent story or dialogue, the viewer is instead served up a smorgasbord of clues, flashbacks, mumbled words, surrealistic images, dream sequences, and the flotsam and jetsam of unfulfilled lives that are in chaos. Unlike more traditional cinema, the audience needs to pay attention, examine, process, and that rarest of all demands, think. Not everyone wants to make such efforts. In the preview screening that I attended, I counted seven people get up and leave during the first hour. Maybe they were puzzled by the abstract ideas, or perhaps just uncomfortable with the frontal nudity, frank sexuality, and universal emotions that ran like a fugue through the symbolism, accompanied by Mozart, Schumann, Beethoven, and other classical pieces on the sound track.I would urge anyone to see this movie with an open mind. It may not deliver the literal journey into the darkest reaches of the soul, as Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas, but it will expand your awareness of the human condition, and give you something to mull over for a long time.

After The Phantom Menace, which proved to be nothing more than a high-gloss\/zero-substance F\/X-driven hype juggernaut (and I'm a huge Star Wars fan), Election surprises and delights with an acrimonious satire on high school life and elections in general.  As Tracy Flick, Reese Witherspoon plays her role perfectly, and should receive an Oscar nomination for her performance with ease.  Matthew Broderick is in his element here as well, along with the rest of the cast, whom all have scene-stealing parts. While the movie runs a bit long, the moral of the story is brought around full-circle through a wonderful conclusion.  Dialogue is crisp, and is both honest and hysterically funny throughout.  The film also has a host of fantastic visual gags, the best of which is the Welcome marquee outside the film's pivotal motel.My rating 9\/10.

Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. He squeezes the best out of each scene. But I can't say the same about Cuba Gooding Jr. Honestly, I think that his character was a carbon copy of the one he played in As good as it gets  same tone of voice, same looks, same moves! This was rather disappointing. The plot was well-developed, although I didn't find anything original in it. Same old idea of living in perfect harmony with Mother Nature. Come on, this movie doesn't really contribute anything to a good old couch-philosophy. Alongside with some corny lines (humans are takers, etc.) and a badly done ending, this movie does have its share of good moments, and keeps you in suspense until the very end.

Cookie's Fortune, however, is a very poor movie.  It's an attempt to make a silk purse of a sow's ear. The sow's ear is the script--a cloying attempt to induce people to think this is a moving story of substance, when it's nothing more than a badly contrived and totally ridiculous mess.  It carries political correctness to new heights and relies on quirky characters to cover up the lack of substance and coherence in the storyline. Rating  3 out of ten.  "},{"date":"15 June 1999","review":"  A movie that makes you realize what dull predictable formula pap so many are nowadays.  Rushmore will keep you guessing what the fate of these likeable (!) human (!) characters will turn out to be.  It is truly hilarious without making the characters seem like marionettes playing out gags.And Bill Murray is the king of 'em all, y'all. "},{"date":"16 June 1999","review":"  If there were any justice in America, Rushmore would be the number one movie at the box office, and the only current film to challenge it would be Election.In general, you should be wary of films called quirky, because that generally means the film tried hard, but didn't quite come together. Rushmore is brilliantly quirky, and features what might be Bill Murray's best performance.Jason Schwartzman is note-perfect, and though Olivia Williams's British accent is never explained, she's quite good.  She may be the film's only subtle performer, but she's expressive and daring. "},{"date":"17 June 1999","review":"  Almost everybody who wrote a review for this movie seem to say that the movie sucked, I disagree. Larry Clark has a real knack for showing society unflinching, raw and vital. The acting is superior and doesn't pull any punches. James Woods deserves some sort of award, he hasn't been better in any other movie. The music is perfect, the cinematography is lush, poetic. See the movie, you won't be disappointed, unless you're one of those wussies with a weak stomach. Look fast for Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly from KIDS) as the guard at the Reverend's house. "},{"date":"18 June 1999","review":"  I was told before seeing this movie that it was boring.  However, I found the film to be exactly the opposite.  I thought it was well done and held my interest fine.Anthony Hopkins does a fabulous job (as always) as a Doctor whom fled from civilization to the African jungles, and lived with a family of apes. Actor Cuba Gooding Jr's character is there to learn from the former Doctor's experiences.  He ends up learning much more than expected, he learns about life.Although I thought some parts of the film were a bit under-developed, I still think it was a success.  At the start of the film, Hopkins acts just like an animal, his only connection to humans being his family which he happens to spot in a wild rage.  The transition from animal to an incredibly intelligent human seemed too abrupt.  Maybe if the things including the other inmates were left out, Hopkins and Gooding's relationship could have been better developed.  Although, I did enjoy the interactions with the other psychotics.Over all, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a 'smart' movie. Don't expect too much action.  You saw most of it in the teasers. "},{"date":"19 June 1999","review":"  The opening scene is dark and horrific, and sets the tone for the remaining story.  That story is a behind-the-scenes look at the English monarchy during the final days of the Catholic and childless Queen Mary, and the ascendancy of the Protestant and unmarried Elizabeth.Dark and brooding with deep colors, smoke and shadow, Elizabeth is not a light Renaissance romp.  Bodies do pile up, and cross and double-cross abound as Elizabeth gropes her way to power. And that's about it as far as the story goes...Queen Mary's dying, the Earl of Norfolk and his friends try to kill Elizabeth and fail, Mary dies and Elizabeth becomes queen, Norfolk and friends try again and fail again, then its payback time for Elizabeth.One of my few complaints about the movie is the lack of character development outside of Elizabeth.  The motivations of the surrounding characters is only superficially addressed.  The movie's success rests on two pillars, Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting, and the beautiful cinematography and sets.  Blanchett (and Geoffrey Rush) carry the acting chores, and they are remarkable.  The remainder seem to go a little overboard, like they're doing a 1550s England bit for MTV.The movie certainly entertains and makes for a good viewing.  My only regret is that I saw it on the small screen, and wished I'd seen it in a theater. "},{"date":"20 June 1999","review":"  This is a solid effort from Altman but it is anything except a mystery. This is where I think the film may run into problems as it is an exercise in cross-genre film making, one I found damn funny and would classify as a dry comedy but not everyone in the audience I viewed it with felt the same way. We had quite a few walkouts which I can only put down to misplaced expectations. This is not a serious drama, it is not a crime mystery, it is not even a straight comedy...I think this threw a lot of the audience off balance. But if you like that kind of thing or can let go of your expectations it is a fun ride watching Altman play with you. "},{"date":"21 June 1999","review":"  This movie is excellent.

Turns out to be a rather satisfying experience with great acting (Melanie Griffith has to be mentioned) and gripping moments. A good job really. "},{"date":"25 June 1999","review":"  This dazzling comedy mixes a wry, offhand allegory for the Nixon-Kennedy debate; a slice of small-town misery pitched right in the midway point between Updike and Preston Sturges; and a homespun update of Bunuel's SIMON OF THE DESERT, with a good-guy high-school teacher (Matthew Broderick) as Saint Simon and a pert, implacable, hard-shelled overachiever (Reese Witherspoon) as Satan.The director and co-writer Alexander Payne has a ziggety, hotfooting but unstressed style that never misses its mark, and the performances are stunning. Broderick perfectly varnishes the hidden desire and rage inside a principled nobody; and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance as a resentful, pit-bull-like go-getter whose button nose, narrowing eyes and helmetlike hair are like a turtle's carapace, blocking the world's aggressions.This picture--probably the best-written comedy since BARTON FINK--is full of delights, like the rich, popular jock (usually a figure of terror or mockery in American movies) who turns out to be a flawlessly saintly sort of holy idiot. And Payne makes the fluorescent-lit classrooms, chain dining experiences and bit players look the way they look in life, not in dressed-up studio movies, without being strainedly realistic. The picture combines intelligence with a rampaging, chaotic sense of fun in a way that seems mostly lost in contemporary film; the movie seems to have been beamed in from another era. It was bunglingly sold by Paramount and quickly squashed by the work of George Lucas; Alexander Payne, like his protagonist, like his mentor Bunuel's heroes, must by now have learned the hard way that nice guys finish last. "},{"date":"26 June 1999","review":"  I rented this movie because I thought it would be a good historical movie, but it looks more like a stage play than a movie. I won't comment about the historical facts, the emphasis on Elizabeth's sex and love life (bit weird when she is known as the Virgin Queen) but it baffles me that someone can make a movie that looks and feels like a stage plays in the last years of the Century and ignore 100 years of filmmaking and the powerful opportunities of storytelling that the medium provides.When film was a novelty cinematographers used to make films that were nothing more than filmed stage plays. After the medium matured directors started using the possibilities that film offered to do something more than a mere play. They started to shoot dramatic landscape scenes often involving hundreds of actors, have more than one or two locations and emphasize on action and visuals more than on words and gestures.In the later decades of this century stage play has begun to emulate film. When you go to a large production on Broadway or London's Westend you see lots of action, multiple scenes (thanks to very ingenious technology) and big scenes with many actors that resemble the movies more than the older stage plays. Seems that now the century is about to close at least one filmmaker is doing the reverse. "},{"date":"27 June 1999","review":"  When filmmakers portray the American South, cliche reigns supreme. The ghosts of Margaret Mitchell and Tenessee Williams seem to hover over every scriptwriter's shoulder. Even those who write from personal experience are unable to resist the sleepy small town with its overbearing patriarchs and matriarchs, too much boozing, illicit liasions, dark family secrets, highly sexed youth and complaisant local cops and other officials keeping a lid on things. The whole thing is usually redolent with the feeling that Tiyam Has Parsed Theis Playce\/ Culture By. Not to mention of course the Race Question.In this comedy (alternatively billed as a murder mystery)  written by Anne Rapp and set in Holly Springs, a small (mythical) Mississippi cotton town, Robert Altman is able to combine all these ingredients to produce an entertaining story with a light satirical touch. Yet it is one in which it is possible to feel some empathy with the characters, who rise above the cardboard cut-out. For Altman it's a fairly straightforward piece though he uses some of the cross-cutting techniques that were so effectively used by him in films such as Nashville. Altman knows how to put a whole village on film without the audience losing track of the story or the main players.As Cookie, the matriarch still mourning her beloved late husband Buck, Patricia Neal with her gorgeous gravelly voice is spellbinding. Unfortunately, the story requires her to depart fairly early, but there are plenty of other characters to entertain us. There is Cookie's middle-aged black retainer and friend Willis (Charles Dutton), who regularly steals pints of Wild Turkey from behind the counter at a local bar and just as regularly furtively returns them. There are Cookie's two nieces Camille and Cora, (Glenn Close and Julianne Moore) one a harridan, the other an emotional basket case, still, in their 40s, sleeping in the same room and saying their nightly prayers together. There is Emily (Liv Tyler of Stealing Beauty), young, beautiful, feisty and independent, and her male bimbo policeman boyfriend (Chris O'Donnell - almost too dumb to be true but very funny). There is a host of minor characters including Lester, the old cop who has seen it all and whose great passion in life is fishing (Ned Beatty), and the canny old lawyer Palmer (Donald Moffat) who is wise in the ways of the Southern gentry and Southern cops.The story doesn't matter much except that it involves a suicide, an attempt to disguise it as murder, and a local church group's production of Oscar Wilde's Salome. It does end with a few surprises. More interesting is the characters and they way they rub up against each other. The South evoked is a sort of sleepy New South. Women as well as blacks have been released from slavery - Emily is a very modern miss. Blacks themselves are into the power structure at last - the most senior and powerful policeman portrayed is black. Willis the retainer is treated as an equal by his mistress and by the other white folk in town. Yet the catfish are still biting, the climate still humid and soporific and the way of life still languid. The New South is like the Old South, but with some of the nastiness removed. However this is a movie to be avoided if you do not wish to know how catfish are gutted.  "},{"date":"28 June 1999","review":"  I couldn't get over how much I enjoyed this movie especially the performances of Glenn Close and Julianne Moore, each of whom are incredible actresses and honestly deserve to be showered with awards.  Close played the perfect evil woman.  Through the chaos of the film we get a feel for her instability, and her resulting need to control everything around her. Close's performance was a perfect caricature of the overly controlling personality, and what happens when it is taken too far.  Close's character had gone much too far for Julianne Moore's Cora.  Cora spends the entire film (and we get the feeling she has spent her whole life) taking orders from her older sister without complaint, but with Moore's superb performance we feel the undercurrents in Cora's personality.  Those of rebellion, and even a glimmer of intelligence peek through on occasion.  Cora, played by any other actress would have been flat and uninteresting, a mere plot device.  In the hands of Moore, she became multi-dimensional and fascinating.  Moore simply proved that it isn't quantity of lines that make a good part but the quality of the actress that can make all the difference.  Great movie great performances great story go see it.

Our Upper West Side movie theater erupted at the site of the Manhattan apartment. "},{"date":"30 June 1999","review":"  Especially when the movie takes place in the 70's (see Casino also) and he's all tricked out in those greasy retro seventies duds. I suspected this before, but having seen this movie I have decided no other actor in the business can come close to him when it comes to playing a sleazy hustler-type. Or just a sleaze. Anyway, he and the rest of the cast in the movie are great. Melanie Griffith, not a favorite of mine, does her best performance I've yet to see as Sid, Mel's junkie girlfriend with the heart of gold, a woman who can shoot smack directly into her neck without flinching but who can also sing a sweet lullaby to soothe Natasha Wagner's character. I especially like the way the movie does not glamorize drug use--the characters all look like crap, and Wagner's character has spotty skin and thinning hair. I was really expecting throughout the movie that all the 4 main characters will end up dead, probably from killing one another, but this didn't happen--the people left alive at the end were not the ones that I thought would be. All the actors did the movie for scale and from what I understand Woods even ended up funding most of the movie when the production ran out of money at one point. Lots of good black humor, and Woods is always great in everything, but best when cast in really nasty roles like this, which was probably written for him. Completely disgusting, but still somehow likeable, and always hilarious. Some of the clothes are to die for (though they look more late 60's than 70's if you wanna get picky, but who cares?) One of those drug movies such as Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas where, if you had any temptation at all to do drugs, that urge will definitely be gone by the end of the movie. I didn't even feel like ever drinking a frikkin' glass of wine again after I saw this. "},{"date":"1 July 1999","review":"  First, this movie was criminally mismarketed.  Whoever did the commercials should be taken out and shot to death in the street.  The commercials are the worst kind.  When I saw the commercials, I thought, what a horrible movie.  This looks completely awful.  I saw it because i was getting extremely mixed reviews, and ended up loving it.  It is one of the best character studies ever.  Although it rips off many movies, the reason it is so great is that it only copies one of them, and that only for a few minutes (Gorillas in the Mist.)That was the only flaw but it was needed.  I, however, took a point off for it.  The pacing was excellent.  How many people can say that their thinking does not have awkward pacing??  That is what the movie was trying to get. And it ranked scenarios in importance to Cuba's character.This movie is much like Silence of the Lambs because it deals with a mute psychopathic murderer.  However, it goes more in depth with that person and delves into his mind.  Silence focused more on the relationship between Clarisse and Hannibal.  It also delves deep into the mindset of humans and human nature.  It deals with the mindset of someone intelligent, and, what we consider, sane.  It actually has something important to say, and did not turn out to be a psychobabble thriller that is trite and common.  This movie is one of the best dramas of the year, so far.  See this if you want something psychological.  If you can't think for yourself...see Big Daddy.--------9 "},{"date":"2 July 1999","review":"  The warning flag goes up for me when a filmmaker makes a film about filmmaking that his breadth of life experience does not go beyond his immediate enclave of college buddies reassuring each other that they're brilliant. Of course there are many superb movies about making movies, for example Sunset Boulevard and the '54 remake of A Star is Born, but these films have interesting stories to tell about, and by, people who have lived, and lived somewhere other than film school. Loss of Sexual Innocence does not. Normally I would applaud the freehand style the director uses in going back and forth between different times in the life of Julian, the main character, but some of his choices in doing so are confusing. When we first meet Julian he is a towheaded five-year-old living in Kenya; in his later youth scenes he appears as a dark-haired, obese teen, and as an adult he is rail-thin and prematurely gray. Morbid obesity is a deeply-affecting, emotionally scarring and virtually incurable condition (the cure rate is two percent, literally half the chance of leading an arguably normal life as has a heroin addict). The fact that Figgis, the author\/director, simply wrote 100 pounds out of the story and reintroduced the character as a thin adult is a cold betrayal of the writer's lack of emotional depth or knowledge of the human condition. We're being told the life story of a character by a writer who doesn't know as much about life as we do. The changing hair color could be explained -- it really does happen to people -- but it hinders the audience who's trying to decide if these three actors are the same character, or if they are separate characters unknown to each other. Another issue that is not addressed throughout the film is, are we still in Kenya? If these nondescript urban and suburban scenes are in fact a foreign country by virtue of a caption at the bottom of the screen that says Kenya, then what is the point of setting the scenes in a faraway country?Eventually (but don't hold your breath) Julian's story vignettes, plus those of some other characters, converge in a single plot wherein they go off to some location to make their film, but the trip results in some very physical repercussions among both central and ancillary characters. Now that the film, at this point, has condescended to tell a traditional story, we never do find out if the injured people recover.I'm reminded of a couple of the later films of Joseph Losey (Dark Ceremony; The Go-Between), who teased us by meting out small bits of the story here and there and not telling us everything, apparently never realizing himself that he didn't have that much to say.One final observation The use of the word sexual in the title and the appearance of naked people on the poster artwork are apparently designed to draw crowds by implying, by virtue of the film's title somehow relating this story to sexuality, that the film is therefore sexy.Don't be fooled.

He typically directs movies which seem inviting enough for me to rent, but are never good enough for me to like.The story, as you probably already know,follows a boy nicknamed Pecker, played by Edward Furlong of Terminator 2 and American History X fame. I don't believe Pecker was written well at all, so nobody could have done much with the horrible character. Furlong tries to make the best out of a bad character, but with his stock on the rise now, I doubt he would have taken this part if he had it to do over.  Christina Ricci's portryal of Shelly is decent, but flat at many times. The rest of the cast gives decent, but no outstanding performances. Waters tries so hard to make this movie funny, he poorly wrote it, and poorly directs it. The film has no vision, and frequently goes in directions that makes me wonder how it even got released. It's not funny, it's not touching, it's not dramatic, it's just not entertaining, not on any level.I can't give it more than 2 out of 10.

"},{"date":"6 July 1999","review":" The movie ELIZABETH is a decent movie based on acting, direction, and cinematography (although too gory for my tastes). But it is a nearly complete failure as history--especially for a movie which claims to be historical. The writer takes a few undisputed facts a builds a wholly concocted story around them. He invents entirely false stories, distorts others, and even takes events that occurred 20 years later and attributes them to Elizabeth's first year. Along the way, he deflowers the virgin queen, and makes a traitor out of her one true love, Robert Dudley, who never would betray her. In short, for lovers of history like me, the movie is sanctimonious drivel. "},{"date":"7 July 1999","review":"  The comic stuff of which Election is made portrays our lesser selves so vividly that we keep hoping it is a movie about something else.  (Maybe it's about high school, maybe it's about politics, maybe it's about sex.)Nope.  Its theme involves all ages, the Election has little to do with choice or risk, and the sex is frankly disgusting, or would be if it wasn't so ridiculous.  The movie has no protagonist, unless we want to settle for Tracy, and she doesn't qualify, she lied.  (Jesus, however, forgave her.) Just when we begin to admire the lesbian sister of her opponent in the election, we must pinch ourselves;  yes, high school elections are meaningless exercises in group obedience, but what are the sister's motives? (Control and revenge.)  And how about the brother who is running for student body president? Perhaps we would rather be mean than quite that stupid.Matthew Broderick's character is the epitome of denial.  Bored with his own life, he tries to punish Tracy for. . . perhaps for refusing to be a victim. Broderick's performance is without ego, a gift, the image of a soul in purgatory.  Reese Witherspoon is a perfect foil.  Combine these two talents with the direction, story, and script (Alexander Payne and Tom Perrotta) and you have a tale of Biblical implications.  This movie simply hasn't generated the recognition that it deserves. The ironies continue to reverberate long after the film is over. "},{"date":"8 July 1999","review":"  This movie is just your basic, sappy, pathetically romantic boy-meets-leopard story.  You know the type.  If you've ever been around a person who's in love with a dangerous predator, I don't have to tell you how annoying it is to be around them; those subtle googly-eyed looks they keep throwing at each other are just a little more than most of us can take. Sadly, this movie is just more of the same.  I mean, don't get me wrong. We've all been there.  Who can resist the shy, flirtatious glance of a large spotty beast?  I mean, we're only human.  I'm not saying I'm in any position to judge.But as tragic as this love affair ends up, it's a little hard to sympathize with the guy.  I mean, get a clue.  Most of us are smart enough to limit our love interests to members of our own species.  It's kind of a common sense thing.  Dating a man-eater is just asking for trouble.  I haven't even had a lot of dating experience, but I can tell you that much, right off the bat.  I mean, seriously, am I wrong?  Doesn't it always end up the same?  There's a misunderstanding, someone gets hurt, and before either one lets down his guard enough to show a little empathy or forgiveness, one of them is lying in a pool of his own blood.  It's sad.  Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against the director of the film.  She had some extra time on her hands and decided to adapt a short story by Balzac to the big screen. Sure, why not?Problem #1  The short story was written by a guy named Honore de Balzac.  Hello, people.  Who names their kid Honore?  It almost sounds French, for pete's sake.  His parents were probably pretty wacked-out and maybe they thought if they gave him a French name it would make him seem really smart or something.  As if the name Balzac weren't bad enough by itself.  He had to have been beat up a lot as a kid, and it's no wonder he ended up with a twisted mind.  Let's consider the source here.  But that's not even the biggest problem.Problem #2  It's not like the Balzac story starts out Once upon a time there was this man, and he met an attractive leopard.  I mean, it starts out pretty dang normal.  It's just this random guy talking to this random lady.  Then the random guy decides to haul off and tell her this wacked-out beastly love story that he'd heard from some other guy a few days ago.Problem #3  The guy he'd heard it from was DRUNK at the time.  Okay, we know that Balzac was twisted and wacked-out.  But he did have enough sense to know that man\/leopard love stories are generally a little hard to swallow.  He didn't expect us to believe it, for crying out loud.  He sure as heck didn't expect us to repeat it to anyone.  All he was trying to say is that drunk people sometimes tell wacked-out stories.  I think we can accept that.  I think most of us can agree with that observation.  And the random guy who heard the story by the drunk guy, and then told it to this random lady, was probably drunk, too.  We don't know that he wasn't.  We don't have any evidence that he wasn't drunk, or schizo, or just totally wacked.  He might have totally changed the guy's story and made it even more twisted and wacky, just for fun.  Maybe the random lady he told it to was really twisted and weird, and she liked to hear wacky, twisted stories. Maybe that's how they got their thrills, by telling perverted wacky stories to each other.  It could happen.Problem #4  The short story by Balzac, like most short stories, is short.  Movies, including this one, are around 90 minutes long. Fortunately, there is a lot of sand in Jordan to fill in the inevitably long empty spaces.  But it would have been better if Currier, instead of making a full-length movie, had made a 30-minute blurb about a drunk guy telling wacked-out stories.  It would have been more interesting.Problem #5  The guy who told the story (the one that was DRUNK) was an old Napoleonic veteran who had severe sun-stroke.  At least, I bet he did. He was drunk, and he was telling a story about something that happened to him maybe 40 years ago while he was lost in a sweltering desert without food or water and only a lot of sand to look at for weeks.  Get a clue.  As if anyone who heard him tell this wacky story was going to be like, Wow, did that really happen?, unless they were drunk too.  I mean let's get a clue, people.Problem #6  The guy, who was drunk, told this wacked-out story soon after watching a show by a wild animal tamer.  Gee.  I wonder where he got the idea for this twisted, wacked-out story about a wild animal.  If he had just come out of a bingo game, he would have made up a totally different wacky story, like maybe about how he had built a national monument out of bingo cards in a desert, or something like that.  And then some weird twisted wacko would have made a movie based on that, maybe.Come on, people.  This is what happens when you try to make a movie out of a story that was written by a wacky guy named Honore, about an old drunk guy telling a twisted, weird story.  Let's think about this for a minute.Now don't get me wrong, because I think Balzac was a genius.  He knew some twisted person would try to make a movie out of his story some day. Prove to me that he didn't.  I'd like to see you try to prove it to me. He had to know that some twisted weirdo would make a movie based on his short story and that it would be so looney that it would make him look like a freaking genius, by comparison.  That's the only reason he would have written something like this.And that's what I like most about Balzac.  Oh, yeah, he was twisted, all right.  We've established that fact.  But he wasn't a total wacko or anything.  That's one of the things I like about Honore de Balzac.  He was pretty smart.  He probably thought about making movies, but decided that writing stories would just be better.  You have to give him that much, anyway.But the movie ... well, let's just say it was pretty wacked-out.

For me, it was a real throwback to the teen movies of the 80's that I grew up with. Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink (notice the John Hughes theme here?) and a slew of other films that made you feel a little less alone.The writing and acting, combined with the wonderfully diverse soundtrack, makes this a movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good couple of hours of laugh out loud fun.  "},{"date":"13 July 1999","review":"  This movie has no substance; it is pseudo-*everything.*  It is not touching for touching's sake, it is not funny for funny's sake, it is not romantic for the sake of romanticism.  All of the techniques it employs are basically tricks used to manipulate the audience into thinking they've just seen a profound, heart-warming film.  It's painfully obvious that the film-makers sat around saying, Okay, we need a scene to make the audience cry. What's the best (easiest) way to do that? But a good film doesn't warm hearts that easily or cheaply--ya can't just throw a heart into a microwave and nuke it, and that's what this film tries to do.  Yet again (sigh),  Robin Williams plays a hero who is too far-out for his companions, most of whom somehow can't sense, or fear, the charm which the audience is supposed to feel astute for instantly recognizing.  It's pathetic.  The first thing that's provided is a quota of  uptight, humorless jerks to serve as the dull background from which Patch will inevitably stand out and shine.  But that's irresponsibly unrealistic, IMO.  I think it's a little cheap of the film-makers to suddenly paint doctors as coldhearted, insensitive jerks (near the climax of the film, the main bad-guy doctor actually says to Patch, I'm glad you finally chose to conform. What a contrived, blatant set-up) just to serve the goal of their movie, which is to paint Patch Adams as an emotional superhero who'll get butts into theater seats and earn them $$$.  Patch takes *every* opportunity he can to make condescending speeches about these human *beings*, who have *feelings*, and *hearts*, and *love*, and *souls*, and--alright, we get the picture.  Yet we're supposed to feel touched by these, um, insights every time he launches another didactic speech.  It's blatantly obvious that he's really *in*sensitive, and despite all his speeches about treating everyone humanely, he's constantly condescending and arrogant.  His mission is not to make people feel better, but to get people to bow down to him as a being superior in every possible way.  See, I'm *funny*, I *care*... And to cover their bases, they tack on the plot-tidbit that Patch gets better grades than 98% of his peers--without ever really studying.  Boy, how convenient--over and over they drive into the ground how loose and carefree Patch is, how stuffy study-sessions aren't his thing.  But how are his *grades*?  Oh, nearly perfect.  That Patch, he's *smart*, too!!  How tired.  Yet another formulaic plot, with Williams riding the same one-trick pony yet again.  Chances are that the people who react so warmly to this movie are reacting from knee-jerk emotionalism, without any critical judgement or thought as to what the film really is, and what it's really doing.  It is contrived, simplistic, and manipulative. It's bitterly ironic that such a cynical, soul-less, synthetic manipulation of audiences is bound to garner such warm responses.  Look past the emotional smoke-screen and you'll see this movie for what it is a sterile, insensitive, heartless scam. "},{"date":"14 July 1999","review":"  John Waters at his best.  He is on top of his game.  This movie was soooooo funny.  The best things about this movie had to the supporting cast. Pecker's sisters, best friend, and grandmother steal the show.  This movie resonates with past Waters humor and keeps you entertained the whole time. It's just a whole lot of fun.  His pictures aren't all that bad either. Also check out the DVD for an extra short on the photographer who shot Pecker's pictures.

While diehard John Waters fans will be disappointed (There's no obese transvestites that eat dog feces or hilariously hideous trailer park characters) it was still an uplifting film with good performances and several laugh-out-loud scenes. An uplifting John Waters film? Yes. He's also known for dark humor;  but this film relied on harmless shock value.Edward Furlong plays the title character, a kid who takes pictures of everything he encounters in his sleazy Baltimore neighborhood. A NY art agent (Lili Taylor) observes his work and he finds he has the choice between either rising to fame (which he loses his friends and family) or keeping his original lifestyle as a poor suburban dweller.Give this one a try Expect nothing, and you won't be disappointed.

It almost deterred me from even seeing this film--but Matthew Broderick is hard to resist.  So I ended up seeing it four times, and laughing harder every time.  It was very clever for a teen flick, which is the reason it didn't make too much money--kids don't want to think about what they're seeing, they just want a little T&A, a little drugs, a couple cadavers and a lot of swearing.  This was a comedy of the most twisted style--there's student-teacher sex, revenge, African music, Juicy Fruit and Matthew's eye.  Apart, they're good enough.  but put it all together and WOW! "},{"date":"17 July 1999","review":"  I am ashamed to say that I was interested in this movie. I'm a large fan of Broderick's, and the premise sounded interesting. But I was so incredibly wrong that I am still hitting myself in the head for this one.A lot of people are saying that finally movies are portraying high school life as more than the recent films, like She's All That and Ten Things I Hate About You, have (but for the record, I loved those movies)- an endless stream of pretty people going to parties, drinking, having fun, and getting the girl. And while I'm glad that Hollywood is realizing that high school is not like that, I'd also like to hope that there is a happy medium between that and this. First of all, the sexual elements were so in your face that I was embarrassed. Anybody with any morals whatsoever would be, I hope.This movie did have some redeeming qualities. Chris Kline (I think that's his name) did a good job in his debut as the dumb, yet lovable, jock. Matthew Broderick is a favorite of mine, so anything with him in it isn't too bad. But his character was so horrible that I really felt sad for him. His acting was good, but you leave with such a feeling of disgust towards him that his talent is overshadowed. But most of all, Reese Witherspoon really surprised me with her wonderful performance. Who knew she could act? She really epitomized the character of Tracy, with the perfect voice, attitude, facial expressions, and body movement. She was really wonderful.So yes, this movie did have some good factors. But as a whole, I'd say skip it- the blatant, perverted sexual elements throw the whole movie off. There has to be a good, accurate portrayal of high school life out there somewhere.

"},{"date":"20 July 1999","review":" It would be tempting to compare 'Lola rennt' for it's action heroine with 'Nikita', or it's sense of punk style and superb soundtrack with 'Trainspotting', or even to 'Wings of Desire' for it's use of modern Germany as a backdrop for a spiritual tale. However, 'Lola rennt' hits the turbo charger and moves into a category of its own by virtue of its un-relenting pace.I went into this film a jaded movie addict and came out feeling like a child who'd looked through a kaleidescope for the first time. My hat off to Mr. Tykwer, Franka Potente and co. for taking a risk and furthering the art-form, whilst still being highly entertaining and (I suspect) very commercially viable.Lola is a sensory delight, who's message of love and spiritual growth pulses throughout the film, in time with the urban electronic beat.Treat yourself. See this film.  "},{"date":"21 July 1999","review":"  There was nothing really withstanding in this film, but it had it's funny moments. Denise and Preston fighting over the dog named Amanda was mildly funny, but everything in this film was just a really sad attempt at portraying high school life. Seriously, not every teenager either 1) drinks 2) smokes up or 3) is constantly preoccupied with sex. Some of us are normal. "},{"date":"22 July 1999","review":"  I really enjoyed this film.  It was so very funny in parts and it does not slow down for even a second.  I thought everyone did a really good job with the characters they portrayed.  It was so believable as a teen film, because they depicted exactly what goes on at a party full of recently graduated 18 year olds.  The funniest scenes were between Seth Green and Lauren Ambrose in the bathroom, and the sweetest between Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ethan Embry, but that goes without saying.   There are plenty of cameos from very familiar faces, most of which seem to work well.  Its like a cross between Clueless and Animal House.  A very funny film. "},{"date":"23 July 1999","review":"  This movie was a surprizingly good look at politics.While  on the surface it may seem to be a high-school comedy,it's a wicked parable of '90's morality.The parallels of  Clarence Thomas\/Anita Hill and Clinton\/Lewinsky are dead  on,and the ironies of the plot twists make you think.3 that stand out for me1 Paul could have forced a tie if he wasn't so stupid and voted for himself instead of  Tracy.2Tammy  actually got more votes than Tracy and Paul,but was  disqualified by confessing to destroying Paul's posters. 3Both Jim and Tracy had the means to destroy each other  before the election,but chose not to.Ultimately,the movie forces you to choseJim or Tracy-who's the villain and who's the victim?Most of you seem to root for Tracy,but I  think Jim's the real hero,even though he is defeated.Great performances all around,especially from Matthew Broderick  and Reese Witherspoon,both of whom usually play nice  people.One final word to those of you who complain the movie is too dirtyIt's a R-rated movie,none of its scenes are gratuitous,and it's actually more sedate than South  Park or American Pie.

The script is fantastic, the director in good form and the cast flawless. 'Cookie's' is suitable for anyone with a sense of humour and a big heart.

"},{"date":"25 July 1999","review":"  Yes, October Sky is worth seeing.  I'd give my take on the good points of this movie (of which there are many) but everyone else has already done this.  So I'll tell you what I didn't like.It seems to me as if the director\/writer tried to make every moment soak with emotion and sentiment.  This might be good, but it also makes it a little sappy and terribly predictable.  At one point, I predicated word for word what the next lines were going to be. That's pretty bad.In fact, October Sky is so busy trying to be inspiring that it acts like we already know the story.  For example, why does Homer all of the sudden like rockets?  Ok, so he saw Sputnik float across the sky.  But so did everyone else.  We never really find out exactly what his passion is with the sky.  He looks up at space only three times in the entire movie.  Anytime we have as dedicated and committed a character as Homer, we need to know why he is as dedicated and committed(Contact does a fantastic job of this).Other questions  why is the principal so biased against Homer's rocketry?  No one else in the town, save Homer's dad, is.  And for some reason, after Homer sits down with Quentin, Quentin becomes everyone's best friend.  Why?  Homer isn't THAT cool in school.October Sky is a great family movie for families.  It's nice to see brains triumph over brawn.  But I really wish they would've spent more time on the lure and the magic of space.  Otherwise, rocketry might as well have been bridge building or car building.   "},{"date":"26 July 1999","review":"  I loved this movie, possibly far too much (in that I saw it 15 times in theatres).  The fact that it came out just as I graduated high school probably helped, but certainly wasn't the whole reason. I don't even know how to express what I want to say about this movie.  For one thing, I loved the archetypical characters.  You have the jock, the princess, the artboy, the homey, and the sarcastic, bitter girl.  Which is pretty much what highschool works out to anyway. The scenes between Kenny (Seth Green) and Denise (Lauren Ambrose) were wonderful.  The hatred between them was delicious, and as they started to talk, it just got better. I loved the relationship between Preston (Ethan Embry) and Denise.  They were completely the almost platonic best friends, the relationship that everyone wants.  Loved them I'm not sure about the ending, but I won't give it away.  Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of high school romance movies, you'll love this one.

"},{"date":"29 July 1999","review":"  Election is so confused, muddled, and unpleasant it's hard to know which end to start carving.  There's no one in the movie remotely likeable.  Sure, there are people we can identify with, if we examine ourselves, for a little Tracy Flick flickers inside every one of us.  But of all the characters in the movie she's the only one who exhibits any laudable traits, lacking only one thing  any real kindness.  Although she's supposed to be the manipulative one, everyone else in the movie is more manipulative than she, and she herself is manipulated and abused by more than one character.  Although Broderick, in a fine, understated performance, seems to be meant for the emotional center of the film, he's a bigger jerk than Flick.  That there was not one minute of pathos for the corner of loneliness Flick painted herself into shows poor writing.  She never had one minute of self-examination or illumination;  and that's all that kept her from being one of the all-time great movie characters.  And it's too bad, too, because she was the only character in this confused and unpleasant road-kill of a movie that was in any way worth saving.  It shows what a lousy pass we've come to in this country that people who want to make something of their life and have any sort of work ethic are so casually abused and hated by theatre-goers.  Perhaps that's why there was, eventually, no introspection for Tracy Flick that led her to any  random acts of kindness, or any genuine feeling for another human being, (for which, surely, her mother was more to be blamed, another manipulator on poor Tracy Flick), she would have been *right*.  It seemed to be the point of the script that anyone who wants to actually accomplish anything, whether from selfish or unselfish intentions (we never saw any of the latter in this movie from anyone) can ever be right.  If Reese Witherspoon hadn't done such a good job on Tracy, who should've been the emotional center of the film, it would be poorly considered now;  and in a few years, save for that one performance, it will be deservedly shelved and forgotton, gathering dust on video-store shelves until its obsessive fans can buy all remaining copies from discount bins.  But even then, it'll be a waste of money. "},{"date":"30 July 1999","review":"  Please.  This was a sometimes funny, mostly tedious movie that went NOWHERE. I fully expected this to be a dark comedy from the setup, where the characters introduce themselves by saying things like I don't know exactly what happened, things just got out of control.  As the movie developed, I waited for the payoff, but there was none!  Things NEVER got out of control!  The acting was the one saving grace in this movie.  Reese Witherspoon was delightful, Chris Klein made a solid debut, and Matthew Broderick was convincingly neurotic.  Despite the performances by the cast, I was highly disappointed.  After a decent first half-hour, the film began to meander, hitting the same jokes over and over again (Tracy's overbearing mother, Tammy's back-stabbing friend, etc.).  I know this sounds callous, but I think that for this movie to really work it would have had to have somebody get killed.  The ingredients are all there a girl driven to succeed at all costs and a teacher consumed by a need to stop her... it was just asking for a murder.  I really thought that Tammy's comment about the power lines at the beginning of the movie was foreshadowing a death, too. Alas, the movie just wound down to a point where it seems like the filmmakers said ok, it's been 90 minutes, that's enough, let's go home. Oh well. "},{"date":"31 July 1999","review":" Leo (Kevin McKidd), handsome, gay, and a bit vacuous, turns 30, still without a special someone in his life. His West London flatmates, the ragingly camp Darren (Tom Hollander) and liberated flight attendant Angie(Julie Graham) throw a surprise birthday party for him. Leo is mortified and retires to his room to watch TV -  the place is full of people I don't want to see. We see why this is by way of flashback through the past few months of Leo's life. Highlights include some very funny scenes in a new age mens' encounter group facilitated with voyeuristic aplomb by Keith (Simon Callow), an affair with Brendan, a hunky Irish cafe owner (an unrecognisable James Purefoy), and reunion with an old female flame Sally (Jennifer Ehle). Tucked into this plotline are the sexual adventures of Darren and real estate agent Jeremy (a straight acting Hugo Weaving). Their scene is making love in the houses Jeremy has for sale while the owners are out, until one day an owner unexpectedly returns with Darren still handcuffed to the bedposts. Darren explains himself as an S & M a-gram sent to the wrong address.The theme of the film is gender bending. Sexual identity is not set in concrete and given the right circumstances and person many of us can swing between gay and straight. This is hardly an original insight but this film tackles the issue with zest and a great sense of fun. A highlight was the men's group back to the wilderness camp, where the men, having failed to find anything to eat in the forest, call up for Chinese takeaway on a mobile phone. A few things grate. Keith's wife (Harriet Walter), author of a book called The Obsolete Penis seems to have strayed in from another movie and Brendan looked a bit too disheveled to be the front man in a trendy cafe operation.Rose Troche, responsible for the rather didactic lesbian comedy Go Fish, directs with a much lighter touch here and takes full advantage of Robert Farrer's light hearted but occasionally poignant script. The tone is comedy rather than comic and we do care a bit at the end how it's going to work out for Leo, colourless as he is. Compared with a conventional romantic comedy like Notting Hill this film derives its tension from the unexpected rather than the inevitable, and gives the audience a lot more stimulation on the way. As for me, I'll never entrust the keys of my house to a real estate agent again.  "},{"date":"1 August 1999","review":"  Matt Damon stars as Mike McDermott, a highly-skilled poker player that knows all the in's and out's of the game, insisting that its 'not a game of luck, but rather skill.' He frequents the many seedy bars and cleans up on naive, first time players, but one night he loses 'three stacks of high society' (30 grand) to the notorious Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), and resolves that enough is enough- no more gambling. That is, until his slimy friend Worm (excuse the pun Edward Norton) gets out of prison and reintroduces him back into the world of gambling.Slowly, the storyline develops and it is learnt that Worm is neck-deep in a fifteen-thousand dollar debt to Teddy KGB. Mike, between juggling law school and his girlfriend, vouches for Worm that the debt will be repayed. What follows are some intriguing, compelling and above all entertaining poker scenes. Its interesting to hear Mike use the poker player vernacular, saying things like I've got the wheel, and gimme three stacks of high society ($30000).Rounders is a very well acted, stylishly filmed movie. All the performances are very solid, notably Edward Norton as the infuriatingly arrogant Worm. Martin Landau, Gretchen Mol and John Turturro also make appearances, although John Turturro is criminally underused.Above all, Rounders is quite a different motion picture. If you can look beyond pervasive language and see the film underneath, then you won't be disappointed.Eight out of ten. "},{"date":"2 August 1999","review":"  I viewed this film as a free screening at Woodstock '99.This film is based on a novel written by one of the Farrelly Brothers (directors of There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber).  Outside Providence is a serio-slapstick coming of age tale that meshes together the disgusting charms of Mary but attempts its hand at serious comedy.  Sorry, but it doesn't work.  Especially the depressive conclusion which follows a hilarious beginning and some sentimental but light-hearted moments. Outside Providence does not flow.  Although the Farrelly Brothers did not direct this one, Outside Providence still contains moments featuring vile bodily fluids meant to solicit laughs, but these do not work either. Honestly, there isn't much going for it except the first five minutes of the film which are hilarious, and unfortunately, these moments are all displayed in the previews.  Reminiesence does not work for these gentlemen. "},{"date":"3 August 1999","review":"  'Here's to the end of irony' whoops an art-phoney at the end of Pecker, and maybe John Waters has exhausted the rich mine of irony\/parody\/pastiche that has served him so well.  His last film, the stupidly underrated Serial Mom, was a masterpiece, revealing a film-maker fully in control of his form, like late-period Hawks, hitting every satirical target, 'important' and trivial, with gleeful gusto.The problem with Pecker, which seems to be a parody on portentous filmmakers Altman and Antonioni, is that it is aimless.  Like Godard, Waters needs the blueprint of a conventional narrative model on which to hang his ideas, style, anger and wit, even if it is only to subvert it.  The great thing about films like Cry-Baby and Hairspray is how he reverses the cliches of 1950s teen flicks and melodramas, breathes life into stereotypes, and moves the freaks and outsiders from the margins  into main roles.But Pecker has a dearth of arresting characters or even types - either the actors are uncharismatic, or the script is weak.  There is no plot to speak of, so the Hollywood conventions Waters is so brilliant at mocking are absent.  Edward Furlong leaves a big black hole in the movie with his irritating non-performance in a non-existent role.  The most unforgivable disappointment, though, is the failure to properly use Christina Ricci, the best actress in movies today, and, surely, the ideal Waters heroine.The glaring problem with the film is its irony.  Previously, Waters' strength was his ambivalent attitude towards the repressive conformity he loathed, and the desire for (parodic) conformity of his affectionate freaks. This reaches its zenith in Serial Mom, where Kathleen Turner is obviously a product of the strain of middle-class propriety, yet also the delirious driving force of the film.Here, though, the enemy is the New York intellectual elite, the most dated, pointless sitting target there is.  Who cares about the fraud that is modern photography? - it's hardly a stifling social force like the suburban mindset, or American apartheid.Whether Pecker is a stand-in for the director is unclear.  His photographs attempt to capture life, but are mostly whimsical or  contrived.  Is the film a plea for the provincial,  or a satire on it?  That's the problem the irony is so diffused that it ceases to be effective.  Everyone is so nice that melodrama is negated.  Perhaps Waters is trying to justify his decision to make 'local' films in Baltimore, but that's silly - making great movies like Serial Mom is justification enough.Sheer good will forces a few guffaws, but even the jaded Simpsons take off on modern art was funnier than this.  Waters' trademark stylisation is threadbare.  There isn't enough material here for an amusing short. "},{"date":"4 August 1999","review":"  Whenever a movie is hyped about, I do my best not to expect very much when I see it, so perhaps I'll go along with the hubbub without a problem. But unfortunately, that didn't work (and seeing The English Patient was a prime example of that). Despite being well done, Elizabeth R is a melodramatic soap opera which results to an overraught travesty.You don't need to be a history buff to see the inaccurancies What's with the miniature subplot involving transvestism? How could someone be poisoned by wearing a dress? Why did they show cheap editing of Blanchet looking in the mirror and talking to herself? I don't want to bore you with all the detail, because otherwise I'll give the movie away, but aside from all the colorful costumes, campy performances and severed heads, this movie had nothing to offer, except a good performance by Kate Blanchet portraying Elizabeth I.Luckily this only got mixed reviews, compared to hype on other over-produced period dramas. "},{"date":"5 August 1999","review":"  My only real complaint with this film is that, much like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, there is too little time for all the characters in this film.  Fast Times was based on a book, so I assume the characters got flushed out more in it.That being said, this movie was decent.  It was very reminiscent of high school in many ways; Seth Green's character in particular was a prototype for many people I went to school with.  The only thing that really is not consistent with my own experience, and it is the same with virtually all teen comedies, is the popularity thing.  I went to three different junior highs (Grades 8-10) and a senior high (11-12), and there was never a single popular group, never mind a most popular couple.  In Grade 12, for example, there were three massive groups- one was the drama group, another was the slacker group, and the last was the Indo-Canadian group (which, for anyone who doesn't know, is made up of the people whose families are originally from India or Fiji, not Aboriginal peoples).  All three groups hated each other and in the case of the first two (since the third was not really a popular group but rather the majority of Indo-Canadians in the school) really seemed to believe that they were popular.  In actual fact, those of us not in either of the groups didn't give a sh*t.  At the Grad dance, I did not even know who either the king or queen was.  There were 700 Grade 12s, and no one knew everyone.  So I am unsure whether the popularity pyramid represented in movies is an accurate picture of most people's experience or not.  My boyfriend's school had a popular crowd, but his school had only slightly more students but divided into 5 grades instead of two, making only about 300 grads, most of which a person had gone to school with for 5 years and not 2.  In this film, I believe Melissa Joan Hart says there are 500 and something grads, so everyone did not know everyone else.  Is it realistic in such cases to have two people admired by the entire school? I have no clue. About the only teen movie I can think of where there isn't this one little clique at the top is Fast Times, but that movie doesn't deal with extreme popularity or unpopularity.Still, even having gone to schools without much of a hierarchical structure, there were still enough small hierarchies to understand the popularity issues in this movie and empathise with the nerdy William or the superficially-worshipped Amanda.  I also thought that it was very realistic (and equally as realistically frustrating) that Mike Dexter realised the error of his ways only to continue acting like that; I've witnessed that story before many times.  And I certainly can appreciate this movie's demonstration of the superficiality of high school.  Thank God I got away from that and moved onto the superficiality of university.All in all, this was a decent movie, but it needed either to reduce the number of characters or to increase its length in order to truly be a really good movie.  Still, it is certainly equal to some of the better teen films of the 1980s. "},{"date":"6 August 1999","review":"  RUSHMORE.

I think the film is enjoyable, it's quirky and funny, but it's just TOO strange in spots and saddled with an ending that is COMPLETELY out of place with the film.

This heartfelt, though frequently comic and occasionally guffaw-able ramble through the inner workings of a young man's heart plays closer to drama.  Jason Schwartzman is perfect is both look and tone as lovelorn Max, and Bill Murray is, as always, Bill Murray (which is good enough for me).  Olivia Williams is completely charming as the beautiful bereft school teacher for whom Max pines, and Seymour Cassell is perfect casting as Max's content father.  The movie is defiantly offbeat in its viewpoint, teetering between comedy and drama and not fulfilling either genre's cup to the brim.Basic problems for me included When Max is tossed out of Rushmore his immediate acceptance in public school is unexplored and unconvincing.  His ability to stage a mammoth play in a public high school is not believable and, excuse my density, to what point? That he continues to be Max?  Why a Vietnam story?  And why do Bill Murray's sons have Scottish accents?However, the major flaw in this film is the perpetuation of the idea that a man's (a male's, anyway) attention to a female MUST be reciprocated.  If it is not, the female is at fault.  Max, a charming though fairly overbearing fellow, falls for a teacher, Rosemary, who quite naturally, tells him no, you're too young.  This is the basis of the movie.  However, at the end of the film, Rosemary apologizes to Max for hurting his feelings and he forgives her!  How about Max apologizing for being a pedantic chauvinist in expecting Rosemary to love him just because he loved her?  And how about a callow teenage MALE teaching an - of course -  uncertain adult FEMALE that she isn't effectively dealing with her husband's death?  (Max must have learned this trick by effectively dealing with acne and bad grades.) Unfortunately, RUSHMORE sets Max to grow up and marry himself to his admittedly high-minded pursuits, while we can rest assured that his wife will toil in silence to make him happy and pay homage to his ambition. This is enforced by the fact that Max's new, age-appropriate girlfriend, who initially was smart and forceful, turns out to be a fraud who cheated her results on a science project; Max won't have to worry that he'll be challenged here.Unfortunately, basic male chauvinist tenets are reinforced at the teenage level through RUSHMORE, and the critics rushed forward all too happily to embrace them.  Welcome to America, Max, where women can't fight and die on the front lines but are free to suffer in everyday relationships.  You'll fit right in.

The coronation scene is absolutely stunning, with those high reaching walls and those massive arches.  Visually, Elizabeth is a triumph of art direction and costuming.  The story is quite good too.  Treachery, deceit, and plenty of scheming make for dangerous times in England.  As the young queen, Cate Blanchett runs a full course of emotions.  She is young and naieve, but once she ascends to the throne of England, she is thrust upon the world stage as a ruler of a soon to be great nation.  She must first deal with the machinations of her own court.  She then learns how to deal with her new found title, and she begins to take care of all of her enemies.  The climax of the film reminded me of The Godfather, as one by one, Elizabeth's enemies are dealt with.  Geoffrey Rush is scheming and devious as Elizabeth's main protector.  He's cunning, ruthless, and he knows how to play sides.  In the end, even he is floored by the transformation that Elizabeth takes upon herself.  She truly becomes The Virgin Queen. "},{"date":"12 August 1999","review":"  This is not a movie for prudes or wusses.  It's very powerful --and not very pretty.  Gross, actually, in many cases (just the smoking of cigarettes in practically every scene makes you want to wash your clothes).  And the needle jab to the neck -- yikes! -- be prepared!   But the acting is OUTSTANDING -- especially Melanie Griffith and James Woods playing two of the biggest dopers on celluloid.  I hope they both get Oscar nominations for their roles -- they deserve it. "},{"date":"13 August 1999","review":"  I really liked this movie. I would have to call it one of the best animated films ever. Yes, I'm including those made by Disney too. Now, I love Disney movies, don't get me wrong, but this movie has a different quality to it. Instead of having song-and-dance numbers, or slap-stick animal characters, it's just a movie. It's like a normal live-action type movie, but everything is drawn instead. I love the medium of animation, because you can do so much with it. The special effects blended much better with the hand-drawn animation in this movie, then I've seen anywhere else. In many recent animated movies, it seems like the characters are drawn into a background where they don't belong, or even fit in. This movie has restored my faith in Warner Brothers Animation. The story was wonderful, the voice artistry wasn't over-done, and the animation was nearly flawless. This movie is definitely one that everyone can enjoy without feeling as if they're watching a kiddie movie. What are you waiting for? Go see it before it's gone!

The worst is Shekar Kapurs direction, which is always trying to make its presence felt. Its almost as if the camera is one of the actors. Kapur cannot seem to keep his camera still on a single conversation that lasts more than a minute. His standard tricks (shooting ceilings, etc...) expose him as an amateur. The screenplay does well in encompassing a lot of plot points, but it doesn't have sufficient clarity, so that a second viewing is probably required. the acting is unever. Christopher Eccleston puts far too much into a nonedescript part and this has a negligible effect, Kathy Burke is badly miscast and Joseph Fiennes is soppy. The best performance is from Geoffrey Rush, who is effortlessly suave. Cate Blanchett gives a good, subtle performance but has little charisma or humour. She is nowhere near as flamboyant as Glenda Jackson was. She does however leave a strong impression.

It is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story, has terrific acting and says something about the human condition. "},{"date":"17 August 1999","review":"  Altman gets more laid-back with every movie. So much detail has been put into this deep Mississippi tale of mischief, both in the sets and in the acting. Yet it all has the vaguely self-conscious feel to it that says Look at me! Isn't this a great performance? (a dubious quality some critics have dubbed the Streep factor).A relaxing afternoon in the cinema no less. Certain details are revealed at the end but by then does the audience really care? Not all of them - it had too much of a made with big bucks and check out the understatement look about it. There are a great many very creative directors about - Altman used to be one of them. "},{"date":"18 August 1999","review":"  Director Michael Corrente must be credited with the more humane parts of this atypical Farrelly Brothers outing.  It's hilarious in spots, some provided by Alec Baldwin as a tough-guy father, others by his son's burnout friends.  The lead, Sean Fatosy, plays a character named Tim but called Dildo by Baldwin.  Fatosy is convincing as he navigates the intricacies of prep school, family matters, drugs, and affairs of the heart, and the emotional honesty of his portrayal holds the movie together.  The outlines of the story are VERY familiar (it's sort of Cheech and Chong meet Summer of '42), but there are a lot of details which ring true.  It's too spottily effective to pack a wallop (and I don't know what fans of the Farrelly's previous films will make of it), but I had a good-enough time to make me glad I went. "},{"date":"19 August 1999","review":"  This was one of those movies that just didn´t work for me. I think the major flaw here is the plot, which is very patchy and not particularly original. It´s kind of GORILLAS IN THE MIST meets SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION meets ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST.The script is poor and so these two hardworking, and very good actors never get a chance to do their jobs properly. The plot, as it unfolds, is premature. There are two going-absolutely-nowhere scenes between Gooding Jnr and ´the crazy professor´s daughter. It was as if the director needed some time-fillers. Also the dialogue launches both men into great moments of emotional intensity, but without any build-up. The film also explores the great revelation the professor has in the jungle, but there is no attempt at all to deal with the fact that he abandoned his family. You get the feeling the director wants us to feel sorry for the primatologist, though the portrayal of the relationship he has with his (real) family is so flittingly dealt with that you wonder why his family want him back in the first place. It just doesn´t make sense! Also, without giving it all away, the ending is without any logic or explanation. Not even Houdini was that good!We left the cinema feeling most unsatisfied. Give it a miss.  "},{"date":"20 August 1999","review":"  Boyoboy, movies just don't get much better than this. I have yet to encounter anyone who didn't fall in love with it.

Anybody notice that Hogarth looks sort of like Frankenstein Jr.'s pal Buzz?Fave scene -- Iron Giant, his arms oustretched, making a noise of satisfied joy as he drinks in the beauty of the woods.

"},{"date":"21 August 1999","review":"  `She had such power over men's hearts,' a young Elizabeth I tells her remaining true adviser, Sir Francis Walsingham, nodding toward a statue of the Virgin Mary at whose feet she kneels, and wondering aloud why her own heart has ceased to be touched. Though it is late in the movie `Elizabeth' with Cate Blanchett in the title role, it is early in what would be the monarch's long reign to come.`They have found nothing to replace her,' Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) replies, nothing to connect their worldly hopes to the sphere of the divine since the English Reformation ended Catholicism as the dominant faith in the realm. Despite the success of a bloody Catholic reaction under Elizabeth's half-sister and predecessor as monarch, Mary Tudor, with hundreds of Protestants burned at the stake, Elizabeth in conscience will sever the whole Church of England from papal authority yet again. But what will take its place, not in canon or conscience, but in the depths of men's hearts?It is now when Elizabeth realizes it must be she. `I have become a virgin,' she announces not long after. She paints her face white and embarks on her long career as the icon an appreciative history would come to call the Virgin Queen.The movie, taking many liberties from the true text of history, chronicles Elizabeth's passage from the uncrowned, gamboling romantic who encouraged the repeated embraces of Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes), to the severe, chaste monarch revered eternally by English people. During this period in her mid- to late twenties she authorizes much spillage of blood as she gathers authority to her and deals mercilessly with those who would dispute it. The dirty work is Walsingham's; the onus is hers.When it is done, she knows she will never marry for geopolitics, as at first she was pressed to do. More sadly, nor will she do so for love, for her heart is dead, ground away in the forward lurch of history. She will instead sit resignedly and heroically, proxy in heaven for the hearts of her folk.

Junkies, violence, blood, we've seen it all before, and here it's not done with any kind of style or humour. The film is saved by a great performance from the always excellent James Woods (though I preferred him in that Simpsons episode ;-) and Melanie Griffith in 'Shock! Quite good perfomance horror!'. So, once again, it's ok to go around shooting people as long as you've got sensitivity behind it - and I am no prude - but if you're going to go for it, why not go all-out excessive, and not try and justify it with fake sensitivity? Ever seen 'Kalifornia'? Got a feeling Larry Clarke watched it a few times. ADIP is not the worst movie in the world, and I don't want to be too mean about it, but seriously, it's one of the most forgettable films of the year. "},{"date":"25 August 1999","review":"  Jim Carrey delivers a superb performance as Andy Kaufman. Carrey clearly did his homework in preparation for his role as all of Kaufman's mannerisms, speech, facial expressions, and body movements are nailed down perfectly. Here's a role that perhaps only Kaufman himself could of played better. This film, in addition to his work in Truman Show, solidifies Carrey as a legit film actor who can perform brilliantly in dramatic roles.In fact, drama is the strength and backbone of this film. Although no serious film about Andy Kaufman could of been made without showing the comical genius of the comedian\/entertainer, the film's best moments are when it takes you behind the scenes and show Kaufman as a human being and his deep relationships with his friends, not just a silly Kaufman on stage as either a prankster or wrestler or comedian.Perhaps my only problems with the film were the recreations of televised footage of Kaufman such as when he appeared on Saturday Night Live, David Letterman Show, Taxi, or his wrestling matches. What I would of love see is to transpose Carrey's image over Kaufman's image (ala Forrest Gump style) in those real footages and thus allow the audience to see the actual events as they had taken place. "},{"date":"26 August 1999","review":"  I only went to see this movie because of the Farrelly Brothers' involvement (I loved There's Something About Mary).  I'm so glad I did!  This movie is truly, honestly funny, and not only in a juvenile way.  Of course, being written by who it was, it does have its share of pot jokes and 4-letter-word induced chuckles.  Alec Baldwin gives a wonderful performance as a crusty dad, and  Shawn Hatosy proves that he isn't just another average teeny bopper movie actor.  This movie is a must see for anyone who enjoyed such movies as The Breakfast Club or Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but its appeal won't be lost on those who prefer deeper movies (dare I even say heartwarming?).  Go see this movie -- you will laugh, you might cry, and you will certainly enjoy it. "},{"date":"27 August 1999","review":"  There are three fundamental flaws in this film. First, it fails as entertainment because of the crude way it beats you over the head with a moral that is shallow, simplistic and, in the final analysis, plain wrong. Second, it fails as a story because it ultimately undermines its own message. Third, it fails as a movie because it constantly resorts to telling us things it should be showing us.The movie attempts to tattoo into us its thesis of nature good, civilization bad along with the subtext that Theo (Gooding) would be much happier if he was willing to let go of control. This is the shallow and simplistic part despite its many flaws, civilization has a lot going for it, including not dying of every childhood disease that comes along, not being dominated by the most physically powerful, and not being deprived of a mate because the big silverback keeps all the females to himself - all characteristics of gorilla society omitted from this film. The movie never addresses this complexity it is totally one dimensional. Furthermore, the assumption that the natural world is so admirable is being undermined by modern research that shows that other primates and even dolphins are prone to acts of senseless violence just as we are, such as dolphins killing porpoises for fun. This is the plain wrong part The world is much more complex than this movie wants to think about.Even if you wanted to accept the movie's thesis, it undermines itself immediately by presenting the proponent of this position as an aggressive, unpredictable man who is guilty of a particularly brutal act of murder and prone to violent outbursts of uncontrollable rage. He also - until Gooding intervenes - has a totally broken relationship with his family. This is supposed to be the poster child for the natural state? Conversely, Theo, representing civilization, is thoughtful, caring, and intelligent, and is the catalyst for bringing father and daughter back together, using the very skills that only civilization could have given him. Meanwhile, the film-makers show us cardboard cut-out villains (greedy poachers, sadistic guards) to illustrate the evils of civilization yet who would ever claim that these straw men represent humankind at anything but its worst?What finally dooms this movie, however, is that even in trying to show us nature at its best and mankind at its worst, and then ask to root for nature, it fails. Long and tedious scenes of the two stars lecturing each other are undermined and contradicted by their (pitifully few) actions, leaving us merely confused. Is there supposed to be a subtle double-cross here, with the real, hidden message being to attack the simplistic assumptions of nature good, mankind bad? Or is it just bad writing?Sometimes, you watch a bad movie and know that there was a good movie struggling to get made; this is not the case here. A bad script got made into a bad movie that not even these two stars could save.In summary, this botched attempt to say something profound fails because it only has something shallow to say, and says it badly.  "},{"date":"28 August 1999","review":"  John Waters' PECKER is by far his happiest film to date.  Even shots of dyke stripper pubic hair (shown in close-up) are gleeful!  Gay male strippers tea-bagging customers are a giddy sight!  Waters revels in his tale of simple a simple guy named Pecker with a talent for the unpretentious snapshot.As in BILLY'S HOLLYWOOD SCREEN KISS, our photographer hero is vaulted to fame and fortune by his unique snaps and even finds love along the way. Unlike that film, however, Pecker returns to his roots at film's fade out and realizes that there's no place like home - even if home is Baltimore.Of course, home-style happiness is summed-up by Waters in a grand dance party featuring cross-dressing lesbians, talking statues of the Virgin Mary, gay male strippers in jockey shorts, New York art world gapers, homeless people wearing thrift store fashions, and (drum roll) Patty Hearst dancing on a table in her underwear!Mary Kay Place is super as Pecker's mom and Christina Ricci good enough as Pecker's love interest.  Martha Plimpton is a stand-out as Pecker's fag hag sister.  Waters regulars, Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pearce and the aforementioned Hearst are in attendance yet again.If it's shock treatment you crave, look elsewhere (unless you are a member of clergy or live in a cave somewhere).

Jason Schwartzman  makes a impressive film debut as Max, Rushmore's leader of clubs and activities. Murray is also very amusing as Herman Blume, the millionaire that vies for the affection's of Olivia Williams, as well as Max. The movie's best parts come in the witty and funny dialogue, especially from Dirk, Max's choir partner. You don't love Max throughout the movie, but by the end you are rooting for him.

"},{"date":"30 August 1999","review":"  There is perhaps too much information available on the nuts and bolts of this movie and I am glad that I managed to shield myself from it by steering clear of the multitude's reviews and comments. However, the movie does not draw strength from plot development, though it is used expertly to tug at you emotionally. Its real power is in subtle characterisation (with the exception  of Glenn Close's journey over the top) and simple fine cinematography.This movie has so many superb nuances and such respect for its audience that you cannot fail to enjoy it, knowing that it is a warm and comfortable film. Being English, I wouldn't like to comment on what seems like stereotyping, or even a lack of respect for, those living in the South, but this seems to be the only failing. Its comedy is light, acting exceptional and it doesn't, where so many movies might, try to ensnare you into cheap emotional responses to simplified political ideas. A great film for just making you feel good, without being too tediously feelgood. "},{"date":"31 August 1999","review":"  This movie will definitely appeal to fans of the Farrelly Bros. other films.  Although this movie has something that was missing from There's Something About Mary--poignancy.  Hard to believe that it exists in a movie with a character named Drugs, and a hero whose father calls him Dildo. The Farrelly Brothers' overlooked Kingpin contained a bit of a serious undertone--Woody Harrelson returning to his hometown, for example.  Outside Providence contains a bonding sequence between Alec Baldwin and the hero that rivals anything in Good Will Hunting or other male bonding films of late.  But this film is not depressing...in fact, I predict it will eventually surpass Bruce Willis at the box office.  The audience loved it and gave it a standing ovation during the closing credits.  Despite its tendency to cross over into Dazed and Confused territory, the film manages to be completely original in the end (loved the last scene between Tim and his girlfriend at the campfire).

Although this movie had a couple of funny moments, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I'm not a prude, but I didn't think the drug jokes were very funny and I thought the language was a little over the top. I also thought the movie seemed very familiar and predictable. Every plot development from the hero's romance to his high school graduation seemed like a foregone conclusion. This is film is just another rehashing of Animal House.

"},{"date":"5 September 1999","review":"  I can't deny that I laughed a lot during this movie.  However, through the entire film I kept asking myself, What is the point of the film?  I am not convinced it is a nostalgic look back on the writer's life.  Mostly it feels like an excuse for people with heavy accents to be crude and do LOTS of drugs.Maybe the reason this feels like a very loose collection of situations and non sequiturs is because it is adapted from a book, and much of the connecting material was discarded.

I actually saw it on a whim, and partly because it was a slow week as far as new releases go. I must say I was so very glad I did see this movie. I actually enjoyed Alec Baldwin's performance in this film. But the glue that held this film together was Shawn Hatosy as Timothy Dunphy, and Amy Smart as Jane Weston. The two actors just clicked and made the story flow so very nicely. I would reccomend seeing this picture, especially for anyone who attended High School in the mid to late seventies. I'm sure you will enjoy the soundtrack as well, and I know it will bring back many fond memories. I gave this move a solid 7 on a scale of 1-10.

It's well done, well-acted, fairly good dialogue, but there's nothing to it.  No conflict, no real problem, no nothing!  I think the real problem here is editing...this film shows HEAVY signs of prerelease cutting.  More than once events are referred too and never shown.  And we're talking significant events, not just minor little things.  A revelation at the end of the film makes no sense because if refers to (VERY casually) to something that we never saw!  Also the kid supposedly has problems with his mother's death (and it leads to a big out of nowhere speech), but it's not even brought up until the end of the picture!

To me, the movie was not sure what it was about, part coming of age, part vulgar comedy, and part drama.  The the subplot w\/ George Wendt's character went nowhere.  The best parts of the movie were the scenes between Old Man Dunphy and his son Dildo. I was left starving for more of the two interacting on screen.  The scenes at school were fun but predictable, kind of Dazed and Confused meets Dead Poets Society.  I liked the movie, and enjoyed it, but felt it could have been so much more.  Trying to hard to appeal to a teen crowd, but the majority of the audience in the one I attended was middle age and older.  Odd sort of marketing I suppose.  The teen crowd most likely will not see this movie.  Should have given up the coming of age story line and stuck with the father and son and dead mother conflict, that was the most interesting and intriguing part of the movie, and most engrossing.

And not merely entertained in the respect of some purely-made-to-entertain movies, but this movie inspired emotion, one thing I think really makes a movie. If a movie makes you feel a certain way, whether it's anger, or happiness, I think it shows something.  For Love of the Game, did that for me.  Costner's character, excellently portrayed in my opinion, loved baseball, and in turn, I loved his character. I loved the whole movie actually. It was funny at times, symbolic at others, and above all, it was  quite enjoyable.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 10.  Again, this is just my opinion, but I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  "},{"date":"12 September 1999","review":"  For Love Of The GameMaybe I'm looking at this film through rose colored glasses. Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors, a real talent with visual ingenuity and a penchant for silliness. With last holiday's bleak A SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi gave up his EVIL DEAD past and churned out the most satisfying dramatic thriller of last year. He is certainly growing by leaps and bounds as a storyteller, and his latest film, FOR LOVE OF THE GAME, is another surprise for those of us who are fans. A truly elegant, dashingly romantic, white-knuckled look at baseball and matters of the human heart, GAME represents what a true Hollywood soap opera should be, effective.Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher for the Detroit Tigers heading for the mound for may be his last time ever. The team owner has sold the organization to a corporation and they have plans to trade Billy. His arm continues to fail him more every time he steps up to thrown. And to top it all off, Billy must deal with his tempestuous relationship with Jane, a woman he met by a broken down car on the side of the road five years ago and has yet to fully commit to. With all these thoughts swirling inside Billy's head, he unknowingly begins pitching a perfect game. Unable to keep his mind clear, Billy thinks back on his life during the game and considers the mistakes he has made and the people he has met.Told mostly in flashback, LOVE OF THE GAME is first and foremost a baseball movie. While being knocked for his recent professional choices (yeah, I liked THE POSTMAN, say what you will) Kevin Costner seems to have been crowned king of the baseball flicks. Ron Shelton's BULL DURHAM is pure genius, the best baseball film ever. FIELD OF DREAMS is more like GAME, both share a strong heartbeat and retaining a smart enthusiasm for the sport. Costner has been the glue that held both films together. He's always been a good actor, only reaching brilliance once (DURHAM). He has the rare charm the many actors forget to consider. While not technically proficient, Costner knows screen charisma well. GAME gives us a desperate Costner performance, one which lets the actor take his guard down for once. His Billy Chapel is a man used to success, yet unsure how to use it to his advantage. A man who can hardly imagine himself consumed by anything but baseball. It's a great performance from Costner. My only hope is that public opinion doesn't tarnish the acting for the paying crowd.Kelly Preston has the more troublesome task of shining brighter than Costner. A working actress for sometime now, this new film feels like the first time Preston is really acting. I enjoyed her supporting work in 1998's underrated JACK FROST, and GAME finally puts her front and center. She bounces effortlessly of Costner, and the two - while skittish at first - melt into a nice chemistry that packs more emotion than I expected. The loopy John C. Reilly (BOOGIE NIGHTS) and Jena Malone (STEPMOM) are also quite pleasant in small roles.Working with even more restraint than his SIMPLE PLAN, Raimi brings to the table his gift for camera placement and visual tenacity. The baseball scenes in GAME are very romantic, the title doesn't lie. A self-professed fanatic of baseball, Raimi's love of the game shows in each shot. With noted cinematographer John Bailey, the two create a pristine looking film. The stadium scenes are both frightening cinematic and realistic at the same time. The look of the film might not register with many people, but I couldn't help but to admire such attention to detail.Screenwriter Dana Stevens made quite an impression with her spare and warm CITY OF ANGELS remake. What she brings to GAME is the feeling of courtship that I enjoyed in Costner's last film MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. Costner and Preston really show the genesis of a relationship, warts and all. The structure of flashback that Stevens uses to tell the story isn't as unfortunate as it sounds. It's all a rather nice mix of familiar baseball melodrama and a hearty dose of Hollywood soap opera. Stevens proves once again that she has a wonderful ear for romantic entanglements.Call me a sucker for the obvious, but FOR LOVE OF THE GAME really worked for me. I really was moved by the story and enjoyed all the nuances and quirks. This classy film might not have a hero with a chainsaw for a hand, a crispy scientist with a reliance on synthetic skin, or a quickdrawing Sharon Stone. What it does have is strong emotional resonance. A audience film that the mainstream will love and the arthouse will abhor. I'll take that any day.-------- 10\/10  "},{"date":"13 September 1999","review":"  Not unlike Kevin Costner's earlier baseball-themed movie Field of Dreams, this movie shows that America's favorite pastime is more to many than just a game; It's a love affair. I'm not a baseball fan, and I loved this movie. It was both emotional and funny, and basically fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone that asked me about it.

It immediately goes into my list of Top Ten Baseball Movies, along with (in no particular order) _Field of Dreams_, _Bull Durham_ (a Costner to Costner to Costner triple play!), _Eight Men Out_, _A League of Their Own_, _Bang the Drum Slowly_, Fear Strikes Out_, _The Bad News Bears_ and three others of your choice.  (Anyone who nominates either Babe Ruth biopic, with William Bendix or John Goodman, will be ejected immediately and banned from the game for life.)Costner plays an aging Tigers pitcher named Billy Chapel with very few strikes left in his sore arm.  It is a couple of days from the end of the season, his record is 8-11, (though with an ERA in the low 3's, which would have made him an All-Star in the real major leagues this year!), he is starting a game at Yankee Stadium that means a lot to the Yankees and nothing to Detroit, and he has just been told the team has been sold and he will be traded once the season ends.  Costner is athletic enough to play a baseball player convincingly (although they use a stand-in for some shots), and his acting range is better than he is given credit for these days.  He can be romantic, funny, self-absorbed, and angry, though his most comfortable persona is stoic with just a hint of sarcastic spine, and this role seems written for him.Perhaps surprisingly, I would say that less than a third of the film deals directly with baseball.  Baseball is the framing story (literally -- the whole film is a series of flashbacks during a single game) for what proves to be an unconventional but believable romance.  This is a great date movie the guys will love the baseball scenes, and the gals will love how our sympathies are always with Kelly Preston's Jane (the love interest), at least after the relationship has begun in earnest.Preston is fine as Jane, but the other supporting actors are better.  Jena Malone (_Contact_, _Stepmom_) is superb as Jane's daughter Heather.  John Reilly (_Boogie Nights_) has some of the best lines as Chapel's long-time friend and catcher.  And J. K. Simmons (_Oz_, _Law & Order_) does his usual fine job making a small role utterly convincing as the Tigers' skipper.The film uses special effects very well.  When Chapel focuses on his pitching, the stands blur and the obnoxious fans (this is New York, after all) are suddenly muted.  We really get the sense of what it means when athletes say they block everything out.All in all, this is a very satisfying film. Yes, the odds of a 40 year-old pitcher carrying a perfect game into the late innings (no spoilers here! you'll have to see it if you want to know if he gets that 27th out) are slim.  But the odds of any pitcher throwing a perfect game at any time are astronomical.  Baseball is the most serendipitous of sports, which is why it makes the best movies.  In any case, Chapel's performance is far more believable than the superficially similar but oh-so-ridiculous one by Steve Nebraska in _The Scout_ (what was Albert Brooks thinking?).A final note, and the explanation for my title.  Costner truly is a fine actor.  He is *not* a good writer or director.  When he just acts, we get films like this.  When he tries to do more, we get _Waterworld_.  Curse the Academy for ever convincing him otherwise by rewarding that cheap knock off of _Little Big Man_ called _Plays with Camera_.  I mean, _Dances with Wolves_.  Please, Kevin, stick to acting -- For the Love of the Movies!  "},{"date":"16 September 1999","review":"  They should have re-named this movie Non-stop weed smoking.

"},{"date":"18 September 1999","review":"  Although many of the Hollywood films have a very American feel to it, For Love of the Game practically defines the United States. This movie shows almost every aspect of the American culture and their obsession with sports but beneath this baseball exterior is a movie about how an individual deals with change.The story revolves around Billy Chapal (Kevin Costner). Billy is the star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and has spent his entire career with the team. We meet Billy late in his long but distinguished career and it seems that time has finally caught up with him. His body is starting to show signs of age and in the final game of the year against the New York Yankies, circumstances dictate that he must decide whether he wants to continue to play (possibly on another team) or retire. Throughout this final game, the movie flashes back to snippets of his life revolving around his career, friends and a woman named Jane (Kelly Preston). Jane is a woman that Billy meets 5 years prior to this time and these flash backs show the relationship between the two of them and the role that baseball plays in Billy's life.This is possibly one of Kevin Costner's best performances. Although he has done many different roles, baseball seems to be one that he's most comfortable in. This is his third baseball movie and I have to say that I found this one to be his best. In many of Costner's movies, I have always found that he sometimes has a very unemotional or stoney performance but this is not the case with this movie. In many instances, I found his display of emotions very true and on occasions you get a lump in your throat. Kelly Preston is exceptional in this movie as Chapal's girlfriend and we definitely see chemistry between the two actors. This movie is not only about Chapal's life. There is enough development by the director to give insight into Preston's character and her life that you feel what she feels. The peripheral actors also give very good performances, especially John Reilly who plays the Tigers' catcher and Chapal's best friend.The one drawback to this movie is that it does feel long. It's approximately 2.5 hours but it feels more like 3 hours. There were also instances that I think some scenes were cutout. The trailers and commercials show some scenes that weren't in the movie that I thought would have been more appropriate.This is a very good movie, even if you're not a baseball fan, which being from Canada, I'm not but nonetheless I liked it. There is much more going on than baseball and the director uses some beautiful images as symbolism. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone....9\/10. "},{"date":"19 September 1999","review":"  OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE is like any number of Coming Of Age type films--seen one, you've seen 'em all.  There are no plot surprises in this one; working class boy gets into trouble at home, is sent off to preparatory school as a way to get out of trouble, and finds that the people at prep school aren't any different from the ones he left behind in his working class neighborhood, except that one of them--a smart girl--falls head-over-heels in love with him for no apparent reason.Shawn Hatosy as Tim Dumphy won't win any awards for this; in fact, by the time the movie ends, you'd be hard-pressed to even remember his name (and my husband and I both tried).  What makes this movie worth seeing, though, are the performances by the undercharacters.  Tommy Bone as Tim's younger brother Jackie is outstanding--funny, witty, undeterred by life in a wheelchair and unafraid to use it to his advantage.  Alec Baldwin, often the best thing about any movie he appears in, turns in a brilliant performance as Old Man Dumphy--vulgar and crude to the point of appearing cruel, but loving and giving to his children in moments that are unexpectedly touching. A funny and moving performance by George Wendt as one of Old Man Dumphy's card-playing buddies with opinions and ideas that make him the odd man out rounds out the undercast.See it once in theatres before it disappears. "},{"date":"20 September 1999","review":"  My only prior exposure to Altman was READY TO WEAR - a film I did not survive. COOKIE'S FORTUNE started off only slightly better, with the story held together by whimsy for the first 20 minutes or so. Once Cookie blew her brains out in one of the most uniquely-filmed suicide shots I've ever seen, I was finally hooked.Unfortunately, that didn't last. I come to films for good, soild story, and that's lacking in abundance here. As with READY TO WEAR, there are so many characters in this film that they crowd each other out - we never know enough to care what happens to any of them. The story lumbers foward until the villian's doomsday draws nigh, the just desserts are served as per the menu - and then everything *dies*, leaving about a half-dozen subplots and love stories crying for their mommy.Glenn Close's Camille, unfortunately, takes center-stage in all her one-sided glory. We never see anything but her ugliness. A last-minute attempt is made to infuse some humanity into her, but it's cheap and has no follow-through. Close's acting is solid, but she puts more into this character than it can contain, and ultimately turns her into a caricacture. Julianne Moore is as good as she can be in the limited role of Cora, a mousy little thing with an arc that peaks too steeply, too quickly.And then there's Liv Tyler. Whoever cast her as Emma should be shot. (And yes, that applies to Robert Altman.) She plays this bad girl role with the same whispery whininess she brings to INVENTING THE ABBOTS (where it worked) and ARMAGEDDON (where nothing worked). In the hands of Christina Ricci, or Drew Barrymore, or even Winona Ryder, this might have been a compelling character; in Tyler's hands, she's Pamela Abbott with a butch-dyke do and a bunch of unpaid parking tickets.Rating 3 out of 10 "},{"date":"21 September 1999","review":"  What more can I say! Do you think it is possible for Kevin Costner to make a movie that is less than 2 hours long these days?  This is a story about Billy Chapelle (Kevin Costner) and Time, as well as a love story thrown in there for effect, the only problem is that the love story consists of 3\/4 of the movie.  The baseball scenes are realistic, and well done.  If director Sam Rami (A SIMPLE PLAN), had shortened the love story of Kevin Costner's character, and Kelly Preston's character to about 45 min, and made the rest of the movie about baseball, it would have been much more better! When I went to the movie, I found myself dozing off into dreamland, several times, and I wasn't even tired!  The movie jumps back and forth through time, and is very frustrating to say the very least! If you like Kevin Costner,and you like baseball movies; check out BULL DURHAM, or FIELD OF DREAMS. My rating on a scale of 1\/10 I would have to say 3, for the baseball content!  Definately a first date movie. "},{"date":"22 September 1999","review":"  I thought this movie was a very nice film, and very well made. I especially enjoyed the way the body of the story was very skillfully and artisitically woven throughout the movie. I enjoyed both Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston's performances, and found them both real and genuine to the story line. I think the movie would have been more enjoyable if the producers would have put a few actual major league players in the movie instead of ficticious players. Otherwise, the movie was solid, though a bit too long in my opinion. I give it a solid 7, on a scale of 1-10. "},{"date":"23 September 1999","review":"  This movie is beautiful in all ways. It is visually stunning, and this is a good thing since the dialogue would only take up a page or two of paper. The acting is superb; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does a fabulous job of turning himself into an animal, and mixing that wild nature with a man's overbearing passion and honor. There is not one flaw, not one mistake or wrong moment to be found anywhere. It is completely perfect, but only if you understand what you're going to experience. It isn't a movie for anyone who wants normality.  "},{"date":"24 September 1999","review":"  A comic masterpiece.  Ms. Witherspoon gives a true Oscar-Worthy performance as the unforgettable Tracy Flick.  It's a shame Oscar won't recognize her work in this movie.  I truly don't understand why they refuse to view teens as serious actors.  Watch Cruel Intentions and Election back to back.  It will show you how talented this young actress is.  Cruel Intentions may not be a very good movie, but comparing her work in that to her work in Election shows how versatile she really is.  Another piece of genius from director Alexander Payne.  If only MY high school were like that...sigh..... "},{"date":"25 September 1999","review":" I saw the much awaited and ballyhooed FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME starring Kevin Costner in his third baseball film. This time he is an aging veteran pitcher which should not be confused with the aging catcher that he portrayed in the superior BULL DURHAM or surely should not be confused with aging outfielder played by Robert Redford in the much superior THE NATURAL.  I guess, like the character Costner played in the third baseball film, FIELD OF DREAMS, film makers believe that if it's baseball and Costner makes it they will come.  If they do it will be unfortunate.  I admit I am a nut for baseball films. The before mentioned NATURAL, EIGHT MEN OUT and Ray Milland's golden oldie IT HAPPENS EVERY SPRING are among some of my favorites.  I looked forward to this new one with eager anticipation and I was unfortunately greatly disappointed.  A pitcher throwing a perfect game (retiring 27 batters without anyone getting on base) is a rare feat indeed. The premise of this film is that Costner late in his career, late in the season in a meaningless game to his cellar dwelling Detroit Tigers facing the Yankees about to clinch their pennant, he throws one. Preposterous you might well say?  This is Hollywood do not forget and baseball is the stuff from which dreams come.  I suppose that this premise is no more or less ridiculous than a man building a baseball diamond in an Iowa corn field to give the 1919 Chicago Black Sox a second try or a professor of chemistry discovering a chemical substance that makes a baseball avoid wood.  So I was more than willing to suspend my disbelief that this could and as I knew, would indeed happen. What made the story unique, I thought prior to viewing it, was the fact that Costner relives in his mind, his life, while he is pitching the BIG game.  I still believe that this premise could work.  The problem with FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME is Costner's life away from the diamond is a big drag. Kelly Preston as his on again-off again girl friend is the biggest problem.  We simply don't give a damn about her.  She is such a neurotic, little whining fool, we want her to just get on the plane to England and get out of the movie.   Their relationship is stupid, terrible and we keep saying why would they want each other. The baseball scenes are terrific, but hardly worth the seven bucks.  I can only hope that Costner, like the aging baseball pitcher he plays, retires from making anymore baseball movies at least ones like FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME. "},{"date":"26 September 1999","review":"  Pecker is a great movie, and it hits home for someone with an artist's heart. Simple art, done for the love of it, ruined by the fame and fortune you probably are not seeking anyway. Pecker gets recognition, but the ultimate sacrifice is made in the process. And the way he sees art in everything from grass stains to graffiti to his quirky neighborhood is exactly how a true artist's mind works. He adores his family even though they are clearly bizarre (maybe he loves them because of it?) He finds fun in everything, is not depressed by his surroundings but embraces it and makes it his own. He is innocent and full of wonder, and when the NYC art world threatens to corrupt him, he does not let it. Great movie, with the usual Waters weirdness. I loved it. "},{"date":"27 September 1999","review":"  Kevin Costner is fantastic as the aging, but still charming Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel. I believe he is acting even better when he plays guys that feel somehow hurt, like Billy Chappel, Crash Davis(Bull Durham) or Garret Blake(Message in a bottle).  He is not like some actor playing a hurt guy, but he can feel the pain as if it is real. One can see the pain, or happiness, or love in Costner's eyes. And, this is real acting!   And the movie is like two movies, for the price of one, baseball game and love story going together, I liked it too much. "},{"date":"28 September 1999","review":"  This film starts off at a slow pace.You aren't sure where Altman is going with it, but gradually it takes hold.And once it does, the comedy comes at you so fast you aren't able to here all the jokes over the audiences laughter.This is the way all films should be made, with more control given to the actor so they can give their own performance their way "},{"date":"29 September 1999","review":"  I had unusually high expectations for this film, and it didn't even come close.  This film is certainly weird at times, but as is so often the case, the weirdness wasn't funny, it was just stupid.  Occasionally, something would happen that was amusing, but more often than not, the jokes would land with a thud.  Edward Furlong displays little charisma in this film, and Waters would have been wise to make Christina Ricci the star.  Looking back, I'm really not sure why I was expecting so much from this picture.  One thing's for sure, it is a bad sign when the funniest thing about a movie is the title. "},{"date":"30 September 1999","review":"  Ouch. It's difficult to imagine a high school satire\/ allegory that's more vicious than Heathers. Election comes very close.Election is one of those rare films that manages to do just about everything exceptionally well from its acting, its intelligent writing, and its hilarious direction, nearly everything functions flawlessly.Its greatest accomplishment by far is the depths to which it stoops in creating one brutally vicious satire (the bathtub scene, in particular). The film effectively lambasts the cut-throat, back-stabbing nature of Ivy League aspiration while serving as a nice allegory about the pervasiveness of self-aggrandizing behavior in today's society. It's also quite amusing to apply the characters that are so complexly developed here to the current candidates for US president. I won't name any names, but you have the ruthless if personality-deprived competitor, whose every move has been meticulously pre-calculated to ensure success, the not-so-bright guy who happens to ride a wave of popularity, however unfounded, to heights of achievement. I could go on, but this movie is about much more than that. And Reese Witherspoon, in some shape or form, manages to embody just about everyone with whom I went to high school. Some people have criticized this film for being unrealistic, but I don't think I've EVER seen a movie that so perfectly captured just how stupidly and unnecessarily competitive high school can be. Seeing this movie in the early summer made me realize how ECSTATIC I was about being a college freshman this fall... Things can get terribly ugly in the top 5%, and Election fully realizes and ridicules this fact. It's just a pity that the Oscar Gods will fail to recognize the depth that Witherspoon, an actress whom I had previously found unremarkable, brings to the nefarious Tracy Flick. It's one of the best performances by an actress of ANY age that I've seen in quite a while. If Helen Hunt can win an Oscar for her work in As Good as it Gets (which I am NOT bashing-- that's a great movie with fine performances...) then Witherspoon should AT THE VERY LEAST earn a nomination. Her performance is really that amazing.And the other performances are no less effective-- Matthew Broderick especially, in his most anti-Ferris role to date. And both Election itself and Chris Klein get bonus points for creating a 'jock' character who isn't the stereotypical misogynistic prick; Paul Metzler actually has a conscience-- a novel concept for a cinematic football hero NOT portrayed by a certain Dawson's Creek troll.The ending is also a most pleasant surprise-- while it is, in one sense, a happy ending, it also leaves some uncertainty; each character, in some way, is left with an emptiness because of the things that have occurred. The reason that the satirical element of Election works so well is that NONE of the characters is able to pinpoint the source of their emptiness, if they recognize it at all.Rating 9 out of 10. By far the best comedy of the year, and hands-down the best movie ever to have an MTV Productions logo at the beginning. But don't let that fool you-- unlike its parent company, Election actually knows how to be pointedly intelligent. Much more than a mere 'high school' or 'teen-oriented' film. Absolutely hilarious and thought-provoking from start to finish!

Both films share the drawback of over-plotting, but both overcome it with rich performances, wit in the script and a light directorial touch which stops you worrying about the denouement.The nicest surprise is to see Tyler and O'Donnell, two actors I have always regarded as soporific, finally come out of their shells and produce something credible and expansive. In fact, there is not one weak link in the cast - even Glenn Close seems idiomatic in her OTT character.Altman directs with obvious affection and, even if the ending is not really in doubt from the start, there is plenty to enjoy along the way. Altman's best since Short Cuts, and 9 out of 10. I'd happily sit through it again.

"},{"date":"6 October 1999","review":"  This was a great movie.  I went into it with high expectations because it had two things going for it in my mind  it was based on Michael Shaara's novel and it's a Kevin Costner\/Baseball movie.  It did not disappoint despite Costner badmouthing Universal for cutting some scenes.  Well worth the price of admission.  I have to admit I may like it better than Field of Dreams... I'll have to watch it again when it comes on video to decide that one.  Shaara's Killer Angels, which was made into Gettysburg, makes a cameo when Billy Chapel carries it onto the plane after a game at Fenway.  Nice touch and tribute to a wonderful author who sadly never lived to see his two novels make it to the screen. "},{"date":"7 October 1999","review":"  This has got to be one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The use of the flashbacks during the game has an excellent effect.  Some of the fading and concentration of sounds can only be appreciated in a theater. Costner and Preston play to each other so well, it is easy to believe the roles they are playing.  My thirteen year old and I both thoroughly enjoyed it. "},{"date":"8 October 1999","review":"  This movie starts out interestingly enough. As the flashbacks begin to tell the story of Billy & Jane, things tend to drag a bit. The love story tends to get disjointed at times, but all is forgiven in the last half hour with the gripping last two innings of Billy's last game. "},{"date":"9 October 1999","review":"  An amazingly well-treated script, with astounding photography and, need I say more, a brilliant performance by Anthony Hopkins.Not only are we taken into the violent environment of maximum-security facilities, or taken deep into nature, but also we are given the chance to really ask ourselves what we are.There are a couple of scenes however that play with the moviegoer's memory. For example, the way Ethan (Hopkins) is designed, reminds us of Connery's character from The Rock. When we are taken to the gorillas territory, we tend to remember both Congo (for which Stan Winston designed the gorillas, as well as for this one) and Gorillas in the Midst. Or when we see the jail environment, we cannot forget Hannibal Lecter.Still, it does have great acting, a nice music score and a highly interesting script.Definitely a must-see film.

In Cookie's Fortune he describes one of the funniest murder inquiries I have ever seen. This is not slap-stick comedy.

I like the long time friends coming to the rescue theme and the multileveled message. It touches religion, racism, friendship and destiny. Very positive and enjoyable movie. "},{"date":"11 October 1999","review":"  Since there are so many comments on this one, I'll throw in just a few of my own1. I don't know why everyone was so surprised that Reese Witherspoon can act. I've been impressed with her every time I've seen her since 'Twilight' (where she also takes her top off, incidentally). I think she will get onto the Oscar list, despite everyone's pessimism.2. Jessica Campbell is under-used. Had she been given more to do, she'd also be a worthy contender for the Academy.3. Having been on the receiving end of election manipulation in my time, I can testify to the accuracy of the events in the film. In fact, I thought they were mild.4. About time Matthew Broderick did something interesting.5. Nice script, including a single but prominent use of the C-word in a nicely judged comic moment.6. The flaws multiple voice-over is irritating; they could have trimmed five minutes off the end, since the film seems to peter out; Tracy's hustings speech isn't strong enough, considering her intelligence; and how come so many people would actually vote for such an annoying little ******* anyway???.7. The depictions of marital sex seem extremely plausible. It really can be that routine and inconsequential, folks...Still, it made me laugh a lot (and wince at the mid-life crisis moments). 8 out of 10, and thanks. This sits alongside 'Rushmore' as one of the most interesting contributions to High School Cinema (my God, it's actually a MOVEMENT...).

"},{"date":"13 October 1999","review":"  One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time, I was forced to hold my stomach it began to ache so much.  The basic premise is that of a high school election and the intrigues and mud-slinging that goes with it.  Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of her career (see her hallway spazz after a night of working on the yearbook) and Matthew Broderick slides nicely into the role of favorite teacher from his old Ferris Bueller days.  However, this movie is not for the faint of heart, it more than earns its R-rating but is so witty and humorous that you can't help but enjoy it.  I liked it so much I saw it twice in the theater.    "},{"date":"14 October 1999","review":"  It was fresh, witty, fun.  It was well done, well crafted, and terribly well acted.  I've seen many of Greg Araki's movies (who I compared to a Godard of our time as his stories are sharp-edged and on the disturbing\/disruptive side) but I have to say that this one is so much more mature, a coming of age.  Totally enjoyed my movie experience and related to each of these beautiful youngsters who live life with a go, without pretension and with eventual responsibility and definite love.  A lesson to all. Bravo! "},{"date":"15 October 1999","review":"  Can't Hardly Wait is an amusing little film about a high school  guy's four year infatuation with a girl, that uses the party after graduation for a backdrop.  The sub-plot is essentially what goes on at that party.  While not able to measure up to the John Hughes classics that define this genre, Can't Hardly Wait is a worthwhile film with a good enough story, a few neat gags and some interesting performances.  Seth Green as Kenny Fisher (a young white suburbanite who better identifies with African American culture) is great.  His timing and his tact (or lack thereof) help this film move along.  Ethan Embry's portrayal of Preston is fine as well. Embry has a knack for portraying the heartfelt nice guy.  However, its Charlie Korsmo's performance as William Lichter (the class valedictorian) that steals the film.  Korsmo is perfect right down to his demeanor.  You really see the misunderstood nerd evolve into the teenager that he has desperately wanted to be (and in the course of one evening no less).  In my opinion Jennifer Love Hewitt (the object of Embry's affection) is merely eye candy.  They could have cast almost anybody in her role, and maybe should have.  Hewitt is flat and often devoid of emotion or presence.All in all, a good flick to watch on cable when you have nothing better to do.  Although no comedy today can truly capture what John Hughes did in (and for) the 80's, Can't Hardly Wait is a slightly above par comedy worth taking a peek at.SSB - New York City - October 15, 1999 "},{"date":"16 October 1999","review":"  Bruce McCulloch, as writer and director, blew me away. I have always been a big fan of Bruce, but this really surprised me. Mark McKinney, having before worked with Bruce McCulloch, is fluid in the movie, though odd at times. I don't much care for the normal romantic comedies that you see, such as You've Got Mail to name one. Those all follow the exact same story line and get repetitive very quickly. However, this movie turns the term romantic comedy upside down. With it's heart-warming moments, and also its moments of humor (most easily understood by a Kids in the Hall fan), this movie really tops the charts.  "},{"date":"17 October 1999","review":"  This is one of the best movies of 1999. I saw it on the big screen in Spring of that year and was knocked flat by it. The acting, directing, dialogue, cinematography all genius! Whoever chose the songs for the soundtrack was no slouch, either.The film tells the story of Max (played by Jason Schwartzman),an underachieving sophomore at a prestigious boys' day school who has an uncanny ability to win friends and influence people. His dozens of extracurricular activities (Rushmore Beekeeping Society, for example) and prodigious playwrighting talents keep him from his studies;he brings home 30s and 40s on tests.Max falls in love with a new teacher at the school, and chaos ensues. He ends up romantic rival to a worn-out millionaire philanthropist(played by Bill Murray). They vandalize each others' property and just basically act like children for the love of the pretty young teacher. Max eventually gets kicked out of Rushmore and the plot really thickens.This movie is dense plot strings and relationships go every which way, but the movie manages to never go off track.The movie seems to be about many things, but here are some ideas that went through my head as I watched 1) The ability of relationships to destroy or better lives. 2) The child and childishness in everyone and the difference between them. 3) Peoples' need for friendship and the loneliness that is somehow always in everyone.Maybe I'm crazy, but someone should get some kind of award for this film. I love only a few films, and this is one of them.Fun things to watch for Budweiser boxers, everybody smoking, throwing star psycho, slow-mo drama, a nine-year-old in charge of dynamite, and a line from the movie Heat. Grade A+ with the bonus question right.     "},{"date":"18 October 1999","review":"  Robert Altman is the king of all filmmakers in two regards 1 being his ability to cast anyone he wants in a picture, and 2, his keen eye and skill at putting together a carousel of characters, situations, and dialogue that uniquely captures a piece of the American way.  Just see NASHVILLE, his 1976 masterpiece about mayhem in the heartland and the overwhelming political element in this country (even in the country singing capital of the world). COOKIE'S FORTUNE is Altman at his simplistic best, light years from the ferocity of THE PLAYER and still as fresh and innovative as his first classic, M*A*S*H.Glenn Close delivers a Gloria Swanson-like portrayal of a demented southern belle whose bell seems to have rung one too many times.  Her performance is over-the-top but effective.  The fortune of the film's title is not exactly what you'd might expect if you know COOKIE'S FORTUNE's premise, however Close keeps the viewer thinking maybe she knows something we do not. The fact that she eats a certain note is stunningly hilarious.The rest of the cast is great.  Ned Beatty talks about fishing as if it was a form of breathing for him and he never strays away from this simple-mindedness.  Neither do any of the less-than-brilliant characters. Charles Dutton is the dramatic centerpiece and pillar who exists at the most important points of this charade Altman is depicting.  He and Liv Tyler have some nice moments together.  Racial harmony is even touched upon with Dutton's conflict and is integral at tying the film's sometimes loose ends together (at times you remain confused as to who is Cookie's daughter or daughters and whether or not Tyler is the granddaughter).Keep an eye out for Chris O'Donnel's best performance in years, however brief it is.  His simple police officer brought me to laughter many times, partly because O'Donnel is masterfully overplaying him.  That is the point.There are many motiffs surrounding the goofy citizens of this small town (police tape, open glass doors with guns behind them), but the film is indeed as simple as it appears which is good considering Altman has sometimes gone nuts in his films (THE WEDDING, GINGERBREAD MAN).  He still employs the overlapping dialogue and scenery he so expertly displayed in SHORT CUTS and THE PLAYER.  See the film for an entertaining romp with a glint of American commentary that is enough to make COOKIE'S FORTUNE both important and delightful. "},{"date":"19 October 1999","review":"  The story of the 'wide-eyed' social servant looking for the opportunity to make things better for the people has been done several times over.  What makes the film Election stand out is that the characters in this story don't make it as far as the White House, the Senate or even City Hall.  The election race in this story is for high school president.Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a political science teacher at Carver High.  He oversees the electoral process of which Tracey Flick (played wonderfully by Reese Withersppon) is the only candidate.  Tracey fits somewhere on the spectrum between Marcia Brady and Atilla the Hun. She is perky and pretty, but she is also self serving and far too ambitious for a respectable midwestern girl.  Tracey isn't popular at school but this doesn't seem to bother her.  We learn early on that even a nasty little sex scandal can't hold her back.One can assume that McAllister doesn't like Tracey very much, and one can see that he doesn't trust her.  He recruits Paul Metzler, (Chris Klein) into the race for presidency.  A former football hero, Paul's sports career came crashing to an end in a skiing accident.  It seems like Paul would be a shoe-in, not only for his heroism, but also because people feel bad that he is a has-been.The story moves along very quickly.  Subplots are cracked open at every turn.  Paul's sister, Tammy (played by Jessica Campbell) claims she is not a lesbian, but rather, she just happens to be attracted to women.  When Paul inadvertantly steals her current girlfirend, she retaliates by running against him for president.The characters are constantly struggling to deny their true feelings, in favor of the supposed high road.  McAllister knows that Paul's victory would be based on a popularity contest, but he rationalizes that this is best for the school and even for Tracey.  Tracey is furious about Paul's last minute decision to run against her, but she assures herself that this challenge is a good thing.Broderick stepping into a classroom (this time as a teacher) is reminiscient of the classic film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  In several scenes he asks a question of his students.  While he waits patiently for a student to respond (of course Tracey's hand is up all the time, much to his discomfort) I kept waiting for him to utter the line Anyone?  Anyone?Tracey Flick emerges as a new kind of villain.  She is a career-hungry student not to be messed with for she knows the game.  While McAllister dislikes her, he treads lightly for she is dangerous, and any misunderstanding could be career limiting.  Flick believes in her own self-righteousness, and anyone who might disagree cannot be a good person. As she states at the start of the film, 'this would never have happened' if McAllister didn't 'get involved.'While the character of Paul was well played, it remains for me the only unoriginal aspect of the film.  The football jock who runs for class president claiming he should be elected since everyone considers him 'well proportioned', is clever, but it has been done before.  Even cut down to size by a broken leg, the dumb jock feeling sorry for himself (but still getting by with the babes) isn't  memorable.On the other hand, the character of Tammy, Paul's sister, is something we haven't seen before.  Like her brother, Tammy chases after the girls. Unlike her brother, she is smart, bitter and hugely unpopular.  Her campaign slogan I'm not going to do anything for you.' sums up her anger.Election is quirky little dark comedy.  This film isn't for all tastes.  As with other black teen comedies, (Heathers and Scream 2, for example) a twisted sense of humor would be an asset.  "},{"date":"20 October 1999","review":"  I first saw this movie about 6 months ago when my roommate managed to buy the video. He had seen it at a friend's house and thought it was one of the best comedies ever made. I was sceptical but after seeing it (about 5 times, including this past weekend), I would have to agree. Reading the outside reviews of this film as well as use comments, I find it very strange that others don't think this film is as funny as I do. One reviewer complained of stiff, forced dialog and a lot of people complained that this movie was too tame for a John Waters film. Now I like John Waters, but why do people insist that directors have to keep making the same kind of movies over and over?To me, Pecker is a film that captures a real slice of life. The characters in this film were caricatures, but so are some people. And the situations were silly, but, you know, I've seen sillier things in life. Overall, the film was very much about the kind of life me and my friends live, not just when were in college, but even now that we've graduated. The buses, the houses, the fun and games in the supermarket, are all the sorts of things you find in real life and the screwy thing Pecker and his friends and family do are the kind of things you do when, like the central character in Pecker, you ENJOY life and don't care what other people think and aren't out to impress anyone. "},{"date":"21 October 1999","review":"  'Divorcing Jack' starts off a bit like Mike Leigh's 'Naked'played strictly for laughs. Soon it takes off to appear morelike a Hollywood actioner set in Ireland, even going so far asthrowing Richard Gant (who was last seen in 'The Big Lebowski',also featuring Thewlis) in as his black American buddy. Stilllots of laughs, with David Thewlis as David Thewlis (i.e. AdamSandler as Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey as Jim Carrey), specificallya miscreant journo in big big trouble with his wife, his boss,the police, the IRA, and anybody else the producers could thinkof. The film has basically nothing to say about the situation inNorthern Ireland (thankfully). Apart from a nearly pointless'gun-toting nun' and Thewlis captured-by-his-enemies  -only-to-miraculously-escape a few too many times, you could doa lot worse than this flick. Thewlis is definitely the focalpoint, and he saunters through with his usual 'charming as adrowned rat' panache. Could somebody please write this guy afantastic script, because he has a lot of talent and presenceand it would be great to see him do something else as noteworthyas 'Naked' before he packs it in and decides he wants to direct.

Amazingly, Tom Tykwer has succeeded in Run Lola Run.Lola stumbles along the Way in a manner that some people do, in a moment of sheer impossible crisis.  It is in that moment that individuals are given a chance to break through the distractions and stumble, or in this case run, into the Tao.You can see it the way she runs each time through.  At first she is awkward and afraid, her way lost to fear and stress.  You can see it in the trivial and fruitless effects she has on other people and the city.  In Lola's final run she attains the Tao. Her running is effortless and effects on the city are deeply profound.I encourage you to see Run Lola Run in this light.  Watch it again if you didn't see it the first time.

This is a film that offers no easy answers but which uses an absurdist and cynical comic slant to portray the madnesses of the political problems of Northern Ireland. The performances are excellent and Thewliss offers another compelling anti-hero to rank alongside his performance in Naked. Divorcing Jack rattles along at a breakneck pace that will keep you gripped throughout. Combining thriller, road movie and comedy elements, this is one of the most original and thought provoking films of the last few years. "},{"date":"24 October 1999","review":"  Election is essentially a modern-day retelling of the Adam and Eve myth. The only difference is that Adam (Matthew Broderick) wants to prevent Eve (all of them) from her corruption.  You don't believe me?  Look for all of the apples strategically placed throughout the film.  I count three.  How about you?In addition, the film is a social satire.  Everyone had these kids in their high school.  Some of you may have been these kids, come on, you know who I mean.This movie is hilarious in both style and gender dynamics.  The style is brilliant with its freeze frames, interludes, and complete acts of seeming-randomness all in the name of set-up.The gender dynamics are also hilarious with Broderick's temptations by women and how he gives into them one way or another (whether it be sleeping with them or rigging the election), he can't win. For example (and this film is filled with them), Broderick is tempted to sleep with a friend of the family (actually he is seduced) and then she tells his wife that it was his fault. Is it?  Yes and no.  After all, she seduced him also.  The bottom line, are men pigs or is it just our weakness for women's temptations?  I'll choose number two.

Not quite up to Sleepless in Seattle, but with Meg Ryan as cute and delightful as this, who cares.  Playing comedy, she has all the appeal and charisma of the all-time movie greats - what a pity the old studio system no longer exists to craft regular star vehicles for her, instead of her appearing in the run-of-the-mill parts which make up most of her career.

Niecy Nash was especially fine here. Close and Moore were amazing, and Liv Tyler was perfect for the role, contrary to the feelings of others.One BIG disappointment. . .there were no credits for the soundtrack!!

This may be the worst baseball movie ever made.I guess that is because it is not a baseball movie, it's a love story that uses baseball as its back drop. Too bad, I heard it was a baseball movie. Costner uses his last game to reflect back on his failed relationship with Kelly Preston. I guess this couple is supposed to get by on the fact that they are both so pretty. Never mind that they really don't belong together. Next time find an actress with better chemistry for Mr. Costner. And for Love of the Game, get a baseball technical adviser.

You have to be clever yourself to appreciate all the funny things about human nature that take place in this movie. Many elements border on over-the-top but they never cross that line (like Something about Mary does). Real life is much funnier than contrived humor and this movie exemplifies that. Probably one of the best of the decade.

The Election at school is the event that sparks it, but the election causes nothing that Mr McAllister wasn't already predisposed to. Hopefully it doesn't remind us of our lives, but shows how giving in to weaknesses can get you in deep trouble. I suppose the moral here is do the right thing, always. Worth a see, I give it 8 of 10. It is very well acted by all.A side note, it was filmed in and around Omaha, Neb., and all the student extras really were high school students in the area. It comes across as a believable setting.(New comments in 2006.) Seeing it again now, I actually now think it is a better movie than I thought it was in 1999, but that comes with one caveat. There are a couple of scenes where the frank sex-related dialog is almost X-rated stuff, one where a male teacher describes sex with one of his former students. The movie would not have suffered if those sexual conversations had been toned down. But aside from that, the movie is extremely well done, and Reese Witherspoon was in top form as the ambitious and manipulative student gunning for class president.(New comments in 2011.) It seems to be a better movie each time I see it. "},{"date":"5 November 1999","review":"  I just saw this movie and I was surprised.  It is a good movie.Shawn Hatosy carries the lead role of Tim as a real person.  His best friend Drugs is another good role too.  All though the rest of his Providence buddies lack character.

"},{"date":"6 November 1999","review":"  Director Alexander Payne returns to his heartland homeland of Omaha (where his CITIZEN RUTH also lensed) for this mock epic set squarely in the fictional all-white George Washington Carver High School.   ELECTION has all the sophisticated humor of RUSHMORE crossed with the fatalistic sardonicism of AMERICAN BEAUTY.Flick pits SGA candidate Flick (Tracy, by name - played superbly by big DICK star Reese Witherspoon) against average joe teach Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, in a casting triumph).  Over-achiever Tracy is confident that she'll make her student opponents eat dirt.  Sharing the ballot are knockout newcomers Jessica Campbell as a teen lesbian who seeks to upset Tracy's apple cart and Chris Klein as a dumb jock at loose ends from a skiing mishap.  Klein is so wonderfully earnest he can convincingly thank God for what I'm told is a large penis during his nightly prayers without making it seem jokey or out of character.The nightly prayer sequence, while certainly not new, feels surprisingly fresh under Payne's lens.  Payne also incorporates images of straight lines for the angular Tracy and round circles for the dulled-down McAllister. Also watch for the garbage motif.  No, Payne is not obsessed with the Nebraska Waste Disposal System.  As confessed on the DVD alternate audio track, Payne is foreshadowing the major turning point in ELECTION with trashy visual hints.  Honest Abe and The Garden of Eden's taste temptation are also subliminally drawn into the proceedings in a sly way.Payne's most dramatic device, however, is the casting of former Ferris Buehler teen-rebel icon Broderick in the turnabout role of the hapless teacher.  Payne's final fadeout is a hilarious hoot of a tribute to FERRIS BUEHLER and his Ben Stein educator.  Yes, boomers, as Payne-full as it may be, our Ferris has grown up.Ballot box stuffers should remember to vote for ELECTION during the Oscar race.

And I know from reading other reviews here that you either loved or violently HATED the musical score of this movie and I have to say that I really liked it.

It also didn't do a very thorough job of explaining his celebrity--his standup routines seem lame and stilted, leaving many people in at least my screening audience to wonder what ever made him popular in the first place. His club audiences in the movie, however, roar with atrociously exaggerated delight over every little facial nuance of his. It just doesn't work.Furthermore, the movie lacked any real visual flair, which was a real surprise coming from a talent like Forman. While Carrey did an admirable job of capturing Kaufman's mannerisms, trust me when I say you've seen this schmaltz before on NBC and CBS. Pointless flashbacks. Rote relationship conflicts. I'm an underappreciated genius. Ugh.

The action, acting, story are great but by far, the most amazing aspect is how it parallels that of a Christian walk of life, from realizing what the world really is to dealing with it all and letting others know.  From the Matrix being the world as we know, one which is filled with things from worldly obsessions to keeping busy.  Both the Matrix and the world keep us blinded from the real truth.  Neo represents a man who has realized that something is wrong with the world.  At first he wants to know what it is, when he realizes it he finds that he doesn't want to believe it.  He's been tricked his entire life.  The story goes on through his transformation. Other parallels would be Agent Smith-Satan, the tempter (as we all know he does in the movie), Sypher-betrayed everyone as did Judas Iscariot.  There is an incredible amount more, it's amazing.  99% of the movie has something to do with the Christian walk and those involved.

To her credit, however, she does this very well.I am seriously beginning to doubt Miss Love's true acting abilities. When is she going to be in a substantial movie with a role that requires her to do some real acting? Perhaps if she ever does have such a role her lack of any real acting talent would be exposed and her star would come crashing down. So it's safer for her to stick with lightweight movies such as Can't Hardly Wait.I gave CHW three stars Two for Seth Green, who is pretty funny all the way through, and one star for Melissa Joan Hart in an unbilled appearance. Other than that, you've seen this plot many times before and you've seen these characters many times before.Of course, CHW would have been somewhat redeemed if it had given us a positive message or two. Instead we get more cliches, like getting drunk will change you from Mr. Nerd to Mr. Popularity. Please!Providence fans, look closely to see a pre-Providence Robbie Hanson guarding the beer keg.

This is the most heart wrenching and exciting tale I have seen this year.  When this movie is released on video I will be the first in line to buy it.  It not only is a beautiful film to look at, but it teaches morals like no other animated film I have ever seen (and I am a HUGE animation fan).  Do yourself a favor and buy this film when it becomes available. This film deserved a better treatment at the box office.  I only hope that video sales will help to make a profit for this great film.  If not, Warner Brothers and other studios might be afraid of losing money on other similar movies and that would be a shame.     "},{"date":"16 November 1999","review":"  Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon were SO GOOD in this.  Witherspoon is SO perky you could just strangle her.  Even though he had a lot of limitations, I really related to Broderick's character feeling so warm and fuzzy towards over-achievers.  Lots of layers in the story that were nicely tied together by the end.  The rich get richer and the middle class, well they stay in the middle.  Loved the scene where Broderick chucks the soda can at the car, it was the perfect cap for the emotions displayed.   "},{"date":"17 November 1999","review":"  It may not be The Player, M*A*S*H, or Nashville, but Cookie's Fortune still stands as a delight for anyone with the courage and\/or wit to actually pay attention to what Altman's doing here.  For one thing, it's another in his long series of genre takes, this one the Southern Gothic comedy (think of Steel Magnolias in Nashville, or Reflections in a Golden Popeye).  As in virtually every Altman film, the acting is magnificent, even when the script droops (it does occasionally).  EVERYONE is at the top of their form, but special kudos go to Patricia Neal, Ned Beatty, Julianne Moore and Charles Dutton.  And Glenn Close is far from over the top -- I KNOW Southern women exactly like this.  The photography is splendidly atmospheric, the mood both silly and affectionate, the characters compelling.  But I must voice some disagreements with many of the other reviewers  this is NOT a movie about race, except to show how the South has changed (see Beatty, Tyler, Moffat and Neal's attitude toward Dutton).  And everyone who mentions the stupid sheriffs\/cops just wasn't watching.  Except for Chris O'Donnell's (very funny) character, the cops are all pretty darn smart in this movie.  And yes, the film moves lazily, but have you ever spent any time in the South? LIFE moves slowly there, and Altman has done much slower-paced films than this (That Cold Day in the Park, Images, Quintet).  Sure, one or two of the running gags get tedious, but by now that's almost an Altman trademark (think bird droppings, dog doo, tuna melts).  Highly recommended except for those who haven't graduated beyond chases and explosions; and eminently re-watchable, which is the highest compliment I can pay a film. "},{"date":"18 November 1999","review":"  Man on the Moon might be Jim Carrey's best performance.  Sure it doesn't have an abundance of his slap stick humor, but there's enough to keep you laughing.  But his dramatic portrayal of Andy Kaufman was brilliant.My only problem with the movie is that it seemed to rush through certain portions of the movie and it left me feeling like some things weren't well enough explained.  (This is mainly in regard to his girlfriend).Overall it's a must see.   "},{"date":"19 November 1999","review":"  I don't know how many people who saw ELECTION saw Alexander Payne's previous film, CITIZEN RUTH(1996).  That film was a satire on abortion, with Laura Dern as a pregnant homeless woman with several children already taken away by social services, and who is caught in a tug-of-war between pro-choice and pro-life activists.  I've never seen an abortion satire before, so that was fresh, but all the characters where instead caricatures, so it was difficult for me to laugh.  And the points were made with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer swatting a fly.ELECTION suffers somewhat from that problem, but most of it works.  Much of that, of course, is due to Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.  Both of them embody their characters down to a T, and while they show us their flaws and their laughable parts, they also made them human beings.  As much as we're meant to dislike Tracy, for example, I actually felt sorry for her when she talked about being lonely.  And how events proceed between them is logical and well-told.Less well-done is Chris Klein as the jock who runs against Tracy.  He's likeable at times, but I could see Klein condescend to him and make him a boob at times(as his sister Tammy, on the other hand, Jessica Campbell makes a good impression; I was actually surprised at an action she took, though it does make sense).  I also thought the sexual repression stuff was obvious and overdone, especially when Broderick sees and hears Tracy when he's making love.  We got that already.  Nevertheless, this is often funny and biting. "},{"date":"20 November 1999","review":"  Obviously ED tv is not an original film, The Truman Show has already got that idea. Likewise, it is not as good as the The Truman Show but it does it's job well.We see Ed living a normal life the way he normally does, but we also see how television twists that life, and removes total privacy from Ed and his family's life. Early on in the film, Ray (played well by Woody Harrelson) cheats on his girlfriend. Ordinarily, no one other than Ed would've known, but as a consequence of television, this act of unfaithfulness is broadcast direct to her within seconds.Ed tv works well at showing that television does remove privacy, but it does fall into it's own trap of setting events up to make it more interesting (a la Liz Hurley's character, Jill). All in all, it works well, and the ending is a treat. "},{"date":"21 November 1999","review":"  Jim Carrey was uncanny in his impression of Andy Kaufman.  The film seemed to move along point by point recreating each significant event in the comedy career of Andy Kaufman, but it did little to add insight to who he was and what he was trying to do.  His sense of humor was well relayed but the characters lacked depth.  The relationship between Andy and Lynne Margolis was particularly underdeveloped despite a fine job by Courtney Love.  Prior fans of Andy Kaufman will find little of consequence in this film. "},{"date":"22 November 1999","review":"  I really enjoyed watching this film, even though the ending seems abrupt and unsatisfying.  The performances, especially by Harvey Keitel and Mira Sorvino, are truely exceptional and the mystical mood of the film is compelling.The weak spot is the screenplay, which has as many plot holes as a hunk o' swiss cheese.  Still, I would watch Lulu again for the acting and ambiance alone.   "},{"date":"23 November 1999","review":"  I really like Andy Kaufman. I grew up watching him torture the world, and I think more than a little of his brand of humor made its way into psyche and helped me become the person I am today. I saw him on SNL and Fridays (and of course Taxi). I followed the tabloids when he got sick (the web wasn't around yet, so the tabloids were still the least accurate medium of the time) because they were the only ones who seemed to really care. I remember watching a late-night news program one time showing in great detail what the charlatans like the one who treated Andy really did. I followed anything I could on Andy to the point that I even watched wrestling for a while (and believe me, back then, if you didn't live in a trailer park, you didn't admit to watching wrestling.) In high school, his bits were always some of my circles of friends' favorites to recite ad infinitum. But I never felt for a moment that I knew who Andy Kaufman really was, and unfortunately I still don't.Man on the Moon is a really good movie; there's no denying that. Jim Carrey's performance is dead on. He deserves an Oscar nom here much more so than he did for the overrated Truman Show. But when you put Milos Forman together with writers Alexander & Karaszewski for a film about a comic genius, you expect GREAT. What Man on the Moon does is give almost perfect recreations of Kaufman's most famous bits. What it doesn't do is give any real insight to what made the man this way. If A & K get a writing nom for this one, they should defer it to Andy Kaufman and his longtime writing partner, Bob Zmuda, because those two wrote over half of everything seen in this film. The recreations were fantastic; they couldn't have been better if Kaufman had come back and performed them himself. But when it came time to show what was going on in Andy's head, they were obviously stumped. Maybe the behind the mask stuff didn't test well and was cut out. I don't know. All I know is most episodes of A&E's Biography show more insight in an hour than Man on the Moon did in two. Maybe, like Courtney Love said as Lynne Margulies, Andy's girlfriend, There is no REAL (Andy Kaufman).  "},{"date":"24 November 1999","review":"   I just got out of the theater a matter of hours ago and I must say that this has been one of the most stunning movies of the year.Jim Carrey definitely performs at an Oscar worthy level, in fact I might be so bold as to say that this is his best performance in a feature length movie. I admit to my lack of Andy Kaufman knowledge, although I have seen many of his SNL skits and plenty of TAXI episodes, I learned a great deal of respect for his genius in entertainment and also became aware more of his personal history and personality.Not only is this movie informative, but amazingly entertaining. Nowadays, a combination that can seem almost non-existent. Milos Forman has proven himself again in my book, as I loved One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, and more recently, The People vs. Larry Flynt. I'm convinced that, although he hasn't worked on many films, he chooses them wisely.So all I can really say is see this one for yourself and then pass the word along to your friends because this is a guaranteed winner. Even if your like me, a naive teenager, I'm sure this will please the hardcore Andy fans, as well as the less knowledgeable Andy fans. "},{"date":"25 November 1999","review":"  I've read most of the reviews posted here, and I will say this they're all right, in one way or another.  Let me say that INSTINCT is, deep down, a good film with very unfortunate things happening to it.  We have an important character who is not essentially good, and that's something that's intrinsic in a credible film - the audience's doubt of their own morality.  We have a very timely story with one of the deepest points in years.  We have excellent, excellent actors.  However, we also have an inept director, a bizarre romantic subplot, a lousy script, and what looks to be a strugglingly happy ending to please the tv generation.  All of which is a real shame, because INSTINCT, deep down, wants so desperately to change the audience dramatically, to make the people question their own beliefs, their own world, as soon as they step out of the theater.  INSTINCT is really an art film that got into the wrong hands. Personally, INSTINCT, be it a mediocre film or not, changed my life.  I was, deep down, concerned about certain things, but I never really brought them to the surface.  Since watching the film, I've stopped eating certain foods, stopped caring about most of my possessions, and started getting my real priorities in order.  What does this say?  It says that for the people who go to the movies to be entertained, this movie might or might not please.  For the art film lover, it's the same.  Like I say, this film breaks no ground filmistically, but what I see is a story with a lot of potential and a true message that got diluted by studios, a lousy director, and the precedent of both Hopkins' career and the many the insane are saner than the sane films that came before it.

And, finally, a good high school movie.  Well, as a senior in high school, I disagree with both of these comments.  This movie was not entertaining at all, and was a giant waste of my money.  This movie was also, just as far from what high school is really like as any dumb high school movie like Cant Hardly Wait.  Like all other high school films, it has the steriotypical jock, who is very popular, the overachieving nerd, and the strange lesbians. Contrary to popular believe, there are normal people in high school. This movie also failed to be humourous as well as true to life.  It was labeled as a dark comedy, but it was not.  A true and good dark comedy is American Beauty, not this waste of two hours.  High School movies should continue to be like Broderick's Ferris Bueller's Day Off a true classic. The times people laughed in the theatre were truely not funny at all. People cracked up when the principal made an announcement at an assembly telling people to quiet down.

Iron Giant is one of the the most intelligent, touching, feel-good animated films to come out in a LONG time.  For that matter, why didn't anyone see this film last Summer?  A wonderful story with a great voice cast and entertaining story.  The Giant is simply an amazing character.  Not for his technical gadgets, but for his range of expressions and the ability to become thoroughly engrossed with his adventure.The messages in this film, from the Red Scare sentiments, to discussing death, freedom to be who you are, and the a little boy's perspective of what a soul is make this deeper than any recent Disney film that comes to mind.  The robot's desire to be a hero like Superman really tugged at the old emotions on my part.  The robot, even in his darker moment, was truly an innocent.I hope the low box office sales don't scare Warner Brothers off from trying something like this again.  It just makes me absolutely ill that something like Pokemon can clean up at the box office, and this was all but forgotten.  I hope it gets the praise it deserves on video. "},{"date":"1 December 1999","review":"       I'm right now sitting at my computer with a mini t.v. right next to me.  There's a rerun episode of TAXI on right now, and it's featuring Andy Kaufman performing the character of Laka Graves.  Just after watching MAN ON THE MOON, and comparing it to the real Andy Kaufman, there are little differences and more similarities.  The film really shows on what was going on with the mind of a man that many people loved, and just as many people hated.  Andy Kaufman (for those who don't know), was a famous entertainer who usually shocked people with his unpredictable actions.  From wrestling women in the ring, to performing the rude Tony Clifton on stage, Kaufman always played his audience, and no one, not even Kaufman's closest friends and family members knew what to expect.  Kaufman is probably best known for his role of Laka Fraves on the sitcom TAXI.  But Kaufman wouldn't like that, Kaufman would like to be known as a entertainer, and this shows that.  I would say that Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, but I won't.  I was very impressed and pleased with Carrey in this film that I'll say Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman.  I've watched Andy Kaufman since I was four years old, and not only myself, but my entire family has always enjoyed his work.  I just consider it for the extremely intelligent.  Kaufman is shown his real thoughts and feelings as he stages some of his most controversial moves in his career.  Some of those bits include his dead-on imitation of Elvis, and his fight on the t.v. show FRIDAYS.      I could also say that this is Jim Carrey's movie, but it isn't.  Milos Forman has always felt sympathetic towards individuals who cuased trouble in society.  From Randal MacMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, to Wolfgang Mozart in AMADUES, to Larry Flynt in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT.  In MAN ON THE MOON, Forman shows at first how much of a rude and cruel guy Kaufman can appear to be at first, then you realize, it's all a act.  Kaufman just likes to really fool people, to where they don't know that if it's a act or not.  And Forman is the perfect director to make a movie about a troublemaker in society.  The supporting acting in this film is also great. Danny DeVito is good as Kaufman's agent, George Shaprio, and so is Paul Giamatti as Kaufman's clase friend Bob Zmuda.  It's also a treat to see some of the original cast members of the show TAXI, yet they have aged quite a bit.  But what's great is seeing character actor, Vincent Schiavelli who plays a ABC executive in this film.  Schiavelli originally appeared on the show TAXI, as playing the priest who married Kaufman's character to Carol Kane's character.  It's also great to see the real Bob Zmuda, and Lorne Michaels make appearances in the film as well.  It goes to show that if all of these people are appearing in a film about a man who appears to be rude, but really isn't.  From the beginning of the film, the viewer sees a young Andy performing to a wall, then to his younger sister. And that is all Andy ever wanted is a audience.  And hopefully with this film, even 15 years after his death, his audience would have grown.      This is a excellent, very funny, and very sad tale that people shouldn't miss.  It might help explain the attitude of the eccentric person that you know.  ***** (out of five) "},{"date":"2 December 1999","review":"  MAN ON THE MOON will dispel any thoughts that Jim Carrey is simply a cartoon character come to life. He eerily inhabits the persona of the late Andy Kaufman. He is so real that when we encounter real-life personalities on-screen, Jim's presence is right in sync...he's just as real as the real cast of TAXI or producer Lorne Michaels appearing as themselves.

I hate that there is a thousand word limit on these things, because I could talk about this one all day.  Never before have I seen a film that so perfectly melted the humor of a situation with the pain and awkwardness that ultimately result in each scene.  It is truly fascinating to see how these characters react to each situation presented. Sometimes we got humor, other times we got these incredibly complex and painful situations.  What makes things interesting is that we never knew what was going to come about, and that was the true test for Wes Anderson here.  It is a daunting task for a director to try and evoke so much humor, pain, sorrow, and ultimate redemption in one film, just ask Robert Altman, and Anderson does it masterfully here.  It is nice to see Anderson growing up and coming in to his own as a director. I enjoyed his previous Bottle Rocket, a very interesting film, but found it a little boring in stretches. With Rushmore, Anderson has created a masterpiece of a film that is an instant American classic.  Bravo!

It's refreshing to see a good character-driven movie, especially one that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The characters are all a little off-the-wall, but they make the movie work.Granted, some of the storyline is a bit contrived, and there are a couple dumb turns that keep it from a higher level.  All the same, the plot keeps in the right general direction, and provides the right background for the various dramas to take place.The story is based around a number of high school personae and the twists and turns their lives take, revolving around the school's student body president elections.  Broderick is good as the teacher whose life gradually falls apart, and Reese Witherspoon turns in the only good perfromance of her career, from what I can tell, as the bratty, status-seeking go-getter who wants more than anything to become president.The real interest in this movie comes from the fact that all the characters have common problems, and they're dealt with in an interesting, though unlikely, scenario.  All in all, worth the money to rent it.

The script was excellent and the performances were top notch. It was suprisingly suspenseful as well, and quite amusing too. Witty and charming, well worth watching. "},{"date":"14 December 1999","review":"  This film is a wonder.  Jim Carrey can't help but look like Jim Carrey with Andy hair, but he moves and talks like Andy.  His moving like Andy really shows his acting genius.  The film is perhaps slim, in that Andy is a cypher.  But its heart lies in watching Andy's life in his art.  That a film can take on this is a testimony to the terrific job the filmmakers did.  Of course, that this is a biopic of Andy Kaufman, a practical joker who is no longer with us, may make this film undramatic in one sense.  However, exploring Andy's nature compulsive, childlike, with a raging center of desire, reveals that the real mystery of Andy may be in how such a amazing creature could exist.  Seeing his life exploded on the big screen brings a sense of wonder to Andy's life and death.  It's a worthy and exciting film. "},{"date":"15 December 1999","review":"  As a British citizen who moved to Michigan in 1998, I have never seen Andy Kaufmann on TV. Indeed I had never heard of him before the release of this movie. But I responded to a free ticket offer and saw it for nothing at my local multiplex. For the first half hour or more I was mighty glad I had paid nothing as Andy's act did not tickle my sense of humour in any way. In particular, Jim Carrey's introductory chatter and the running of the end credits at the beginning of the movie were merely tiresome and irritating. To judge from the laughter around me, I assumed that he must be a nostalgic cult figure and the audience were reliving their teenage memories of Andy's antics, much as Brits of my generation can quote Monty Python verbatim. After a while I found myself laughing despite the seeming dumbness of much of the material, especially where Jim skates on the very edge of bad taste and political incorrectness - and frequently falls over that edge. I cannot judge how truthful an impersonation Jim delivers, but his typically dynamic performance seemed to be the product of really concentrated effort. The later sequences in particular, where Andy is diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer, becomes progressively sicker and tries all manner of alternative therapies, are unreservedly touching and a portrayal of quiet courage. It was particularly fascinating to be reminded of the bizarre Philippines hand-on surgery without anaesthetic which I saw in documentaries of the early 1980s.As with all Milos Forman films, the craftsmanship is impeccable and the soundtrack highly enjoyable. At the end of it, I was still left wondering why Forman found Kaufmann so interesting that he was willing to invest the staggering effort which it takes to create any movie. As in the case of his last movie about Larry Flynt, though for rather different reasons , I could not see why he picked this guy out of the billions who have lived in this century to immortalise on film. Larry was just too loathsome and Andy was somehow not that distinctive. I will be surprised if the movie has much success in markets where people have no memories of seeing the original Andy first time round. I would give it 7 out of 10 for craftsmanship, acting and (against the odds) making me laugh. "},{"date":"16 December 1999","review":"  I was only 6 years old when Andy Kaufman started working on Taxi and believe it or not, I remember. Who wouldn't? Latka Gravas was an adorable character, and despite his being a network redefinition of Andy's original Foreign Man (from his stand up routine), I still believe that the tenderness was true facet of Andy's complicated heart.Those expecting a standard lifeline biopic will perhaps be disappointed. A look at the teenage Andy in high school is not to be found here. No first dates here. We go from a very young Andy singing animal songs with his baby sister, directly to his singing those same animal songs with a drunken and unamused audience in an anonymous comedy club. But the film suffers nothing from this leap in time, because this is a look at the private Andy behind the public Andy we all watched develop on television.To say the representations of the people in Andy's life are accurately portrayed is an understatement, because the people he knew and worked with are (with notable expections) all here. The cast of Taxi, Lorne Michaels, Jerry Lawler, David Letterman and others all play themselves, and you sense that they are all doing this out of their love for Andy.My feelings about this film are time-released, like the old Contac commercials used to claim. I saw it yesterday afternoon, and today I find myself pondering points and sorting emotions.Questions about Andy that have stuck in my mind for years are not necessarily answered by this film, but they are acknowledged, and that acknowledgement makes me feel better overall. It is hard to explain, and especially difficult because I have no desire to reveal any of this films secrets and surprises prematurely.The film is wonderful. I have been asked by friends if it is sad. Yes, very much so. And it is very funny. There was a gleeful darkness to Andy's art that did not make him an easy person to appreciate, but there is a poignancy to his story that offsets that darkness. And somehow this film has managed to give its audience a look at the center of that balance of light and dark, of sadness and joy.  "},{"date":"17 December 1999","review":"  Man on the Moon is a funny film only in the fact that what Andy Kaufman did was sadistically funny.  Jim Carrey, who has stated that he became Andy Kaufman does a great impersonation, at best.  The biggest flaw for me was the question Why watch one funnyman's impression of another funnyman? Why not just watch Kaufman's original material as performed by the man himself?  With that point aside, director Milos Foreman and his talented cast (including Courtney Love, Danny DeVito, and a great Paul Giamatti) do bring back the Kaufman gags with high energy and maximum laugh appeal.  The film becomes unexpectedly touching in its last moments and Carrey does a tremendous job with his material.  I would reccommend it, but again, why not see Kaufman's genius (or moronic\/psychotic tendencies, depending on who you are) performed by the man himself? Grade B- "},{"date":"18 December 1999","review":"     Teen Schwartzman (budding play-wright and extracurricular maven), and oldtimer Murray (professor and wealthy industry maven) are both romantically interested in instructor Williams at elite private school Rushmore.  The focus, if a focus can be determined, seems to be on the sometimes rocky relationship between Schwartzman and Murray.  Too little is done to explain the motivations of the male leads, and the film lacks continuity, cutting from one vignette to the next.  Williams does grow on you through the film, and the story does have its moments, but something is missing here.  Not a bad rental, but a little too bizarre and\/or unconventional for my tastes.       "},{"date":"19 December 1999","review":"  Rose Troche introduced herself to us in 1994 with the small budget, pleasant lesbian love story called Go Fish which was set in the United States.Her very assured Bedrooms And Hallways moves its locale to urban England and follows the will I, won't I musings of Leo (Kevin McKidd).He's fallen for five o'clock shadowed Irishman Brendan (James Purefoy) but Leo fears he might have got himself into trouble. He's terrified of falling in love with a straight man.But is Brendan straight or gay or both? He's just come out of a long standing relationship with a woman.The two men meet at a men's s group run by a serious eyed and voiced Keith (Four Weddings and a Funeral's Simon Callow).It would seem that Rose Troche and her team find a lot that goes on at these groups to be pretty funny. There's much clasping of the honesty rock and a particularly apt solution to catering.Meanwhile the sexually unambiguous characters get their fair shake. The flag is flown strongly for all sexual inclinations.Very camp Darren (Tom Hollander) knows what he wants. He's having a great time with Jeremy a real estate agent played with terrific intensity by Australian actor Hugo Weaving. They sneak into people's houses which are on the market to have sex.Leo is wavering, he's showing some interest in women as well as in Brendan and Darren is incensed, expecting calls from the sex police. Meanwhile Angie and Sybil have no qualms about being happily heterosexual. But all remains fluid.Bedrooms and Hallways is a cheerful comedy romance with a homosexual bent. It gathers pace in its final third when, as in nearly all comedy romances, everyone finds a mate and\/or a lover. There are plenty of laughs in what is a smart, impressive new movie from Rose Troche.Things have changed over the years in films. The boys and girls used to be nearly ten years younger in these sorts of comedies and we were used to them finding a life long, heterosexual partner in the final reel, to then live happily ever after.These days a three night trial liaison is probably more than can be expected, a situation which more suitably fits the thirty somethings these films are about.

What a strange event, that the same wrestler who landed Andy in a neck brace also injured Jim. MOTM is a beautifully made film with good, decent acting (for once!) and kept me interested all the way through. As a life-long Kaufman fan I was thrilled with the movie and Carrey's performance. This time around, he deserves best actor. I've never really been a big fan of Carrey but I am changing my tune surely. I'm glad that Carrey had enough respect for Kaufman to do him justice. But then maybe Andy was really poking through... Who knows.8 out of 10 "},{"date":"21 December 1999","review":"  I love this film because of Jim Carrey efforts.  He brings some magic to role of Andy Kaufman.  This person died a few years ago from cancer which cut short his meteoric career.His role made you really feel compassionate about the various aspect of Andy.   If you are experienced fan of SNL you will most likely like this movie.  I hope he gets an award in late March! "},{"date":"22 December 1999","review":"  Who was Andy Kaufman?  What was he really like?  The answere is, I think, no one really knew, not even himself.  I think that is the point the critics who mention the film doesn't get to the heart of who Andy Kaufman really was.  Man on the moon may not be 100% accurate, but it's a wonderful film.  Being a late Kaufman fan, (I was to young to have a clear memory of him when he was alive and in the direct spotlight), I have become a fan through showings of his classic performances and news shows about him.  What I've seen has been recreated very vividly.  Jim Carrey doesn't just play Andy Kaufman, he is wisked away into Andy, he becomes Andy, in a performance that should earn him one of those little golden trophies.  (If it doesn't then I'm convinced the Oscars are rigged.)  I remember two young ladies leaving the theatre half way through the film, they must have been expecting another Ace Ventura, or The Mask, and had no idea who Andy Kaufman was.  The film isn't for everyone...bottom line, but on the other hand, we have my fiance on the other side who went into the film kicking and screaming, and was all misty eyed at the end (I cried to, it didn't help that she started it...), falling in love with Andy Kaufman as I did long ago.  Andy was banished from everyone's memory years ago, now it's about time he got the appreciation he desearves.  This ones for you Andy.    "},{"date":"23 December 1999","review":" Warning!!    Warning!!!Though it was not the intent of the writer, there may be some spoilers in the review. But we swear, they're not really big ones. We promise. So, please read on. Thank you very much.....As the Universal logo appears, Kaufman fans enjoy the sounds of Andy's wrestling theme. The weird introduction will have the entire audiences scratching their heads, then laughing them off. Man on the Moon delivers Kaufman act after Kaufman act after Kaufman act again. Jim Carrey executes them flawlessly. The movie has spills, chills, twists, sists, fits, and telephones(you thought I was going to say something that rhymes with fits, huh?). Besides the humor aspect, Man on the Moon shows a great portrayal of a man slowly loosing his world. If you're a Kaufman fan, you know the ending; all I will say is that it was so wonderfully done, that I was fighting back a tear or two. I'm not sure how Andy's life really was, but if his family supports it, it can't be too fake. The movie is excellent.....Except for that Tony Clifton guy. What a jerk!!!

Jim's performance is so convincing that I'm beginning to appreciate Andy now. I really luv this movie and I can't imagine why some critics would attack this movie. CNN (Showbiz) Online called it The most disappointing film of 1999., while Entertainment Weekly named it the No. 1 movie of the year.Though a 50\/50 chance of good and bad reviews, they all admit that Jim Carrey's performance is a revelation. I agree and I hope he won't be overlooked by the Academy (Oscars) again. Otherwise, everyone will never stop thinking about why Jim has been snubbed.

Bob Zmuda's book is much better than this movie and I have not finished reading it yet.  It just seemed too quick and choppy to do Andy's life and career justice.  Too much on Tony Clifton and the wrestling and less on Andy himself. "},{"date":"28 December 1999","review":"  I thought that Jim Carrey was excellent in this role. I was watching this special on the life of Andy Kaufman and showed many scenes of him which were also shown in the movie. Jim did them perfectly, and was also very funny too. I also thought the director did an excellent job of recreating the scenes. ALl the actors were excellent in the movie especially Danny Devito. "},{"date":"29 December 1999","review":"  I knew a man on the moon would be good because it would be ideally suited for Carrey's exceptional talents.

I don't normally see movies twice but I'm sure this will be an exception. "},{"date":"30 December 1999","review":"  The movie is a must-see if you are an Andy Kaufman fan.

Andy can't be translated into literal terms.  Kudos to Forman and Carrey for allowing him to remain what he was -- a mystery. "},{"date":"1 January 2000","review":"  First, I think that audiences who have seen Andy Kaufman perform will get the most kicks out of this movie, (whether you loved or hated him), but even someone who has never heard of Tony Clifton, or has never seen Taxi, will probably enjoy this picture. Carrey was born to play Kaufman, and I think that his performance was Oscar-calibre, (as was Truman Show for which he was tragically looked over). If you love to laugh, cry, and think LONG after the movie is over, Jim Carrey's Man on The Moon is your ticket. "},{"date":"2 January 2000","review":"  Milos Forman is one of the greatest directors of our time. He has only made a handful of movies but each one he makes is an excellent success. Man On The Moon is no exception. Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman to a T his voice and mannerisms are top-notch. The movie doesn't leave out any major details about Andy Kaufman's life. Everything you've seen or heard about is in this movie. Although it's a few minutes shy of 2 hours, it never seems to rush through anything. I didn't want it to end. The opening scene is one of the most interesting scenes ever in a movie. This goes right up there with Forman's previous works (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus) and is superior over Forman's last biopic The People Vs. Larry Flynt, another very good movie but not an excellent one.   "},{"date":"3 January 2000","review":"  It seems that one's impression of this film is going to be largely dependent on one's impression of Andy Kaufman.  I hesitate to call myself a fan of his.. I don't know that you can truly be a fan of Kaufman's.  He didn't want fans and in fact, often tried to create the exact opposite- enemies.  I do appreciate his work and what he was trying to do though, so I went into this movie hoping to get a glimpse of the mind behind the man.Jim Carrey is absolute brilliant as Kaufman, encompassing the late performer so completely that often it was hard to believe I *wasn't* looking at Andy himself.  He recreates some of the best and most famous of Kaufman's performances and if you loved or hated them originally, you will feel the same here.However, after the recreations of what I already knew, I was hoping to see what led Andy to perform the way he did.  What motivated him?  Why was he so dead set against ever letting the audience in on the joke (his one-upping the executive after the Fridays staged argument)  These questions the film doesn't answer.  Perhaps this is in keeping true to Andy's enigmatic persona but in a bio-pic I expect these kinds of revelations more than just finding out the truth about him & Jerry Lawler.Speaking of the wrestling.  Way too much of this too-short film is dedicated to Andy's wrestling career.  Now, in all fairness, too much of Andy's life was dedicated to his wrestling career as well, but that doesn't mean the filmmakers have to make the same mistake.Here's to hoping there is a 3 1\/2 director's cut lying around somewhere that gives more background on this fascinating performer. "},{"date":"4 January 2000","review":"  Here's another example of a weak flick made by a director who should have done better.  I got the feeling that some studio exec someplace didn't like the 3 hour version and chopped it all to hell.  This is a movie with no substance at all.  None.I came out of this film excited to see some more of Kaufman's work.  He seemed to be a very interesting character.  But, this movie was just one gag to the next, with no substance in between.  There is no depth to this character who was obviously so deep, and talented.  All that we are shown are his gags.  Where's the rest?  Where his humanity?  His gags suggest he was an interesting guy, deep, angry, funny, and a born entertainer.  We see him entertain, but get no explanation as to why he MUST entertain.  The entire film seems unmotivated.  For Forman of Amadeus, Cuckoo's Nest, this is a departure from everything.The wholes in this film will cost Carrey an Oscar.  it's unfortunate, because this could have been one of the better acting performances in recent years.  Instead it's just Carrey playing a different comedian. "},{"date":"5 January 2000","review":"  It's a shame this movie isn't making more money because it's obvious that it was a labor of love for many people, especially Jim Carrey.  He does a great job as Andy Kaufman, capturing the man's voice and all of his mannerisms. If you've ever seen any of Kaufman's actual material (i.e. Taxi, I'm From Hollywood), you should be able to really appreciate Jim's portrayal.

This contrived tale - of a New York auctioneer who discovers himself suddenly kneedeep in the criminal shenanigans of his fiancé's mafia-related family - attempts to derive its humor from the incongruity of a stuffy, nervous nelly Brit trying to cope with and fend off a bunch of tough-talking Italian thugs. Unfortunately, the screenplay wheezes its way through one heavyhanded plot contrivance after another without provoking more than a few halfhearted snickers from the audience.Hugh Grant dithers tiresomely through his part with the customary frantic wimpiness that is fast becoming his predictable stock-in-trade. James Caan, in the one real casting coup, gets a chance to provide a straightfaced lampoon of his Sonny role from The Godfather and seems to be having a swell time doing it.Mickey Blue Eyes is a tolerable timewaster, but for a first rate comic twist on all things mafia, check out Analyze This instead.

What i expected and didn't get from this movie was a backstory. I didn't want to watch Jim Carrey pulling Andy's stageact and his legendary pranks. I expected his passion articulated on screen.  If you like E! entertainment story type bio pics, you'd enjoy man on the moon, but it's a clunger for anyone expecting to understand the real Andy Kaufman.

Now I must say that Rushmore has a solid place in my top 10.The viewer gets to experience the whole gamut of interpersonal relationships through the relationships Max experiences with Mr. Blume and Ms. Cross. Wes Anderson superbly and subtlely portrayed those emotions on film.So many people who have seen the movie have said they just can't stomach Max's character.  I think they miss the vulnerability he so astutley covers up.  I think Max is really just an overachiever who misses the love of a mother who died when he was very young (which may explain why he yearns for the love of Ms. Cross-an older woman).I thought a highlight of the film oft over looked was its music. The twins' birthday party scene showing Blume stoicly tossing golf balls in the pool whilst his wife is flirting with another man across the way over the Kinks' 'Nothing in this world can stop me thinkin bout that girl' was just magnificent.  A scene that sends the chills down my spine every time is when Blume claims Ms. Cross is his Rushmore and Max replies while walking down a grass incline, I know, she was mine too. as the Stone's 'I am Waiting' begins.  That song says it all and you really feel pity for Max's apparent defeat.Brilliant film making in innumerable ways, I can't wait for the next Anderson\/Wilson serving.

When I first read this I was questioned it mainly because I didn't think it was a very good film and there actually was plot devices that were needed (i guess) for the film to move forward... but this is not a review of Speed. Ever since that article came out I have been wondering what an American film that told it's story through visuals would be like. Jean-Luc Godard of course has done films like this throughout his carrier, as has Wong Kar Wai, but it hasn't been possible for American directors to be able to do so, what with the demands of capatilism. Mike Figgis, with The Loss of Sexual Innocence, has been able to do just that.The photography by Benoit Delhomme was the most beautiful photography that I've seen in a film this year, which is a high praise considering Besieged and American Beauty and Fight Club were all this year as well.Figgis was able to do away with the need for dialogue, as most of the movie is either silent or in multiple languages without subtitles, but the story is displayed beautifully via the picture compositions and the structure of the film.By far one of the best films that i have seen. the images have and will continue to flood my mind the same way i might mentally revisit some of my favorate works of art by Bonnard or Picasso. "},{"date":"17 January 2000","review":"  Election defies the trend of recent high school adolescent movies by treating different subject matters than the traditional teen themes of popularity, horror, sex, and relationships.  Alexander Payne's film focuses on a variety of topics, such as ethics and morals, ambition, and maturity. However, despite Election's examination of these more profound motifs, the movie lacks a center to combine these themes.  The film's story revolves around a school election that affects all of the film's characters in different ways and that ultimately dramatically influences their lives. While this election is the movie's main plotline, the film tends to wander off into the lives of the main characters outside of the election, especially Matthew Broderick, who plays a teacher in the school who has a somewhat peculiar interest in influencing the outcome of the election. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, is a student who is the leading candidate to be elected school council president.  Witherspoon gives a very convincing performance as a workaholic, fiercely determined student whose ambitions dominate her life.  Broderick's character is perplexing, as his actions concerning the election and his behavior in his personal life often lack rationality.  There are a few witty and politically satiric moments in the movie, but on the whole, the script is not very comedic or intelligent. Election is probably the best teen flick to come out in recent memory, but it could have been much more funny and interesting.  Two stars out of four.

I think the acting was very good and the writing was unique, but this could have been a 35 minute movie without compromising the story.  Also, I was painfully deceived by the placement of this movie in the video store and by the video cover summary.  This was touted as a comedy.........um, WHAT!  There were some humorous moments in this movie, but no more than Saving Private Ryan and just as close to being a comedy.

It's an animated film that should make the people at Disney feel inadequate.  It's not sappy or corny, it doesn't talk down to its audience and it feels like a real movie.  I forget that I'm watching a cartoon when I watch this movie, and that's definitely a big part of why it's one of 1999's very best films.  The animation is simple but beautiful, the characters are charming, the voice characterizations are fantastic (especially Christopher McDonald as Mansley and Harry Connick as McCoppin) and Michael Kamen's score is a revelation.  The Iron Giant is a first-class piece of filmmaking. "},{"date":"20 January 2000","review":"  Though I cringe at the thought of MTV supporting a high quality film, I must admit that Election was one of the finer films of the year, certainly the best film based in a high school environment.  Though the story and humor were obviously wonderful, what takes this film above most others was the realistic take on the experience of high school.  These actors and actresses looked and behaved as the situation would dictate. Though the movie is called a black comedy, which it certainly is, I think too often a movie that depicts realism is passed off as a so-called black or dark comedy.  The truth of our life is that in all things real there is a certain humor or absurdity.  Failing to recognize or ignore this humor is, in fact, denying reality.  Watching this movie with that in mind will enhance the enjoyment, I think.  Fine performances all around and much recognition to the director who painted this great picture.

Predictable all the way, but saved by it's extremely likeable cast Ethan Embry, as the daydreamer nice guy, Seth Green, showing off is talent in his part as a wigger and the photogenic Jennifer Love Hewitt, who has the part of perfect girl down to perfection. (Is there any other way to describe it? She really is that good at it.)Like most good films in its genre Can't Hardly Wait has many witty moments, pace and charm. The parallels with Fast Times At Ridgemont High are obvious.Seth Green as a white boy who really would rather have been a black boy is a very funny and to the point social comment. It's a shame, however, that the film can't break loose from the stereotypes that resurface in every teen comedy. There's the blonde bimbos who just look pretty and are armpieces to the jocks. There's the jocks who drink beer and pick on the nerds. There's the nerds who have big glasses and re-enact scenes from Star Wars and the likes. Why don't producers seem able to break away from those stereotypes? The moments where these characters are brought into play, the boring slapstick they engage in... Those are the moments where the film loses it's pace and that's why these films only brush upon interesting subject matter. This is also the reason why new generations won't be bored to watch until the end of this film in twenty years time. I know I changed the channel 30 minutes into Fast Times...Without the everlasting stereotypes and standard storylines (nice boy wants girl... nerd gets cheerleader for one night or forever more) this kind of film might actually distinguish itself. As long as that doesn't change the rating of this film is likely to remain stuck at 6.3, at which it is stuck right now. That's where the genre deserves to be as it is. I rate this film slightly higher at 7. "},{"date":"23 January 2000","review":"  Having recently seen Godzilla there is no doubt that Matthew Broderick should never again attempt an action film and should stick strictly with smaller works that center on characters. Here again he shows his subtle hand at understated comedy.  He is just fine as the teacher who is drawn into a high school election,  simply because he cannot stand to see the annoying, overacheiving,unopposed candidate for student body president win without a race.  That candidate is played by Reese Witherspoon, who is totally believeable as the high school senior with one thing on her mind;WIN...WIN...WIN.  THE injured bodies she leaves in her wake as she pushes through to her goal is what this movie is about. And in examing the price of success the movie examines much of what is wrong with a society that places its only value in success.Witherspoons impact on all those around her leaves them all damaged.  If they challenger her they are beaten down, threatened, and forced to submit.  After they are dispatched and she has moved on to the next contest, they are forgotten, irrelevant to the immediate goal. And they are left to repair whatever damage she has done. That is not to say the injured parties are not responsable. They are.  Their own weakness causes their eventual downfall, not Witherspoon. But when a problem rises up to confront her it is the amoral singelness of her purpose that gets her through.  The others fall because they have a morality.They have an occassional weakness of the flesh.  She does not. This of course speaks volumes about our current politcal system.  Dont we all feal that most of our leaders, those that have risen to the top are nothing but a bunch of amoral, issueless, pointless, driven, self-centered,attention seekers, whos opinions change with the latest public opinion poll, and who wouldnt take an unpopular moral stand on anything even if their lifes depended on it.  This is Witherspoons character. Her whole being is one of connections, networking, and using people.  If your own board great. Until you are no longer needed.  If you oppose her she will try to crush you for no other reason than you stand in her way.  A great social commentary on what I believe we all feal about our political leaders.  There is not a real person in the bunch. Ironically her two opponents in the election eventually get exactly what they have always wanted.  Thats because they were no real opposition to Witherspoon.  They were just there as something of a joke.  For Witherspoon its real,  and she knows who the enemy is, and the enemy pays. And once the enemy is dispatched........well its on to the next contest.  She never looks back.  And cares nothing about the consequenses of her acts.  Thats because there is no morality in her game.  There is only one thing;WIN...WIN...WIN. Great charecters and a great script make this a good move.Not in the top 250 of all time...and I suspect as it ages it will disappear from the list. Still a good movie and worth an EIGHT...... "},{"date":"24 January 2000","review":"  This film is about a struggling movie producer, Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), who decides to make a movie with one of hollywood's biggest actors, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). The twist is that Bobby can't get Kit to sign a deal so he and the other cast members decide to shoot the movie anyways by taking video shots of Kit in his everyday life without him knowing and piece it together to make the film. I think it would have been better for Eddie Murphy's career if he didn't know he was in this movie cause thats how bad it was. Probably the worse movie I've seen with Eddie Murphy, as for Steve Martin, well when was the last time he was in a good movie? Planes,Trains & Automobiles... 1987. If you have 2 hours to kill or need a good movie to fall asleep to, then yes this would be a good film, Otherwise leave it on the shelf at the video store.

Being understood was not his aim, so let's explain the humor anyway so now everyone can get the joke. Jim Carrey, over-understood comedic gurner, gets paid a salary in the tens of millions to fight the Kauffman cause.... Perhaps putting the movie in a context was not the best way to proceed.....Carrey is in every scene. Perhaps they could have paid him a bit more for a little less.. The film was stocked with an interesting group of supporting characters, many playing themselves (which is always a good start) none of which managed to get a significant word in.Great subject matter, poorly handled by both the director and writers and with a central character played by an actor without the required range.  "},{"date":"26 January 2000","review":"  The Loss of Sexual Innocence is about the way the world breaks us from our sexual innocence and moves us further away from the Garden of Eden.  We follow the life from young boy to man of Nic and his experiences that one by one moves him further from his own Garden of Eden innocence.  Spliced into this story is a telling of Adam and Eve (for those that didn't get the point of the title).  It is by far the most beautifully shot segment, though not very subtle or original for that matter.  There is also a third story line (you get the idea that maybe the writer learned how to tell a story by watching Fantasy Island or Love Boat?  Three Three Three stories for the price of one!  Too bad they couldn't get John Ritter and Charro to play Adam and Eve.)  The third story is about twins separated at birth who see each other years later in an airport.  No longer unique, the twins face a...you got it...loss of innocence.  These stories are complicated by flashbacks and dream sequences.

Whether this is by accident or intention I won't pretend to know, but watching this film is quite an interesting and enjoyable experience. Rather than filling the screen with explosions and forecasting every plot twist three or four times so even the least attentive viewing will get the point, this film takes a different approach. It wraps the viewer in ambiance and possibility, leaving them to determine the meanings and possible meaning of the events. It's nice to find a film that doesn't hold a low opinion of viewers. We don't have to be taken by hand and walked through every scene. Imagination and subtlety are also part of film, and I for one am glad to see films like this that challenge and respect the audience.

I thought the movie was boring and only watched the whole movie to see if it got any better.  Like some people have noted, it is not for everyone. "},{"date":"1 February 2000","review":"  Despite a great performance from Jim Carrey, this feels more like a greatest hits collection of Andy Kaufman performances than any serious attempt to examine him or try to understand him. Some people have said that by not trying to psychoanalyze Kaufman the filmmakers show admirable restraint and point up the fact that we can never truly know anybody or their motives. Fine, but in that case why make a movie? Without an angle or a point of view to it, a biopic is just dull. Books and\/or documentaries remain the best way to chronicle a person's life - and in Kaufman's case, there are several good examples of both (books Lost in the Funhouse by Bill Zehme and Andy Kaufman Revealed by his friend and writing partner Bob Zmuda; documentaries Comedy Central's Salute to Andy Kaufman and, if you're interested primarily in his wrestling exploits and his bouts with Jerry Lawler I Come From Hollywood - and there are others as well). With so much information out there about the man, this movie just feels redundant and unneccesary.  "},{"date":"2 February 2000","review":" (Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.)I wonder if the feminists have discovered this movie and if so, what they think of it. How could they not discover it since it has won a number of awards, including seven Academy Award nominations? Yet, I wonder, because the movie is deeper than might be thought on first blush, and it reverberates, but not with any simplistic sexist answers to the human struggle, but with uncomfortable questions, disturbing allegations.Allegation number one a woman can rule and be the equal of a man, but she must suppress her feminine instincts. Uncomfortable question number one are women as vicious and murderous as our demonic males?What makes Elizabeth such a wonderful movie is the uncompromising portrait it presents of a woman in a life or death struggle while in a position of power. Notice that she does NOT become a man, nor take on bogus or pseudo masculine traits to achieve her ends. She remains a woman to the core, yet acts with the kind of aggressive, decisive, brutal intelligence usually assigned to men.Next question Is this good to know?A great work of art should be content to ask the great questions, not presume to answer them.Cate Blanchett is superb in the title role and wonderfully supported by Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes. Shekhar Kapur's direction is without a hint of cant or even the slightest pandering to a mass audience, and is psychologically true and without any presumption to moral or spiritual wisdom. There is no preaching or taking sides. The script is a work of scholarship fused with the most compelling dramatic development, climax and resolution. The editing is almost invisible yet we can see that exactly enough was cut away while the essence was preserved; viz., it is remarkable how we are led to experience the political growth of the young queen and see her take on the attributes of her father, as necessary, and then see her seek refuge in the church and a kind of piety as the Virgin Queen in such a short period of elapsed screen time. THAT is film making of the highest quality.Not enough can be said about the subtle, charming, expansive, vivid and veracious performance of Blanchett, yet Joseph Fiennes is to be commended for achieving success in a difficult and unsympathetic role. Geoffrey Rush's restraint and control in a part that could have easily been overplayed was highly admirable and contributed strongly to the success of the film.This is not to say that the film is without flaws. The scene where Elizabeth discovers the French duke's homosexuality is unlikely as staged, and her risqué behavior with Leicester not in character. Better, I think, would have been to keep him frustrated and allow him only to play at love; however, today's audiences seem to demand coitus always. Leicester's dalliance with one of her ladies was extremely stupid, but in character. The co-incidence of her wearing the acid dress as she betrayed her queen was a delicious if implausible irony. Further it was not made clear how the queen's commands through Walsingham are made viable so that they must be carried out; indeed the under struggle among the ministers was glossed over, although her dismissal of the no longer effective Sir William Cecil was aptly done.(Of course I can presume to answer my queries.) I think allegation number one, that a woman as a ruler must abandon her normal sexual drive is true, but the argument is too long for this space. Are women as vicious as men? They don't take the foolish chances that men take, since they can be reproductively rewarded only by staying alive and securing a stable future, whereas men can reproduce prodigiously for a while and then die successfully. But when necessary, women can be as brutal as Genghis Khan, as Elizabeth demonstrates.Is it good to know that women are also vicious animals, when all the time we would prefer to think of them as fairy tale princesses? Well, something's lost and something's gained in growing up; but, yes, it's important to always keep that in mind when out there in the big world. I might add that it is sobering to realize that women as reproductive animals was not even addressed in this film. Therein lies another dimension of femininity that needs exploration...

Will offend most people because of the adult content, but it's necessary for such a truthful and poignant story. ****  out of four "},{"date":"6 February 2000","review":"  I saw this movie when it first hit theaters and then again on video a year later.  The first time I saw it I remember hating it and I couldn't understand why it became such a cult classic with practically everybody.  I seemed to enjoy it a bit more on the small screen, perhaps because of the new venue, it seemed a bit slicker than what I recall, however, I can't get past the fact that Keanu Reeves is a lousy actor, and what's worse, that The Matrix is a great idea gone horribly wrong.The Matrix is the story of a computer geek who sells bootleg software to the underground market.  We are never quite sure what he is selling, but we know it must be good because his clients are paying top dollar to get it.  Reeves is Neo, an unsatisfied software pusher who is contacted via his computer, by a group of action heroes who are somehow able to dodge bullets and clobber anyone in their path.  These hooligans, headed up by Laurence Fishbourne, claim that they need Neo's help, and promise him the truth that he has been searching for.  Before he can make up his mind, the authorities are hot on his trail, threatening untold danger if he doesn't turn his new friends in. Neo is offered the truth in the form of a pill, a la Alice in Wonderland.  One pill will show him the light, the other will allow him to return to his day to day world.  Of course he chooses the light.  The light, as it turns out, is that we are living a false life.  We are actually hundreds of years ahead and we are being kept in a state of incubus.  Our minds are controlled by a computer program that lets us imagine that we a members of the 20th century.  And that's just the beginning.  The Matrix is a nicely styled action flick, offering some neat special effects and a seemingly cool plot.  As stories go, this one is brilliant.  But The Matrix is far from perfect.Let's start off with Keanu.  As one of the worst actors ever to rise out of Hollywood, this guy grunts and groans his way through his part, acting as an extension of his old Bill and Ted character.  For an action star this would normally be fine, but Reeves takes himself far too seriously (as usual) and his deadpan wit is no where near as funny as his contemporary, Arnold Schwarzengger.  What's worse than Keanu's bad acting?  Well, his bad acting happens to be the best acting in the entire film.  All of the supporting stars, including Fishbourne, over act their way into oblivion, making what should have been an interesting premise, seem silly and trite.  And just when you think it can't get any worse, the big finale arrives.  I got the feeling that the writers\/producers ran out of neat ideas, or perhaps they just felt that this was going no where so they decided to really screw things up.  I won't spoil it, except to say that this flick turns from being too serious to being too outrageous.In the end, The Matrix is nothing but a big let down.  However, I can't argue with the overwhelming response from fans everywhere who have already taken this film to cult-like status.  Maybe I'm just not in touch with today's movie going public.  Or maybe I just took a different pill than everyone else. "},{"date":"7 February 2000","review":"  Bedrooms and Hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival.

They also go on a 'hunter gatherer' weekend with hilarious results. Trust me, you'll laugh your teeth out.

To begin with, Meg Ryan practically defines cuteness. Even at thirtysomething she is cute enough to fawn over, bless her heart; and Jean Stapleton as her bookkeeper and her mother's bookkeeper-adorable. The clever old gal even bought Intel at six-just adorable! And can Tom Hanks ever handle this? Play a male lead with property and money and a bad dye job? Piece of cake. I mean, just behave and you are plenty eligible and totally adorable yourself. Throw in a dog and some cute kids and a fairy tale New York, and what have you got? You've got corn syrup! That's what you've got. My lord, even Dabney Coleman is cute in this! (And don't you just love the way his bad dye job mustache matches Hanks' bad dye job hairdo?)This is a diabolical, cynical seduction of sappy-hearted lovers everywhere. Indulge. This is femme porn. Bring a box of Kleenex (actually the Ephrons anticipated this and put a few on screen, bless their hearts) and some bon-bons. Know that the female lead will find true love, money and life-long security simultaneously after going through some real fun misdirections en route. Muggers in New York? AIDS? Cockroaches? Crack cocaine? Summer swelters? Dirty snow? Garbage strikes? Smelly, polluted Hudson? Odoriferous poverty? I mean, get real! Even the two roommates that our lovers dump are going to live happily ever after. Do we experience heartaches? Does love bite? Diss off! This is the yellow brick road in Olde New York, and it feels just like mainlining heroin.Best line As Hanks reveals himself to Meg he uses her email handle and says, Don't cry, Shopgirl while the sound track prompts our tears with Somewhere over the Rainbow. I mean, this is a BIG HANKY kind of movie!In summation, the cute speed limit was greatly exceeded in this Pollyannish feel-gooder, and I am imposing the following fine on Director Nora Ephron 200 hours of community service in the ladies powder room of the Bronx welfare office, and a promise never to do anything like this again, no matter how great the temptation.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Although this movie takes place some twenty years before I grew up, many of the mores still exist.  For instance, in the 70's and early 80's coal mining was still a dominant market force in southern WV.  Both of my grandfathers were coal miners who worked much of their life underground. Children were primed and expected to work in the mines if they intended to continue to live in southern WV as adults.  This movie strikes an interesting and true-to-life account of a typical southern WV coal mining family.  While watching this movie, I felt transported back to my childhood days, remembering what it was like to wonder if I would be relegated to working in the coal mines.  But, like Homer, I too was able to choose a different path except that I had my father's blessing.  Needless to say, I was moved and touched by this movie, however, I do believe there were great things about growing up in the WV mountains that were not explored in the movie.

You're too far out from high school to take this movie seriously.Now, there are two types of people under 30.  The first category are the teen-movie lovers --  those who laughed out loud at American Pie, boogied to 10 Things I Hate About You, and even misted up at the unlikely finale of She's All That.  It doesn't matter that some of the dialog is campy, the events don't make too much sense, the sentiments aren't profound, and sometimes the hijinks don't resemble anything that ever happened in any high school anywhere.   The movies are good fun, a nice reminder of a simpler time.For these people (myself one of them), Can't Hardly Wait is great.  It's funny, it's got Seth Green, a personal hero, and it has great intertwining plot lines held together by photogenic actors and actresses.  Bug-eyed Ethan Embry is at his best here, as is Melissa Joan Hart as a yearbook-obsessed kook and little Charlie Korsmo, all grown up, as the resident geek who finds fame lip-synching Paradise City.  All of the stock characters are represented -- the jock, the nerds, the beautiful cheerleader,  the shallow best friends, the white wanna-be homeboys -- but, as in American Pie, are given enough human dimension that they're plausible and fun to watch.  The movie's entertaining from start to finish, refreshingly irony and angst-free, and the ending is cute as can be.The other type of people under 30 are those who take their movie-watching very seriously.  They don't have time for fun, silly movies, and they viciously rip them apart because they aren't perfect.  They hated American Pie because it had semen humor, they loathed 10 Things because it blasphemed Shakespeare, and they wouldn't think of buying a ticket to a movie called She's All That.  That sort of person should avoid this movie like the plague.  If it's playing at a party, leave the room, you're only going to spoil it for the people born *with* a sense of humor.So, all you category-one youngsters, enjoy Can't Hardly Wait.  All you category-twos -- lighten up, start slow (maybe Breakfast Club), and sooner or later you'll learn to enjoy life.

Max is such a little whiny megalomaniac, and Blume is even worse, but I think anyone who fails to sympathize with these guys is completely missing the point. They're so laughably pitiful that the movie doesn't even need to make proper jokes' to be funny, and I think this went over many people's heads.  Rushmore is the most cynical goofy parody of real life that I have ever seen, but there's a disturbing amount of truth to it.

I was a bit put off by some of the historical details, such as the soldier Reich's Billy Idol hairstyle and the dialogue that was decidedly NOT antebellum (The Colonel kept saying, Wow!). Would the U.S. Army really let a soldier get away with smoking loco weed and taking peyote in the 1840s? I don't know.Anyway, the Eat me quote that flashes on the screen at the beginning of the film should tip anyone off that the film is intended to be tongue in cheek (appropriate considering the subject matter).

Not only is it beautifully filmed and acted, it achieves a certain wit, grace, and heart missing from most film today.  I cannot recommend this movie enough. Rushmore is also an amazing look at adolescence in all its messy glory.   It's a telling look from the eyes of an academically challenged yet unconventionally talented 15 year old.  It's also about true friendship that crosses age barriers, and the ability to maybe find redemption and meaning in an unsure and sometimes indifferent world.  Fantastic...don't miss it.

Shawn Hatosy plays a high-schooler from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, whose lifestyle of hanging around, smoking up and joyriding is cut short by a car accident, prompting his exasperated father (Baldwin) to send him to prep school. There he encounters the elitism of the high class students who attend the school, makes friends with his fellow misfits and falls in love with the golden girl (Amy Smart) who eventually falls in love back. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Feels like this kind of movie has been done a million times, but Michael Corrente's sensitive direction and a script by Corrente and the Farrelly brothers (of There's Something About Mary fame) easily avoid most cliches and go straight for the heart. These guys sure know how to tap into the blue-collar American subconscious, and for the most part they get it right.

It's main character is a fifteen year old boy who might best be described as obnoxious, although he hides it under suave manners. So, the main character is not someone you can really relate with, he's almost a caricature. But the main theme of this comedy is change. And Max Fischer does change. It is his development from the obnoxious boy in the beginning of the film, to the reformed young man in the ending, that made me like the film so much.

Every detail is carefully placed to make you run.This film deserves to be remembered many years later.  "},{"date":"20 February 2000","review":" This is quite simply one of the finest movies I have ever seen. It has incredible pace and flair, with both the script and the direction demanding equal attention. And it just works so well on so many levels. Whilst it is a political satire, it also stands well as a story in its own right. It's great to see Matthew Broderick in a good film. Reese Witherspoone turns in what I consider to be a career-best, and Chris Klein is wonderfully endearing as a jock with a heart of gold.What I really love about Election is the way its pace doesn't let up at all. By the time you've finished you feel like you've seen a good two and a half hours of movie. It's the only film I know that seems longer than it is in a good way.This film made me laugh out loud more than any other I can remember that isn't just a dumb comedy. But Election also doesn't take itself too seriously. The direction can accurately be described as deadpan - with Chris Klein, stripped of his ability to play football, gazing soulfully out to sea, and falling asleep over a book on philosophy. The way that each major character is afforded a voice-over, giving us an amusing insight into their psyche, is a wonderful technique, and the freezeframes of Reese Witherspoone's contorted facial expressions truly are moments to treasure.What more can I say? Election is smart, funny, and biting. It maintains its brilliance for the entire duration of the movie, and the ending is wholly satisfying. In fact, I can't actually think of one word of criticism. You'll have to search long and hard to find a better film anywhere, which is why I'm giving it a stellar nine out of ten.

Andy Kaufman isn't interesting enough that you feel like spending an evening with him, not even in cinema. It would be good for a semi-documentary (IF - I want to see the real Kaufman, too!), but Forman decided to bring his life onto a big picture - with all the ingrediences you need to reach the masses, especially the pathetic stuff. Infortunately it doesn't work here. The film can't tell me where is the special significance and the importance of Kaufman. He provoked the TV-public with his artistic and humoristic extravaganzas, Forman says, and he is right, but he did it in an era, in which the public was already accustomed to nonsense in TV programs. In fact, Kaufman didn`t hurt existencial taboos of society, but just the feelings of some of its members. There was a documentary about the Sex Pistols on the Berlin Film Festival, where the anachronisms in society (monarchy and british hypocrisy vs. punk phenomenon) is shown much clearer. If you mind the circumstances (wrong subject, wrong type of film), Forman even made the best out of it... "},{"date":"23 February 2000","review":"  I am just puzzled why so many people are so strongly opposed to The Loss of Sexual Innocence.  This movie was absolutely stunning.   The photography and music were breath-taking, and I enjoyed its Adam and Eve sequences, which have proved to be unpopular with the majority of the public.  The scene in which Adam and Eve get photographed and exploited by the paparazzi was a little bit much, but only a little. Also, the Twins (both played by Saffron Burrows) sequence was the most beautiful in the movie, particularly when both women meet eye to eye. That scene is what I remember the most about this movie. The fact that Mike Figgis created an international movie with sparse dialogue is really amazing.  It was like watching a contemporary silent film and Figgis allows the viewer to fill in the blanks.  I can't say that I understood the movie completely (I saw it more than 6 months ago and can't remember everything), but I felt very absorbed into it. It just astounds me how so many people criticize this movie as being pretentious.  It may have been self-consciously arty at times, but so what?  The films of Stanley Kubrick could be justifiably labeled the same way, yet we hail him as one of the best filmmakers of all time.I recommend The Loss of Sexual Innocence to everyone.  "},{"date":"24 February 2000","review":"  I thought this film was fairly good, not brilliant but by no means bad. Someone told me it was really bad so I was pleasantly surprised by it and gave it 7\/10. It is very funny; no side-splitting moments like Austin Powers 2 or American Pie but a continuous stream of above-average funny moments which do not pass unnoticed. The story line is comparitively boring and you can tell that the actual election is not going to be the major climax of the story like it would be in a more mainstream box-office high-school comedy. There is also a subplot focusing on Matthew Broderick's personal life which I found pretty boring (yet underdeveloped). The main strengths of the film would have to be its humour, the direction is also good with some innovative ways of introducing the characters. The characters, although stereotypes, are well drawn, pleasing to watch, amusing and well acted. Reese Witherspoon is spot-on as the prissy overachieving Miss Perfect and Chris Klein reprises (or pre-prises?) his American Pie role of a dumb but very likeable sports star. The part of his sister is very interesting and not exploited quite enough.All in all it's pleasing enough and funny, but there seems to be something vital lacking which makes the film easily forgettable.

There is just something so endearing and enduring about this little film.  First off, John Waters (writer and director) is brilliant. Can you think of a better name for a strip club than The Pelt Room? And I'll let you find out for yourself what teabagging is. The characters are all so likeable, even the ones who are at odds with one another. The dialogue, set ups and situations are so creative, irreverent and borderline (OK, cross the border) tasteless, that you have to love them. There's little I can say that won't ruin something.  Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, and Lili Taylor (Joe lies!) are the headliners, but the smaller parts pull this gem together. Pecker is wonderful in the same way Raisin' Arizona is. And, hey, it's got Patty Hearst (Yes, that Patty Hearst) and an actress named Mink Stole in it.

Stunts like reading the whole of The Great Gatsby in a mock British accent and having an old woman seemingly die on stage during a performance were standard Kaufman fare.\tYet another product of Saturday Night Live, where his act lip-synching to the Mighty Mouse theme became legendary, not to mention his terrible impersonations using only his foreign man voice, Kaufman based his humour on rib kicking assaults on what the audiences demanded of him.\tIt's a wonder he got any work at all!\tApparently, I don't remember seeing Kaufman, he essentially had a blissed out, hippie like demeanor; a sort of a silly boy determined to make you laugh at something that was just not funny, even plain stupid.\tJim Carrey certainly doesn't portray Andy Kaufman as a dill brained hippy though, although he certainly does impress upon us that Kaufman's motivations were not definable.\tThose who know tell us that Carrey's Kaufman was uncannily like the man, but I get the feeling that Carrey was unable, or unwilling, to give Kaufman innocence.\tBut then the feminists who closed down Kaufman's myriad and increasingly lurid wrestling contests with women probably wouldn't attest to his innocence!\tAnd it seems that Kaufman, who delighted in controversy, would have loved the women howling at him from the side of the wrestling ring, as he would have found it terrific that we still don't know what the hell he was on about.\tMan On The Moon becomes the Jim Carrey Show. It's split time structure and unlikable main character leave its audience antagonised and just wanting to slap Jim Carrey. Kaufman fans would by definition be a strange and unconventional lot. They just might love it. "},{"date":"27 February 2000","review":"  This film was sold to me as the German 'Trainspotting.'  Which I think is totally wrong.  The film has virtually nothing in common with 'Trainspotting' other than it is European.  Just because a film has a slight drug content and some dance music does not make it a 'Trainspotting' clone. This is the third film this year that has been sold to me as something 'Trainspotting'.  The other two 'Go' (American Trainspotting) and 'Human Traffic' (Welsh Trainspotting), were equally only vaguely linked with 'Trainspotting' by drug content and dance music.  All had different aims and messages.The theme of 'Run Lola Run' is not new, 'what if?' has been used in many other films before 'It's a wonderful life'.  However, this is an excellent addition to the theme.  I'm not sure about the 'Groundhog Day' similarity that has been mentioned.  That film, which I really like, was based on being trapped in a single day.  'Run Lola Run' is about the freedom and unpredictability of the future.The choice of only a 20 minute timeframe is very good.  It builds the tension even before the phone is put down.  How can anyone get DM100 000 in only 20 minutes?   Watch Lola try - three time.'Run Lola Run' is a wonderful film.  It has immense energy, is funny, and makes you think.  Visually it is amazing, and I guarantee that the image of Lola's red hair running down the street will stay with you.

It is packed with so many visually stimulating images that you may have a hard time keeping up. This film constantly gives the viewer exactly what they want by playing out the plot in three different outcomes.  It's one of my most enjoyable movie watching experiences because of its perfect mixture of action, comedy, surprises, and the human element. "},{"date":"29 February 2000","review":"  I saw this movie in the theatre and absolutely hated it ever since. Never, ever in my life have I seen a movie with such blatant disregard for common sense. Consider the event which sets everything in motion the radio contest. How does Ben Willis get on the radio to announce the contest? How does he know that at that exact moment that the girls would have the radio on, be listening to that station, and have the urge to call in and answer the question? Wouldn't it be easier to sneak into Julie's apartment and just kill her than to transport them to the island and time it just right for a huge storm to come?  Are we to believe that Ben Willis's son enrolled in college, gained Julie's trust and became her friend over the course of a year just to kill her? In my opinion, the whole premise falls apart within the first 10 minutes. Consider the part when Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is driving with his friend and they come across the body in the road. How did Ben know that they would be coming home that way, at that exact time to discover the body? What would have happened if another car came around the corner before them? This movie is absolutely loaded with garbage like this. If you stop and think about it logically for one second, the every scene in this movie falls apart. I cannot believe that someone was paid money (probably a lot) to write this horrible, horrible garbage. "},{"date":"1 March 2000","review":"  This is not a film for someone who wants to sit back and be mindlessly entertained.  It is a challenge to watch and an even bigger challenge to decipher.  However, this film is such a demonstration of where film can go (beyond a linear storyline and literal constructions).  It is patient and relaxed in its pace, is free to navigate through time and place.  At first glance it appears to be a random compilation of shorts, but it really is a powerful interconnection of dreams, memories, archetypes, and life.  What is most admirable about this film, though, is its confidence in its imagery (some of which is extremely powerful) and its minimal dialogue.  This is not a film that spoon feeds theme and gives us chatterbox characters to walk us through what is happening. To be honest, I have seen the film three times and still am not sure about what is happening at every point, but it does leave room for personal meaning that makes it priceless and so rich. How many films can it be said of that even after a third viewing you have not even begun to realize its full meaning?  There is much more said in the silence of Loss of Sexual Innocence that is ever said in any of its verbose contemporaries. "},{"date":"2 March 2000","review":"  First of all, I was a big fan of Andy Kaufman's, I enjoy Jim Carrey and I've seen 4 or 5 Milos Forman films that I would call great.  That being said, I do not understand the motivation for making this movie.Most of the scenes were just staged re-enactments of televised moments from Kaufman's career.  On that level, you're much better off watching one of the oft-repeated documentaries on Comedy Central or parts of the retrospective shown at the Museum of TV & Radio last year.  As far as the uncanny portrayal from Jim Carrey, I don't remember Kaufman as that blissed out.As for his off-camera life (what there was of it, which I suppose is almost the point of this movie\/exercise) some of those scenes were dreadful.  Like when Jerry Lawler & he are in Shapiro's office and Lawler says something like We really showed them, didn't we Andy?  I don't remember the exact line but things like that were so clunky you could hear them coming out of the typewriter as the writer pats himself on the back.There's kind of a built-in system from fans of Kaufman and\/or this movie that if you didn't care for him\/the movie, then you don't get it.  I was right there with Kaufman most of the time.  But there were other times when he really was neither funny nor interesting (like that one-time TV special of his - oy!).  Like every performer, he had his ups and downs.  Yet those in his camp seem a little too eager to think of him as a genius and thus won't say the emperor has no clothes and admit that everything Kaufman touched wasn't made out of gold.As for this movie, OK ... he's an enigma.  We get it.  That does make this script worthy of an audience for two hours.This thing was so stiff it made me rethink the whole creative principals involved and admit to myself that The People Vs. Larry Flynt was also a waste of time.   "},{"date":"3 March 2000","review":"  I thought Rushmore was original, touching, bittersweet, understated, lyrical -- all the adjectives Hollywood movies don't get anymore.  I have no idea how this movie got made.  I can imagine some studio executives hearing high school and comedy and thinking they're getting a raunchy sex-farce, but walking into this movie instead.  No nudity or gross-out humor, not even have the obligatory prom.  The shock must have been lethal.Rushmore is a litmus test of sorts.  The secret to understanding movies, I think, is identifying with the character.  Some characters are fulfillment of our fantasies (like, for example, James Bond).  Others show us parts of ourselves, sometimes things we admire, sometimes things we wish we weren't.  Max, Mr. Blume and Miss Cross, the stars of Rushmore, are unique because all of them mix fantasy and realistic elements.  Max is the energetic, razor-sharp individualist we wish we could be, but we watch him go over the line many times and suffer for it (fortunately, Max comes back).  Mr. Blume is outwardly successful (owns a steel mill, drives a BWM), but he's miserable until he meets Max and rekindles his enthusiasm for life.  Miss Cross is an intelligent woman who is given two choices first between Max and Mr. Blume, but ultimately her choice is whether she wants a relationship again or to stay faithful to her dead husband.Some people just don't get Rushmore -- it's a difficult movie to latch onto, and not always easy to like.  But in the end, everything turns out okay, and we all learn something about potential, aspiration and happiness. "},{"date":"4 March 2000","review":"  The ultimate quirky comedy!  But yet that fails to do justice to this masterpiece of humor and heart.  The story concerns Max, a playwrite at a prestigious prep school, who falls desperately in love with a pretty young teacher named Rosemary Cross.  Max has also made good friends with Herman Blume, a rich benefactor.  It now seems that Blume has also fallen for Ms. Cross and a rivalship between Max and Blume begins.The acting is fantastic, and the script is beautiful.  And what Bill Murray does with Blume is amazing.  The role would've been squat without Murray- who takes Blume's idiosyncrasies and depressive nature and makes them disarmingly hilarious.  Jason Schwarztman plays the young Max as an ambitious and utterly confident teen without a hint that you should even like him.  And Olivia Williams makes an impression in a small role as Ms. Cross.The movie is fantastic, daring to be original, and very, very funny.  One of the best movies of '98!

As the main actor KEVIN COSTNER (Billy Chapel) and  actress KELLY PRESTON (Jane Aubrey)  have done a very great acting in this  movie -  for which  I was very  impressed - they also possess the heart-of-acting.

Just don't expect to learn any real history from it. Many of the historical characters have been altered in their relative ages and arrival on the scene. Walsingham was not around in her early reign, Cecil was in his thirties at the time of coronation and counseled Elizabeth for most of her reign. If she had gotten pregnant by Dudley in her early reign, when she had very little support, do you think she would have survived? Would she be so foolish to risk it? There was never any 'Godfather' quality to her reign, where on a given day numerous enemies were executed Don Corleone style. That is ridiculous. The Scottish French queen resembles her historical figure in name only. On the other hand, the film captures the brutal power-grabbing nature of European politics of the day, the degenerate state of religion. Her early years were treacherous and she almost lost her head. Her rise to power and real control surprised the hell out of a lot of people. Since that is the focus of the movie I can buy off the revisionist stuff and enjoy the movie!

Witherspoon and Broderick play with an intensity that is rare in comedy.    Although the script takes a misogynistic outlook towards women, it's also unkind to men as being the perpetual and willing victims.   This moves along at a brisk pace and even though you often know where it's going, you enjoy the ride.  Full of wonderful touches like Broderick's elaborate set up for the one night stand that doesn't happen.

"},{"date":"11 March 2000","review":"  I've always said Cuba Gooding, Jr. is a great actor. I think I first saw him in Outbreak, where he was playing the role of Major Salt, and in that moment I knew he had a lot of skills, and he would make some good movies. Not many people saw A Murder Of Crows, but I did, and I really enjoyed it. He's the main character in that one. We all saw Jerry McGuire, and we all know how great his performance was, and he got the best recognition an actor can get for it.Anthony Hopkins, yet another excellent actor. After movies like The Silence Of The Lambs and a bunch of other great movies, we should expect something good if this man is acting. And with Cuba, I think one hell of a combination.Instinct is the kind of movie that even when it's not totally realistic (A man living with gorillas for 2 years?), it has messages that are absolutely right. For example, it says that we are not Free, or we do not have Control, and that we are the Takers.If we all think about it, we'll found out it's true. Hopkins found in the gorillas a group of things that he couldn't find in humans. The gorillas helped and defended each other. And they had a lot of peace in their territory. And when Hopkins was accepted in the gorilla group, and he started to live with them, even at nights, he was living better than in his old life.This movie also makes you angry, because the scene where those black men kill all the gorillas, and Hopkins kills some people, it's very sad and not fare. Also some of the guards are so mean, that it makes you want to kill them.I think the makers of the movie exaggerated a little bit about Hopkins behavior. He was acting like a gorilla, thinking like one, and attacking people like one. But after he talks to Gooding, Jr., we see that he can actually behave like a normal person.The scene where Hopkins tapes Gooding, Jr.'s mouth and forces him to answer his question (What have I taken from you? What have you lost?) it's great, and the answer is even greater. My control? No, you never had control. My freedom? No, you think you are free? My illusions? Yes, your illusions.The movie's ending is great and happy, which makes people like it even more. Hopkins escapes from prison (He wasn't really sick after all) and returns to the place he described first when talking to Cuba.I'll rate this movie with an 8 out of 10. I'd recommend it to anyone and it's really watching.

This is a bit of a cinematic in joke anyway as several of the cast (Purefoy, Ehle and Walter) have all starred in recent Austen adapataions.There are several belly laughs too - this is one for curling up with someone of the same or opposite sex, and having a cuddle and glass of wine whilst you enjoy it.

Stuck far from her world -- in a town without cable or cell phones -- Skye is befriended by Blue (Sexton) and meets the local gang -- five kids without much to do.

"},{"date":"17 March 2000","review":" A word about the back story of RAVENOUS, first Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski was originally hired to direct this picture on the strength of his critically-acclaimed anti-war film BEFORE THE RAIN.The original report alleges that after the first few months of filming, the brass at Fox, (who had initially and uncharacteristically decided to take a hands-off attitude for this film) saw some of the resulting finished product which was so unwatchable, that a high muckety-muck flew in personally to fire Manchevski outright. A short list of replacements was quickly contacted, and after several refusals, Antonia Bird (PRIEST) was hired to step in, partially at the suggestion of actor Robert Carlyle, who had worked with her on that film.Hence, the schizophrenic tone that the movie establishes from the get-go is kind of off-putting. The closest approximation I can come up with? Think of SWEENEY TODD sans Mrs. Lovett, cross-pollenated with a comedic take on the Donner party incident, directed by Dario Argento and scored by his favorite composer, Ennio Morricone. Bird's style of direction is similar with the way the gore sequences are shot, and the split of scoring chores between THE PIANO'S Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn produces something every bit as unique and affecting as any of Morricone's scores for Argento.With the film's unfortunately troubled history, the cast and director seem to have a tough time deciding whether this is more of a comedy or a horror film, the end result being that the viewer's feelings about it end up being more split than a lot of the bodies that end up sliced, diced and consumed through the course of the movie. Some commentary that links the American hunger for the consumption of the New Frontier to today's rampant materialism and consumerism is attempted, then suddenly dropped as if screenwriter Ted Hughes decided to say Oh, never mind right in the middle of the proceedings.At least an attractive (and tasty) cast makes it worth an evening. Captain Boyd (PEARCE), a disgraced war hero in the Spanish-American conflict is promoted to Fort Spencer , manned by a 'skeletal' regiment commanded by Jeffrey Jones (AMADEUS), deep in the mountains of California. He finds most of the staff bored to the brink of insanity, where a few members have actually gone over a long time ago, especially the character played by Arquette (he of SCREAM fame.)Things don't really start to get ultimately interesting or nasty until the arrival of F.W. Colquohon, (Carlyle), who stumbles into the Fort almost dead. Upon his revival, he graces them with a tale that just about rivals the Donner party's experiences, and has the men scurrying to make a foolhardy rescue attempt of a couple of alleged survivors. Throw in some Native American mythology about flesh-eating daemons, add a some of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE'S moral ambiguities and stir well.RAVENOUS wants to be all things at once and eventually ends up failing at most of them. However there are tasty morsels floating around that indicate what a true feast this movie could've been the just-barely-restrained performances of Carlyle and Jones; the tangy, twangy score that is as unique to this film as violin screeches are to Hermann's PSYCHO, the period setting adorned with touches of post-modern culture, (the prodigious drug use of Arquette's character; the neo-Adam Durvitz 'do sported by Pearce).Not a flick I'd recommend to the even-slightly squeamish, RAVENOUS probably has a bright future as a cult film amongst gorehounds, guilty pleasure buffs and MTV addicts.

It was a quantum leap beyond their previous efforts. Unfortunately, with this entry, they focused too much on those new aspects at the expense of their strengths. In fact, I do not believe this film was intended as a comedy. As such, Dumb and Dumber fans be forewarned. While I applaud this attempt at a heartfelt, personal film, the movie fails. The simple kids vs. establishment narrative is lame, the characters are stock and the inclusion of a handicapped brother seemed pandering and desperate to me. I did like the father-son relationship and Alec Baldwin's non-leading man turn as well as some of the well observed period details (Remember clackers? ---- I ,too, got Goodbye Yellowbrickroad as a Christmas gift).

It doesn't know if it wants to be a teen comedy or a Teen Afterschool special. This movie does not lack in teen drug use, which most of this movie is really. You didn't miss anything if you missed this in theatre. If you are a huge fan of the Farrely brothers, see it, If not skip it!!

The characters are typical, like the wisecracking cynical father, the picked on friend, and the underdog struggling to make his way whom we can root for. This wasn't a bad movie if you are looking for a few chuckles and are a fan of the Farelly Brothers. You may, however, be surprised by the heart that this film shows in the relationship of the broken family wounded by the untimely death of the mother.The best part of the movie for me was the soundtrack. Threaded throughout the film was nothing but the best music from the time. Nothing but the heavy hitters of the mid-seventies like The Who, Paul McCartney & Wings, Yes and many others. It truely sets the mood for the film and reminds the watcher how powerful the music of the time was.All in all, it is worth a viewing, although other seventies retrospectives leave the viewer more satisfied. 6 out of ten "},{"date":"24 March 2000","review":"  This mid 70's slice of life comedy is charming in spots, but mostly insubstantial.  It is the story of a working class teenager from Rhode Island named Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy) who is sent to prep school for getting into trouble with the police.  The story meanders through his exploits with his friends at home, his relationship with his father (Alec Baldwin), and his situations with his new preppy friends and with the evil headmaster.  The film has its moments, but mostly it is a nostalgic retrospective on prep life in the 1970's with little in the way of a plot.Having gone to college in Rhode Island in the 1970's, I can identify with the period, and Rhode Islande born director Michael Corrente, through the look and feel of the New England settings and the background music, did a good job of bringing back a flood of memories from that time.Shawn Hatosy did an excellent job in his portrayal of a working class teen, trying to make the best of what he considered a bad situation.  His acting, though not yet very polished, is very sincere and this part seemed to fit his personality well.  Amy Smart, as his girlfriend Jane, is a fresh face with a sweet look; just perfect for the nice girl role.  Smart also exuded sincerity so the screen chemistry between the two was excellent.Alec Baldwin finally found a role where his new paunchy look was an asset.  Actually, he was quite good as Timothy's rather crude dad, doing the best he could with limited intellectual assets.  Baldwin, who usually plays clever characters, gave a realistic and enjoyable performance of a working class stiff, though his accent was a little too stereotypical and not true to Rhode Island.I gave this film a 6\/10.  It relied too heavily on New England charm and there was just not enough story.  Though there were funny scenes sprinkled here and there and the ending was nice, it just lacked the horsepower to really keep the viewer engaged throughout.

From the grandmother with the Pit Beef stand and the talking statue to male strippers like Seafood Sam the Sailor Man teabagging their customers to Patty Hearst showing off her breasts in front of a mirror, everyone seems able to laugh at themselves.

However, there was something about this film in the back of my mind that made me revisit is a few days later.  When I saw Election the second time and finally realized this film was amazing.  For all its satirical hyperbole, Election is also a realistic film like no other.  This school looks like a school and the characters look like teachers and students--costumes, houses, cars, and haircuts.  I later watched the film with Alexander Payne's commentary and discovered that this film was made in a working high school in Nebraska, and most students and teachers in the film were actual students and teachers.  Election looks real.However, what makes Election an excellent film is its characters. This is not a film which gives us a good vs. evil with one character who we can root for.  Rather, every character is both good and bad.  Each character has good and bad traits.  This is real life.  Especially standout are the performances by Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell.  But every supporting role deserves accolades for their contribution to one of the most solid casting jobs in any recent film.  Finally, Election shines because it takes time to show the lives of these characters beyond the school setting.  Rarely are teachers given a dimension of being a real person--flawed and vulnerable like anyone else.  The same goes for the students.       "},{"date":"27 March 2000","review":"  I've never been a fan of Altman's but was drawn by the cast, the promise of a good comedy, and the good reviews; I returned the video still no fan of Altman's. The best part of the movie is Patricia Neal's wonderfully crotchety though brief performance as 'Cookie'. Glenn Close and Ned Beatty do good work also. Of note is Liv Tyler as Cookie's granddaughter Emma; her eye-catching performance shows this is an actress on the way up. The story line is interesting but the movie wanders around too much; it needs tighter direction and better editing. What comedy there is is a tad dry; it's certainly no knee-slapper. What is worthwhile is the out-of-left-field surprise ending; I was caught totally off-guard, though in retrospect I feel stupid that I didn't see it coming. It's a mixed bag; I've seen a lot worse movies lately but this is still a bit of chore to get through. "},{"date":"28 March 2000","review":"  I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of English period movies but this would have to be THE BEST English period movie that I have ever seen.  I don't know how historically accurate the movie was or, attempted to be.  The first thing that a movie should do is entertain, and from the opening credits with the chilling opera? music to the closing, Elizabeth had me.  The costumes, lighting, sound, script, acting---all were perfect!  A certain part of me had wanted to see this movie because of the hype and it did not disappoint!  Rating= 10 of 10 stars.  The kind of movie that, like a fine meal, will make you appreciate it long after it is over.    "},{"date":"29 March 2000","review":"  It took me about an hour after watching this movie to realize how much I liked it.  I was at first unsatisfied with the abrupt ending but after some pondering I realized what a unique and beautiful story it truly was. Unusually, you get to see a true love affair through the eyes of a man and it is just as touching and emotional.  The realistic sex scenes and arguments between Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly make it easy to forget that you are watching fictional characters.  The acting and direction of this movie are superb.  I would like to see Billy Crudup get an oscar nomination next year.  His is the finest performance I have seen in a while. "},{"date":"30 March 2000","review":"  This movie had incredible concepts! The chaos theory was brought into personal focus in this picture in a most intriguing fashion. The animation did not work for me, however (it seemed underdeveloped). There were other little quirks about this movie I felt didn't work, such as the magical, mysterious scream that the protagonist posesses, the sub-par dubbing, the the little melodramatic exchange between two sub-characters at a bank. This almost interupted the breakneck pace this movie contains; the pulsing electronic music arrived in the nick of time to save it. This did not deter any of the strong points of the movie from shining though an excellent central idea brought into focus through appropriate music, excellent cinematography and choreography, good use of common thread images, and surprise twists. I rate this as a must see for those who tire of the tried-and-true formula. Try to find it subtitled, if possible though. The dubbing sounds like that of a cheap Japanese animation short for kids!   "},{"date":"31 March 2000","review":"  This movie tickled my funny bone from the first minute. I thought the school kind of looked like my old school. Broderick and Witherspoon make this movie entertaining from start to finish. I especially thought the lesbian sub-story was funny too. I don't understand why this movie didn't receive more nominations like American Beauty received, but who knows. Klein is far more hilarious than he was in American Pie he had his moments in this story, and of course the ladies. Hollywood should really think of making more comedies like this than stupid goody good good high school movies where everyday is a fairy tale for all the heroes.

Goldie & Steve are great together and so is John Cleese. This film also takes place in New York (a big plus!). The only problem is that most of the jokes are only mildly funny or just amusing. Some scenes are hilarious though.Check this one on video. It gets 6 out of 10 from me.

She has had a horrible past with hints of abuse etc.....But afterwards, I listened to the directer's notes about the story. So much of this movie was poetic licence. Patch Adam's did not have a girlfriend who was murdered. Admittedly, in real life Patch Adam's best friend, a male was murdered, but why not tell this true story as it happened - not try to pull heart strings by making up a female who never existed. Throughout the story, the directer talks of scenes that they invented to make the movie more interesting. After listening to how much of the film was poetic licence my view of this movie has gone right down. "},{"date":"3 April 2000","review":"  I didn't know what to expect before viewing this film. Certainly the title gave no clues and was a bit of a turn-off. However, right from the start I found the story to be interesting. It had a lot of twists and turns that kept my interest throughout. It is one of those pictures that you are better not knowing anything, so I won't reveal any of the plot. Suffice to say this script made for enjoyable watching and I am surprised that other viewers did not rate it as highly as I did. "},{"date":"4 April 2000","review":"  What a bad movie this really was. In what seems to be the demon child of 9 to 5 meets any of a variety of horrible teenage coming of age drama\/comedies, Teaching Mrs. Tingle lacked anything worthy of making it a watchable movie. The plot was stupid, and didn't have the guts to go far enough to even qualify this film as horror. The humor was even worse. Don't lecture me on the brilliance of Marisa Coughlan's improvised Exorcist scene, it was as embarrassing and out of place as the rest of the humor in this so called dark-comedy. The only redeeming quality about this movie was Helen Mirren. How they got her to even play the part is an amazement, and it goes to show that truly great actors rise above the worst material. I applaud her performance, but question her choice of roles. I have to admit as well that while Katie Holmes is cute, and may have acting ability, this role is wrong for whoever tries to play it. What a wimpy, sappy, simply disgusting character, but then again, she fits right into this sad movie well. My advice to you, avoid this like the plague. "},{"date":"5 April 2000","review":"  MTV has yet to make a good movie. This was better than most of their productions, but they still have a long way to go. Mathew Broderick was generally funny. Reese W. was casted well, but her character didn't show to be very dynamic. This is an obvious case of people jumping on the bandwagon. This movie didn't deserve to be ranked so high.  "},{"date":"6 April 2000","review":"  This is an excellent baseball movie and a decent romantic entry as well.  Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a veteran pitcher with an accomplished career who is headed for the Hall of Fame.  On the day we meet him he has a lot on his mind.  He is informed that his team is being sold, he is being traded and the love of his life is moving to England.  Add to this the pain in his pitching arm, his impending decision on whether to retire and the fact that winning this game is critical in determining if the Yankees go to the playoffs, and you have a man with overloaded neurons.The story unfolds as an introspective retrospective.  As he is pitching this important game, he is thinking about his childhood, his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston) and how he is going to get the next batter out.  He is so preoccupied that it doesn't even dawn on him until the eighth inning that there have been no Yankee hits and he has been pitching a perfect game. The flashback elements are expertly woven into the game, giving us a genuine feeling for his distraction.  This is a fresh perspective for a sports movie.  Instead of simply focusing on what the player is doing, the film focuses on what he is thinking while he is doing it.  It gives us an authentic look at how athletes get `in the zone', filtering out all the noise and concentrating totally on their performance.  Those who have been involved in athletic competition can identify with this state, although only the best can achieve it at will.Sam Raimi's direction on this film was excellent.  His direction of the love story was nothing special, but he did a superb job on the baseball scenes.  The combination of on the field action, commentary by Vin Scully and simulated TV telecast footage was so well done that it was impossible to differentiate it from a major league game in progress.The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  Kelly Preston was very good as Jane.  She brought a full range of emotional expression to the part, though she sometimes got a little shrill, like the scene in the hospital where she screams out `Is this America?  Is baseball still the national pastime.'  Overall though, she played the part of the torn lover very well.Kevin Costner is no great lead actor and it is hard to understand why he is so popular.  Perhaps it is his whiny lost boy charm that makes women want to mother him.  In the love story, he again presented as listless and uninspired.  But in the baseball scenes, he came alive.  In fact, in these scenes Costner was not acting so much as acting out.  He loves baseball and was obsessed with doing all his own baseball scenes.  He is a top notch athlete, so he really could throw a curveball and his fastball had plenty of pop.  His ability to portray a professional athlete in this instance was superlative, probably due to his having played the game scholastically.   So overall, I would have to rate his performance here as very good.John Reilly gets a very honorable mention as Chapel's catcher.  He was quietly supportive and unobtrusive, the way catchers usually are.  He portrayed intense desire in a demure and low key way without overacting.  It was a nice performance by an actor in a supporting role playing a baseball player in a supporting role.I love baseball and this was a great baseball movie so I rated it 8\/10.  Anyone who enjoys sports will probably enjoy this film.  "},{"date":"7 April 2000","review":"  The great director Don Bluth once said, I'm not sure the world needs any more movies right now.  But if a man is going to go ahead and make one, surely the film he makes ought to offer something to the audience.  Apparently, Brad Bird agreed with him, for The Iron Giant offers everything you could want in a movie  adventure, comedy, drama, and even a few tears.  The animation, music and voices are on par with the story.  Perhaps the greatest achievement by the animators is making the CGI and traditional animation blend so seamlessly that you forget that the main character is computer-generated.See this film, and see it in its letterbox format to fully see the giant's physical relationship with everything around him. "},{"date":"8 April 2000","review":"  Let's be honest  90 % or recent American films are just formulas. There's no surprise, no sense of creativity.Director Auster is not part of it I saw his Smoke and it was very fine. Here, he sets a story a little bit away from Hollywood clichés. I love the many references to Louise Brooks and her film Pandora's Box. Sorivino, in the way miss Brooks was a femme fatale without knowing it, did the same thing with the same sense of innocence. And like the men in Pandora's box, Harvey Keitel goes crazy for her. Auster ads some strange parts which made his movie fascinating. This is what I mean by creativity and it's good to see that some Americans can still go on that way, while mainstream American cinema is such a bore. "},{"date":"9 April 2000","review":"  Although I didn't like For Love Of The Game the way I liked Bull Durham or Field Of Dreams, it's still a very entertaining film. Directed by Sam Raimi in a very subtle style, this is Costner's best film since Tin Cup. Raimi only shows flashes of his visual theatrics, Costner is very solid and I liked Kelly Preston very much. The way the story is told in the film is very fresh for a baseball movie and this is the high point for me. Baseball is just the background to a very touching love story. I hope this film more than anything else shows Hollywood that Sam Raimi is one of or greatest talents behind the camera. "},{"date":"10 April 2000","review":"  Lulu On the Bridge had all kinds of potential but didn't go anywhere near fulfilling them.  The actors were all of very high caliber but they were not given a story line that made any sense in the end.  Even trying to complete the story after the end of the film proved almost impossible.  There were so many possibilities the time needed to create a viable conclusion would be far too much even if one felt the exercise worth the effort.  "},{"date":"11 April 2000","review":"  This is John Waters best film to date. The characters are obvious and symbolic, just as in his other films. So there are no surprises or character changes. I enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story. It was good story-telling with honest people. "},{"date":"12 April 2000","review":"  I think alot of people who didn't like this movie either missed the point entirely or they aren't familiar with Hollywood. This was a great satirical look at Hollywood and the those who inhabit it. Steve Martin is probably one of the best comedy writers around today. And Eddie Murphy has finally made a movie where he's actually funny again. I thought Eddie Murphy's dual role was great, each character was halarious. See this film if you like comedy and satire. "},{"date":"13 April 2000","review":" If you have not seen this film then you may not want to read this as it gives away 1 minor plot change very early in the film.This film starts following a small time poker player(Damon) who is desperately trying to break into the world of the big players and his dream is to make it into the Poker World Championships.The story starts by following him to one of his normal games, where he tries to kick-start his career by playing much bigger stakes than usual and failing miserably.At this point I will stop to explain one of the points of the film that impressed me the most. All the way through the film you hear Matt Damon voicing over the thoughts and the mentality of a poker player. This gave a very interesting and unusual insight into the world of a man who is in his third year of paying his way through law school with money earned by poker playing, and who then loses all of his hard earned cash in one night of big headedness. You may not agree but then you may not be able to relate to them like me.We return after this event to McDermot (Damon) a good while later when due to lack of money he has had to take up a night-shift delivery job to pay his way, still lamenting his losses but having made a promise to his girlfriend(Gretchen) that he will never play cards again.However this is all turned on its head with the release from prison of his best friend Worm(Norton) who tempts Damon back to cards. A roller coaster ride ensues as Damon tries to pay back the loan sharks who are on Nortons back, all complicated by the fact that is a notorious mechanic.This is a form of cheating involving the grip of the cards enabling the dealer to deal cards off the bottom of the deck which is virtually impossible to spot.With an amazing script, notibly good performances by John Malkovich, Matt Damon and Edward Norton and a script that always leaves you wondering what is going to happen next.9 out of 10. "},{"date":"14 April 2000","review":"  Unfortunately, Waking the Dead will not win any awards in today's computer-driven special effect and in your face story-lines, this is a simple and beautiful love story that most the general public will find slow. The plot sounds boringly simplistic an up-and-coming politician begins seeing his thought-to-be-dead girlfriend everywhere he goes.  What we find, however, is a story about what it means to love someone devoutly, what it means to believe in yourself despite disappointing the ones you love and why as humans, we refuse to give up hope.  Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly provide amazing central performances, with an excellent supporting actress performance by Janet McTeer.  The music is excellent, and both the photography and directing are impeccable.  A somber film, but you will not be disappointed. "},{"date":"15 April 2000","review":"  I love Kieth Gordon films,  let me get that out of the way. They are intelligent,  thoughtful,  and heartfelt.  I'm rootingfor him.  But I was very disappointed with this film.  As thenew york times said,  There is no light in Billy Crudups eyes, and this kills the whole film.  The politics are skirted andslight at best,  and it relies on a love story which has nosparks.  The music is overwhelming,  as if Mr. Gordon is tryingto prompt us into feeling something that his actors aren'tproviding.  Perhaps if he had cast different actors and trustedhis audience a bit more,  the film might have worked.  As it is, I'm afraid it's just dull and lifeless.

They say it's cliched, and maybe it is.  But there's something basic and honest and very likable about the characters presented here.  The Characters make you love them, because they are good people, maybe a little mixed up, but good hearted. That seems to be a theme for the Farrelly Brothers....showing good, if dim people, on the road to happiness and redemption.I recommend Outside Providence it was very enjoyable.  I'm not going to sit here and blow holes in this or that.  It's a movie, so enjoy it... "},{"date":"17 April 2000","review":"  I can't remember why I rented this DVD.  It is a well-done movie, based on a book by a real addict and ex-con.  But it is packed with violence, graphic sex, and cursing.  So, it is not for those who avoid those types.  Had I known what all it was, I doubt that I would have rented the movie.James Woods and Melanie Griffith are very good in this.  As entertaining as it is at some points, mostly it is depressing to know that there are real people out there like the characters in this movie.  6 of 10 for what it is... "},{"date":"18 April 2000","review":"  It's pretty easy to see why this went straight to cable. Lulu on the Bridge tries desperately to be profound and mystical and ends up being a weird jumble that simply makes no sense. The cast is game and quite watchable, especially Harvey Keitel and Willem Dafoe, but the story is so convoluted that the viewer (at least this one) is left confused and disappointed.  "},{"date":"19 April 2000","review":"    From School Ties, Geronimo, to Good Will Hunting I have always loved Matt Damon's movies.  I even liked the Kevin Smith movies he was in!  Here he plays Mike, a law school student who is also a poker prodigy, and he plays for more money to pay his way through school.  Also, he tries to outsmart the enemy, Teddy KGB (played by John Malchovich).  I also liked John Malchovich's performance as the villain in this movie.  Gretchen Mol was good as Mike's girlfriend, too.  All and all, this movie was excellent. So, even if you are or you're not familiar with poker at all, this movie is still worth seeing.    I think this one was the best of all Matt Damon's movies.  I look forward to seeing more movies with him, soon!  I give this one 4 out of 5 stars! "},{"date":"20 April 2000","review":"  In viewing Rushmore for a second time, I picked up a lot of the little things in the movie that make it so great.  The pool scene with the Bill Murray character is one of the best directed scenes in the movie. You can feel his depression.  But the movie is so much more.  Listen to the way the characters talk to each other, react to each other, listen to each other. Its the way real people act, and unfortunately it happens all too little in movies. Also note the last scene (the dance) and how the director (Anderson)has assembled every supporting character there.  It truly is a smart film. "},{"date":"21 April 2000","review":"  I happened to see this film, for the second time, tonight on cable.The film is a bit of Hollywood teen fluff but, has many funny moments.Jennifer Love Hewitt is beautiful as always and, Seth Green steals the show as the wannabe gangsta.What I did find very odd about the screenplay is that the central character Preston (Ethan Embrey) seems to be fixated on Love Hewitt's character and part of the plot hinges on an obsessive letter he has written her about watching her for years and being fixated on her.In real life, not only is this behavior passive but alarming.If most men left such a letter for a woman they hardly knew, they would quickly find themselves on the wrong end of a restraining order.They certainly would not be rewarded for such behavior.This is what I find totally unbelievable about this film.I hate to say it but some people see things in films and believe that this the proper way to behave.I did enjoy it for the most part though!

This is a very funny movie that fully entertained me while I was watching it and that I'm glad I saw.  It's hilarious, I'm not kidding. Alec Baldwin is WONDAFUL!  He's such a good guy even when he's being stupid, and the I hope you never forgive me, then! scene really showed how much his character was dealing with.

"},{"date":"23 April 2000","review":"  If you need an example of how a director and script can make excellent actors perform flatly, this is the movie for you.Excellent actors Keitel, Dafoe, and Sorvino have their performances ruined by an indecipherable script and lousy direction.Save your money and your time. "},{"date":"24 April 2000","review":"  This movie proves my theory that any movie with a high gore content obviously has no story. And that's what you have here, no story what so ever. The Fisherman is killing people left and right in very sick and disgusting ways. Of all the people that killed, though, I would say only two of them did not deserve it, while all the other victims were annoying and I personally was just waiting for the Fisherman in the end. Another horrible thing about this movie is Brandy. She can't act (or sing for that matter) and whines about everything throughout the entire movie. The only people who have any talent in this movie are Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr., and let me tell you that talent is wasted beyond belief. The whole plot is just a rip off of the first film but somewhere along the line they put in these plot holes large enough to drive a truck through. I could say what they are, but if you scroll down the page, you'll find someone else has already pointed them out. If for some idiotic reason they make another Summer film, I could not see how it could get any worse.

This one has numerous cute and appealing perspectives, and makes you laugh often.  One minor but distracting error  the pay phone for a callback number has a 702 area code, which was formerly all of Nevada, yet the film is supposedly set in fictional Baxter, California.  (Reason is that it was shot in historic Goldfield, NV, which at the time actually WAS in area code 702, although it has since been changed and only Vegas is 702 now).  Watch Desert Blue -- it's well done, and you'll enjoy it. "},{"date":"26 April 2000","review":"  This film is an endearing look at a baseball player who might be pitching his last game after 19 years with the same team. After such films as Bull Durham and Field Of Dreams baseball seems to follow Kevin Costner as he returns to the diamond once again in For Love Of The Game. I enjoyed this film immensely not only because Costner is my favorite actor, but because he brings firey attitude to his character Billy Chapel. Costner is known for this as he brings it to every film he has been in.Sam Raimi brings a fresh attitude and look to the silver screen as the director of this movie. Raimi did a brilliant job unveiling the sequences as he did as the plot surrounded one game with flashbacks to Billy's on again, off again romance with Jane, played by the beautiful Kelly Preston.In addition, John C. Reilly who played Gus Sinski was a pleasant addition and surprise as he brought an excellent balance of calm and support to Billy. The best thing about this film was the monologue Billy carries with himself throughout on the mound. The only complaint I may have about this film would be the length; I think some scenes could have been edited out or cut down a little because the film shouldn't have lasted as long as it did. It was an excellent for what it was, which is a sweet, lighted hearted romantic drama. "},{"date":"27 April 2000","review":"  Reading the negative comments to this movie is the most baffling experience those who hate it seem to take action flicks as comparisons, talking about holes in the plot or whatever else that is pointless, failing to understand that this movie comes closer to poetry than most. Needless to say, the script is superb and Paul Auster shows to be a modern master of the literary genre, excelling as much on the screen as he does on paper (the scenes with Dafoe and Keitel are stunning, Dafoe telling the firefly story is memorable) this movie is all about reality and exactly because it feels so real it couldn't care less about realism. I watched Lulu with an open heart and it was all clear to me, all the words made perfect sense. But criticizing this Paul Auster gem because of your typical, run-of-the-mill Hollywood expectations is nothing but a crime. "},{"date":"28 April 2000","review":"  WARNING!

Robin Williams plays a man who's suicidal at first but with the help of patients, he gets this passion of wanting to help others.  When I rewatched this movie, I noticed that Patch Adams and I have a lot in common.  We want to help others and we're nice to women no matter how they treat us and just watching the movie, I put myself in Patch's place when he and Carin are together and it just makes me imagine.  The only part that really stunk was when Carin died.  That really broke my heart, especially when Patch cried over her coffin.  Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to everybody.

When Pecker came out I didn't think much of it, wasn't particularly interested in seeing it. Still, I rented it recently, and was purely shocked at how much I loved this movie. Truly the best John Waters movie I've seen. I wasn't expecting much, but after watching it, I found it difficult to enjoy the other movies I'd rented (Happiness and Breakfast at Tiffany's), finding none to be nearly as enjoyable as this had been. Mind you, this isn't a perfect work of art, I don't think it was meant to be. But it is a fantastic movie. "},{"date":"1 May 2000","review":"  Those who distill Passion in the Desert down to a guy falls in love with a leopard actually miss the point.  The interesting thing about this movie is not its unique and stark setting, or the strange match of its two protagonists, but the way the film manages to paint a metaphorical portrait of love and all the slings and arrows that go with it -- and it does so almost wordlessly.  The resulting film is curiously pure, strange, and unforgettable.Even the first act, which is more or less a conventional portrait of two men lost in the desert in Napoleonic times -- has a richness and poignancy (one man, an artist, drinks his paints in thirsty desperation, and the image of his paint-stained lips is haunting).But ultimately this is a movie about love, a sensitively told fable, gorgeously photographed, about a man who is first mysteriously protected by -- and then drawn to -- a wild she-leopard, and of the way the leopard begins to draw him into her world.  The movie isn't so much about men vs. leopards (or men with leopards! tabloid-style -- the movie stops short of portraying the affection between the two in the biblical sense, although there is some ambiguity there) as it is about the nature of love itself. The film paints some fresh, unsettling, and sometimes amusing portraits of the things people do when they're in love -- all the way down to the spitefulness and jealousy that come into play when that love is threatened.By the end of the film, the story has become almost Shakespearean in its depth and richness as the plot plays out to its haunting end.  At this point, the roles have almost reversed -- the man has become wild and catlike, and the she-leopard seems strikingly human and thoughtful in her expressions and her actions.  The film is the first I've ever seen which actually raises some uncomfortable and ultimately fascinating questions about the possibility of a human falling in love with an animal -- and it explores these questions gracefully and without sensationalism.All in all, Passion in the Desert was an exquisite film that really moved me -- the performances, both human and animal, are breathtaking and frankly amazed me, and the cinematography and music are glorious.  (Too bad there aren't animal Oscars -- the she-leopard in this film really gives an incredible performance.)  Bottom Line  If you're looking for something off the beaten path (no pun intended), this film's a keeper.

This film is no Our Town, but weaves the tale of a budding photographer (Edward Furlong) whose unusual images earns him fame as an artist to the New York art elite(including Lily Taylor), but comes at a price for his life in Baltimore.

"},{"date":"6 May 2000","review":"  The baseball sequences are as good as any I have seen in a movie, but the rest is as bad as any movie I have seen.  Unfortunatley the baseball part is not enough to make this a movie which could be recommended.  I have read the book and thought it too was a good book though not great which concentrated on the character of Billy Chapel as a baseball player and as an individual. The relationship with his girl friend was not as elaborate or complicated as that shown in the movie, but did depict him as someone who was dedicated to his baseball career, and though a decent human being did not really need anything or anyone else.  I saw this movie on DVD and the best part was the extras added about how the movie was made and the short film about Babe Ruth.  It did not seem to have any connection with the movie, but to a dedicated old time baseball fan was quite interesting.  What surprised me most was the fact that Costner did all of the pitching himself and in this manner aquitted himself as a good baseball actor though his acting in the other love sequences was not as convincing.   "},{"date":"7 May 2000","review":"  Matthew Broderick gives a sly, delightfully comic performance in a film that shows us what Ferris Bueller might have become later in life. The performances by Reese Witherspoon as an ambitious girl who wants to be class president and Chris Klein as a sweet, likeable lunkhead are also hilarious.The film takes the classic high school setting and turns it into a satire of human nature in all of its absurd shades. Ironies and dark humor are mixed with some broad slapstick to make a truly funny movie. "},{"date":"8 May 2000","review":"  Pecker is a very entertaining film, better than I had expected, actually.

If the stewardesses weren't standing by the door I would have opened it and jumped.  Why did this film suck so bad?  Where to begin?  Well, as someone mentioned earlier, why must Hollywood always make these cliched, lazy, baseball is a metaphor for life, films?  Kevin Costner  A man who displays as much range of emotion as a wooden cigar store Indian.  Kelly Preston  What, did Meg Ryan cost too much?  The screenwriters  If the story starts to sag, just dream up some new crisis and we'll go from there...(Kelly's unknown daughter runs away from home and Kevin must rescue her from a bad neighborhood; Kelly catches Kevin getting a massage from another woman; Kevin slices his hand wide open on a buzz saw and hurts Kelly's feelings in the process; Kelly gets tired of waiting for Kevin and finds herself an artsy-fartsy playboy to sleep with.  And Vin Scully....Vin, I hoped they paid you a lot to make this, because your reputation really sank in the estimation of a lot of us baseball fans.  Is your memory starting to go Vin?  How could you say that you hadn't seen a perfect game since Don Larson's in 1956, when you very famously called Sandy Koufax's perfect game on September 9, 1965 against the Mets.....remember?  (Swung on and missed, a perfect game!)  Ah well, Hollywood loves to crank out these formula love stories, and I'm sure with home video rentals, overseas sales, rentals to airlines, etc., this will make a nice pot of dough for the studio.  As the great Gene Siskel once noted, no matter how cynical you get about Hollywood, it's never enough to keep up. "},{"date":"10 May 2000","review":"  Disney continues to establish themselves as the masters of wasted opportunities.  With years in development and an entire studio of technology built to make it, Dinosaur comes off as a flat, boring, standard-issue Disney animated film that just looks better than it's predecessors.  To call its plot standard-issue Disney is almost giving it too much credit.  All the basic elements are here but Dinosaur's script is so patch worked together from other Disney films that it has no personality of its own.  It's just a collection of repeated Disney themes.  Making things worse is the film's tendency to undermine what little drama there is.  Part of the film involves following a heard of dinosaurs across the newly scorched landscape to where water should be awaiting them.  They get there and find no water.  Our hero discovers that the water lies just under the surface, everyone rejoices and drinks.  The next day it rains.  The film continues on in this backwards manner.  There are two ill-tempered dinosaurs leading the pack and all for leaving behind the weaker ones to be picked off by following predators.  The film's persistent and somewhat annoying message of teamwork should have the most impact on these contrary attitudes.  Instead, enlightenment is granted to one of the two, quickly followed by his death which renders the whole gesture pointless.Is there anything worthwhile here?  The visuals are astounding, but in this day and age of constant one-upsmanship in the field of cinematic CGI, one can't help but feel a tad flippant about the whole thing.  James Newton Howard provides a score that is at times interesting, the dinos don't sing thank God, but too often proves derivative of The Lion King.  The voice work is unimpressive all around and adding ethnic undercurrents to each personality was a bad idea.  The whole idea of voicing these characters further proves the film's determination to undermine itself.  Create the most visually real dinosaur film you can possibly imagine, and then make the dinos talk and throw in modern references for good measure.  The Disney machine needs a serious overhaul, now.

We all know, or have met people like Traci Flick(Reese Witherspoon), and they are defitinely annoying.  Matthew Broderick is excellent as the high school teacher who tries to toss a stumbling block in front of Traci to keep her from succeeding at her goal of becoming the senior class president.  An excellent character driven movie. The voice over thoughts of the characters was dead-on funny!  Kudos to the writers!  The part where Traci is thinking about what life is like for teachers while looking at Mr. McAlister, wearing the same boring clothes and saying the same thing year after year while the students go on to successful profitable careers, was definitely funny and biting.  Thank goodness for video and cable because they give overlooked gems like Election a second chance to find an audience.  8\/10 stars.   "},{"date":"12 May 2000","review":"  This movie is strange. Just weird. It would seem as if it's trying to be a romantic comedy, and indeed that is what it was billed and sold as (And it's based on one of the best - the 1938 film The Shop Around the Corner, starring Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.  People, this is an absolute gem, and regardless of how you feel about You've Got Mail, you ABSOLUTELY must see it. See it! See it! See it! You won't be disappointed.)But back to You've Got Mail. Now, I like Tom Hanks. I like Meg Ryan. I loved them together in Joe Versus the Volcano (haven't seen Sleepless in Seattle - and have no intention of ever doing so). But they completely fizzle here. It's not really their fault. The script is so hard-wired to prevent any audience sympathy or interaction. The premise would appear to be golden two people fall in love with one another via the Internet, only to realize that in real life they can't stand each other. This is an intriguing set-up (and a savvy and intelligent update of Shop Around the Corner's pen-pal conceit); the scenes where we hear (through voiceover) Tom and Meg's communiques with each other are low-key and sweet. But. . . oh, there are so many buts - such as*Did the script really need to pair up the stars with respective live-ins (Greg Kinnear for her, Parker Posey for him)? These characters never get explored in the least, are blatant caricatures (he of N.Y. intelligentsia, she of the brash and crass world of publishing), and are dispensed of without any noticeable fanfare. What's the point? Surely, having the leads be separated by not knowing each others' identities should have been (and is) complication enough.*Why is Hanks' character privy to the secret identity of his e-mail partner so long before Ryan's is? True, this development corresponds structurally to the one played out in Shop Around the Corner, but that's not really a fair comparison. There, the entire movie was more or less seen through the eyes of Jimmy Stewart's character, and our identification with him made us wonder how he would make use of his knowledge. Here, though, Hanks and Ryan are given equal weight and screen time; neither represents the definitive perspective through which the film is to be seen. As such, awarding his character knowledge which she does not possess strikes of a desire to play favorites - and wreaks havoc with the trajectory of the movie's second half. It suddenly ceases being a movie about equals and becomes more about the deliberate manipulations and evasions of Tom Hanks' character - making the whole thing seem insincere and smarmy, rather than fun or heart-warming.*And speaking of smarmy, what's with the moral of this story? Is there one?! I mean sure, going in, we more or less figure that there will be a sappy but endearing message about love winning out in the end over personal differences. Which we're prepared for (and frankly, if you're not, you've stepped into not only the wrong movie but the wrong genre). Since, in the film, Hanks and Ryan are the heads of rival bookstores - he a large and impersonal chain, she a small, independently owned neighborhood store catering lovingly to children - we get to see their personal peccadillos played out in the world of business. This is a good idea, particularly as his chain is attempting to drive hers out of business. Problem is, no one really had the heart to make Tom Hanks the yuppie s.o.b. he really needed to be for this story to work (of course, the Hanks of the '80s was born to play just this role - but now that he's graduated to bland nice guy parts I suppose all nuance and complexity have gone out of his work). What the filmmakers do instead is truly laughable (and here comes a major SPOILER, so if you don't want to know how this film ends stop reading here) - they have Hanks' company run Ryan's out of business - and then have her fall in love with him anyway. HUH?! Could someone explain that to me? The two don't reach a détente, a middle ground, in their personal and business bickering. They don't join forces, or find some compromise way to co-exist. I was at least expecting some diatribe against big business in favor of small and independent shopowners who truly care about their product. Corny though it might have been, it at least would have been consistent with the genre it found itself in. Or the movie might have been truly brave and suggested that, under the circumstances, there was no way Ryan could ever be with Hanks, as much as she loves him in cyberspace, for their fundamental difference in temperament and philosophy would always keep them apart. Then, maybe, Tom would have to undergo some kind of transformation or catharsis or. . . . but, hey, since he's already such a nice guy in this movie, screw it, let's just have him win heartlessly in business, and get the girl anyway. Under all the gossamer and syrup of the ending, it's a pretty mean-spirited and cynical message this movie is pushing. Very distasteful, too. And not at all the experience I had in mind when laying down my eight bucks to see two of the most likable and charming leads working in movies today.But Shop Around the Corner, that's a whole other story. ..

It promises to be a 1970's stoner comedy with all the political correctness thrown-in.  There's a three-legged, one-eyed dog, a kid brother in a wheel chair who has a paer route, not to mention the drunk Dad who sits around with his poker buddies and labels every guy queer.Then suddenly it turns into a comedy about fitting in, then a love story, and before you know it, it's a cautionary tale about being responsible for your actions.  All Farrelly movies have heart, but this one tries to hard to have heart, and under Michael Corrente's tries too hard to be too many different movies at once and ultimately collapses into a heavy-handed tale of woe.The cast gives it there all and there are plenty of funny moments in here.

The visuals and animation are amazing and it's a very nice film to look at.  However it lacked character and story development and was far too short (1 hr. 15 min.). The plot was uninteresting and more than half the film takes place in the desert.  It is a movie geared towards little kids and there is no doubt in my mind they will love it and it will be a huge success, but as for anyone over age ten, they will be disappointed.  ** out of ***** "},{"date":"17 May 2000","review":"  Cookie's Fortune is a very dark comedy mistakenly billed as a drama bordering on a whodunit.  It's got Julianne Moore, who as always is outstanding (she's the reason I picked the film, although I had heard of it before because it's the one that made Liv Tyler cut off all her hair a while back), Glenn Close, who has a memorable part as a kind of a Cruella DeVille meets Scarlett O'Hara, Liv Tyler, who is in an out-there cute bad girl role which is delightful, Ned Beatty, Chris O'Donnell (another great performance, and I'm not what you'd call the biggest Chris O'Donnell fan in the world), Charles S. Dutton, Lyle Lovett as a sleazy fisherman, the guy who played the pedophiliac beauty pageant judge in Drop Dead Gorgeous, the guy who plays the senile ex-lawyer on The Practice...  Excellent ensemble cast, and they really make the movie.  See, the whole story revolves around the characters in a small Mississippi town, and it wouldn't work if you didn't feel like you know what it's like to live in the town, but the familiar cast really helps with that.  Plot-wise, it's about a woman named Cookie who commits suicide, but as her sister Glenn Close says, Only crazy people kill themselves.  In an effort to salvage her family's reputation, Glenn Close gets her mentally challenged but adorable sister Julianne Moore to help her fake a robbery\/murder, and the movie revolves around the investigation of this crime and how all the characters react.  But what really makes it work are all the small touches, the little things people do, like having a candle-lit dinner in a jail cell or hogging the bedside electric fan (you'd have to see it to really understand).  This may not mean much to most people, but in one scene, Julianne Moore looks out a window and points out a Magnolia tree, and I absolutely freaked out (I became a rabid Julianne Moore fan because of her performance in Magnolia).  It was a very cool moment.  Anyway, I give the movie an 8.  Not exactly ground-breaking and unforgettable, and it's got some really unnecessary but harmless plot twists towards the end, but it's lots of fun throughout.

Witherspoon is exceptional as always as the ambitious, and possibly evil, Tracy Flick who will do anything and destroy anyone in her ruthless pursuit of power. Her uptight mannerisms and facial expressions are worth the rental fee alone as she works night and day to achieve her goals. Set against her is three-time teacher of the year winner Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) who, seeing her rise to said position of power because of the mostly apathetic student body, sets out on a noble yet ultimately self-destructive course to stop her at all costs. Though the school itself is full of people it often appears like there are only two combatants locked in a struggle for supremacy, each with their own agenda and methods. Witherspoons character comes across as equalling determined and manipulative as she is pathetic and needy. Broderick on the other hand sees his life spiral out of control as his all-pervading crusade to stop her eats away at his otherwise feeble and easy-going nature. The supporting cast also perform superbly with Chris Klein (Who looks and sounds more like Keanu Reeves every day) earning particular praise for his nice, deadpan yet intelligent jock who, under Brodericks guidance, plans his own campaign. This is where the film elevates itself above normal teen movies with the very morals and ethics so subtly woven into the film early on becoming the most important part of this titanic struggle. As Broderick falls deeper into the dark side in his effort to stop Witherspoon he loses the decency and even-handedness he so valiantly displayed at the beginning. Is he really right to use Flick's own dubious ethics against her, even at the risk of becoming what he most despises? Depending on whether you're an ambitious go-getter or a couldn't-care-less daydreamer you might find the answer a little less than straightforward. The ending itself is brilliantly surprising and just when you think it ends it doesn't quite. Fantastic.

How this film ever got made is beyond me, and I am POSITIVE that most people will hate this movie as much as I did.  Basically, it's a series of thoroughly dull scenes, most about an uninteresting guy named Nic.  Nic has several flashbacks, all of which seem to pop up for no apparent reason.  Then there are the Adam and Eve scenes, and they somehow are even more out of place than the flashbacks.  I should also mention that there is a minimum of talking in this movie, so we are left with little except a string of visuals, many of which are ordinary in the extreme.

Now that I have been able to enjoy the film better, I finally feel that I can write a comment.  I agree with everyone else that the story is little more than The Land Before Time revisited, but I still think it works (for the most part).  But the score by James Newton Howard is just magnificent.  Kudos to the sound effects wizards for concocting the sounds of the raptors.  I also like the fact that there is no sound when the meteor hits, but you hear the surge afterwards.  And Samuel E. Wright is absolutely perfect as Kron, the stern herd leader.  As for the film's visuals, I will say nothing about them because they speak for themselves when you see them.  I will say, however, that I wish they had shot the film in the 2.351 widescreen format, but I am sure they had their hands full with the 1.851 format.  But I enjoyed Dinosaur the second time around.

They belong together like fish and bicycles (thanks to Gloria Steinem). Elizabeth is a great costume drama and a fascinating interpretation of one of history's most admired and ambiguous figures. But please don't say the film was 'inaccurate' or 'not historically correct.' Were you there? History is rewritten the moment it first appears on the page, or is told orally. It's not relevant to film as a medium, or to storytelling in general.I thought Cate Blanchett was inspirational and played the role like she was born to it. Her strength and ruthlessness was learned, not present at birth. She had to grow and find her way in the dangerous times she lived in. This is a version of how she may have done it. Her character is very complex and gives an insight of what it meant to be a woman in a powerful position during those times.Costuming and cinematography are fabulous, although I wish at times they had bowed to modern lighting techniques so we could see more in those dim corridors. Joseph Fiennes is gorgeous and just sulky enough to make you think he got what he deserved. I loved Richard Attenborough as Cecil and even Eric Cantona got it right in the right places.

In Waking the Dead, besides all the aforementioned ingredients, he also included self-questioning situations mingled with loss, death - intense grieving of a dearly beloved. Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly are aptly paired in this unusual love story. You might say it's literally out of this world.

Morton is capable of intense emotional portrayal, also along the line of loss, death and grieving of her mother in writer-director Carine Adler's 1997 Under the Skin; she is dynamic in demonstrating the range of emotions the main character was going through.

"},{"date":"31 May 2000","review":"  This uninspired biopic of the infamous oddball performance artist\/comedian Andy Kaufman misfires on almost all counts. To begin with, there are millions of people who have never heard of Andy Kaufman, so there's a entire demographic that would need to be taught about the late auteur. Right away, when you have to convince a large portion of the population that the subject of your movie is worthy of your cinematic paintbrush, you're in a hole that most moviemakers can't dig out of. But that's only the people who weren't aware of Andy Kaufman when he was alive. What about those of us who were? Those who closely followed the television series Taxi remember the character of Latka Gravas, but how many people paid any attention to Kaufman's offscreen antics? Those who did notice generally seem to fall into one of two categories those who loved Kaufman and believed him to be an unsung comic genius, and those who despised him and saw him as a relentlessly weird pathological  liar.Those who loved Kaufman and his work might find something of value in this film. As a straight biography, there are inspired, original moments - such as the beginning acting as an end, or some of Kaufman's bits (including the legendary Saturday Night Live Mighty Mouse skit) - but most of the movie is rather pedestrian, given that it's directed by Milos Forman, who brought One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to the big screen. Our Hero struggles against People Who Don't Understand Him (parents, audiences) until he is saved by a Nice Agent With a Heart of Gold who shows him the way to superstardom. Ho-hum. The viewer, instead of being enticed by this purportedly unique, larger-than-life character, finds that it's really just an exercise in somnolence. The script is smarmy and self-satisfied, as if it's telling it's damn funny and if you want to be hip, you'll think it's funny, too.Jim Carrey, as Andy, turns in some remarkable work, but thanks to a rather standard script doesn't really get to show off his acting chops (which we saw in The Truman Show). As Andy, Carrey turns in a good impersonation, but not a full characterization. Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne isn't exceptional, but the character lacks depth. She's no more or less important than Adrian from Rocky, cheering her man on through thick and thin, leaving him at one point but - surprise - coming back to him when he needs her the most. Danny DeVito is his agent, George, and he's likeable in a thankless role (remember Edward Norton in The People Versus Larry Flynt?).Like Oliver Stone's The Doors, we come away from this movie not knowing much more about the lead character than we did before the movie. There are no deep insights, no real secrets revealed. The result is a slipshod, lackadaisical film, a movie that promises to bring the story of a 'misunderstood' man to light but winds up being a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

With Wes Anderson there's the likes of David Fincher, P.T. Anderson, Doug Liman, Spike Jonze, and Kevin Smith (save for Dogma please).

Other, possibly mor serious movie watchers, appreciate it for the interesting theme it creates. Mathew Broderick's character, as we see in the beginning, can tell you everything you want to know about morals and ethics, even the difference between them, and so can Reese Witherspoon's character. But as the movie unfolds we see that neither of them really have any. And I think the thing that was most interesting was the character of Paul. His character is just so nice it is comical, yet he is not very bright either. In conclusion, I would recoment this movie unless you are easly offended by sexual slurs and images. The strange music when Witherspoon got mad is aslo a stroke of brilliance. "},{"date":"3 June 2000","review":"  There are a couple of things that distinguishes a film from a documentary.  One of the most important is building a unifying theme throughout the movie, telling a story, rather than just reiterating historical events.  This movie was mostly just a replay of the real-life exploits of Andy Kaufman, with very little attention given to the behind-the-scenes action or, more importantly, motivation behind the events.  Carrey does a great impression of Kaufman, but no effort is given in making Kaufman a complete character. I could have rented a best of Kaufman tape and gotten the same effect as this film. In fact, the real Kaufman would have been much funnier.  This was like reading a biography written by the subject's biggest fan...a skewed effort attempting to show how great Kaufman was.  Unfortunately, we already knew how much of a comic genius Andy was...he showed us himself.  There is no reason to watch imitators attempt to replay his shining moments.  Andy left his own legacy, and I suggest everyone relive it by watching the master himself. "},{"date":"4 June 2000","review":"  Man on the Moon leaves the viewers with two questions.  (1) What possessed anyone to make this movie?  (2) Why did anyone who knew Andy Kaufman care about him?  Andy Kaufman may have been brilliant and eccentric (and other than the Mighty Mouse and Latka, nothing was very funny so the brilliance is questionable), but there's no attempt to explain to an audience what made him tick - and showing what made him tick MIGHT have made an audience care for two seconds.  It's difficult to watch a film when you hate the main character. Carrey is a fantastic actor and certainly capable of going deeper into the character of a complicated man.  The film picked up toward the end but there's never an explanation of why people he totally abused, such as the Taxi cast, were shown seemingly to have loving feelings toward him.

What it makes worst is that big fat ugly orchestral music that we hear all the time. We don't need that elevator music sounds to feel emotions. Cuba Gooding Jr is fine, but Hopkins seems so bored.  I'm sure that whenmister Gooding will be an old man and watch this, he will be thinking of the errors of his youth. "},{"date":"6 June 2000","review":"  Elizabeth was one of the best movies of 1998. From the first scene to the last this is one of the most memorable movies ever made. Cate Blanchett is astonishing as Queen Elizabeth the first. There are many performances that are considered great, but hers was the best performance given by a woman in a movie released in the 90's. The scene where she talks to the parliament is one of the best of the 1990's. She's smart, she's assertive, she's manipulative and when the scene nearly ends her impassioned plea on behalf of the bill she has sent to them is  extraordinary. Almost every scene with her is worth mentioning.Besides Blanchett's performance there are others that are very good. Fanny Ardant is brilliant as Mary of Guise. The scene where she comes upon the very young injured English soldier is mesmerising. She looks at him with pity and hate at the same time. Her other scene near the end of the movie in which she complains about her nephew evokes the scene in The Godfather where Marlon Brando complains about Sonny. Kathy Burke is stunning as Mary I. The scene with her and Princess Elizabeth (Blanchett) is astounding. Burke is excellent in her role. Both Ardant and Burke deserved oscar nominations for best supporting actress. Both Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attenborough are amazing in their roles as well. I think that Rush should have been nominated for his role in this rather than for Shakespeare in Love. The script was one of the best of 1998. Elizabeth was written by Michael Hirst, a catholic historian! Besides the performances and the script the technical aspects of this movie are phenomenal. The direction by Shekhar Kapur was amazing. He deserved to be nominated for best director, but amazingly wasn't. The costumes were the best of 1998 as was the stunning cinematography. The scene where Elizabeth gets the Queens ring is one of the best looking scenes ever shot. The editing by Jill Bilcock is astounding. Everything about this movie is superlative. It may be one of the best historical dramas ever filmed.  "},{"date":"7 June 2000","review":"  To tell the truth, I went into this movie expecting to come out totally confused, but instead I came out asking questions that I think i will never be able to answer. Next to John Woo, the Wachowski's are the best directors I have ever seen. They way they film action sequences is spectacular and was worth the Oscar they won. The plot also, will raise some eyebrows and cause a lot of questions to be asked. My favorite character in the film would have to be the evil Agent Smith he is both slimy and mysterious at the same time. I have to say this film set the standard in directing for action\/sci-fi movies. I give it 10\/10 and anxiously wait for the sequels. "},{"date":"8 June 2000","review":"  Sure the movie had its typical sequel problems, but they were minimal flaws in comparison to ANY other franchise in this genre.  It was a good look at how each of the surviving characters in the story had changed, and where the problems in the original Scream started.  It kept the pieces together, and the story intact.  It still manages to pull MANY inside jokes, while at the same time giving you chills as the killer continues his vengence.  Scream 3 is in no way better than the original, but FAR superior to Scream 2, and any other horror sequel for that matter.  Alot of movie-goer's complained that Scream 2 and Scream 3 were stupid or not scary.  But trust me, those people are not true fans of the series, direction, writing, or cast.  They're just there to watch a movie.  So, please pay no attention.  Scream gave horror a much needed boost in the late 90's and spawned 2 years worth of copy-cat films.  I think what a lot of people just don't get, is that Scream had two sequels from the beginning.  These were planned sequels, not merely attempts to fool us into buying more movie tickets and popcorn, but rather a very long horror movie\/story that the producers found could be told in three parts allowing more detail and emphasis per movie\/story.  Hollywood has just about finished its horror\/teen flick run.  Scream 3 is definitely the end of a good thing.

AFter the showing she told the audience about the making and the lengths the computer animators went through to get realism into the characters and scenes. So, obviously, the movie should appeal to anyone who is interested in computer animation and\/or filmmaking. By the end of the film I was still dazzled by the beautiful animation (especially the fur on the leemurs) but left thinking that the plot could've fitted into 30 minutes. Of course the story is made so children will understand, but thinking to the last Disney movie I saw (Tarzan), it had a lot more substance, humour, and fun which Dinosaur just didn't. On another note, the music for Dinosaur is quite good and interesting in that there aren't any lyrics or a famous voice behind it.

We need more films like this one!!!! "},{"date":"13 June 2000","review":"  I believe this includes a very minor spoiler see the movie first before you read this to understand my points anyway....This movie is a dark comedy and a parable of our two personality of ourselves. At first glance it seemed to mimick a previous relationship with an older woman that I had, so at first I found it sort of a remedy for a broken heart... Strangely though the romance felt like we were teenagers in love at some points.   Then soon I realized that although it was a teenager and a middle aged man in love with one woman, you can view it as one person... a childlike, appreciative, overzealous outreaching, shy person- the one aspect of personality, and then the other- a money making, washed up out of shape man.  I view that as a combination of who I or people in my age group... mid 20's to 20's, too old to do youthful things like sports teams, plays, going to classes.  Yet that desire to do those things was great.  Bill Murray's attempt at freshing up his life and is eventual falling in love with olivia williams character characterizes the working aged group at youthful romance. The ending provided that the two characters come to terms with each other to successfully win her affections.  The useful Max had to learn to grow up and take things seriously in his life and get out of his rut and do what he dreamed while Mr. Blume had to love and care for himself to win the affections.  In the end, it did not matter who won her heart, but that the two characters, the two halves similar to the two halves of ourself had to learn to come together to terms with each other and work together for the overall benefit. It's funny that you can call this a dark comedy, it's really therapeutic. And quite frankly, Bill Murray shows us why he's probably one of the most underrated, most important comics... still.

She is the true main character, getting her revenge in the end.But there are other facets to this film that make it great the weird people that seem to be Altman's specialty, the over-sexual deputy and the theater scenes. Brilliant and funny. "},{"date":"15 June 2000","review":"  When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't expect it to beat Field of Dreams as the best baseball movie ever.  At the end of the movie, it blew Field of Dreams out of the water.  Kevin Costner is the King of Baseball movies.  Bull Durham was great, Field of Dreams improved on Bull Durham, but For Love of the Game was Costner at his best.Costner as Billy Chapel, an aging pitcher who doesn't know if he will pitch again nevermind where, is thrust right into an introspective look at his life when he finds out that his on and off girlfriend Jane is leaving for London.  This makes Chapel think about the last five years with Jane, and as he is thinking about this, he is unwittingly getting deeper into a rare feat in baseball the Perfect Game.Chapel is then faced with two big mountains.  The perfect game and Jane. He figures he can do nothing about Jane, however, the very competitive Billy Chapel wants to get the perfect game at all costs, and the will and fight he shows is impressive.  But the difference with Billy Chapel and all the other characters Costner has played is that Billy Chapel is very human.  He is flawed, but he has one thing that he loves, and that is the game.For Love of the Game is inspiring.  Its the story of a man who is faced with incredible adversity, and its the story of a man rediscovering himself, its a must see, and you'd be a fool to miss out on a journey as incredible as this.

But that Christmas (1998) I didn`t go to the local theatre by my own and we had to choose between Enemy of the state and You`ve got mail. OUR choice was for ROMANCE and, while I was just preparing to have few hours of sleep, Tom Hanks stepped into the corridor. Where is he going to, why does he seem so afraid to get noticed ? Oh, I see, he`s got a girlfriend. No, not that one, just-out-of-doors, but a REAL GIRLFRIEND. From Internet.Since that moment the movie got my attention.

His gruff, curt fathercharacter is played almost to a caricature but cut short beforethe line of no return. Not a standout film but a descent one andworth  "},{"date":"19 June 2000","review":"  Spoilers AheadIf I had to choose between watching For Love of the Game or the Postman twice in a row, there would be no contest. At least the Postman had characters you can empathize with and dialogue from this planet.  Costner plays a highly-successful 40 year-old pitcher whose team owner tells him his team has been sold and Costner has been traded to the Giants.  This first scene is played with intense melancholy, as if the audience is expected to have empathy for him; it's hard to forget the fact that his character is a highly successful lifetime pitcher for a major league baseball team (how much $$ does a lead pitcher make over the years?), and who has had a career most would envy.  I wanted to go AAwwwwwww! in the theater.  I wondered how many single parents on welfare would have felt sorry for the lug.  Kevin's 20-something girlfriend dumps him over the phone, but in the next two scenes he befriends another 20-something, an attractive if angry woman whose car won't start on the side of the road, and without saying much more than aw, shucks- want to go to a baseball game?  has changed her from yelling go away,  to sleeping with him in the next few scenes.  She makes a speech about respecting each other's space, then surprises him in his apartment later, only to be surprised to discover he's been sleeping with his personal masseuse (guess when you're the pitcher it comes with the massage), another 20-something perfect 10 who is more attractive than the love interest.  I swear, there must be something about turning 40 that turns men into babe magnets among the under-30 crowd.  If Costner was portraying a magnetic type of Casanova we could understand, but he is played like a manniquin.  Again, Kevin is given a huge closeup in slow motion as we are expected to feel sorry for a millionaire who gets laid every 30 seconds.  This would be tolerable if there was a plot, but there isn't one that I can discern and the dialogue is so incredulous you wonder if the writers care if the audience is actually listening.  You want to come to a baseball game?  A game. Do-you-want-to-come-to-a-game...with me.,  No, I want to throw a baseball at Kevin for saying these lines, and sue the writer for mental cruelty.  I don't know what happens after Kevin is sent on an errand to retrieve his girlfriends errant rebellious teenager daughter from a bad party; I walked out at that point.  I hear that some baseball actually occurs later in the movie, some well-choreographed scenes in fact.  If the movie had started with this and been about this, it would have been an enjoyable, if not deep, movie. As it is, it's completely contrived with random plot twists thrown in without rhyme or reason;  Two more relevant titles for this movie would be For the Love of Money (explaining why it was made), or For the Love of Costner.  Costner fans won't be dissappointed or care about the plot, as the closeups of Costner are slow and sweet. To us guys, they are slow and sickening.  I didn't intend to be this vitriolic about an actor who has done mostly great work.  I have to wonder what Costner really thought of it?   No rating - just the most negative review I have written, and that includes Battlefield Earth!

What they deliver instead is a somewhat heartfelt story of a stoned, dysfunctional circle of friends and an even more disturbing family.  Dangerously treading on formulaic and bordering on a music video to chortle away the day with your favorite bong, the movie does have some redeeming characteristics.  The relationship between Timothy and Jane is compelling, Alec Baldwin may have found a perfect role, Timothy's friends are good for some quality laughs and are notoriously similar to friends that I had when growing up; but the move gets a bit too feel-goody at times.The multiple subplots aren't adequately flushed out and as with many other coming of age movies, they end up spreading the story too thin.

The film, which passed itself off to audiences as a mystery, actually reveals Cookie's killer within the first 30 minutes of screen-time, and then spends the next 90 letting us get to know the kooky residents of a close-knit Southern community.  With exception to Chris O'Donnell, who should stick with his rubber-suit and codpiece, the cast is fun to watch, and each play their part with an effervescent charm that is damn near contagious.  Although it moves along at a fast enough pace, Anne Rapp's screenplay never quite works as a straightforward comedy, and the actors seem as though they're putting on performances tailor-made for a far better movie.

He has directed a movie that is gleefully evil, painfully hilarious and fabulously tragic.  Nothing is held back, and the actors (particularly Reese Witherspoon, who, at 23 years old, plays the part of an overly determined teenager more convincingly than anyone who has ever gone before her) bring his cutting social satire to life with a perverted sense of joy. This film is so perfect at accomplishing exactly what it set out to do (which is basically to have you laughing hysterically in fits of recognition), that it's hard to believe it came out of MTV Productions. It's actually fairly hard to believe it came out of Hollywood's studio system, at all.  Don't miss it.   "},{"date":"25 June 2000","review":"  Elizabeth is a nice little film that tries to be big.  The production design, costume design, and direction are all wonderful.  However, all these elements take away from every actor in the film.

Her transformation from naive child to powerful queen over the course of the film is remarkable.  She is a definite scene-stealer and when she is not on screen the film seems to sputter. Geoffrey Rush has his usual fine performance as well.  Others like Joseph Fiennes, Chris Eccleston, and Richard Attenborough seem to be overwhelmed by the film itself and give fair performances at best.

It led you to believe that they were going to give you another movie like Dumb and Dumber and Something About Mary. They lied.Is that to say that this was a bad film?  No, not really.  But is it a good film like the other two?  Not even close.  The other two were hilarious, they were crude and they took humour to a different level.  Outside Providence is tame, sort of funny, kind of sweet but mostly lacking that certain something that will make it fun to watch.  I guess the best way to describe it is to say that it is just like most of the films that have come out in the last few years.  It's just okay.  And when the best way to describe a film is with the bland word, okay, then you have problems.Perhaps this film tried to take a page out of Dazed and Confused by setting it all in the 70's.  Evidence to that can be attributed to many things, not which the least of it can be pinpointed to the drugs, the free sex, the school theme, and a few other issues.  But this film doesn't contain the charm of Dazed and it certainly isn't as smart as Dazed.  It is a cheap imitation and it was a deserved failure.The film tells the story of a father, Mr. Dunphy, or Old Man Dunphy, that is tough on his kids but loves them very much.  His oldest son, Timothy, just called Dunphy by his friends, is at that stage of his life where he into drugs, partying and insubordination.  After he goes a step too far ( ramming a parked police car while smoking from a bong that would make Cheech and Chong jealous ) his father pulls a few strings and gets him into a private school.  It'll prepare you for not getting smoked by me, his father explains to him as he sends him off to the school.  Upon reaching the school, he learns that it is more like a prison as there is no drinking, no drugs, no sex, no trips into town without permission, no locks on the doors,  F*** me,  Dunphy says,  and no swearing, the dean informs him.  The deans name is probably the funniest part of the film, Mr. Funderberk  Say it fast enough and you could get kicked out of school for uttering an obsenity.The usual things happen at this prep school.  The kids find a way to do drugs and party and then our little recluse meets the girl of his dreams.  Her name is Jane and she is played by Amy Smart.  I immediately recognized her from Varsity Blues and Road Trip.  She was Vander Beek's plain girlfriend in Blues and she was Beth, the gorgeous sexpot that Breckin Meyer sleeps with in Road Trip.  In Outside Providence, she is supposed to be the unobtainable vixen, the Rose DeWitt Bukater of this prep school.  Of course Dunphy ends up dating her and she changes his life in many ways.  He also becomes noble and at the end of the film he does something that shows how much he has grown.The film is not bad, it's just that it is a nice film.  It is kind of like Mumford, the film that came out last year that no doubt looked great on paper but when it transferred to film, it just lost some of it's edge.  There isn't anything hysterically funny about it, there is nothing new to be said about teenagers, the school isn't different than any other school I've seen in the movies and the characters aren't anything more than cardboard cut-outs of other characters I've seen in a dozen other films.  Alec Baldwin is good as the caring but insensitive dad but that is just a portion of the film. Maybe I've seen too many films and I am expecting to be shocked too much and too often, but this just felt old, stale and tired.  Outside Providence isn't bad, but it isn't that good.  Not quite a ringing endorsement for a film.6 out of 10.  If you want to see a tame side of the Farrely's, then this is for you.  If you want another Something About Mary, then stay away.

The plot itself attempts to follow the events of an end of school party. I say attempts, as it digresses into a vague and disjointed blur of vaguely connected events (not unlike an end of school party). The film was only worthwhile watching if treated as a comedy alone, that said - three actors exceeded their remit. Seth Green, the homeboy wannabe - Kenny; Melissa J.Hart as the (uncredited) delightfully irritating yearbook girl; and Victor Togunde, who played a similarly annoying guy who remembered everything you would like to forget about high school.

Outside Providence is a coming of age type movie with little in the way of gross out and more in the way of story.  It concerns the trials and tribulations of young Timothy Dumphy, who is shipped off to an exclusive private boarding school by his father after an arrest on a drug and drink filled night with friends.  Shawn Hatosy plays Tim (his dad has a less than flattering nickname of a sex toy for him).  This is a good portrayal of a young man who is growing up and learning life's lessons.  His younger brother Jackie (played by Timothy Bone) is in a wheelchair after a touch football accident (the explanation is hysterical) and is dependent on Tim driving him around to do his paper route. Tim is a good character, hard to dislike him and as the central character he remains constantly interesting.  Alec Baldwin plays Old Man Dumphy, and as a blue collar working class guy is great.  Wonderful personalization and sounds so much like my father it's frightening.  This was a nice return for Alec, and he plays a surprisingly strong supporting character.The lovely Amy Smart plays Jane Weston, the object of Tim's affections at school.  She is the main turning point in Tim's life and this character has a pivotal role in his outcome.  Smartly played (no pun intended) Amy.  I like you more and more every role you do.  Supporting cast is good. Jonathan Brandis and George Wendt are about the only names you'll recognize, but Jon Abrahams as Drugs Delany (Tim's closest friend) is a nice sideman.  Loads of fun to be had by this bunch. Outside Providence was a good changeup to follow Mary, but was done in by the from the people who brought you.... bit.

Instead I, with mouth agape, scanned the audience and found that everyone else was in a conniption fit of laughter. I have actually lost friends over my intense dislike of this movie and I do not at all miss them.  I also blame most of the gross-out comedies that put gross elements just for the sake of having a film with gross-out on this sick excuse for cinematic debris (I'd be giving it too much high praise if I called it a waste of talent since there is none in this turkey).PS  I know how it ends and what's in what i missed.  I feel I left at the right time. "},{"date":"7 July 2000","review":"  At first I didn't really like the movie, however it's one of those movies that you keep thinking about long after you have seen it.  I couldn't get it out of my mind and kept having flash backs to the bedroom conversation and the rock episode.  Then I finally watched it again and it all made sense. I did a complete 180, and now it is one of my favorite movies. "},{"date":"8 July 2000","review":"  Okay - so I'm not going to act like I'm an amateur movie critic by picking every bit of this movie apart. What I will say is that I thought CF was delightful. The humor was mature, the pace appropriate to the setting, and the characters were complex. It's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it entirely. If you enjoy thoughtful comedy and subtle humor, you'll enjoy this one.  "},{"date":"9 July 2000","review":"  This is a wonderful film, quite a surprise - I had not heard of it and rented it because of the actors and the fact that it was supposed to be a suspense film.  It is instead a very spiritual and emotional film about all of us, our illusions and our self-imposed imprisonments.  Hopkins is great as usual but Gooding's character is the glue - a young man who believes in himself and dives in head first to try to make a difference among people who have been beaten down and have given up.  Did this film get much distribution?  Is the name Cuba Gooding, Jr. a red flag to put something right into video?  Because Instinct and Murder of Crows were both wonderful, yet I don't remember hearing much about them. "},{"date":"10 July 2000","review":"  Come on! This discussion should never have devolved into a set of arguments for or against artistic and Nonlinear filmmaking. The film is an acceptable example of neither. I saw it on DVD last night and found it unbelievably  sophomoric and self-indulgent. The cinematography was  cloyingly pretty and should appeal only to rabid MTV fans and greeting card photographers. The whole Adam and  Eve subplot wore nothing but a trite old hat. The fact that Figgis cast that singularly vain prat Julian Sands as his past selves and put pout-on-a -stick Saffron Burrows under him should be a dead giveaway -- equivalent to putting a warning sticker on the movie Warning This film was made on a low budget by an impotent pre adolescent old fart to appeal to undersexed post adolescent artsy fartsies (who should know better.) Figgis's painful commentary on the DVD's extra track is a lot of jibbering on as the auteur searches vainly for something to say and is reduced to snippets of the an actor got sick so we used my cousin bob in this scene variety.  The film works on only one level as a graveyard for every dumb 19 year-old would-be artsy's ideas, images, politics, sexual fantasies and cheesy  classical record collections. "},{"date":"11 July 2000","review":"  Intrigue and treachery guide this lush film of the crowning and political maturity of England's virgin queen, Elizabeth I. An outcast of her own family, an independent thinker, and perhaps the worst of her sins-a non-Catholic, Elizabeth is saved from a life in the dungeons by virtue of the fact that she is a woman and can thus bear children. Her sister's untimely death before producing a proper male heir is her saving grace.Elizabeth's teenage life is quite simple and serene, with nothing to challenge her obviously high intellect more than innocent children's games, her studies of the arts, and the pure joys of young love as personified in the supple form of a lusty Joseph Fiennes. Suddenly Elizabeth is thrust into the role of Queen, on the very day her sister dies, and the transformation as played by Cate Blanchett is revealing of a knowledge of the strength in this legendary figure that is remarkable for an actor of any age or experience. Blanchett presents a child-woman who is aware of the multifaceted dangers awaiting her ascendance to the throne. "},{"date":"12 July 2000","review":"  I saw this movie on DVD without much expectation. 1\/2 hour into the movie this was turning into one of the best movie I saw since American Beauty 3 months back. It is simply hilarious, sometimes in a dark manner. There is not as much of a sexual element to this movie as in American Beauty but enough to make you laugh and think at the same time.Excellent movie. 8\/10 "},{"date":"13 July 2000","review":"  In a year overwhelmed with reminiscent films, Elizabeth rises above the rest to become one of few stunning manifestations of the Hollywood Renaissance. Certainly acknowledged by the Oscars garnering 7 nominations, Shekhar Kapur's intimate portrait of a young Elizabeth further expands the modern view on a distant monarch, whose maturing reign as well as taming nature continued to dazzle the 20th century viewers.Presented here by a superb cast led by Golden-Globe winner Cate Blanchett, early Elizabethean era turmoil and upheaval are captured brilliantly. The lush set itself is a feast for the eye as the audience is drawn to follow a passionate young Elizabeth's path. Against the dark setting of medieval stone castles, a blooming Golden Age approaches as England expands to take control in a world of great unrest after Catholic Queen Mary's death. Her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth daughter of Anne Bolyne is placed on a throne of a kingdom torn between religion. Cate Blanchett does a fabulous job capturing the details of a frustrated young woman waking to the merciless reality of queenhood--surrounded by enemies such as Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston). Constantly by her side is her reverent adviser Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough) who advises Elizabeth to marry for convenience choosing from a pool of ready political candidates--while Elizabeth herself is long set on her lover from the past Sir Robert Dudley (a charming Joseph Fiennes). Yet just as England learns to wake up from the medieval dream, Elizabeth learns the bitterness of betrayal as she looks to Sir Francis Walsingham (Jeffrey Rush)'s counsel.Focusing on Elizabeth's subtle changes of phase from fire to ice at a distant in the midst of a grander panorama beautifully shot, the audience gradually distinguishes her footsteps from the shedding of innocence to a tough ruler that dares to strike first against her enemies, to ultimately become the Virgin Queen to reign above all men.  "},{"date":"14 July 2000","review":"  I rented this movie on a whim because I like Harvey Keitel and Willem Defoe...I found it somewhat reminiscent of Kieslowski's Colors trilogy, or The Double Life of Veronique, and fans of these movies will definitely like this one. The movie's ending (which I won't give away) turns what you think is an interesting set of plot twists into a dreamy, allegorical tale that stays with you for a while. All in all, an excellent movie. "},{"date":"15 July 2000","review":"  With The Loss of Sexual Innocence, Mike Figgis has reminded the movie-goer that in its truest form, film is meant to evoke a feeling in the viewer. Like any often misunderstood art, Loss... must be experienced, rather than fully understood.  The images on the screen, coupled with the masterful use of score absorbs the viewer, resulting in him harboring different emotions and views regarding the film itself and the ideas it presents.  There are few writers and directors today that are confident enough in their film's power to almost entirely rob it of dialogue, but Figgis takes that risk and succeeds in increasing the emotional intensity of the experience.  Most have spoken against this, but have we forgotten that Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, a film about silence, mood, and image won an Oscar for its (minimalist) screenplay?I don't doubt there are people that will simply not understand this film. We have been raised on the Hollywood vision big stars, big thrills, little plot, little thought.  Now that something comes along to challenge that, they don't know what to do - they can't understand it, and because they spend so much time trying to understand it, they miss the point.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is willing to sit down and be taken by its impact - and wait until the film is over to put its pieces in place.

It is very underrated. "},{"date":"17 July 2000","review":"  Perhaps I went into the movie with the wrong impression. I thought I was going into a comedy. I thought I was going to laugh. I thought incorrectly. I am not sure what happened in this movie. What I am sure of was that it should have been 10 minutes long, to ease the suffering of the audience. I tried to fall asleep. Sadly, I failed. I am a worse person because of it. "},{"date":"18 July 2000","review":"  Patch Adams is a movie with very little to recommend it.  The story, although true, is trite and cliched, and nothing is done in the flick to make it any more than that.Robin Williams plays Patch Adams, a young doctor who goes against the grain and wants to do things his way, as opposed to the way of all the uncaring, cold-hearted, robot doctors around him.  Which means, operating under the theory that laughter is the best medicine, he tries to make his patients laugh.   Wow...what a daring idea.And they do laugh. Along the way, he meets a pretty but stand-offish girl, pursues her, and after he convinces her that he is a nice guy who won't mistreat her, gets her.   While at school Patch pulls some pretty outrageous stunts, all in the name of light-heartedness and laughter.  He opens up his own hospital for anybody who needs free medical attention of any kind.   After a tragedy hits, he rebounds and keeps on plugging away, establishing his own Gesundheidt Institute.A heart-warming story in real life, but it just doesn't translate well to the screen.  Williams is too old to play a romantic lead, at least too old for his screen partner, Monica Potter.  Potter plays too much of a cold fish to make us care about her.  And for some reason, after she rudely ignores Williams' sincere and well-intentioned advances, she suddenly changes into a woman who is trusting enough to visit a lunatic in his home, alone.Bob Gunton, as the dean of the medical school, practically reprises his role from The Shawshank Redemption.   The joke about the visiting gynecologists was so obvious and predictable, it was dumb. But the most annoying thing about this movie was the music.  When Adams is clowning around in the children's cancer ward, and they begin to smile, the music attempts to evoke a sense of wonder, as if this has got to be the first time these kids ever smiled in their lives.  Please.   I'm sure at one time or another one of those horrible, cold, uncaring doctors portrayed in the film once said something nice to the kids.  Smiling and laughter are indeed nice things, but don't try to make us think that Patch Adams is the only savior in the world who can supply them.Sentimentality is nice is measured doses; this movie is like a dumptruck unloading its cargo of syrup on us.  This is not a bad movie; it's just that its weak points overwhelm its overall niceness.  "},{"date":"19 July 2000","review":"  People who would say this movie is an example of poor cinema and bad acting take themselves way too seriously to just sit back and enjoy a movie about high school.This movie came out while I was a senior in high school and I can say that every single part of it is too true.  I can watch this movie and say I know him, I know her, or I know them.True , it's no Fast Times or Ferris Bueler, but it does just as good of a job as them of creating a place that's real to teenagers.  A party.   Hot girls, dorks trying to fit in, maybe a little drama, creepy spirit girls, sex upstairs, people passing out, fights, and white guys trying to be black. All in all a place to drink beer and hang out with friends.  This movie is that.  "},{"date":"20 July 2000","review":"  I liked this film a great deal for a few reasons.  The script was brilliant. The actors were all solid (Bill Murray in his first good role insome time, Jason Schwartzman in a great star debut). However... The directing didn't cut it. In many scenes the actors didn'tseem to be strongly motivated, which made the  performances flat and stilted. The editing gave me problems; it seems as though sceneswere shot with very little coverage, so there weren't manyoptions for the editor (many jump cuts, etc.). It feels like the production didn't have enough time to makethis a really solid effort and had to get what they couldfinished quickly. Unfortunately, this meant that a very goodscript turned into a pretty-good movie. "},{"date":"21 July 2000","review":"  First off to get that out of the way, this film is widely inaccurate in historical terms. The events that take place in this film span about 30 years in history but you get the feeling all this happens in a  year. Let alone the fact that some of the  events and allegiances of characters are plain fabricated in order to tell a story. Here lies the biggest problem in this film. Changing history is not a problem, but coming up with a muddled storyline in the consequence is. The film is beautifully shot and acted but you get the feeling this was supposed to be a 3 hour movie which got killed in the editing room. Characters are never properly introduced and so come off one-dimensional up to and including miss Blanchett herself who has a real presence and is obviously a talented actress but never gets room (as the rest of the cast) to actually act. It's like the actors started a war against the cameraman and lost. The film therefore looks like a collection of beautifully framed pictures looking for a story to tell.  If you don't have any interest in or knowledge of the period, I don't see how you can make heads or tails of it. A lot of the relations between characters are only implied or hinted at so some actions the characters take seem bewildering. Lots of cameos (Fanny Ardant as Marie de Guise is wonderful but what she actually wants is unclear as with her cross-dressing nephew de Duke of Anjou) The ending is preposterous and then you suddenly see why everything in this film is as it is. It is all to drive home a point so lame the writer should be burnt at the stake like the peasants at the start of the film. This film therefore leaves a one-dimensional aftertaste, like you have been reading a pamphlet for 2 hours which is very unsatisfying.

My favourite character is Seth Green (Kenny Fisher). I also like Melissa Joan Hart, who played an annoying yearbook girl. Jennifer Love Hewitt was ok, but Ethan Embry (Preston Meyers), Charlie Korsmo (William Lichter), Lauren Ambrose (Denise Fleming) and Peter Facinelli (Mike Dexter) did amazing jobs. It is extremely funny.Most teen flicks aren't funny, but this one was. It had a better plot than American Pie (If you call four teens trying to have sex a plot), more jokes than in She's All that, and better acting than in Detroit Rock City.

They hang out and argue the relative benefits of moving to California or staying in Pawtucket after high school.  Their criteria for deciding revolve around the potential quality and quantity of drugs and sex.  Dunphy lives with his dad (Alex Balwin) and his younger brother (Tommy Bone).  Dunphy gets in trouble. One of his dad's friends is connected and gets Dunphy's jail sentence deferred if he enrolls and successfully completes his senior year of high school at an exclusive prep school.  Dunphy moves from stoned fish in a small pond to fish out of water. His ensuing adventures are predictable but fun.  There is the geeky roommate, stoner pals, beautiful girl that's out of his league, and the Dickensonian schoolmaster.  I enjoyed most every moment.  No scene ever got too melodramatic or silly.  The stoner jokes and other one liners are funny.  Outside Providence plays as a very good 70s coming-of-age movie.  The writing credits for OP goes to Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers (There's Something About Mary, Kingpin, and Dumb and Dumber).  Given the Farrelly connection, I was surprised by the restraint and tenderness of this movie.  Very much worth the rental.

However, if you have attended high school recently you might want to check this film out.Going into this movie I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was funny and I pretty much enjoyed every minute of it. The characters, although somewhat shallow, are interesting and distinct from one another. The acting isn't bad, and the soundtrack is one of the best from any film in the 90s. No one will confuse this with one of the all time great films, but it can be solid entertainment for a night.

As for the story....you're mistaken if you're looking for a history lesson, at least an -accurate- history lesson.  However, I don't think that is the purpose of this movie.  The story of this movie is about the transformation of a free-spirited girl into cold and ruthless yet capable monarch.

So many people told that this movie was a disappointment that by the time I saw it, I was pleasantly surprised.  You see the struggles of an aging baseball pitcher coming upon the crossroads of retiring or continuing to play with a changing game.

After all that this movie was hyped up, I was greatly disappointed.

That's like saying Quick, we need to touch a dog to get out of the matrix!)I have never once in my life seen so many good looking computer geeks. All so stylishly dressed as well, but then again, this is a definite style over content movie, with black clothes being so popular, it's no wonder the producer wanted people decked out head to toe in trenchcoats. After all, why bother to write a decent storyline when you can just fake it, put in lots of great special effects, trendy costumes, l33t computer H@xors and have it sell on these points alone? Sorry, not good enough for me.This movie is plain bad, from the moment it starts right up to the moment it ends, with all the blatant overacting inbetween.If you are one of those people that doesn't like to think when they watch a movie, (and no people, that whole Oh the Matrix makes you WONDER line is just lame, stop it) you'll love this.

The film portrays itself as a comedy. However it also seems to be tackling some deeper issues such as lesbianism and coping when everything you love has been stripped away from you. I therefore couldn't find anything particularly amusing about it. All this would be fine though if the film tackled these issues well. Unfortunetly it doesn't. These things are just glossed over, nothing is gone into in any great depth and at no point do you feel that the film makers have taken an issue as far as they could have done. Also we are left in some doubt as to how we are supposed to feel about the various characters. I assumed that I was suppose to like and empathise with at least one of them. It was a real shame that I couldn't do that because they are all characters who you grow to hate or find annoying as the film progresses. Ultimately Election is a film which tries it's hardest to be funny while at the same time dealing with some issues and giving a message. It fails to do any of these things and would have been perhaps better to have adopted the old adage of 'less is more', one to avoid. "},{"date":"12 August 2000","review":"  What can I say?

It was a bad bad bad book but he made a sick twisted movie of it and Jim Gillespie gave it a semi-surreal Santa Barbara\/As The World Turns kind of look using phony sets and lot of blue highlights and dark tones.But this sequel... it's unwatchable for two principal reasonsNumber one it's a useless sequel, NOTHING here is new and the main feeling you get watching this is deja-vu, if not boredom. Number two is that Trey Callaway's screenplay is horrible. It's an amateurish and barely coherent effort all the way. First of all we KNOW who is doing the killings the whole time and there is not even the slightest single effort at mystery.As for the directing Danny Cannon pretty much apes the look of the first film and flies on auto-pilot the whole time. No points there.Finally, there's the acting... ewww... Freddy Prinze was horrible in the first movie, sometimes looking like he had just read his lines off a teleprompter (no noticeable acting effort) and he continues this tradition here. Jennifer Love Hewitt was pretty good in the first one but she seems to have gotten worse the more she's done films.So here we have it, bad direction, bad writing and bad acting.

The movie seems very long at points despite the fact how the game and the flashbacks go back and forth is well done. Brief points of melodramatic mush do not seem to match the emotions of what any ball player (minus this brooder) would actually act like. Overall the movie is not bad, so it is an OK rental. Compared to other baseball movies though, it probably will not rank as anybody 's new #1 hitter. "},{"date":"18 August 2000","review":"  I knew Rounders had something to do with gambling, and that Matt Damon stars in it, but not much more. So, when I watched it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised how engaging a film it is.I am not a gambler, so maybe that is part of why I found it so fascinating. Basic story - Damon's character is a 2nd yr law student in NYC, and a good enough poker player that he has aspirations of entering and winning the million-dollar prize in the world series of poker in Lasvegas. However, Ed Norton plays his good buddy just getting out of prison. Norton's character is also a poker player, but also incorporates cheating because that just helps you make money faster. This approach gets both of them in some pretty hot water, and also deep in debt!!Damon's character has a S.O. played by Gretchen Mol. Her distaste for gambling puts a great strain on their relationship. Will she stay, or will she move out??And finally, John Malkovich does a wonderful job as the Russian gambler nicknamed KGB. John Turturro is perfectly cast as Damon's friend and street advisor. I simply found myself caught up in this story, anticipating the next poker game, wondering if they would all get whacked, or survive. Plus, Matt Damon has such a relaxed acting style, with that great smile of his, which makes all of his movies easy to watch.I rate this one 8 of 10 for the well-done gambling drama depicted here.

I was so bored...the utter audicity of this film.   Who has a shootout with 15 other guys with automatic weapons and not only doesn't get scratched, but kills ALL the other guys.  No plot that hasn't been seen in Terminator or Tron.  The other bad news is there are more of these 'teeny fantasy sfx' films coming and they'll all be as bad as this one.

Rounders has an interesting story plot and gives the viewers a look at the world of professional gambling.  Damon is supported by a professional cast that makes for good viewing time.

The gorgeous visuals set a perfect backdrop for some of the greatest movie dialogue of all time.  Between the amazingly witty comments made by both Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) and Herman Blume (Bill Murray, in a truly Oscar worthy performance, he was unjustly robbed of a nomination), the producers implement some great, offbeat music that fits perfectly into the film.  This music accurately projects what Max is feeling, and it progresses as he does throughout the film, as we see just how far a young man will go in the name of love. "},{"date":"22 August 2000","review":"  This movie is full of comical events that lead from one to another, but can sometimes be a little gross to watch, case in point, Little Chrissy's sugar dependency. It also shows how fame is sometimes less desired than privacy, as is the case when Pecker's family life is turned upside down by intrusions, first by robbers, then the media and all other sorts of companies and people. And I was hoping that Sexton would have  more screen time than he had in this movie as Pecker's buddy, as I feel he is an underrated young actor. Furlong's performance was top-notch, as expected, with brilliant comic timing, and Ricci is perfect as his girlfriend, who can really deadpan it. "},{"date":"23 August 2000","review":"  This was a very good movie. James Caan was a bit of a stretch as Frank Vitale, it had more to do with the way he looked in the part than with his acting. As usual Hugh Grant was right on the mark as the bumbling Englishman. This movie had a wonderful cast of colorful characters. It also has a surprise ending that left my viewing companion at one point saying that they don't normally do that in movies. This isn't the best or funniest mob movie but it is worth seeing. "},{"date":"24 August 2000","review":"  Robin Williams has always been one of my favorite actors, and he shines in this film. I found it slightly echoing the theme of Dead Poets' Society, another Williams film. Patch Adams is a doctor-in-training who is about to bring the medical establishment on its head by suggesting that laughter is as important as medicine and professional medical care. In DPS, Williams played an English teacher who taught his students to question and not accept as fact everything that is spoonfed them, but to challenge and form their own views of the world around them. Here, Patch Adams is again asking the doctors and nurses to question and challenge what they feel is important to the patients. Is just medical care and medication and making sure the patient lives all that matters? Or is bringing joy and laughter into their lives so that they not just exist, but live, just as important?It is a inspirational movie and not many actors have the calibre that Williams have to bring it off. Once again, he has made what was seemingly the routine medical journey of a medical intern into a movie that is worth watching many times over for all the special scenes where one actually thinks about the message as the movie progresses.

I also think that the first thought is the film is a rather boring piece, but it's true that some of the scenes hit soundly and live in your mind for months, and that the last minute make the rest of the movie more interesting. The movie also reminds me some of Kieslowski's works.

You get a good look at some of the high school cliques - the jocks, the queens, the geeks\/nerds, the outcasts, and Preston, the ordinary-guy-who-sits-next-to-you-in-class-whom-you-know-but-don't-talk-to-much. As in, You know, Preston is....you know.....Preston. A surprising cameo role for Jenna Elfman as the angel, witty as ever. Seth Green is ridiculously funny as well, and the whole movie on the whole keeps you feeling good and comfy. It rolls along, picking up on people's lives along the way, and sometimes makes you want to scream\/sing\/dance\/make-out along with the characters.

There's not much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said before.  It's basically made to appeal to the worthless MTV generation (Which is probably why I can't relate to any of the characters) and not only that, it's probably the most overplayed movie on cable.  None of the characters have any depth, I've seen this movie numerous times and the only thing I can remember about any of the characters is that there was girl who did nothing but whine and she was trapped inside a bathroom with a wigger.  Other than that, nothing even comes to mind of what the freakin movie was about.  If you see this movie, change the channel FAST "},{"date":"29 August 2000","review":"  The cast is perfect, the acting flawless, the story-line deeply moving.  There's nothing draggy about this film, but I feel that this is not the type of movie you pick apart in regards to perfection of directing or this or that. It has a point, and that is that we humans have screwed things up, but it's also our choice whether or not we want to continue doing so.  Anthony Hopkins was, as usual, superb and Cuba Gooding Jr. stole the show. I seldom cry when I watch a movie, but I was totally caught up in it.  Hats off to everyone that had anything to do with bringing about this wonderful movie.  "},{"date":"30 August 2000","review":"  This is not a movie for anyone, especially kids.  Sure, the first few minutes, including a spectacular flight on the back of a pteradon, had me dazzled.  I was glued.  And then I was not.  This is not just a bad movie.Fault 1.  This is a boring movie.  Kids don't like to be bored, but they will with this one.  Yes, the first few minutes are set in a beautiful tropical landscape overflowing with amazing creatures.  Then the rest of the thing is set in a boring and utterly depressing desert.  If the execs at Disney wanted to flaunt CGI, couldn't they have found a more interesting backdrop.  A kid's movie should be anything but boring, right?Fault 2.  This is a violent movie.  I like violence in films.  It's often stimulating and always gets a reaction, but in a kids film, to see a cute little triceratops get pounced on by a giant monster and then watch as the innocent thing is torn to shreds is appalling in a film aimed at youngsters. And this incident is very soon in the film.  Then you see the aftermath of this one poor dinosaur all ripped apart, blood all over, barely alive from his ordeal.Fault 3.  This is a film with bad ethics\/morals (apologies to Election). As has been stated numerous times, all those who eat meat are considered pure evil.  Vegetarians, that's mother nature's elect, I guess.  What happened to Mufasah explaining the circle of life?  And kids will no doubt be asking their parents to explain the mating ritual of the lemurs, which was supposed to be cute and mirror real life, but it explained nothing, just confused kids more about sex.  And then there's much hypocrisy concerning the moral of the story, about standing together and yet beeing a rebel when the occasion called for it.Fault 4.  This is a stolen film.  Not only was I constantly reminded of The Land Before Time, but I realized that I was just watching The Land Before Time, but gone were good characters and dazzling poetic backdrops.  All the plot points are identical, it's just that here, we don't care, largely due to the fact that Dinosaur is supposed to be realistic, which it is not (they talk), but the previous had characters which were kids.  The audience could relate.Parents, please do not buy this film for your kids.  Go buy Chicken Run, came out around the same time, was inspiring, intellectual, absolutely exciting, and I laughed throughout.  Land Before Time was also great if kids want dinosaurs. "},{"date":"31 August 2000","review":"  Patch Adams is genuinely a nice film with a nice theme about the enjoyment of life! That's a great attribute- making the most of your life and living it! With that attribute why did I feel a little patronised, and then why did Patch Adams, the character, eventually become irritating?!The reason I found it patronising, I guess- is because I felt Tom Shadyac and the writers could of showed Patch actually saving a life instead of just making people laugh! Or maybe it was because Patch Adams jerked the system from the beginning and was so righteous! I don't know, I felt something was truly missing in this film- it just didn't gel for me! I really like Robin Williams but he was mis-cast in this film even though he played the role sufficiently! He was basically a big kid in this film, but he was less annoying in Jack!Bob Gunton and Philip Seymour Hoffman were also very good, and plus there was some excellent lines throughout and some very funny moments! But this was no Dead Poets Society! Patch Adams wouldn't rank high compared to the other numerous Robin Williams ventures I've seen! The moral of the film was great but I wish Patch Adams had a flaw or two (considering the film was based on a book written by the actual Patch Adams), and I wish they actually showed some of his skills! If you want to see a poignant film about a doctor\/patient relationship, see The Doctor! I won't say I dislike Patch Adams, the theme and some moments were great! It just seemed a little phony, and really tries to pull the heart-strings!That aside, Patch Adams is fairly light-hearted comedy\/drama that is worth a look. Tom Shadyac's other films; Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Liar Liar are better! I'll give Patch Adams a *** out of *****! "},{"date":"1 September 2000","review":"  After seeing Jim Carrey in both dramatic and comedic roles, I was not quite sure what to expect from this movie. After seeing it, I feel that Carrey is a really talented comic and an above average actor. He gives an impressive performance through out the film although at times he looks as if he is trying to hard. Part of the problem is that he chose to play a man who really was not that funny to begin with so it was hard to empathize with some of the more 'heartbreaking' scenes of the film. The public never really understood what Kaufman was trying to do and I think this movie simply states that. Carrey does give a good performance though. "},{"date":"2 September 2000","review":"  Being someone who can appreciate the game of poker (including its ups and downs), I found this movie to be very good.  The characters in this were well done and Matt Damon and Ed Norton play superb roles. Although I do agree with some reviewers that John Malkovich's accent was a little extreme and also that director John Dahl is a little too technical in explaining the game of poker, I also feel that the overall movie was excellent. If you are looking for an entertaining movie with excellent star performances then this is the movie for you.  The only real problem that I had was with Gretchen Maul's character.  I felt that she needed more of a role to further the movie  "},{"date":"3 September 2000","review":"  It's curious that Elizabeth has attracted so much flak for its screenplay's tendency to reinvent and mythologize the early history of Elizabeth I's reign, since treachery and fidelity, history and myth-making, are precisely what the film is about. As only becomes clear in the last few minutes (sort of spoiler alert!), the film is the history of an image - the famous public image of Gloriana, the virgin queen, powdered white and with a fright wig that makes her look halfway between a clown and a corpse, locked into a costume that restricts her movements to the ritualistic and barely human.  How could any human being become reduced, or inflated, to that iconic status? Kapur's film has a good deal of insight into the nature of the Tudor court, but its primary interest is less historically specific, more about the relationship between personality, celebrity and power.  But the broad lines of the history are quite rich.  There's an alternative myth of origins for English protestantism here, rather convincingly locating the psychological appeal of Elizabeth's church within, rather than outside, English Catholicism, by substituting the Virgin Queen for the Virgin Mary.  And its analysis of the relationship between Tudor politics and Tudor sex, private and public lives, is subtle and pointed, rather in tune with contemporary academic approaches.  There's little scholars need scorn, for all that a good deal of the details, the events, are as fictive as most of what you find in Tudor chronicles or the plays of Shakespeare based on them.So as a knowingly contemporary work of historical imagination, it's more sophisticated than anything since Sally Potter's glorious, if drastically uneven, Orlando (1993).  Unfortunately, like Orlando, Elizabeth is patchy, sometimes cringe-worthy. Some of the contemporary nudges are unsubtle (a weakness shared by The Madness of King George (1994), where the anxiety to make past and present dance to the same tune can leave the film historically adrift, risking relevance to nobody living or dead).  The soundtrack's late lurch from Elizabethan music into Elgar and Mozart's Requiem doesn't work at all, though you can see why director Kapur wanted to broaden the scope, to underscore (literally) how Elizabeth invents an English mythology - hence the Elgar.  The acting is a mixed bag while Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush are pillars of strength, there are some distractingly odd casting decisions, and Richard Attenborough is no better than usual.  But anyone interested in the ongoing history of how film deals with history, and indeed how history gets made in the first place, should put this on their to-see list. Nice frocks, too. "},{"date":"4 September 2000","review":"  The Farrelly brothers (the makers of such laugh-a-minute gross out fests as `There's Something About Mary,' `Kingpin' and `Dumb and Dumber,' among others) take a decided stylistic turn with `Outside Providence,' a low-keyed, laid back coming-of-age tale set in Rhode Island during the mid 1970's.  Shawn Hatosy stars as Timothy Dunphy, a likable, not-very-bright high school student who, like many of his generation, would much rather party than study and would rather smoke-out than think seriously about his future plans for college or career or even life in general.  When he crashes his vehicle, packed with other drinking and pot-smoking teenagers, right smack into the rear of a parked police car, Tim is sent by his working class father to finish his last school year at a nearby prep academy.  Alec Baldwin, adopting a dese-dem-dose accent for the occasion, plays Tim's father, a well-intentioned widower whose brusque demeanor hides a filial love that Tim is only vaguely aware exists.`Outside Providence' certainly does not bring a whole lot of fresh insights to this well-worn territory.  We have the obligatory scenes of non-stop pot smoking (this being a depiction of 1970's adolescence after all), the inevitable first love between the hero and the sweetest, most understanding and, of course, most beautiful girl from the local distaff school, and the predictable confrontations that develop between the freethinking teen and the anachronistic stuffed shirts of the school's administration.  There is also, of course, the mandatory death of one of the members of the original gang to act as a device to sober the boy's up to an awakened awareness of the seriousness and responsibilities of adulthood.Yet, for all of its adherence to the formula of this particular genre, `Outside Providence' wins the audience over, partly through the breezy likeability of the actors and performers, partly through the unforced realism of the screenplay, and partly through the film's dead-on accurate recreation of a decade that is fast becoming the era of choice for modern day nostalgia.  Like so many films that tie themselves strongly to a time long past, `Outside Providence' relies (and perhaps even over relies) on a soundtrack filled with memory-inducing tunes of the period.  This is the easiest trick in the book for filmmakers to stir an audience's fond recollections &#150; but, damned if it doesn't work every time.  In addition, the film is set within the beautiful environs of autumnal New England, a factor that contributes to the overall laid-back charm of the film.`Outside Providence' provides a relaxing, unfrenetic trip down memory lane for those of us who happen to have come of age in the era the Farrellys arepresenting.  The film ultimately doesn't amount to much, but one could find worse ways to spend 90 minutes &#150; and a worse group of people with which to spend it. "},{"date":"5 September 2000","review":"  Election is the type of movie that actors\/actresses do as favors for the director or someone associated with the movie.  Matthew Broderick, fresh of the success of Godzilla, plays Jim McAllister.  Jim is a high school teacher who seems to be a little scared of the world around him.  Reese Witherspoon, Tracy Flick, is a senior at the same high school and running for student council president.  Tracy is the type of person that will do anything, and anyone, to get ahead.What this movie lacks in plot, acting, and directing, is also absent in EVERY other aspect of the film.  The only good thing that I can, and will, say about Election is that the director most certainly introduces us to each and every character thoroughly, which allows us to form our opinion of them almost instantaneously.  We learn that Tracy is a conniving little b*tch who like to kiss ass and then backstab to get her way.  We also feel sorry for Jim having to live his atrocious life of not being able to impregnate his wife, and eventually loosing his mind because of Tracy.I especially don't see the point, or maybe I am just missing it, for the bee sting to Jim.  It is completely irrelevant to the story, and completely unnecessary.  Not at any point in this movie could you hear my laughter.  I don't know what the director (Alexander Payne) was trying to do with the film, but I certainly didn't get anything from it.  Unless you are a diehard Matthew Broderick or Reese Witherspoon fan, Election should be voted off your list of movies to see.  "},{"date":"6 September 2000","review":"  I liked it a lot. It's about people, not things or action or plot. That's uncommon these days, and should be applauded and supported by movie goers. People complain about f\/x flicks, big cash blockbusters, and formulaic lowest common denominator pop-trash movies. That's a noble sentiment, but why not walk that talk? Why not get out to the theaters and pay to SEE movies that attempt to break out of the pop-culture molds? One of the reasons f\/x (etc.) movies are almost all Hollywood makes anymore is because that's mostly all you and I pay to see anymore. Well, here's your chance to put your money where your mouth is and support something a little bit different.Dog Park had a few annoying snotty chick cliches, but not too many, nor too bad. Whether or not this movie represents real life or not, I cannot say. Whether or not a movie, any movie, even SHOULD represent real life--who knows that, either? But, if art, good or bad, is designed to evoke a certain feeling, and certain vibes, then this movie does that very well. The specific events may or may not be accurate, but the vibe and the results are.Minor flaws aside-- and they are mostly mere quibbles-- this is a bright, charming, thoughtful movie about contemporary people. I think everyone could relate to, and benefit from, Dog Park's exploration of the heart its fear, courage, deadness, commitment and connection.

He is easily the best thing about it, as the screenplay is ridiculous and the plot points are worse.  I don't want to mention them all, thereby spoiling anything for anyone, but suffice to say that following a good beginning, its all straight down-hill.I must mention a sub-plot involving Alec Baldwin's poker buddies and their treatment of one of their group.  When the abused returns the next time these men are seen playing cards, its not only ridiculous but insulting.Its not the actors fault, in this case, because they really try to bring some humanity to the proceedings.  "},{"date":"8 September 2000","review":"  I have to say that EdTV is better off to be a sequel to The Truman Show rather than a brand new movie. Despite what others say about EdTV, I believe it to be a rip off of The Truman Show because it is basically contains the same premise. I must say that it did have originality, which I enjoyed and basically the only reason it was bearable to watch. Matthew McConaughy, Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Woody Harrelson star as EdTV just misses the target. While it is my opinion that it is a disappointment, I did enjoy how Ron Howard showed the life of a celebrity and all the trials and tribulations they face every day.With performances that were so-so, EdTV was a humorous look at celebrity life, which I enjoyed.However, I can't believe so many huge stars contributed to this film. It seemed as if they were more like cameos than actual roles. I give this film a 6 out of 10. "},{"date":"9 September 2000","review":"  Outside Providence seems like just another low budget, goofy high school comedy from the preview, but it is really a good movie. Timothy Dunphy is the lovable high school screw-up whose father sends him off to boarding school after he is involved in an accident with a parked police cruiser while smoking pot with his loser buddies. He develops an unlikely romantic relationship with the stunningly beautiful Jane Weston (Amy Smart) at the repressive school while fighting off the disciplinary excesses of the school faculty. This seems like the premise of the kind of ridiculous high school comedies that characterized the 80s (Screwballs, Ski School, etc.), but Outside Providence works well because it has heart. Timothy Dunphy is sent off unwillingly to this hellish school, and it turns out to be a really eye-opening experience for him. He develops a lot of insight about himself, his friends, his romantic endeavors, and his family. The story is not exactly something that is entirely original, but the presentation of the film and the acting are extremely good, and the end result is a great comedy. Alec Baldwin delivers a hilarious performance as the emotionally closed-off father, regularly referring to his own son as dildo. He steals every scene he is in, and he should be particularly noted for his ability to give such a convincing portrayal of an emotionless, macho father and still be convincing in the emotionally tense scene between him and Timothy where he describes Tim's late mother. That scene in particular is unexpectedly intense.Outside Providence is a good comedy. It does not resort to tasteless sexual fourth-grade humor to pull it along (which is one of the biggest problems with teen comedies lately - American Pie, Scary Movie (there was no hope for that one from the beginning), There's Something About Mary, and Road Trip, which should have been a great movie). Instead, Outside Providence focuses on character development and a good story, and tops it all off with a healthy amount of comedy in the form of the cast, the characters, the script, dialogue, and pretty much everything else. Probably one of the best elements of this movie is that it is not a relentless comedy. It doesn't grab desperately for a laugh every second of the way, but instead it rounds out the content with drama, romance, skillful comedy, as well as good writing, directing, and acting. Outside Providence is badly underrated and should not be missed. "},{"date":"10 September 2000","review":"  Uninspiring time killer which is just about watchable. Billed as a comedy, it turns out to be more of a thriller as we follow down on his luck (and alcoholic) reporter Dan Starkey (David Thewlis - Dragonheart) as he bumbles his way through being convicted of murder, chased by the IRA and the Police while he tries to unravel a conspiracy involving high and mighty politicians trying to make peace in troubled Northern Ireland. Moderately entertaining, it falls down mainly because you will not care less what happens to any of the very dislikable characters involved in the plot and if you really think about it the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Best part of the film is the gorgeous Laura Fraser as Thewlis' &#145;bit on the side', although she is not in it all that much.

The sudden pairing off of all the characters feels forced and lacks credibility.  I felt quite let down. "},{"date":"12 September 2000","review":"  This movie is awesome.

"},{"date":"13 September 2000","review":"  This movie, For Love of the Game, spans one complete baseball game, Detroit at NY Yankees, last game of the regular season. In a series of flashbacks Costner's character, the aging all-star pitcher, reminisces over the past 5 years, particularly in his relationship with Kelly Preston's character. In the process, about 2\/3 through the game he realizes that he has a perfect game going. In 120 years of baseball, only 18 perfect games have been pitched. So, the drama mounts as we see whether he will succeed, or, as he did in Tin Cup, hit it in the lake on #18.If you generally like Costner, like I do, then you will like this movie. The writing is very good, and unlike many modern action movies, this one does a lot of character development. One memorable line - No matter what happens during the next 5 minutes, I want you to know my heart lept when you showed up at my door. My heart lept in my chest.As you find out from the DVD extras, real professional baseball players and real major league umpires were used to film the game. For 30 days in Yankee Stadium, just after the season ended, they filmed the action. For that reason the ball play is very realistic, very game-like. Overall a very fine movie. "},{"date":"14 September 2000","review":"  The Farrellys have delivered the goods once again with Outside Providence. Playing off of the time-tested classic coming-of-age plot, they've made another indy-spirited, off-beat comedy.Tim Dunphy gets into trouble and is in danger of not graduating high school, so his mob-connected scumbag dad (Alec Baldwin!) gets him enrolled at a top-notch school in Connecticut. While there, he makes good friends, has a good time, gets in trouble and learns a little about life.The Farrellys are very aware of the coming-of-age teen drama that they are satirizing. Much of the humor is subtle. But exaggerated characters such as Drugs or Old Man Dunphy bring the film to life ala Warren from Something About Mary. Of course, you'll feel guilty for laughing when Tim's wheelchair-ridden brother acts excessively handicapped to gain admission to a Patriots game.I highly recommend this movie, especially if you are a Farrelly fan. It hits the comic funny bones as you would expect, and also adds some surprising heartwarming and provocative stuff to round it out. (Does Old Man Dunphy maintain his friendship with his recently-out gay friend? Where does everyone end up in life?) Contrast this with Kingpin, which takes a bizaare premise with bizaare characters and produces bizaare results. Outside Providence takes a cliche premise and adds bizaare characters, subtle plot twists, and produces solid results.

Then there was Scream 2, that kept the humour and blood flowing both as strong as each other.  After these, we were promised an 'Extra Special' sequal, in the 3rd and Final Chapter that would finish the Scream films...and did we get it...well, allmost. It's not that Scream 3 is a bad film, it just isn't as good as the others.  The main reason is, Kevin Williamson is not the main writer, and it shows.  The humour isn't as good and the deaths aren't as elaborate and imaginative as in the other films.  Also, Ghostface is not seen much and neither is Neve Campell really for that matter.  In stead, the plot is really focused on Courtney Cox and David Arquete. Does Scream 3 answer all your questions...in a way, it does tie up loose ends, and you will never guess the killer in a million years...the ending is definately one of Scream 3's most memorable moments (along with the cameo from Jamie Kenedy as Randy) Don't let this put you off Scream 3 though...it is a good film and scream fans MUST see it...but, it could of been so much better, and i can't help but feel that it wont be long before another sequal spews it's way out, even though Ghostface's knife is clearly blunter that it has ever been.  "},{"date":"17 September 2000","review":"  **Possible Spoilers**\t\tDirector Kelly Makin infiltrates the mob in `Mickey Blue Eyes,' a comedy starring Hugh Grant and James Caan.  Art House auctioneer Michael Felgate (Grant) is in love; when he asks Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) to marry him, though, she turns him down, and he hasn't a clue as to why.  What he doesn't know is that her father, Frank Vitale (Caan), is a member of a `family' run by Vito Graziosi (Burt Young), and Gina realizes that if she marries Michael he will automatically become a part of it all, whether he wants to or not.  She loves him, but she wants to protect him from the life into which she was born.  An admirable notion; she will sacrifice her love in order to keep him out of trouble.  Michael, however, is not about to accept her answer without further investigation.  He decides it's time to meet her father.  When Frank finds out, he is delighted, and he prepares to take Michael into the family.  Before he can formally introduce his son-in-law-to-be to Vito and the other family members, however, he realizes some training is in order.  That British accent, for one thing, just won't cut it.  In what turns out to be one of the funniest scenes in the movie, Frank then attempts to coach Michael in the finer aspects of `mob' dialect.  Well, `F'gedduhboudit.'  Michael comes off sounding more like Elmer Fudd on Prozac.  By the time Michael finally meets Vito, he has become `Mickey Blue Eyes,' a connection from out of town, and a man of few words. \tAn amiable enough comedy, Makin keeps it all fairly light-hearted, and there are some humorous moments; all in all, however, there just isn't a lot of laughs here.  Grant does a good job with Mickey, relying on his usual stammering and innocent countenance enough to win over the audience.  Tripplehorn makes her Gina just sympathetic enough to make her likable, putting the martyr-for-love aspect to good use.  Unfortunately, there isn't much chemistry between the two;  the performances are satisfactory, but their characters lack that certain something that makes you really want to root for them.  Caan does well in a roll to which he is perfectly suited; in fact, it would seem that this part was written specifically for him.  Young is convincing as Vito, but he really doesn't have much to work with; he looks the part, but it's a thankless endeavor.  Joe Viterelli adds a nice touch as `Vinnie the Shrimp,' and with this one and `Analyze This' under his belt, he should be a made guy by now.  The rest of the supporting cast includes James Fox (Philip Cromwell), Gerry Becker (Agent Connell), Maddie Corman (Carol), Tony Darrow (Angelo) and Paul Lazar (Ritchie Vitale). \tIf you're looking for some light entertainment and a few laughs, and especially if you're a fan of Hugh Grant, `Mickey Blue Eyes' will fill the bill.  Though far from memorable, it's not too bad, either; just the ticket, perhaps, for whiling away a pleasant evening without having to think too much.  I rate this one 5\/10.     \t   "},{"date":"18 September 2000","review":"  My wife and I are regular dog park visitors, and we rented this movie purely on the title.

However, the fact that I may have been slightly more ignorant of England's history during this time than perhaps other reviewers was overshadowed by the fact that I actually *felt* as though I learned more from this film of the particular time era.   Cate Blanchett was unarguably superb as far as protagonists and lead actors go. Everyone seems to mention the weirdness of the direction...I guess I should watch it again to take notice.   However historically flawed this film *MAY* be, let it also be considered that Elizabeth's persona in this film is flawless; she epitomizes the upper-class, yet unwanted daughter of Henry VIII, who, as a child, had to take responsibility of Queen of England. Yes, she did look like an innocent child before she was crowned, and that's because she was! Although her stern political views came later, this movie is special because it depicts this Elizabeth's process in *becoming* the leader, the legend, the inspiration of a country. It studies the consequences that shaped the views she would have for the rest of her life.    This film helped me recognize Cate Blanchett as one of the most promising future actresses of our generation(I hate using superlatives...but I feel I owe one to Cate!)

"},{"date":"23 September 2000","review":"  Andy Kaufman's motivation isn't at all hard to understand.  We've all had the desire to play practical jokes.  We've all had the urge to say and do things that are, objectively speaking, funny, even though, and often because, we know that the humour will be invisible to everyone but ourselves.  And it's obvious us all what a good practical joke requires it requires that we shut up and let others work out for themselves what the joke is, whatever the cost of our silence.  Andy Kaufman - the character portrayed in this film, at any rate - was simply someone who loved a certain kind of humour more than anything else in the world.  You've heard stories about people who love, say, music, more than anything else in the world...?  Well, this is no different; certainly no more mysterious.Remember the moment when his agent says, You have to ask yourself this question who are you trying to entertain?  The audience, or yourself?  Andy doesn't answer.  But the answer he would have given, had he been in a mood to be honest, would have been, Neither.  I'm interested in creating situations that are, objectively speaking, amusing - even if audiences are unable to laugh at them - even if I MYSELF am unable to laugh at them.That's why it was worthwhile for Milos Forman to come along, after the dust had settled, and make Kaufman's life into a movie.  Some of the jokes are only visible to a God's-eye view.I walked into the film pretty much prepared to loathe Kaufman (whose stuff I've never seen).  Okay, the man probably had talent.  He was a skilled artist, of a kind.  Still a skilled artist of almost any other kind would be more worthy of admiration.  But Forman keeps his distance, and simply asks us to see a genuinely tragic story of a human being who is somehow easy to like and - to us, if not to the other characters in the film - perfectly transparent.  (So much so that we have to wonder how it was possible for Kaufman's contemporary audiences not to know what was going on.  Are Americans REALLY as dense as legend says they are?  Maybe not; and anyway, Forman's frequent cut-away shots to the audience show a variety of different responses.)I could have done without that postscript with Tony Clifton; but the Philippines stint, and the funeral sequence it dissolved into, were marvellous.  Forman's best work since Amadeus. "},{"date":"24 September 2000","review":"  Their names are, JURASSIC PARK and THE LOST WORLD.

Even as The Phantom Menace entered into the summer, The Matrix was definitely the premier Science-Fiction of the year, making up where The Phantom Menace failed so miserably. (Anyone that up-plays The Phantom Menace over this movie is jealous because everyone ragged on their precious, infallible Star Wars and placed this one far ahead of it, which is rightfully so. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars, but this movie is definitely better than Episode One).There were at times some cheesy moments, most notably the romantic moment between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). Neo wasn't as strong as one would hope our hero to be, but it can be understood that he is taking his situation in all at once, converted from just a simple programmer\/skilled hacker in the process of reorientating his entire knowledge of things. To understand the movie of course, one would have follow the advice of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), Unfortunately, nobody can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.The effects were excellent as well as the action sequences, not to mention the plot concept had been very intriguing, original no less. It is certainly worth seeing for anyone who wants to think about new concepts afterward. Anyone who thinks this was a terrible movie DOES NOT appreciate Science-Fiction, and probably believes classic literature is the only kind of literature.

We've seen this so many times before, and it seemed as if everyone from the Ephron sisters to Hanks to Ryan were just cashing a paycheck. No subtleties whatsoever. The ending really angered me, too.  Was it just me, or did Hanks' character spend the last quarter of the movie manipulating Ryan's character needlessly? The final scene would have rung much truer if, rather than sobbing and kissing him once he revealed himself to be her on-line paramour, Ryan's character instead slapped him in the face for screwing with her head. If you must indulge in such romantic piffle, you can see essentially the same movie by renting When Harry Met Sally.

Somehow I just can't muster much empathy for these folk--any more than I can for mountain climbers, speed racers or stunt daredevils.If that's their choice, fine; but leave me out when it comes to feeling sorry for their plight when things go amiss. In the case of Rounders, I just couldn't feel much for these assorted poker whizes, be they reformed-, hustler-, or addict-types. It was then to the cast's credit that this presentation proved as provocative as it was.  The excellent Matt Damon and the superb Edward Norton offer convincing characterizations, along with fine supports, including John Turturro.  The above trio represents the best of the more younger crop actors working in film today.  Each brings a youthful talent and integrity to their respective assignments, which shines through even in average productions.  In the case of Rounders, their ensemble acting is on a consistently high level, with the total production offering some well-observed statements on the tensions created between gambling denizens and their loan shark counterparts.   ###   "},{"date":"30 September 2000","review":"  Cate Blanchette was robbed of an Oscar for her performance as Elizabeth.. she was strong and compelling. HOWEVER, the liberties with which the writers and director of this film took on historical points was appalling.  Never, once, anywhere, have I read that she had sex with anyone!!!!!!  I'm so tired of Hollywood thinking that every film has to have a sex scene in it, even if learned minds already know that it is a lie to place it in the film.She lost her hair as a result of a fever as a young woman, not because she was going to present herself as a virgin queen...  she did not cut her hair off--it fell out.  Her skin was rendered with pock marks as a result of the fever--perhaps she contracted scarlet fever?  Therefore she used heavy white makeup base to hide the imperfections.Nonetheless, the historical inaccuracies are what kept this movie from being as monumental in its scope as Anne of the Thousand Days...  but no matter--Cate Blanchette should have won the Oscar for her portrayal--certainly not Gwenneth Paltrow and Judy Dench for a 6 minute blurb on screen.. yes, she may have turned in a powerful 6 minutes, but it's not enough in my mind, to blot out an hour plus movie on the same character.

I like the little tease with the dynamite and the pop gun, where you might think that Max is about to go postal at the school instead of using those tools to produce his opus.  This might be considered in poor taste by some after Littleton...There is more than a little symbolism in the clothing worn by Max throughout the movie as he undergoes his metamorphosis, evolving from the ever present Rushmore jacket, through the blue collar outfit and vest when Max is a barber, culminating in the flamboyant green velvet outfit at the Heaven and Hell premiere...In short, a really incredible, beautiful movie... please don't miss this!

Not only in  the visual sense,  but in storytelling, the way society is, and much more.  And, Keanu Reeves is almost good here.Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A.

Only he didn't plan on Sarah (Jennifer Connelly).  Sarah is a free spirited, radical human rights advocate.  We meet them on the day she dies and then flash back to the inception of their relationship in 1972.  He is The Establishment personified.  She is an iconoclast.  Two philosophies more incompatible could not possibly exist, but despite everything, they fall in love. The story then fast-forwards to Fielding's campaign for the House of Representatives ten years after Sarah's death.  It is at this time that Fielding becomes obsessed with Sarah's ghost.  He believes he is seeing her everywhere and that he is surely losing his mind.  He begins to question his own philosophies and begins to lose his will to win the election.The film is an engrossing character study of two very fascinating people cut of completely different cloth.  The non-linear approach used by Director Keith Gordon was both a blessing and a curse.  Sometimes it provided important character development and motivation and at others, it jumped back and forth for no good reason.  This often made the film seem disjointed and hard to follow.  Gordon's direction was only fair, though he delivered accurate period renderings especially of the 1970's.  There were too many instances of unnecessary stylizing.  For instance, there was excessive use of monologue jump cuts, where he cut from the speaker saying one thing to the same speaker in the same spot saying something else.  He used it so often that it looked like bad editing.  In addition, Gordon tended to focus on the schmaltzy romantic angle and downplayed the far more interesting philosophical tension.  He did give us some dialectic, but generally cut away when the philosophical fireworks were just getting started.  He also kept treading over the same ground in different ways.  This made the story drag.The acting by both leads was terrific.  This film brings Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly together again, both having appeared in `Inventing the Abbotts'.  Crudup was extremely impressive as the tormented politician.  This was an exquisitely complex character and Crudup flexed the role to the max.  Connelly was a bit more uneven in her role, sometimes playing the role with great force, but at others with a mousy self-consciousness that was inconsistent with the character.  Still, she gave Sarah great depth as both a lover and a crusader, and a convincing passion for her beliefs.This is an absorbing but slow moving romance that is a bit heavy handed, but nonetheless interesting.

I was embarrassed for the actors who appeared in this gut-wrenching, slobbering, emotion-fest.  Both Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connolly are fine actors, and anyone offended by mawkish sentimentality will wince at some of the lines they are made to speak in this in this awful, maudlin, frustrating movie.Billy Crudup plays a super-decent, super-caring, super-sensitive Democratic (of course--just one of this movie's many cliches) Congressional contender. Jennifer Connolly is his lover from some 10 years ago, who he believes has been killed in Chile rescuing people from a despotic regime.  Their affair is told through flashbacks. They have long senstive conversations.  When they fight, they don't really fight--they are both too decent to yell at the other.  They just look hurt, and we *know* that this is a very meaningful non-fight. Naturally, he is a gentle lover; she weeps during sex. Everyone in this movie is terribly earnest, and LOVES to talk about what they're feeling. In other words This is the Über Chick Movie!But then, when Crudup's character is running for office, he begins seeing Connolly...around, sometimes out of the corner of his eye, sometimes everywhere, a flock of her coming at him.  It seems likely...likely that she's alive...or is it his imagination?  We're never given a convincing reason why, if Connolly is still alive, she has been in hiding all these years, or how such a sensitive, decent person could justify doing what she did to him.  If she isn't alive...then ole Fielding is hallucinating and is, therefore, a psychopath, and the whole idea that he could sustain a campaign, let alone get elected, is laughable.There is one remarkably inept scene in which Crudup's character Fielding is eating with Connolly, her church coworkers (two priests), and 4 Chilean nationals they have just rescued.  One of the Chilean women confronts Fielding on his desire to become a politician, condemning him specifically for becoming an American politician, and we--like Fielding--feel the others in the room silently agreeing with her.  Fielding explodes (but decently!), pointing out their hypocrisy, and how, despite the world's finger-pointing at Americans, it is OUR shores they so often wash up on when fleeing the terror of their homelands.  Finally, he declares that he is choking on the collective superiority in this room! It is a good line, and he delivers a great tirade...but everyone (except, perhaps, the Chileans) in this movie is so darn nice, and good and wholesome, that we can't believe for a minute that they can't see Fielding's goodness, too.  So their collective superiority...it just doesn't ring true.In fact, very, very little in this movie rings true.  This is the sort of movie a 14-year-old girl wanting an adult love story might like; it displays precisely that sort of idealized emotional maturity.  Few discerning adults will be able to stomach it.  Even my wife (who is the reason I sat through it) disliked it.

This movie does an excellent job in making the viewer reflect on how life is and how it can be, it only depends on the point of view of each person that conforms society as it exists, and also on the will to be aware of our own acts and the consequences of this same acts in society. For example all the wars that has been fought during human recorded history are a waste of energy, and even some of those wars have been in the name of god, so I think that sometimes we humans should have to consider if our way of acting and thinking make us slaves of unpractical and hateful ideas or does it liberate us.

Unlike Federal Hill and American Buffalo, Outside Providence has a number of dolly and pan shots instead of keeping the camera still for 90 plus minutes. The film also had three montage sequences that made the film move faster. The sound track of the film alone makes the movie worth watching.Any viewer from New England will be amazed to see Foxboro Stadium in the film. I think its safe to say that Outside Providence is the first and only film to shoot a scene at the not so famous stadium where the Patriots play.Overall, This was a great film ! Shawn Hatosy hit the Rhode Island accent like it was his second nature. A new comer to the screen, a lot of us will remember Shawn from the hit comedy   In and Out.

This is a great film. Thought  every detail has been painstakingly well thought out. The little dialogue it contained was insightful and never overdone. The  connection between the on screen visuals and the  background music blended together to such perfection i dare not drawl any analogies. Take a guess.This movie  really flowed, as in fluid motion. Well, if you feel you need a guide to take you from point a to point b than watch it anyway. For the experience, and it is an experience. A haunting one at that.

"},{"date":"20 October 2000","review":"  I suppose its easy to simply dismiss a film like this that mawkishly wears its heart on its sleeve with each and every scene. I tried to resist this impulse and was able to look past the first 20 groaners.  The film beat me into submission. I love Jennifer Connelly and really wanted to like this film but the corny dialogue, too-artsy pretentious editing and monotone emotional stance (Supersensitive Fielding is forlorn the entire running length) ,wore out their welcome. The leads  did have a good chemistry and I applaud the ambition of the film (as well as the maker's non-use of worn out Big Chill-like music to soundtrack the flashback scenes), but mark this one as an earnest failure.

The story reflect most of the real life where people might face or encounter.Love might not come easily but this shows how love supposed to be expressed either right or wrong, either way.Such a flawless movie with good acting and expression by the cast, thumb up. "},{"date":"22 October 2000","review":"  When I first heard about Election, that movie was in the nominees for Best Inspired Screenplay for the Oscars.  When I visited this site for further explanation about the movie, I was really unsure about seeing it.  When I finally watched it yesterday on cable, I was ashamed that I didn't see it sooner.  This movie tries and succeeds on being different types of movies. In fact, it takes the craziness of American Pie or There's Something about Mary and combines it with any political movie you've seen.  Matthew Broderick proves he can act in this feature and Reese Witherspoon is great in her perfect-student role.I give this movie 8 out of ten. "},{"date":"23 October 2000","review":"  I was skeptical of The Iron Giant when I sat down to watch it for the first time a few months ago.  My attitude had been If it isn't a Disney film, it can't be that good, can it?Oh, yes, it can.  This is definitely the best animated film I have seen in years.  The characters were realistic, the animation was beautiful, and the plot was good enough to hold my three year-old's attention as well as my own.  And I figure that, eventually, I will be able to watch the ending without bawling.  Also, I liked the anti-gun message behind the film, and how simply it was rendered.Do yourself a favor.  Even if you don't like cartoons, give this one a shot. "},{"date":"24 October 2000","review":"  Max Fischer has so many extracurricular activities there little time left for studying. He writes plays about Vietnam. His friends are a loyal eleven year old aide and a forty-five year old millionaire who drives Bentley. This comedy is so off-beat you just have to love it. It's an ode to nerds, about a young boy who feels grown up and about a grown man wanting to be young again. Aside from being very on-point, it's also hilariously funny. It's great looking at the world through the eyes of a fifteen year old with all the problems of a grown man. Great work by Jason Schwartzman. "},{"date":"25 October 2000","review":"  What is wrong with all the people who have called this movie c**p, the worst of the decade, etc? People attack this movie for not making sense. It only makes enough sense to transport you from one scene to the next. Basically we see our lead, Nic at three stages in his life. Yeah, so the story isn't terrific. But it's the visuals that are astounding. And the Adam\/Eve representation was also very well done. This is not a bad movie. You want to see a bad movie? Try Where the Heart Is or Salo's 120 days in Sodom. Or, dare I say it, Fame 2? Save your criticism for these, don't put it here. "},{"date":"26 October 2000","review":"  Election takes a new twist on political satires like Bulworth, Primary Colors, and Wag The Dog.  This film has the setting of a high school presidential election.  Tracy Flick is an over-achiever and the leading candidate; she is the only candidate in the school's election.  Reese Witherspoon plays her to perfection.  She is perky, spirited, smart, and in the eyes of one teacher (Matthew Broderick) demonic. Tracy has already inadvertently gotten one teacher fired by having an affair with him.  Mr. McAllister (Broderick) tries to steer clear of Ms. Flick, but being her teacher and head advisor of the student counsel, he finds that task rather difficult.  To try and keep himself from any possible danger he seeks the help of the high school's ex-football star Paul Metzler. Knowing full well that Metzler will never play football again he encourages him to run against Tracy in the election.  Chris Klein plays Metzler with such a goofy charm working for him that I would find it hard to believe that anyone couldn't like him. The third party is Tammy Metzler who is only running to get back at her brother and his girlfriend, Lisa.  You see, Paul doesn't realize it, but before he was dating Lisa she was dating Tammy.  Angered, and love-scorned, Tammy runs the type of campaign I remember from Brewster's Millions, and tells the voters not to vote at all.  She is very funny and very malicious, with what one might call a soft spot. Election also explores McAllister's home life, which is a little boring, and so is his sex life.  His wife wants a baby and is using sex solely for that purpose.  However unromantic the sex scenes are, they are quite hysterical. He fantasizes about affairs with a friend of the family and Tracy Flick. Matthew Broderick is in a small way horrifying to watch in this role. Remember that he was once Ferris Bueller.  He is often disgusting, and pitiful, but always there to laugh at, and very loudly at times.  The best scene of the movie is Broderick staring in desperation into the large face of a vending machine. This film works on many levels, not one of which would be as a teenage comedy.  This is not She's All That, nor is it Never Been Kissed.  It is darker, and it knows it.  As far as political-satires go, Election is the best I've seen, and to think, it's school-political-satire.  The levels of the performances are outstanding.  Matthew Broderick has recently had a very bad spell (Godzilla, and Inspector Gadget).  Here he hits the right note playing the teacher mildly and seriously.  Reese Witherspoon smothers the screen with her huge smile and striking personality, even if it persuades you to hate her.  Chris Klein who also stars in this year's American Pie (almost the same role), reminds me of a young Keanu Reeves in films like River's Edge and Parenthood. Like most of the films I mentioned in the above statement Election is not for everyone.  Some people will be disgusted, some will be offended, and some will turn it off.  I believe in the realism of this movie.  I believe in a world unbound by censorship and an industry able to make this art, imitating life, imitating art.  Perhaps one day we will all understand the significance of these movies.  I should have run for class office.  "},{"date":"27 October 2000","review":"  When this movie first came out, I saw the commercials for it and I thought to myself Now THERE'S a cool movie!  Unfortunately, my family is not one that sees movies regularly, so I totally missed it in theatres (DRAT!). Happily, I got a chance to see it when our local movie rental place got it. (YAY!) The instant I saw it, I turned to mush.  This HAS to be THE best movie of the year... heck, of the DECADE, even!All the actors were great, and I especially adored Hank Azaria as the fork-flinging, turban-wearing, British-accented Blue Raja. (you can tell, I named myself after him!)  So guess what I did?  I hunted up the special edition of the movie at the nearest video-selling place, and I bought it. With my own money, which is saying alot because I don't have much of my own money...I really don't see how anyone could hate a movie this neat!  The effects were great (and hilarious), the script was great, the casting was excellent, and the costume design deserves two-thumbs-up!I'm one of the few people in this world who has now dedicated all their spare time to doing anything Mystery-Men-ish.  This Halloween, I'm going as the Blue Raja, forks and all. The only question I have is When's the sequel coming out???  "},{"date":"28 October 2000","review":"  I despise Goldie Hawn usually, and I found her very funny and touching in this movie as a supportive wife who's sacrificed her career for her children and now hopes to suck the marrow out of life. Steve Martin, as always, is hilarious.  He is partially reprising his role in the BRILLIANT Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with a vengeance in this film.  His attempt at controlling his demeanor at the car rental place by keeping a big smile on his face was really funny.  This sign should say 'We have car.' honey!  The homage to Mrs. Robinson looking through Goldie Hawns' legs at a sheepish looking Steve Martin took me by surprise as well.And, what more can you say about John Cleese?  The man is nothing if not funny in everything he does.  He is the anti-Fawlty in this movie, and he has a fairly juicy part as well, so look to him for some great laughs as well.Don't listen to all these people with no sense of humor.  This isn't a classic film, but it's MUCH better than people have been saying.  A little cheesy, a lot of fun. "},{"date":"29 October 2000","review":"  Keitel, Dafoe, and especially, Sorvino carry this film.  Those who criticize their performances as emotionless don't seem to understand that episodes of love in 'real' peoples' lives need not be filled with overt rapture.  In other words (appropriate to this film), we don't need to be re-creating Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the Rain' scene when fate brings us into those moments of untainted happiness.  The actors brought to their roles exactly what was necessary.  The film is about the unpredictable yet apparently fatalistic turns life can take.  Though we might not be able to say what is going to happen next with each passing scene, there is some method (guided by an inanimate object in this film) to the madness.  As the viewer, you sense, for better or worse, that the characters are inexorably moving toward an end, traversing both love and loss on their journey.  This film will either captivate or alienate the viewer, just rent it and see for yourself. "},{"date":"30 October 2000","review":"  The phrase Black comedy doesn't do Election justice. The way it seamlessly jumps from funny to downright disturbing and back again is unique. We need a name for this new one-movie genre.

"},{"date":"31 October 2000","review":"  Occasionally along comes a film which is not hyped to the maximum and generally comes recommended by a friend, my favourite Sci-Fi film of all time came to me this way, that film was The Hidden. Now it has been surpassed by Pitch Black, received the US DVD last week and so far watched it 5 or 6 times and the film just gets better and better.So where to begin, the start is excellent full of action not the usual eerie pan around the spaceship interior. The bodycount also starts pretty quickly. This leads into a very fast pace for the whole film all the way to the end.The sound (on DVD) is excellent and the visuals (although not scientifically accurate) are a wonder to behold, with lots of freeze framing going on. Characters are well in two camps ( those who survive most of the time and those who don't ), Riddick, Fry, Jack, Imam, Johns and to a lesser degree Paris all have some development throughout the film and add some interesting plots.The acting on the whole is very good and Vin Diesel deserves to increase his Hollywood profile following this film. The DVD offers a lot of information with the commentaries sections and would recommend checking these out. I look forward to 10th November when Pitch Black is in UK cinemas ( yes that is 9 months since the US release and some one should face criminal charges of cruelty for that ) as it will be a visceral feast to enjoy on the big screen.If you liked Predator, Aliens, The Hidden, Independence Day, The Thing or any other leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride movie then you MUST see Pitch Black. "},{"date":"1 November 2000","review":"  On a Sunday afternoon I was captivated by a film starring Harvey Keitel. Being a big fan of his work I watched...and watched...and watched as a very convoluted story unfolded.  It seemed too long and told enough to get you interested, but not enough to fill you in.  I will say that I have attempted to watch it again to gather the meaning and plot of the film, but gave up remembering the disappointing ending.I would suggest this to anyone who is up for a confusing film.  The acting is great, the story has too many holes. "},{"date":"2 November 2000","review":"  This is a wonderfully directed, written, cast, acted, photographed, scored and edited feel-good movie - much like Costner's equally underappreciated Tin Cup - and everybody seems to hate it.  Unlike sanctimonious dreck like Forrest Gump and Pay It Forward, For Love of the Game earns its sentiment honestly, presenting realistic adults dealing with life's hurdles and changes (or is that strike-outs and foul-balls?).  A thorough delight, if you're open to it.  "},{"date":"3 November 2000","review":"  This is a very charming and sweet movie.  First off, after having attended a prep school for four long years, I can say that this is a great representation of one.  Kids double-crossing you for favor of the headmaster, sneaking around for fear of being booted, and the general backwardness in thinking of those that were in charge.  Supposedly, Peter Farrelly also went to the same school as I and used it for the movie albeit with a name change.  Cornwall is only 10 miles from the Kent School so its possible, but you know how rumors fly.  Anyways, the movie is well acted and has a great soundtrack.  I highly recommend it.

"},{"date":"6 November 2000","review":" Dan Marcus and jasper, I just have a few things to get off my chest.Last night I watched Gorillas in the Mist for the first time in 12 years. It is a good movie, but comparing it to Instinct is a pretty difficult thing to do. It is only similar to Instinct in that it has gorillas in it, and it has a message of freedom. Similar things can be said about comparing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Instinct. Mist is about Gorillas, and Cuckoo is about mental patients, while Instinct is mostly about the mental freedom that humans need to achieve; we need to wake up and realize that we do not own the universe.That is the message in Instinct that you seemed to have either so ineptly failed to comprehend, or became so very angry at, because you did understand. Yes, these other two films could point you in the same direction, but Instinct very bravely shoves this message right in our faces, tempting many brain-dead and\/or heartless people to get their butt hairs all up in twist, bashing this incredibly brilliant, poignant and valorous film. I understand. Really I do. But you don't. Are you free, juha?Jeremy Barger "},{"date":"7 November 2000","review":"  Wes Anderson's Rushmore is a quirky, well meaning and sometimes funny satire of prep-school life that takes a good look at an oddball who run more student clubs than there are oil drills in Texas.  It is usually on target and works well, but it isn't as perfect as the majority thinks.The story follows a weird kid (played by Jason Schwartzman of the Coppola family and son of Talia Shire in a fine debut) who is content in being a academically bad student, but then finds the apple of his eye, a teacher (Olivia Williams) who changes his perspective.  But, he is contending against a millionaire (Bill Murray in one of his finest roles) who wants her just as much.  Some very wise moments and looks on school life and love, however, the lulls lower the standards just a tad.  Still, worth seeing for the performances alone, especially Murray.  B+ "},{"date":"8 November 2000","review":"  I'm not sure about spoilers, so bewareVery few films can compare to this one.  You get honest laughs.  The humor is not manipulated or stupid.  The character Camille (Glenn Close)could definitely be classified as a villain (not to mention a nut-case).  Cora (Julianne Moore) plays a puppet for camille to boss.  Emma (Liv Tyler) is the rebellious, fish skinner, a totally differant motif from her normal feminine roles she has had the last 5 years.  Throughout the movie I got slightly confused with how whom is related to whom. But the charming cast and great acting out weighs that.  The best part is the end with Coras' revenge.   "},{"date":"9 November 2000","review":"  This is quite simply one of the most breathtaking and exiting films of all time. The editing, the soundtrack, the hot Franka Potente all come together. You simply have to see this film. Even my friends, who usually wouldn't even look at the poster for a subtitled film, enjoyed it. "},{"date":"10 November 2000","review":"  I saw this little gem of a film last year, forgot about it, then decided to buy it. On a second viewing I realized how much I missed the first time around. The scientific\/mythical\/mystical\/spiritual interpretations are left up to the individual, and I found myself leaning toward the mystical\/spiritual, especially when the film-within-a-film (Pandora's Box) entered the plot. While some might have felt this whole episode was irrelevant, to me it  was central in a kind of a skewed way that wasn't really developed. Anyone familiar with the myth of Pandora's Box  will recognize the significance of the rock in the box that causes lives to change in a dramatic, profound way. Izzy's state of consciousness during the film is simply a device -an interesting one- to tell a story.Seeing Dafoe and Keitel working together again (first time since Last Temptation of Christ?) was a delight. Both are capable of a tremendous range, but chose restraint in this film, and it worked. The interogation scenes in the warehouse were mesmerizing. I love this film! "},{"date":"11 November 2000","review":"  Most of the criticism I see for this film is from people looking for objectivity  where it doesn't belong.Do you find Plot Holes in dreams? A fine little gem.A Noirish love story with magical overtones that works on many levels.The reference to the classic silent film Pandora's Box with Louise Brooks is fascinating.One thing-On the DVD version there are several deleted scenes.One has Mira Sorvino as a prostitute in a shabby apartment with two male characters not in the final cut.Where would this have been intended? "},{"date":"12 November 2000","review":"  This is quite an odd film, but pleasant throughout due to the likeable actors and some laugh out loud moments.  There are musings throughout about dating and love, none of which really hit the mark.  The ending was somewhat unsatisfying, and loose ends weren't really tied up.  In addition, Bruce McCullough, from Kids in the Hall, who directed and wrote the film, somewhat underutilized himself in the movie.  He could have added some more hilarious moments for himself, but his Kids In the Hall partner Mark McKinney gets most of the laughs as a dog psychiatrist.  I appreciated that it seemed to be trying something new in the field of romantic comedy, and was less predictable than many similar films.  Overall, I did enjoy it and would say it is worth a rental, but I can't really justify giving it more than 6\/10. "},{"date":"13 November 2000","review":"  Scream 3 is apparently the final cut, the end of the marvellous Scream trilogy. Although it is not as accomplished as either of its predecessors, Scream 3 is still an adorable, memorable and entertaining addition to the series.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has literally disappeared off the face of the Earth - hiding from the world and the whole haunted, bloodstained legacy that is Woodsboro. But that's all about to change. A new slasher flick based on Sidney's horrific story is being shot in LA, called `Stab 3'. And one by one, the cast of `Stab 3'are taking their final curtain call. Someone is mimicking the horrific murders of the first two Scream films, only this time, even the leads are dying. So the real Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette), Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Sidney Prescott must step into the spotlight to flush the killer out. And that means going back to Woodsboro one last terrifying time.The cast all seem to enjoy themselves lots, the new additions are Patrick Dempsey who is convincingly hilarious, Scott Foley who is near-perfect, Jenny McCarthy who is funny and enjoyable, and newcomer Parker Posey is outstanding. Her performance is witty and watchable. But, it is still the oldies that bring the screen alive. Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette have a marvellous on-screen chemistry and their performances are excellent. But, it is Neve Campbell, once again; who ignites the screen the most. Her 3rd leading role as Sidney in the series is brilliant; her acting is absolute perfection, to say the least! Ehren Kruger, the writer has lots of comic talent. His script is clever and imaginative, and his flaws aren't noticeable.Scream 3 is a loveable instalment to the classic series; it is well worth a look for fans of the first two films.I rate Scream 3 8 out of 10. "},{"date":"14 November 2000","review":"  Years from now, people are going to think this movie was an allegory about the 2000 presidential election, because Tracy Flick and Paul Metzler seem like parodies of Al Gore and George Bush.

I keep thinking that they need to look for the Florida votes in the wastebasket.  "},{"date":"15 November 2000","review":"  Who wouldn't like this one?

No such thing in Dinosaur! It's a serious movie that is very sad and partially cruel a wonderful tale of courage and survival, told with respect for the audience, with unpresidented animations. The dionsaurs merge seemlessly into the real surroundings, and they move and look absolutely real. Finally, computer animations have reached the stage where it doesn't look animated anymore!I was also very touched by Aladar's attempts to save the old dinos, and although I'm a grown-up, I jumped in my seat when the carnotaurs emerged. There was violence in this film cruel battles between carnivores and herbivores. And surging through it all there is a feeling of sadness and loss, for a world that is about to fade away into the pages of history.Thus, it's not for the smallest children, but it's a great story that treats it's audience with respect and pays homage to that great lost Earth that was buried in the dust millions of years ago.9\/10 "},{"date":"19 November 2000","review":"  I could not stand to watch such talent wasted on the screen.  This was one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in a long time.  Hopkins and Gooding should have made it better but either they didn't care or they were hamstrung by some awful scriptwriting.  It was implausible, and the timing was *way* off (things couldn't possibly happen that fast).  I couldn't manage to finish it; good luck to you if you do.  I gave it 2 stars only because I thought Gooding deserved better.Leave it on the shelf at the video store. "},{"date":"20 November 2000","review":"  Pretty boring film that, like a pitcher wondering whether to throw to home or first on a suicide squeeze, suffers from a fatal case of indecisiveness. Is it a romance or a sports yarn? So it tries to do both, and fails. Too bad The Lou Gehrig Story was already done. Ostensibly about a pitcher trying to end his career with perfect game, it develops no excitement about this prospect up until the eighth inning. Before then, we get flashback after flashback, sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks, documenting what is, except for the celebrity of one of the participants, a pretty desultory romance.Kevin Costner is quietly effective, though perhaps too quiet to wake up viewers lulled by the drony dialogue. Kelly Preston has a big vein on her forehead, and not much notable screen presence besides that. Even John C. Reilly is forced to spout some howlers (We'll be awesome for you!) And Vin Scully! How did they make you utter a line like A Chapel pitches a gem in the Cathedral of Baseball? That wasn't thunder in the sky; it was the sound of Mel Allen groaning.

I simply cannot say enough good things about this movie. The animation is incredible, the story, while nothing too revolutionary, serves as a basis for a great message.The movie is filled with some great moments that are cute, while not cloying. The action, such as it is, is handled well and does not glorify violence.Perhaps most refreshing is the lack of wisecracking animal sidekicks and musical numbers that Disney has made so popular.If you're a parent, rent this one for your kids.

The film's opening shot sets the tone for the entire film; a beautiful girl lies between two handsome men, a look of pure bliss on her face, and sleepy satisfaction on theirs! Unusual for a mainstream American film, but this is NOT your usual 'Boy Meets Girl' movie!Young Veronica, portrayed by the astonishingly lovely Kathleen Robertson, comes to Hollywood to pursue an acting career; one evening, attending a crowded costume party with lesbian friend, Mike (British actress Kelly McDonald), she sees hunky drummer Zed (played with goofy charm by Matt Keeslar), and immediately is aroused, much to Mike's chagrin! As she is pulled away, she literally runs into handsome, sensitive writer Abel (the always watchable Johnathon Schaech) and sparks fly again, despite Mike's funny insults! After passing him her phone number, she retreats to the bathroom...and runs into Zed! Passions explode immediately, and a tryst begins that ends in her apartment, the next day...when Abel phones her!Veronica bemoans the fact that it's always 'feast or famine', but likes both guys too much to date either of them, exclusively! Of course the two suitors eventually meet, and Veronica is so sweet and desirable that she manages to convince both of them that a loving relationship between the three is not only possible, but desirable!This would be the 'end' of many films, but director Araki uses the threesome as the framework for an entire movie, covering a wide assortment of funny situations! As the 'glue' that holds this unusual relationship together, Robertson's portrayal of Veronica is a marvel, funny and sexy, yet vulnerable!Can this trio of young lovers survive, especially with a young, wealthy TV producer (Eric Mabius) waiting in the wings, to take Veronica away from all this?

"},{"date":"24 November 2000","review":"  Kevin Costner's streak of poor movies continues with this disappointing baseball film about a veteran pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and what could be his last game as a pro.  The Tigers are out of contention, the owner is going to sell the franchise, and Costner will likely be traded after the season.  Now they are in New York trying to beat the Yankees and Costner is trying to give one last glimpse of days past to himself and baseball fans.  He is pitching a perfect game and as he does so he thinks back to everything that has happened since he met the one true love of his life (Kelly Preston).  As the game progresses, more memories come to Costner and he realizes that as much as he loves baseball, he loves Preston even more.  For Love of the Game is a movie that wants to be good, but falls due to movie cliches.  Many times the flashbacks are more distracting than anything else.  Costner and Preston are the only two performers who really have substantial parts.  They both do pretty well, but the direction is never quite clear.  The screenplay was going for something like Field of Dreams, but ends up playing more like a sub-par baseball film from the 1940s or 1950s.  Overall a film that is only fair at best.  2.5 out of 5 stars. "},{"date":"25 November 2000","review":"  This movie is an original - a gem.  Fifteen minutes after it was over I began weeping - I was so touched.  It is never too late.  One can lead a rotten life,  but there is always hope - even in the strangest of times - to find love and to become a person worthy of being loved in return.  To provide more details would undermine the movie's original theme.  Indeed, the description on this web page is not at all what the film is really about. I don't know why the ratings aren't higher. Perhaps the movie is lost on impatient souls who need lots of action to keep their attention intact. "},{"date":"26 November 2000","review":"  On almost any day, I'll take youthful exuberance and experimentation over more polished, accomplished, safe work. This is just that. It is energetic, but not particularly accomplished. There is no point, but the conception deserves celebration. --Animation inserted in live action--Parallel universes--Split screens--Heavy zoom shots--Hypermedia projections of the futures of incidental characters--A few visual jokes (a cartoon croupier `spins' her at the beginning)--Black and white flashbacks--Switching between video and 35mm--Real time action for each thread--Supernatural screams--Techno pacingDoes this add up to a new genre? I'm skeptical, but IMDB voters put it in the top 75 films of all time!When this level of risk and energy is turned toward a deep subject, we'll have something important. Until then, this is interesting enough. "},{"date":"27 November 2000","review":"  You've Got Mail is a decent romantic comedy that's worth to watch a weekday night after a long day of work. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan come back on screen together after the succesful Sleepless in Seattle, but the feeling you get while watching the movie is of deja-vu. Same cliches, same plot line, same ending.  The plot is simple Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are huge rivals in business but they meet and fall in love over the internet, without knowing their names. This leads to a lot of pretty good scenes, but also pathetic ones, especially those in which they keep passing by each other or bumping into each other. The destiny wants them together.

The opening scenes instantly gave me a bad vibe about this film - o.k it is a low budget film but that doesn't  stop it from being good - but the ham acting and bad dialogue does.  This film also tries to win the audience with some badly thought out humour which wasn't close to being witty or sharp.  Allright I hear you say it's just a sci-fi movie but it could have been so much better - what seemed a good idea (spaceship crashing on an unknown planet with several survivors trying to re-launch before the planets 3 suns eclipse and unleash winged beasts who only come out in this period of darkness to kill and destroy etc ), this film tried to play with this idea and failed.  I felt cheated by seeing the trailer before-hand, which showed probably the best clip which lasted 30 seconds (honestly), and had to suffer the remaining 1hr 29 minutes and 30 seconds.  The characters I found laughable; the convict (wanted for murder - which by the way is glorified sadly throughout the movie) who is bad-guy turned good-guy , the English antique dealer ???? (thats what I thought!!), the totally unconvincing captain of the ship - I could go on but I'm not going to.  I honestly am a big sci-fi fan but I would class this as a straight to video release from the eighties ( YES that bad!!) and find the only thing  frightening about it is how this movie has become so successful. The special effects are rubbish and look like  rejects from the Starship Troopers studio and that along with a pathetic script ruins what seemed to be a pretty good idea. Nuff said 1\/10.

"},{"date":"1 December 2000","review":"  When I saw the trailers for this movie, I was mildly interested, but I was putting in 65+  hour weeks when it came out, so I missed it in the theatres. By the time I rented it, I had heard so much hype about the movie that I was really energized to see it.  The movie came as a massive disappointment.In retrospect, I've decided that it was an okay science fiction film. Absolutely off-the-shelf plot, largely wooden acting (with exceptions, of course), spruced up by a few nice and cutting-edge special effects. Eminently watchable, if one likes scifi and approaches it un-biased.Unfortunately, it is tough to approach the film unbiased because of the utterly insane amount of hype that followed its release.  One of the most annoying things I keep hearing about the film is how new and original it was.  I cannot adequately express my opinion of this nonsense without resorting to profanity, but I will try.As far back as DesCartes, the idea that we may be living a lie and that all we think we know is being put into her head put into our heads by an outside force.  Since that time, it has been in almost constant use by science fiction writers.  The Matrix plot is neither new, nor even a new interpretation of an old idea.  It is simply an old idea.The acting had its shining moments, but between the actors and the script, there was never really a shot at greatness.Cinematically, aside from a few very eye-catching shots, the movie descends into a series of largely boring and formulaic slow-motion shots.The effects?  Well, aside from the new (and, admittedly, spectacular freeze-panning effects), they were somewhere at or below the level of episodic television, especially those which occur in the nominal real world.Plot holes?  Enough of them, and big enough, to drive a fleet of Mac Trucks through.  Insanely huge example follows, but, be advised, it does contain big SPOILERS if you don't know the plot.  If you don't want the spoilers, skip to the next paragraph.  Okay, I warned you.  All the humans in the world are tied into this virtual reality to keep them passive while their body heat is used to power a giant evil computer.  Why humans? Why waste all that time creating the virtual reality, when they could just use a whole bunch of chained up squirels?  I'll tell you why because the creators had this great idea about people stuck in virtual reality, and couldn't come up with a good reason why, so they just slapped something together, that's why.Perhaps the worst thing about this movie, is that it has ruined a lot of scifi that has followed.  Anytime a fight scene features an attempt at actual martial arts choreography, or uses any slow motion in a fight scene, it is decried as a Matrix rip-off (often with the term blatant thrown in), as if Kung Fu and over-crank were invented for the Matrix.  Even worse is that the technological aspects that the Matrix borrows from scifi canon are now decribed as being Matrix rip-offs too.Anyway, here's the summation line this is a watchable, and often enough enjoyable movie, that suffers from being extremely over-valued. "},{"date":"2 December 2000","review":"  I think that this movie is Matthew Broderick's best film.  Reece Witherspoon was also excellent in it.It had a great storyline and the pace was excellent, it kept you hooked all the way through. "},{"date":"3 December 2000","review":"  Election is a very great comedy built on a poisoned and exceptional screenplay (by Payne and Jim Taylor, which was nominee at the Oscar). The story is told by the protagonists of this story which are four Jim McAllister, idealist and beloved teacher of the Carver High School. Tracy Flick, the favorite student to win the election of the President of the school students, perfect and ambitious. Paul Metzler, the ex quarterback of the school, a naive boy chosen by McAllister to contrast Tracy. Tammy Metzler, lesbian sister of Paul and third sudden candidate. That's because Paul has stolen her the girlfriend. McAllister hates Tracy for his perfection and ambition and wants to prevent the possibility of her victory. For that it will do everything. This is an exceptional comedy, which reflects in itself the atmosphere of war of thousand of other kinds of elections. If the part of the betrayal of Jim to his wife is the less interesting, the study of the war at school, supported by three young actors of sure talent Reese Witherspoon leaves the pure character of Annette (Cruel Intentions) for a cruel, ambitious, hateful girl with a smile which remembers the worst Doris Day. Chris Klein seems a young, (and stupid) Frank Capra character and he has the right look for it. Jessica Campbell is a revelation as the revengeful Tammy.  "},{"date":"4 December 2000","review":"  This movie touches on so many points. While horrifying, the suspence and tension is relieved much of the time by smart dialogue and some light humor that is well placed throughout the movie. There aren't any stupid awkward jokes. The plot is intriguing and unpredictable. The really weird soundtrack creates a fantastically sick sadistic feel to some of the sequences. The villain is particularly intriguing, clever and eerily easy to somewhat get into his mind. The hero, however unlikely, is funny in his 'cowardice' but we have MUCH sympathy for him.I must say that the gore is quite light for something about cannibalism. There are only only a couple of gushing bloody scences which I was able to stomach. HOWEVER if you don't like to think too much about the topic of cannibalism, I wouldn't recommend watching this because the thoughts lingering in your mind after watching this movie aren't pretty.I gave this movie a 10\/10 because the best word suited is it's ENTERTAINING. You should definitely not miss out on this suspense filled, plot twisting piece of art. I particularly liked the ending which gave the story a final, funny feeling of satisfaction. "},{"date":"5 December 2000","review":"  Although Mike Figgis is an excellent director,I believe this movie is his worst one. He has a quality in direction and the soundtracks of his movies are always brilliant. But I think that what he wanted to say with this movie is expressed with confusion and chaotic-flow pictures. This Adam\/Eve exploration and the battle between sexes becomes almost static and cold... Being experimental doesn´t necessarily means that you´ve made a masterpiece. Of all this weird mixture, the most interesting point comes out of the wonderful performance by Saffron Barrows.She is a really good actress and her beauty makes a total contradiction with the places this movie is filmed. I hope Mike Figgis is more lucky with his new one..  "},{"date":"6 December 2000","review":"    When conversations turn to the topic of consistently bad directors, B-movie hacks like Larry Buchanan or Al Adamson easily come to mind. However, I have found Joel Schumacher's work steadfastly mediocre. He made his feature directorial debut with The Incredible Shrinking Woman, an inane sham starring Lily Tomlin. A piece of junk called D.C. Cab followed. St. Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys, Flatliners, Falling Down, and A Time to Kill are inferior mainstream Hollywood fare. Hell, he wounded the Batman franchise. Therefore, my expectations were meager for 8MM, which looked like a rehash of Hardcore. So, I was surprised to encounter a modestly exciting story. Less an excursion into the world of pornography (or more exactly of bizarre fetish gratification), it is more of a noirish thriller. Cage's crisp, precise articulation recalls Bogart in The Big Sleep. Joaquin Phoenix is no Bacall, but delivers an adequately subdued performance as Cage's escort. A capricious, foretelling ending and a liberal anti-smoking message are a couple of faults I had with the picture. With the praise afforded Tigerland and my reaction to this film, perhaps Schumacher may start producing some challenging work. 2.5 out of 4 stars. "},{"date":"7 December 2000","review":"  I hadn't gotten around to seeing Magnolia when it was in the theatres, but I'd heard some good things about it. I was not prepared for the depth of vision and strength that the combination of the script, cinematography, music underscore, art direction and directing that vision film-maker Anderson has pulled together in this film. The DVD presentation is also a beaut! Two discs (one completely filled with background material) and a video transfer than simply shines! The performances by William H. Macy (and real-life spouse Felicity Huffman as a relatively minor character), the incredible Jason Robards, totally surprising Tom Cruise (an intensity he probably hasn't reached in years), the incredibly talented Julianne Moore. Add to these, terrific supporting performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Melinda Dillon, Philip Baker Hall and even Henry Gibson (remember him from Laugh In?) and you've got a rollicking romp of a film.Just when you think the ending is heading for some sort of wild conclusion, Anderson takes a wild left turn (don't give it away!) and the film leaves you slack-jawed. This is what film-making is all about! "},{"date":"8 December 2000","review":"  This movie is not liked by most people. Here's why It is uncomfortable for the people who watch it. It shows us how little we really have to say around this planet. And for most people, this is a vision which they don't like. After all, Jon Turteltaub did a wonderful job. The film is definitely not a movie that combines Gorillas in the mist with One flew over the cuckoo's nest, it is an introduction into a different way of thinking. The movie says Switch back one or two gears and take a look at the bigger  picture. Dr. Powell could also have been a completely different character, for example a woodcutter who is  suddenly troubled by his deed of cutting down whole  biotopes. Or a hunter. Or even a office clerk. The film is about breaking out of common understanding. Something  has to be given up for it, and in this case it's what we call civilization. What the movie wants to show is that our civilization is not a progress to, but a regress from what is good for us and our planet. We are less far civilized than the old civilizations. Writer Daniel Quinn doesn't say go live on a tree, he says think it over and make it better. And I think we still have lots of things to review and improve. Conclusion Watch this movie not as an ape-story, but as a guidance to a better thinking.

It's set out like a vampire movie, but it's a lot more original than your typical vampire movie. If you're a gorehound, or horror fan getting a bit tired of vampire movies, this cannibal movie will make a pleasant diversion.

I mean, I can expect this from Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland, but why Hopkins?  A comment on the IMDB described this film as an example of excellent writing, a great film... It seems almost impossible that I have seen the same film. Not once does the story ring true, the dialogue is silly at best(e.g. the Sigourney Weaver-one-liner, which is funny, but seems totally out of place)and, come on, how moralizing can one film be? All this is presented with a mushy Danny Elfman score and several useless subplots. The end shot is ridiculous, the romantic subplot is unbelievable, Donald Sutherland's character could have easily been left out and why not focus more on the relationship between the two doctors, instead of presenting a wide variety of Cuckoo's nest characters?I gave this film a 4, but God knows I've been very generous.

Though this has the potential to be overly violent (the only fault with BRAVEHEART), the director did not let the it slip below acceptable levels. Nominated for numerous Oscars, it deserved all of them (especially Best Actress, though I won't dwell on that) The story moves along at a pace which is neither too fast nor too slow, and the result is a well-acted, understandable yet subtle film about one of the most dramatic periods in world history. "},{"date":"14 December 2000","review":"  Oh my, what a piece of c***.  This movie feels like something a freshman in film school would do when he was trying to be artsy.  The Adam and Eve thing was so cliche.  I didn't learn anything from this film.  There were no new insights into life, or new ways of looking at things.  Through the most basic symbolism (that a college kid would be embarrassed to use) the director tries to say something about sex I guess.  The film was shot beautifully, but so what.  Britney Spears albums are recorded beautifully by talented producers but the music underneath still sucks, and that's what happened here.  Figgis would be a great cinematographer, that's about it. He really does do some inventive and passionate work visually, unfortunately, the rest of the movie is total garbage and you need MORE than just visuals to make a quality film.  His story ideas are hackneyed and cliche.He tries to tie together different times of a man's life, yet he uses a blond haired, big-headed kid as a young child; a fat brown haired kid as a pre-teen; and then a blond stick-thin man as an adult.  If you are going to show different stages of someone's life, especially not in sequence, you should at least have the actors bear some minimal resemblance to each other. Don't tell me this movie is sooo abstract that you can have totally physically differing looking actors playing the same person.  I can't fathom how or why they would do this.  Totally ridiculous casting.By the way, Why is Eve a thin white woman and Adam a strapping black man (who looks like there must have been a solo-flex in Eden)?  There was absolutely no point in those scenes.  Oooh, I get it, a snake.  At one point I thought the whole movie was just one long Diesel Jeans commercial--all pretension with no substance.  I have no problem with non-linear film, in fact I have loved some and gotten a lot out of them, but this movie manages to at once be incredibly obvious and predictable and at the same time totally incongruent and non-sensual.

The freedom to be yourself, to be unselfconscious, to let your mind roam and behave any way you want.  I feel jealous at how passionate and free Max (the lead) is.    Anderson's films celebrate the unusual among us, and not in that lame Hollywood way with drivel like Forest Gump.  The lead in the movie is a bizarre character and he is fascinating and endearing for it.  The thing I love best about Max is that he is so full of life and passion.Anderson is also a fantastic director.  The movie was shot beautifully (reminiscent of the style of The Graduate) and there was (as with Bottle Rocket) a quirky yet powerfully emotional soundtrack.  Nothing about Rushmore is conventional yet--and this is important--it never tries to shock you in a cheap Hollywood way with violence, sex, or some special effects crap.  This to me is the ultimate in film making (and any art for that matter)--it is at once entertaining, intelligent, unique, emotional, and thought provoking.  Rushmore is so rich with so many things and is well balanced between all of them.  A TEN.

If only they had all had the wrong idea.There have been quite a few good teen flicks in the past few years, but Can't Hardly Wait isn't one of them. Admittedly it did get better in the second half once the messy first bit was over, but apart from Jennifer Love Hewitt (the only reason, to be honest, that I checked it out on Sky Moviemax - in addition to bombing in America, it never got a British theatrical release), the only other performer to make it through intact was Seth Green. But then he always delivers the goods. Grating humour and a soundtrack that, unlike She's All That, is not something I can imagine teenagers today checking out, does not a good movie make. Skip it unless you're a major JLH fan or want to see how many cast members from other teen flicks or TV shows you can spot (and there are quite a few). "},{"date":"18 December 2000","review":"  Rushmore is undeniably one of the paramount achievements in modern film. It takes a somewhat trite  `coming of age' story to the next level by incorporating a dry and darkly comic edge, exposing the melancholy behind youthful innocence and hopeless romanticism. This is accomplished primarily through the surreal maturity found in its young characters, but also with the tenderly problematic older ones. Overall, Rushmore dispenses a gloomy charm, as the events of the film constantly teeter over failure, yet remain focused on fanciful dreams of success. The result is the ability of the audience to overlook disappointment and cherish the love of creation to love the actual process of achievement, no matter how impossible or unattainable the ends may seem. In essence, Rushmore illustrates a new love for life, questioning whether one can ignore consequences in spite of the trivial pursuit of fun and invention. 10\/10 "},{"date":"19 December 2000","review":"  I am not the biggest fan of action movies, but there have been many that I enjoyed.  The Matrix wasn't one of them.  It is pretty hard to make a boring action movie, but the Matrix was successful.  The only reason I go to action movies is to see someone bust some heads, and watching the same three bad guys that look exactly the same get beat up over and over got really old after the second time.  All that computer stuff looked really neat on the trailers but I felt let down when I saw the movie because I had seen all the cool parts already.

For the action, blow-em up smash-em up lovers, it has everything you ever want. However, what makes this movie exceptional is the actual answer to the question, what is the Matrix? The Matrix is conceptually, one of the smartest ideas in Sci-Fi in years. Keaneu Reeves has often been accused of being one dimensional. Well, if that is true, this is the dimension that all of the critics speak of. He's perfect for this movie, as are the rest of the cast.  Fishbourne is brilliant and Carrie-Ann Moss very sexy. However, the most effective actor in this movie is Australian, Hugo Weaving. Weaving plays the villain , with a great blend of intelligence and indestructibility that makes you wonder how or even if he can be defeated.This is one of those Sci-Fi action movies that gets better the next time you see it.

That said, this particular version of the idea, chronicling the romance between a jazz musician played by Harvey Keitel and a struggling actress played by Mira Sorvino, is murkier than it needs to be. Their scenes together are very convincing but once the film has played out, what has gone before doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

"},{"date":"26 December 2000","review":"  I mistakenly rated this movie 7 instead of 6.As an aspiring professional poker player (legitimate; in casinos), I found this movie to be very ENTERTAINING.  I capitalize ENTERTAINING because that does not comment on its artistic integrity.The following notes describe what is right with the movieJohn Malkovich, Edward Norton, John Turturro and Martin Landau, need I say more?  Landau, Turturro and Malkovich perform on par, which is about three levels up from on par for many other actors.  Norton creates a character that is lovable and familiar.  Though perhaps many people who see the movie won't have a best friend who screws up quite as much as Worm (Norton), no one has a perfect best friend.  His humanity shows through in every move he makes.The visual aspects of this movie attributed to lighting and production design are phenomenal.  There is a scene early in the movie in which Mike (Matt Damon) and Joey (John Turturro) are standing on the sidewalk that takes my breath away every time I see it despite having watched the movie twenty or more times.The plot is excellent, providing the audience with a sense of tension despite the movie's Hollywood production.  Hollywood production leads the audience to the knowledge that everything will be ok and the status quo will be maintained by the end of the movie, as far as I'm concerned.Rounders is accessible enough that upon watching it, the audience is playing all the hands that Mike (Matt Damon) is playing and winning and losing with him.The things that are wrong with the movie are as followsGretchen Mol.  She couldn't act her way out of a cardboard box.There is one specific time (if you're not a serious poker player, you won't understand anyway) when Damon seems to misunderstand, or perhaps not understand at all what he is saying in terms of poker parlance.  This event falls in a voiceover at a major turning point in the movie, thereby cheapening the voiceover's effect if you do understand what he means.The end is predictable.  I won't say any more than that in the interest of not giving away the story to anyone who has not seen it.At the beginning of the movie, there is a piece of writing and\/or direction that is bothersome Teddy KGB (Malkovich) walks away from the poker table having just turned over a hand as if it couldn't have been beaten.  The fact is that he holds the second best hand possible and that Mike (Matt Damon) holds the third best possible hand.  Again, to the layman, this fact is likely not a problem, but to me, the scene was clearly artificial in that Malkovich's character walks away from the table as if he couldn't have been beaten when in fact, he could have been.  A minor inconsistency, but a problem to the aficionado.Overall recommendationsIf you're a poker player who has read more than a few books on the subject, see the movie, but don't expect it to dazzle you in terms of its poker savvy.  If you've never played poker, watch it and enjoy it despite the whole Hollywood thing.  If you play poker at home with your friends recreationally, watch the movie, it may teach you something about how to play the game.  If you don't like poker or are a gambling addict, don't watch the movie; it makes you want to play poker.  If you like independent films and play poker less than once a year, don't watch this movie; you'll think its trash. "},{"date":"27 December 2000","review":"  Remarkable.

Probably one of the more faithful adaptations I've seen of any cartoon in recent years.  For those who are initiated, the movie may seem esoteric and even pointless.  "},{"date":"29 December 2000","review":"  I watched this because it billed Julian Sands. I think he's about as talented as they come.I liked the film, though I can see why some - ok - a good number of viewers - wouldn't. It's slow, it has no blatently obvious plot, they characters are vague, and the imagery is cliche.If you want to see a block busting adventure - this ain't it.But - If you want to see a film which is an excellent piece of art, with wonderful acting characters that are deceptivly strong and a fascinating view on how society as a whole overacts to casual sexual encounters - then watch it. Watch it 3-4 times (it helps)If you're thinking of making a film watch it - it's full of clever tricks and wonderful camera work. "},{"date":"30 December 2000","review":"  It wants to be a 'Cincinatti Kid' crossed with 'The Hustler' and 'Mean Streets', but it doesn't come within half a dozen downtown blocks of these greats. One problem is the density of the technical info thrown at you - straights, flushes and low-hi 30-40s (or something) go in one ear and out the other, which would be OK if it didn't matter to the build-up of tension - but it does! The final game is a damp squib because we really don't have a clue what's going on. Another problem is some of the performances. John Malkovich has a truly preposterous (Russian!?) accent and wouldn't frighten a kitten, but he's supposed to be The Man who's supposed to put the fear of God into Matt Damon, who in turn just can't carry such an intense role, I'm afraid. A film that wants to be cool but that comes out cluttered and awkward. A major disappointment. "},{"date":"31 December 2000","review":"   EdTv is about as arcane as you can get. I'm not going to compare and contrast from the Truman Show because they are two different films. Matthew McConehey (however you spell it) is Ed, a video store clerk who's life is broadcasted for the viewing pleasure of America. There were a few funny scenes and it was decent enough to finish. the cast is completely wasted. Ron Howard tried to make a good movie and came out with celluloid garbage.  Bottom line is that it's watchable but not a very good movie.** out of **** "}]
