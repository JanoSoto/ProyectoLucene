[{"date":"18 March 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Put basically, this is by no stretch to be interpreted as a biography of Elizabeth Tudor. This film in not a faithful portrayal of the characters or historical events.The irony is that Elizabeth's character and life are far more compelling and film-worthy than this movie.It is a good film as a piece of fiction, but remember that is imposes 21st century ideologies and mores to create a story far removed from historical reality.The costuming and set design are stellar, and fine performances are acted from the leading cast. The ambiance of the time, where intrigue and danger are integral to court culture, is well represented.I recommend that those actually interested in Elizabeth I either watch the BBC's Elizabeth R or read popular, reputable historians Starkey, Weir, or Fraser, and perhaps watch this film for fun.
