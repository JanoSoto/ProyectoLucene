I disagree, but pieces of its plot structure were obviously borrowed ... from The Godfather -- another perfect film. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. (I hope that doesn't spoil it for anyone.)

To me, every film is a good film. They just have to be seen in different respects. I mean, in many ways, to me, seeing an old Roger Corman flick like THE UNDEAD in a drive-in atmosphere, on a summer's night,or in a local art cinema,popcorn and coke scents in the air, is more fun than any thing else. But seen on video or home entertainment, the film seems pointless and weak. Environment is about 50% of the show. However, there are some films that exist purely as themselves. THE GRADUATE is one of these. Whether at a drive-in,art cinema, movie house, or in your home, THE GRADUATE has the same effect. Mike Nichols-my nomination for best director of the last half of this century-does a fine job in telling the story of Benjamin Braddock, a college graduate unsure about his future. Of course, everyone is great in the cast whether it be Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson, Katherine Ross as Elaine, Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson, William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson as Ben's parents, or great character actors like Norman Fell or Marion Lorne, this entire cast deserves serious praise.Of all the new films I have discovered on television(and the only reason I watch television is to be introduced to films like these thanks to stations that run films), this is probably the best. Great score by Simon and Garfunkel. Here's to You, Mrs. Robinson!
