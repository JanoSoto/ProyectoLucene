Luckily, we caught it at the very beginning, and the opening credits barely got started, so we got to see it in its entirety.  Also, luckily for me, I knew almost nothing about the film storywise, and what I thought I knew about the film, I would later find out, was erroneous.  It didn't matter, that didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film... or non-enjoyment, as the case may have been.Here's the usual SPOILER WARNING, which I think is important to give in a film like this, whose impact relies heavily on certain unexpected plot-points.  Read no further if you haven't seen it a couple loses their two children in a car crash, and barely has the time to deal with the loss when the husband is killed as well, shortly afterward.  We follow the husband into the afterlife, where he is presented with what is essentially a paradise, and is re-united with his son and daughter.  However, he soon finds out that his wife on earth has committed suicide in grief, and for that she has been sentenced to an eternity in hell.  He quickly journeys to the underworld, accompanied by a guide and his son, to see his wife and, perhaps, save her.It's an intriguing plot indeed, but I had two major problems with it.First of all, we have to accept as fact the film's depiction of the afterlife.  This would normally have been no problem to me if it weren't for the fact that the presentation given is terribly corny and heavily Western-religious influenced.  I would expect a grandiose task of presenting a version of the afterlife to be handled with some originality at least, or perhaps something would be there that would seem new, exciting or surprising!  But, no, we get the standard heaven-and-hell structure, with heaven depicted as a world as perfect as you can imagine it, and hell populated by tormented souls who wallow in the mud like something stolen out of classic literature.  It's been done, and it certainly wasn't interesting.But that was a minor quibble compared to the main point of the plot itself that we are watching a man whose love is so strong that he can do the impossible raise his wife from the depths of hell.  OK.  I see that the movie is about this all-powerful, moving, conquering aspect of love.  However, I am not convinced that I should just be happening to watch the one couple in the history of the universe who has succeeded in beating the afterlife system.  The son makes two things very clear to the father that suicide condemns one to hell forever, and that no one has ever come up to paradise from hell.  Now, I assume that both heaven and hell here are populated by the souls of the history of the universe; that's a long time and a lot of people.  And this couple... this one here, in the movie, these two who are really no more special than neither you nor me... happens to be the ones who beat hell?  The husband makes the sacrifice of pure love, and that alone was good enough to take his wife away from eternal damnation.  I suppose those eternal rules aren't that strict.  By the time the ending arrived, the whole thing seemed terribly contrived, and left a bad taste in my mouth.  It's like someone tacked the big Hollywood sign, in big lights, on to the ending.In my opinion, the movie turned to be narrow-minded.  Not only did it present a hackneyed version of life-after-death, it tried to make us believe that the couple we were watching was the only exceptional couple in the known universe worth preserving eternal happiness for, nevermind the sufferings and love of others.  The only saving graces of the movie were the very impressive special effects, and, perhaps, its rather humble goal of simply being a strong love story.

Reason two The movie mixes social satire with comedy with drama with sentimentality, and that's too many spices in the soup.Reason three plot holes or disappointments. There's a murder in a 7-11 kind of store. The only reason I know that isn't from the film. Guns are fired, we never see anybody hit, and the next scene is miles away in a hotel.

It's implied that the police action during the championship halted it, but there's not even somebody getting up to make an announcement. Somebody dies in the movie, but we never see it. Somebody wins the karaoke tournament (or doesn't) but we don't know. Duh.Reason four We're stuck in the same karaoke bar, no matter what city or what bar we're in. There are several good karaoke numbers by the characters. I give them points for doing them well and using them to support the character development, and even the plot. BUT they all seem like the same bar. The eyes want a little variety, and I felt mine were getting tired from straining to see in the darkness of the bars. Reason five The action leads to Omaha, and I did not see a single indication the characters had arrived. This has to be a major rules violation of directing. It's a small point, but indicative of the sloppiness of the movie. It's like doing a movie about San Francisco, and leaving out everything unique about SF. They could have sent a second or third unit there to at least get some establishing shots, but they were up in Vancouver, instead. They should have said the Karaoke championship was in Vancouver. This isn't a bad film. You see how much they cared about the work they were doing on the set. It's just a disappointing one.  Oh, Gwyneth Paltrow can sing, and she plays a dimwit with a heart of gold very well.

I had never seen it from start to finish, and having seen most of Hitchcock's other films, I was curious as to how it would stand up. I expected not to like it, but I wound up giving it a 7 in the voting booth.I have to echo that the special effects were innovative for the time period. They weren't nearly as cheesy as I expected. The thing that annoys me about later Hitchcock films is his incessant use of backdrops. Hitch hated shooting on location, but after the 1950s the backdrop technique was badly outdated. He should have made the effort to do more location shooting. For example, in the scene in which Tippi Hedron is in the motorboat, we see a real live shot of her bringing it into shore and getting out of it. Why then, if she was actually there in the bay for that scene, did Hitch have to shoot the rest of the boat scene against a backdrop? Oh well.I can't for the life of me see Hitch's attraction to Tippi Hedron. She's a mediocre actress at best, and I find her voice to be nasally and grating. I would have loved to see Ingrid Bergman in this role. Perhaps if she had been cast the writers would have re-written the story and actually made it interesting.The second half of The Birds makes up for the boring, slow paced first half. I never thought of Psycho as a horror film- I saw it as more of a documentary, a psychological thriller. But The Birds was truly terrifying. As has been said before, the reasons for this are the lack of soundtrack, the use of ordinary creatures like birds as monsters, and the tension leading up to climactic moments. Nothing like The Birds had been done up to that time, and nothing has been done like it since. People were afraid of Martians before they saw War of the Worlds, and they were afraid of sharks before they saw Jaws. Not many people were afraid of seagulls before seeing The Birds.I thought the scene inside the cafe was hilarious. The doomsayer, the angry fisherman, and the elderly ornithologist had me cackling. I don't even know if this scene was meant to be funny, and not a single reviewer other than myself has mentioned it as being humorous. By contrast, I didn't laugh once when I saw The Trouble With Harry, which was supposed to be a dark comedy. I think that what Hitch tried to do there, he got right here.I loved the ending to The Birds. I think its strength lies in its ambiguity. After such a surrealistic story, it was the only ending that was appropriate. The Birds is truly a unique film, both among Hitchcock's own body of work and cinema in general.

When the dying man confessed his life to his nurse i almost had to turn it off and pull myself back together.  It wasnt that long ago i lost my mother to cancer and the reality of this man lying is his death bed was so powerful, so brilliantly horrific, i was in tears.  The story of his, at first money hungry, druged up, guilt ridden, wife was painfully beautiful.  When she goes to get some prescripitions only to have the clerks stare and probe into as why someone would need such things evoked a sence of privacy being violated for someone who deserves no sympathy yet screams at you for help. Tom Cruise's character as the idealistic ID of a man's personality to the infinite power was brave and unabashed.  Him lying by his fathers side, a man who deserted him and his dying mother, a man who he had not seen in years, a man who's dying wish was to see his son, was played with such raw emotion its a wonder why these two people were not givin some kind of reward for there acting.  We get the story of a whiz kid quiz show star and a story of a former whiz kid quiz show star where the former is so fed up with having to do everything and being the smart one and dealing with his overcrazed father while the latter cant shake the shadows of his former fame and just cant do anything with his life.  This man was disturbing, all he wanted to do was love.  He just wanted to love someone, anyone, anything, because he didnt love himself enough to move on from his past.....ahhh the past...a subject so defined in this film.  Some poeple are able to move through life and things either fall into place all nice and cozy or there little speed bumps dont affect them.  Yet there are many out there who cant get through the past.  cant understand why they may have done certain things and are left with the guilt of there sins and it runs them into the ground day after day after day.  No one said life was easy and certainly there is no handbook.  we all should know right and wrong but once you cross that line is there anyway to come back?  that is what this movie is asking.  and like life there is no answer.  we just dont know.Now the sing a long that has got everyone's attention was perfect in my eyes.  at the time of the story to see something you really never seen before with so much meaning was amazing.

It wasnt that long ago i lost my mother to cancer and the reality of this man lying is his death bed was so powerful, so brilliantly horrific, i was in tears.  The story of his, at first money hungry, druged up, guilt ridden, wife was painfully beautiful.  When she goes to get some prescripitions only to have the clerks stare and probe into as why someone would need such things evoked a sence of privacy being violated for someone who deserves no sympathy yet screams at you for help. Tom Cruise's character as the idealistic ID of a man's personality to the infinite power was brave and unabashed.  Him lying by his fathers side, a man who deserted him and his dying mother, a man who he had not seen in years, a man who's dying wish was to see his son, was played with such raw emotion its a wonder why these two people were not givin some kind of reward for there acting.  We get the story of a whiz kid quiz show star and a story of a former whiz kid quiz show star where the former is so fed up with having to do everything and being the smart one and dealing with his overcrazed father while the latter cant shake the shadows of his former fame and just cant do anything with his life.  This man was disturbing, all he wanted to do was love.  He just wanted to love someone, anyone, anything, because he didnt love himself enough to move on from his past.....ahhh the past...a subject so defined in this film.  Some poeple are able to move through life and things either fall into place all nice and cozy or there little speed bumps dont affect them.  Yet there are many out there who cant get through the past.  cant understand why they may have done certain things and are left with the guilt of there sins and it runs them into the ground day after day after day.  No one said life was easy and certainly there is no handbook.  we all should know right and wrong but once you cross that line is there anyway to come back?  that is what this movie is asking.  and like life there is no answer.  we just dont know.Now the sing a long that has got everyone's attention was perfect in my eyes.  at the time of the story to see something you really never seen before with so much meaning was amazing.  Mann's song rang through my ears like few others have before.  And the frogs...well...im not a religous person...i understand this came from the bible...its exact meaning i do not know.  but as the movie tells you all along regret is blatantly hard.i give this movie, film, story, personal page out of life, what ever you want to call it, a 10.

I don't mean to ignore the great story and the on-screen performances here. Browse the other user comments for those raves. I want to zero in on the quality musical score. It really drove home the emotional impact. Bernstein captured the curiosity and fear the kids had for Boo Radley, that later became understanding and appreciation.
