[{"date":"6 December 2002","score":"","review":"  Ravenous is a film that was largely ignored by both the critics and the general movie going audience. This is a real shame, if not a tragedy, because Ravenous is one of the best movies of the last decade. For fans of quirky dark comedies such as Sleepy Hollow, Ravenous is a real treat. The darkly interesting 'camp fire' story line is accompanied by super performances by stars both big and small. Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle play their lead characters very well whilst the supporting cast of Jeffrey Jones, David Arquette, Neil McDonaugh, Jeremy Davis and John Spencer play all thier quirky-sterio-character roles with such energy and perfection that they would seem believable. All of this is topped off with a brilliant quirky (theres that word again) atmosphare setting soundtrack by Blur's Damon Albarn and stunning landscape locations (which is Slovakia passed off as the Sierra Nevadas).If you havent seen it, and love interesting, quirky, plot twist laden, character driven, violent, gory, supernatural, historical setting based, very black comedy, adventure thriller movies, then I would recommend seeing this one.9.5 out of 10.
