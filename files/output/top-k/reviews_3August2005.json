All dinosaur was good looking and most of all the Tyannosaurus Rex. Tyrannosaurus Rex eat the lawyer who job is to do about this park, it all started, when John Hamond creating dinosaur, I never read the book, it goes the same way. Dennis Nerdy set the dinosaur free, one part I like is when the Tyrannosaurus Rex give chase to Ian Malcom, Elite Slater and that one guy, who is doing the driving, it shows the Tyrannosaurus Rex's speed, one thing for sure, the Tyrannosaurus Rex could catch up and eat the one closed to him. There is a mistake in this screen, if the Tyrannosaurus Rex has catch-up to the Jeep, instead of roaring to the mirror, it should snatch Iam Malcom off the Jeep, but at the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex stop, I think the Tyrannosaurus Rex never gives up, unless he was very tired of chasing them. The end part of the movie, I like it too, the Tyrannosaurus Rex stop the Raptor, but this is the mistake, instead of smell or smoothing or trying to strip some flesh of the Raptor would it just chew a little while swallowing the whole body. Anyway this movie is fun and educational, but mostly educational.

Burton has no concept of plot or acting, his style is entirely visual, and he is dishonest as all get out when he wants to make a point. I'm sorry that Tim had problems with his parents, especially his father, but that does not justify his screwing with classic stories so that he can whine once again about how parents just don't understand you and might even abandon you.Having got that off my chest, I would like to summarize POTA as follows. The movie makes no sense and the reason it makes no sense is that the director has no vision, no sense of a story that he wants to tell. Even the highly touted ape makeup is a mistake, because the director has no idea whether the apes are supposed to be subhuman or better than human. As a consequence they behave in a manner that simply leaves the viewer confused.I am a biologist who has studied behavior in apes, so I might be more picky than most, but I defy any viewer to answer the following question. Why are all the female apes chimpanzees? I have watched the ape village scenes several times and to my view there is not a single female gorilla or orang utan in the entire place. Also these female chimps don't look like chimps, but like some sort of odd chimp\/human hybrid, which might explain the attraction between Marky Mark and Helena BC, but otherwise feels just thrown in (This is what I mean by Burton throwing logic out the window to make his themes fit his preconceptions). For example why does the female chimp (Carter) have eyebrows, a trait missing from every primate but humans? Also why do chimps, which seem to make up the vast majority of the apes, walk upright except when they charge? This makes them very ineffective as warriors. They can't hold weapons, so why do they wear armor? The acting in this film is confusing and few characters seem realized, and once again I think Burton is to blame. In Burton films the only actors who are memorable are those willing to create their own characters and overact shamelessly, e.g. Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice, Nicholson's Joker, DeVito's Penguin, Walken's headless horseman. In this film this tradition is carried on by Tim Roth's Thade, a character so psychotic it seems amazing that anyone takes him seriously. The cast includes some good actors, but all are handicapped by bad direction. For example, Paul Giamatti an excellent character actor, tries hard to create a believable character in his whining sycophantic slave trading orang utan, but he is made up as a female rather than a male orang utan, which collapses the character completely.Other actors fare no better. Wahlberg, at best a charming male ingénue, cannot act like a leader, so I was startled by the idea that all the humans would follow his lead when he seems to have no idea as to what he's doing throughout the entire film. The other humans seem to be merely tagging along looking confused. Michael Clarke Duncan, subtle and wonderful in the Green Mile, here plays sort of a King Kong who can talk. As a subtext, why are the Gorillas played by Afrcian American actors, and the chimps by white actors? This leads me to what I think is Burton's greatest weakness, his ability to direct actresses. The only actress who has ever turned in a memorable performance in a Burton film is Michelle Pfeiffer's sly, slinky Catwoman in Batman II. Otherwise excellent actresses have been left to flounder by Burton, e.g. Christina Ricci is Sleepy Hollow, Kim Basinger in Batman. Given this history, I find confusing all of the hostility and crass comments about Estella Warren's performance as Daena, the only human in the film with any personality. Estella Warren is a powerful presence, who in every film in which she appears works from the premise that she is, at the least, the equal of all the male characters and that she is smarter even than most of those. She tries to pull that off in POTA, but she is left to flounder, trying to work off the giant vacuum emitted by Marky Mark. Warren acts using her face to communicate subtle emotions and changes of mood, but that tactic backfires in this film, where subtlety is lost. She gets no perceivable reactions from Wahlberg, who seems lost in his own world, and she has almost no scenes with anyone else. As a result Warren has little to do but look distressed and confused. I think most of the negative comments directed at Warren's acting come from silly insecure young men who feel that a pretty woman should not also be strong and competent, and simply want to ogle her.To summarize, this film is probably the worst big budget film ever made, but don't blame the actors. As they say in Russia, fish begin to stink from the head. In this case the head is the director.

The idea that a shark could develop a grudge against a family is so funny that when trying to explain this concept to my friends i found myself and them in absolute hysterics. To top it all off the Shark also it would appear has developed some kind of satellite navigation which allowed him to track the entire Brody clan as they move some 2000 miles away or whatever. Thats right the Shark is able to track down the family. Whats even more funny is that rather than setting up a nice home in the country or buying an apartment in the city, Brody's wench of wife despite her belief that the Shark is following sets up home about 1 minute away from the coastline. Maybe its just me but if a white shark was stalking my family i'd set up home as far away from the coastline as possible. But despite their predicament the Brody family really do seem to have a death wish. Firstly the younger son decides to become a coast policemen and is deservedly chomped up by our vengeful shark. His older brother despite his families history and calls from his mum still decides to continue his work as a marine biologist. Call me unsympathetic but these people deserved to die.

The movie starts with a chilling score that cooperates to build tension in the forthcoming scene and since then, your attention centers at 100% in the movie.Unfortunately, as everyone also knows (or heard) the movies' next half an hour is as boring as you can get, filled with non sense scenes, dramatic situations that do not add anything to the movie, and pointless dialogues. And as everyone else has mentioned, the movie's last 20 minutes are very good and compensate half the damage that the movie's 2nd. part did. *SPOILERS* I think this is everything you need to know about When A Stranger Calls -The snob Mandrakis marriage go out for dinner and leave in charge of their children and home young baby sitter Jill Johnson (palyed by Caro Kane). After they leave she starts getting phone calls from a deranged man who keeps repeating HAVE you checked the children?!, and why haven't you checked the children?!. To deal with the situation Jill calls Mr. Mandrakis in the restaurant but she is told that they left about 40 minutes ago. Meanwhile she turns off the house lights, checks some places in the house, and even has a drink. The calls continue and after Jill gets really freaked and scared, she calls the emergency line that subsequently connects her to the police men that are rounding the area. The goofy Sgt. in charge gives her a stupid advice in order to get rid off the phone calls but Jill breaks on tears and tells him to do something for her because she's really scared. The Sgt. tells her that in order for them to trace the call she needs to talk with the man for about 1 minute. The looney calls again and this time he tells Jill that he wants her blood all over him and that he can actually see her. The phone rings for the last time but it's the Sgt. that tells Jillthat the calls are coming from inside the house!(THX sound) And in one of the most tense, nerving, and scary scenes in Horror movie history, Jill tries to escape from the house... ...you know the rest. Sadly enough, the movie falls terribly into half an hour of boredom, pointless scenes, and some unfortunate dialogues. What a way to kill a Horror fan's expectations. We learn that when Curtis (the maniac) is caught by the police, he had the Mandrakis children's blood all over him. He is sent to a mental hospital but escapes 7 years later. Mr. Mandrakis knows about his escape and hires P.I. John Clifford (the same man that locked him down the first time) to once again lock him up. Whatever. The ending pays off the torturing half an hour and has the Mandrakis children killer chasing again Jill after 7 years of the events. He traces her down and sets in her home at night in a chilling and tense ending that obviously ripped off Halloween (the mere ending).*HIGHLIGHTS* -The beginning of the movie is the best thing , that's for sure. It's an important and influential scene in Horror cinema. Excellent scene. -What the hell is about with the chasing scene?! I couldn't believe that the same wacko that made the chilling calls run like a girl! Please, Detective John Clifford was about to have a heart attack after running 1 minute after him. -The scene where Jill and her husband are having dinner and suddenly she takes a call from guess who?. Curtis! and he tells have you checked the children?!. -The ending has a really creepy scene. I have to comment about it. Curtis hides under Carol's blankets taking the place of her husband and later shows up... the scene is really creepy and well done until John Clifford plays Dr. Sam Loomis. Overall, When A Stranger Calls is a decent mystery movie. It doesn't have blood (well only in flashbacks) or death scenes (well not until the ending) but manages to create an eerie atmosphere in the important scenes. We never get to know Curtis' intentions for chasing Jill or what was his mental problem or whatever situation that leads his weirdness. That's a minus in my opinion. The soundtrack is excellent in my opinion. Yes, even with the THX sound. The direction is very classy, intelligent, and sets a perfect feeling of claustrophobia and fear. My recognition for Fred Walton, he created a truly scary movie with his direction and that's a merit.Even though the movie contributed with scenes and ideas to the genre, I must say with sadness that it's very overrated. If you haven't watched it, there's no urge to rent or buy it. It's not even recommended for die hard fans of the genre because it doesn't offers the basic existence elements that the genre sets. In my opinion, this movie has to be watched only to witness the chilling opening scene which is the movie's main contribution to the genre. Give it a try if it's on your hands but I'd say that it's not necessary for fans of the genre to watch it.

The movie starts with a chilling score that cooperates to build tension in the forthcoming scene and since then, your attention centers at 100% in the movie.Unfortunately, as everyone also knows (or heard) the movies' next half an hour is as boring as you can get, filled with non sense scenes, dramatic situations that do not add anything to the movie, and pointless dialogues. And as everyone else has mentioned, the movie's last 20 minutes are very good and compensate half the damage that the movie's 2nd. part did. *SPOILERS* I think this is everything you need to know about When A Stranger Calls -The snob Mandrakis marriage go out for dinner and leave in charge of their children and home young baby sitter Jill Johnson (palyed by Caro Kane). After they leave she starts getting phone calls from a deranged man who keeps repeating HAVE you checked the children?!, and why haven't you checked the children?!. To deal with the situation Jill calls Mr. Mandrakis in the restaurant but she is told that they left about 40 minutes ago. Meanwhile she turns off the house lights, checks some places in the house, and even has a drink. The calls continue and after Jill gets really freaked and scared, she calls the emergency line that subsequently connects her to the police men that are rounding the area. The goofy Sgt. in charge gives her a stupid advice in order to get rid off the phone calls but Jill breaks on tears and tells him to do something for her because she's really scared. The Sgt. tells her that in order for them to trace the call she needs to talk with the man for about 1 minute. The looney calls again and this time he tells Jill that he wants her blood all over him and that he can actually see her. The phone rings for the last time but it's the Sgt. that tells Jillthat the calls are coming from inside the house!(THX sound) And in one of the most tense, nerving, and scary scenes in Horror movie history, Jill tries to escape from the house... ...you know the rest. Sadly enough, the movie falls terribly into half an hour of boredom, pointless scenes, and some unfortunate dialogues. What a way to kill a Horror fan's expectations.

A more accurate thing to say would be that this movie is about a young man (Renton) outgrowing his home and his friends, leaving them behind to pursue a better life.The movie got noticed in large part because there were those that said it glamorized drug use. Well, yes, drug use IS glamorous and fun, sometimes. If it wasn't people wouldn't use them, but lots of people do. Of course, with that lifestyle comes risk that can result in tragedy(Tommy), or difficult withdrawal (Renton). For many though, using drugs is just something you do as a young person, a product of having too much idle time, and no responsibilities and\/or prospects, and doesn't really come with any dramatic result or end to it (as is the case with Sick Boy and Spud).Ultimately though, this story is not about drugs. The main plot point of the movie is Mark Renton slowly realizing that his association with and loyalty to his loser friends is dragging him down, and that in order to cast off the limits his dead-end life in Scotland has set on him, he needs to get off drugs, move to London, and make a new life.When his friends follow him there, he is faced with a choice of slipping back into mediocrity with them, or screwing them over and in the process cutting ties with them forever. He concludes he is better off without them, which he is, and steals their money, realizing full well and probably happy that it means he will never see them again if he has anything to say about it.Like another movie made shortly after, Good Will Hunting, this is a movie about a young man in a bad situation learning he can make something more out of his life if he goes his own way. It's not as touchy feely as GWH, but it is the same general concept.

So I found myself posing the question whether I would still like it all that much...Telling something about the story isn't very easy. I guess that you can best try to find a resume of the horror movies that I mentioned in the previous paragraph, since this entire movie more or less follows the same story lines. The entire movie is in fact a literal, but comical version of these movies.If you are looking for a somewhat intelligent comedy, than this movie will once again be a huge disappointment. The Wayans brothers know no shame and find humor in every bodily function. What you'll get are jokes about farting and sex and sometimes one about smoking pot. Personally I still could laugh with most of the jokes, because I already knew that I didn't have to expect anything decent from this movie, but I can imagine that there are people who will be very offended by it.I'm not even going to tell something about the acting, because there isn't really any to be seen in this movie. This was just a bunch of young people re-enacting several scenes from all kinds of (scary) movies, behaving like a bunch of fools, but also having some excellent fun while doing so. And it shows. It's probably the best reason why you should watch this movie. It's completely over-the-top, couldn't be more opposite from subtle humor and hasn't got anything to offer that comes close to a story line, but I still like it because it's so absurd and that's why I give it a 7\/10, maybe a 7.5\/10.

Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the cutest movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough cute lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in Hitch. The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One Hillbillies-like moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some crows out of a tree so that they won't sh*t all over the reception. Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. I saw another review that noted the choppiness of some scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.The movie moved up from a 2 during the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to a 6 in the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene. I hope this is not a spoiler.I don't really understand the almost universal overwhelming praise by the reviewers here.

They decide to continue their journey and try to forget about it, but when all a sudden their car breaks down and they see the same pick-up passing by and turning around, they are scared.

The trucker offers to bring them to the next diner where they can call a tow truck, but Jeff decides to stay with his car and lets his wife leave, alone with the trucker. When Jeff is able to fix his car all by himself and drives to the diner, his wife is missing and there is no-one who has ever seen her or the truck, let alone that they would know where he should look for her...In my opinion the pace of this movie is the best that it has to offer, because it doesn't leave you the time to think too much or to question certain parts.

The acting and the rest of the story are certainly OK, but it's the ending that spoiled a lot of my fun, because I just couldn't believe in it anymore.

You can't replicate them (Mars Attacks and the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra went close) but you can enjoy them on a comical level. This movie costing millions and millions must now be christened the grand daddy of bad cinema. Plan 9 From Outer Space cannot begin to compete with this movie.It had it all cameras on tilts, weird colour filters, silly acting, hammy acting, bad sets, illogical sets, ridiculous costumes, insane plot and almost worst of all a scientology sub text. That's a home run when it comes to bad movies, Ed Wood had every one of those but he had a cast and crew full of heroin addicts, and the movie was funded by fundamentalist Christians.What excuse has this movie got? It was directed by George Lucas' right hand man (hence all those tacky transitions), production design by the man who designed Independence day, starring the guy from Pulp Fiction, the guy from Ghost Dog and the guy from 25th Hour. The cinematographer also worked on Swim Fan. And most importantly the book was written by L Ron Hubbard, the creator of the cult Scientology, surely with that sort of creative team this move could have least been OK.Sadly this is not the case.This movie has significant problems in every department, firstly the acting.Barry Pepper shows the same emotion when is horse is killed as he did for his dearly departed father, and that emotion is hammy acting. Most of the movie he winces like someone has stolen his marbles. John Travolta looks as if he was auditioning for the cowardly lion, it is hard to take his character seriously as he prances around with extravagant hand gestures. As for every other actor in this movie, you were OK, but not good, take this off your resume and have a good day.The Script. Well with dialogue and a plot straight from 1950's sci fi this movie was off to a bad start before filming. Any first year film student could rewrite this movie and take out all the leverages and man-animal lines, that are peppered every 10th sentence. The writers of this are not world renowned writers and never shall be. I know the book was bad, but surely it could have been better than this.The direction. If I think really hard the only thing I can think of that the director did right was casting. Forrest Whittaker and Barry Pepper, both fine actors, but the craptastic nature of this film ruined them. There was nothing this movie did that made sense, why tell us they are in Denver, who cares, they could be in outta space for all it matters. I know john Travolta put a lot of pressure on this Roger Christian but damn man this is your career we are talking about, you have to put your name on this.The Producers. Bad sets, Bad acting, Bad Directing, Bad Camera-work, Bad Screenplay and bad pretty much everything else. You have to wonder whether the producers were on set for any of this. I mean this is dribble and how did the producers expect to sell this, its unwatchable to anyone except people who like bad cinema. All the producers can do is hold it till L Ron or John dies and try and market it as the worst movie ever made.The Plot. So many holes, so little time, firstly why is it they say dog, but then man-animal. Secondly how does one wipe out all armies in 9 minutes, then lose to a bunch of cave dwellers. Thirdly, how do said cave dwellers teach themselves to fly jet planes in only a few hours, and what powers the flight simulator? Fourthly, why does the hero not shoot all the Psychlos when he has the gun? Fifthly Psychlos? Sixthly John Travolta? Lastly, but definitely not least, L Ron Hubbard. You sir should be ashamed of yourself. Sure you invented a cult that millions around the world are members of, sure you are rich because of it, but mate, why waste 78 million dollars on this, a remake of your book, a book that doesn't make sense as well. Please just leave this planet and take all your thetans with you. We will try and get through life without you.Finally I must make mention of the fact that this movie is essentially just L Ron Hubbard helping us poor un-enlightened people understand that Scientology is the answer. That is what the hero does, he is more intelligent so he teaches everyone that there beliefs are stupid and they should trust him. Although in the movie he doesn't ask for cash, like the Scientologists do.

What he presents here is a unique little treatise on youth, on the subtle and disconnected qualities that go in life when you don't have much to do. In a way it's an existentialist film without many very serious questions to deal with story or even character-wise (except until maybe the last fifteen minutes in the Paradise segment). Like a French New-Wave film, to which Jarmusch was heavily influenced by (i.e. the gorgeous, grainy black and white photography by Tom DiCillo), he leaves more for the audience to ponder, as they go along on their journey.One of the things that Stranger Than Paradise has going for it is a sort of realism that, like and not-like a Wes Anderson film for example, is off-beat. Only here it is more of an urban sort of landscape and interiors that Jarmusch gives us with, along with its three principles. John Lurie as Willie is very good at having attitude when he needs it, but in reality is rather low-key in his 'hip-ness'. His cousin from Hungary pays him a visit (Eszter Balint as Eva, maybe too low-key at times, though appropriately observant of foreign territory). There is also his faithful companion Eddie, played in a great supporting tone and style by Richard Edson. The first segment of the film deals with her in New York. The second one has Eddie and Willie go to Cleveland to pay Eva a visit. Then in the third segment they go down to Florida to have some fun, only to have anything but.In other words, those looking for a film where a lot of things 'happen' may be disappointed, or just bored. I've seen the film twice now, and on the first viewing I was a little detached from what was going on on screen, which is just little things going on with the characters, like one would see in everyday life. But on the second viewing I somehow connected more with these characters, the youth that seem to drift needlessly along. The editing of the film is also the most simplistic, though highly effective, in adding to the disconnected quality of Jarmusch's direction- no cuts during dialog, just fading to black, fading up, fading to black, fading up (Jarmusch would continue this with Down by Law and Dead Man, though not as frequent or strategic).In fact, the whole film is rather deliberate in its style, but as the song that plays several times in the film I Put a Spell On You from Screamin' Jay Hawkins plays, it does work to bring a viewer in...or not. Like many in the art-film world, almost all of Jarmusch's films are either liked or not, and I think that's appropriate for his stories, which often deal with low-key characters dealing with unusual but either realistic or metaphorical situations. One thing I can say for certain, much like the French new-wave films inspired by it, it's imitated, but not equaled in its form.

John Wayne portrays the hot headed owner of Donovan Construction Company, who offers his services to the government in building airfields and related support fortifications for the war effort. The story centers on Wedge Donovan's single mindedness in getting his men armed so they can defend themselves under attack; as civilians they have no such authority. Boiled down, Wayne's role was to make a lot of foolish mistakes that got many of his men killed, both out of uniform and as soldiers.Complicating matters for Donovan is a three way love triangle supplied by reporter Connie Chesley (Susan Hayward) and her fiancé Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow (Dennis O'Keefe). When Connie suffers a near fatal wound following a Japanese invasion of Island X-371, Yarrow overhears Donovan and Chesley exchanging I Love You's together. Ever the stalwart military man, Yarrow doesn't seem to take it personally, even as he continues to pine for his woman.The fight scenes offer some unique twists that one would not expect. As Japanese tanks advance on the island, the Seabees combine ingenuity with resolve by battling the enemy with bulldozers and cranes. The surreal nature of the exchange makes one wonder if such fighting actually could have taken place, though I imagine it would have been possible.Only John Wayne could go into battle without a weapon, and in seconds take out three attacking Japanese while securing a rifle in the process. It comes as a surprise then when his character dies on the battlefield, first shot and then blown up by enemy fire. Most of his men suffer the same fate, a colorful supporting cast that includes William Frawley, Leonid Kinskey, Grant Withers, Paul Fix and Ben Welden.With no sense of a time dimension for the history of the Seabees, and a hit and run approach to the Wayne\/Hayward\/O'Keefe romance, the movie has a disjointed feel and is best approached as an entertainment piece and not a serious exploration of it's subject matter. The film closes on an appropriately patriotic note, with Commander Yarrow reading a presidential citation for the heroes of X-371. The movie's theme is formalized with the line - We build for the fighters, we fight for what we build.

This seems to be something that Robin would say to Batman in the 4th installment of the Batman series. This movie comes off the success of Batman Forever(while although cheesy, the jokes in it do not fall as flat as the ones in Batman and Robin.) In Batman Forever and all of the other Batman movies the villains actually had chemistry with each other. Not so in this movie I am afraid to say. Arnold Schwarzeneger as usual completely overacts in this movie as does Uma Thurman. The Plot leaves something to be desired(In my opinion the worst plot of the series.) It is about Poison Ivy, who may not be that great of a villain to begin with. She uses the same kind of gas that the Joker(portrayed brilliantly by Jack Nicholson in the first Batman)to a different and utterly laughable effects. It seems the most harm she can do is to seduce some of Gotham's highest citizens and then with her kiss of death kill them(unless of course you bring your rubber lips for the fight, even though you were completely under her spell not 2 seconds before-hand.) Arnold was miserably type-casted for this movie, throwing out more puns then last week's garbage. While he may be a huge movie star what we needed was a good actor. Don't even get me started on Batgirl's character who seemed completely unnecessary to the story line(It seemed the only reason she was there was because of typical feminists who don't to see men be the only ones fighting crime in the movies.) George Clooney could possibly have been the worst role for Batman, ever. We didn't need a sarcastic actor to play one of the more serious roles in the series. One of the only cool sequences in the entire movie is when you enter Arkham Asylum and see the Riddler's and Catwoman's Costumes from the previous movies. Sloppy action does not make a good movie. Neither does corny dialog and campy performances. Save the turkey until Thanksgiving and don't watch this movie. 2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 August 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Holy Cheese Batman!!
