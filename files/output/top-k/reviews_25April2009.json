Suffice to say, the Holy Grail is not really the most important thing in this film. It is a pretext for a series of unlikely adventures and misadventures that includes an Arab cult, rats, a crusader's tomb, Nazis, secret passage ways, zepellins, a Pasha with a passion for automobiles, an unlikely battle with a tank, and a temple with boob-traps that could only have been put there by the all-mighty God, who (judging from the film) has a really dark sense of humor.Now very little of this Indiana Jones movie makes sense. For example, would the British really allow Nazi soldiers to march about freely in Egypt (which was then a British colony)? Probably not. But in director Spielberg's film, the Nazis roam about Egypt like they own the place. But that's not the part of the film that I object to. We already grown accustomed to this idea that Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is not a serious adventure film.The problem with this movie is that it has too many action scenes and the overwhelming majority of them are boring. I am tired of watching chases. I am tired of the explosions. I am tired of pointless machine gun battles. I am tired of watching Indiana Jones best a German tank. And yes, I am tired of seeing Nazis being reduced to two-dimensional characters whose only purpose in life is the be evil bastards (which unfortunately is what Spielberg does all too often in his films). To his credit, Spielberg tries to make the action scenes more interesting by having Indiana Jones' father (played capably by Sean Connery) make fun of some of the action scenes. This is not archaeology, he tells Indiana. But such humor only goes so far and the temptation is to skip through the action sequences as quickly as possible.Where Spielberg does succeed is in creating truly exotic sequences. I will not spoil anything, but suffice to say there is a sense of wonder when Indiana Jones walks though a chamber with artifacts or an old ruin. If Spielberg focused more of his attention on that, instead of the shootouts, the explosions and the silly chases, then he probably would have ended up creating a better picture.

The American crew, Bruce Bennett and Dan Duryea, believe they know Gunn well, so they're surprised when he discovers there is no water at a distant Oasis, but further learns a German Armored battalion is also advancing on the Oasis and decides to make a stand.

What the Germans are unaware of, is Gunn and his men although holding the Oasis, are also in great need of water. Who will prevail as Gunn sends for help and the Germans prepare an all out assault against the outnumbered group?

Why do so many fans hate it? It leaves me to wonder what all the anti-Halloween sixers would have done if they were stuck with the task of explaining a raging psychopath's motives.Let me start off with the story. Surely not a bad one at that considering it had to pick up with the problematic status left on the table by Halloween 5. It starts six years after 5. Jamie and Michael are presumed dead after an explosion. In all reality, Jamie has been kidnapped by a cult lead by the mysterious man in black, and she is pregnant (we are never officially told who the guilty party is). She gives birth on Halloween eve. The man in black takes the baby but Jamie manages to get him back and escape the cult's dark, underground domain. The cult seemingly frees the shape and sends him after Jamie. After she escapes him at a bus station, Myers catches her and unfortunately completes her story. However, the baby is nowhere to be found. Michael stays in Haddonfield and wreaks havoc on a family living in his home, more Strodes, while searching for the infant. The man in black's identity is finally revealed and Dr. Loomis and Tommy Doyle prepare for the last act back in a familiar setting.Now, some of the acting here is really thin, but we must remember that this film is primarily story and atmosphere driven. Speaking of the atmosphere, it is amazingly strong here. The lighting and look of the night is purely excellent and the look of the day scenes are surprisingly great as well (gray and loomy, rather than bright and sunny as in H5). The Myers house also gets a nice makeover and we no longer have the ever-terrible mansion. The mask in this film is the best since H1, and the shape is acted very well.All in all, I actually like this film, and it is in my top 3 of the series.

He plans to fly jets and enrols at a tough Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School. Very much a loner and used to doing things his own way, Zack must tow the line if he is to succeed. Forming friendships and taking on a romance with a local girl, he may just make the grade. But he has to convince not only his tough no nonsense drill instructor, but also himself.An Officer And A Gentleman has been bogged down over the years by being labelled as a chick flick, a film they say, that is for the soggy handkerchief brigade. Not so say I. Yes love is a critical strand here, not only finding it after years of being closed off from it, but also to keep it after seizing the day. But it's as much a film about determination as it is love, in finding strengths from within to achieve ones goals against seemingly badly stacked odds. It really is a film that essays that triumph of the will spirit so lacking in many similar pictures that followed this 1982 piece. There are some incredibly great sequences here, chiefly during the training programme, from Mayo's continuing conflict with Sgt Foley, to a devastating turn of events with a friendship. This film royally packs an emotional punch.The cast are uniformly excellent, Richard Gere as Mayo is pitch perfect and it pays to notice that he was a 32 year old man playing an early 20s rookie, it's a testament to his undervalued ability that nobody noticed. Debra Winger was nominated for a Best Actress Award for her portrayal as Mayo's love interest, Paula Pokrifki. It's believed that Gere and herself didn't get on off screen, it isn't noticeable, tho, because the chemistry sizzles and the resulting end product is one of a joyous return. Honours have to go to Louis Gossett Jr., tho, rightly winning the Best Supporting Actor Award, his performance as instructor Sgt Foley is towering and one of the best of the 1980s. David Keith and Lisa Eilbacher also turn in strong performances, and Taylor Hackford's direction is smooth and without intrusion. The involving screenplay and tidy editing are also noteworthy, and the theme song, Up where We Belong took home the gong for Best Original Song.Some critics have called the film sexist, oh come off it people.

And this has not changed for me in the decades since I have seen these movies first - despite many modern achievements of allegedly advanced horror.

At various points each of them takes the initiative, carrying the budding romance forward; at various points each one retreats a little, though overall it seems that Jesse is (slightly) more pushy. There are certainly commentaries about the differences between Europe and America here, but only once does it seem over-the-top (a bar scene where an American couple rudely complain to each other about the service); generally this is a film about what we have in common, not what drives us apart.After the long and wonderful night, it's time for parting.

We can see plenty of differences between Celine and Jesse developing, but also enough commonalities and real attraction that we really wonder, and want to know, what's next between them.

Take in mind that I've read the novels, I'm a big fan and I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10. This is a good adaptation of a great book, but I will say that the only thing that disappoints me now when I watch it is that I can't help, but imagine what it would have been like if JK's first choice of director had been picked (Terry Gilliam). Terry would have definitely been more creative and he probably would have brought something different to the table. I agree with British film critic Mark Kermode, Columbus does have a rather bland and straight-forward direction style. Now that may work in some movies, but not in a fantasy film like Harry Potter. I must say though in his defense that second movie was much better than the first one, and it seemed to be an improvement for Chris who was probably a lot more comfortable with his surroundings, and had a better relationship with the actors. Still both films are a bit bland in comparison to the rest of the franchise, most of all if we were to compare the first two, to the third one which was directed by the wonderful Alfonso Cuarón, who's style of direction is considerably different from Columbus'. Apart from the blandness the film is great fun for the whole family, and there's always a distinctive energy when you're watching a new HP flick in theaters with a bunch of enthusiastic fans. People are saying now that Twilight is going to replace HP, but I don't think so. The Twilight fan base is only a third of the HP fan base, and the film series is close to been the biggest franchise of all time, and I think they can actually accomplish that. There's great acting by everyone, most of all by the Golden Trio, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the lovely Emma Watson. Also stand out performances by Maggie Smith as the strict but fair Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the greasy git, also known as Professor Snape. Richard Harris excels as the Headmaster of Hogwarts Academy, Dumbledore. He plays Harry's mentor to a tee. And I have to say I sorely miss him even if Gambon is doing a great job as his replacement.

Wells' film has even less to do with his great-grandfather's novel than the 1960 version, in fact changing the whole motivation of the main character so that he can even more readily dispense with any of the philosophizing and social theorizing that has helped to keep the novel still relevant and interesting today.In this film, the setting has been moved from London to New York though it's still the Victorian '90s. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a physics professor about to ask for young Emma's (Sienna Guillory) hand in marriage when she is killed by a mugger. In grief, he sets about inventing a time machine so that he can go back and save her. Wouldn't you? Four years later he's ready, but he quickly finds out that he can't change the past, as that would keep him from building the machine and that would be a paradox. Of course, the paradox of his machine appearing 4 years before it was built in his laboratory or the possibility of him running into himself are never dealt with at all, and this sets up the bad action\/thriller pattern in place for the rest of the film throw logic out the window and when something needs to happen just do it and hope the audience won't notice.He quickly decides to go off into the future. No real reason why -- no discussions of mankind becoming noble and true, as there was in the novel -- nope, he just wants to get out of Dodge apparently. After a longish stop in 2030 where he meets a holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) and somehow glosses over the fact that he apparently died in 1903 - the year he left - and a short one in 2037 as he witnesses the moon break up (cue cool digital effects) he is knocked unconscious on his machine and stays in a daze while the world changes around him, until finally awakening in the year 802,701. Given that 36 minutes have passed by now out of the under 85 (leaving off end credits), you know the action's going to have to come fast and furious and the strangeness and wonder - that still excite this lover of the novel - are going to be in short supply.Suffice it to say that he quickly meets the Eloi, the surface people, led (more or less) by Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is the only adult in the tribe to speak English which is learned by all of them as kids but forgotten by most; she's the teacher though and of course remembers it, can speak intelligibly and is able to lead Hartdegen eventually to the ruins of the library where, miraculously, the electronic librarian still works. But wait, there's a cog in the machinery! Alongside the wonderfully mixed-race Eloi (the sole interesting touch in the film) there's a race of dead-white monstrous super-ape-like thingies, the Morlocks, who are faster, stronger, and like to eat Eloi-flesh. The Eloi of course just accept that their old, feeble, and sometimes others just get taken away - despite being reasonably smart and sophisticated in this version (in the novel and the 1960 film the Eloi are quite feeble and it's not at all surprising that they can't or won't fight back). In short order Mara is captured and our hero has to venture down below where he meets the supreme Morlock, an idiotic conception who can read minds, is super-strong and controls the other Morlocks but who of course gets bested rather quickly by the monkey-faced Pearce\/Hartdegen. He's played by Jeremy Irons who I will say seems to enjoy these kinds of cheesy things, at least he's having fun making his big paycheck and probably knows it's crap.And here comes the best\/worst part after dispatching the leader by moving his machine forward in time while super-Morlock is hanging on outside of the machine's sphere of safety (my words, none of this is ever explained) and aging the Morlock to death in a few seconds, the time traveler comes back, frees Mara, and sets the machine to blow up, which it quickly does, turning all of the Morlocks underground to dust just as the protagonists reach the surface and safety. So, uh, he saves the day by basically blowing up his machine despite not, uh, really possibly knowing what the consequences would be. This, like virtually the whole of the rest of the film, is just thrown at us with no explanation, and now our hero is presumably left to start a new world with the (of course) beautiful and intelligent Mara, having in a few days forgotten all about his past.Pearce is awful, looking like an ugly sad puppy through most of the film and never being remotely convincing as a man of science; Mumba is nice to look at but that's about it. Some of the art direction and sets are kind of cool, but in a very self-conscious way look, isn't this awesome! Like the Eloi village, a bunch of weird shell-shaped structures on a cliff face that really don't seem feasible or likely.

Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is a physics professor about to ask for young Emma's (Sienna Guillory) hand in marriage when she is killed by a mugger. In grief, he sets about inventing a time machine so that he can go back and save her. Wouldn't you? Four years later he's ready, but he quickly finds out that he can't change the past, as that would keep him from building the machine and that would be a paradox. Of course, the paradox of his machine appearing 4 years before it was built in his laboratory or the possibility of him running into himself are never dealt with at all, and this sets up the bad action\/thriller pattern in place for the rest of the film throw logic out the window and when something needs to happen just do it and hope the audience won't notice.He quickly decides to go off into the future. No real reason why -- no discussions of mankind becoming noble and true, as there was in the novel -- nope, he just wants to get out of Dodge apparently. After a longish stop in 2030 where he meets a holographic librarian (Orlando Jones) and somehow glosses over the fact that he apparently died in 1903 - the year he left - and a short one in 2037 as he witnesses the moon break up (cue cool digital effects) he is knocked unconscious on his machine and stays in a daze while the world changes around him, until finally awakening in the year 802,701. Given that 36 minutes have passed by now out of the under 85 (leaving off end credits), you know the action's going to have to come fast and furious and the strangeness and wonder - that still excite this lover of the novel - are going to be in short supply.Suffice it to say that he quickly meets the Eloi, the surface people, led (more or less) by Mara (Samantha Mumba) who is the only adult in the tribe to speak English which is learned by all of them as kids but forgotten by most; she's the teacher though and of course remembers it, can speak intelligibly and is able to lead Hartdegen eventually to the ruins of the library where, miraculously, the electronic librarian still works. But wait, there's a cog in the machinery! Alongside the wonderfully mixed-race Eloi (the sole interesting touch in the film) there's a race of dead-white monstrous super-ape-like thingies, the Morlocks, who are faster, stronger, and like to eat Eloi-flesh. The Eloi of course just accept that their old, feeble, and sometimes others just get taken away - despite being reasonably smart and sophisticated in this version (in the novel and the 1960 film the Eloi are quite feeble and it's not at all surprising that they can't or won't fight back). In short order Mara is captured and our hero has to venture down below where he meets the supreme Morlock, an idiotic conception who can read minds, is super-strong and controls the other Morlocks but who of course gets bested rather quickly by the monkey-faced Pearce\/Hartdegen. He's played by Jeremy Irons who I will say seems to enjoy these kinds of cheesy things, at least he's having fun making his big paycheck and probably knows it's crap.And here comes the best\/worst part after dispatching the leader by moving his machine forward in time while super-Morlock is hanging on outside of the machine's sphere of safety (my words, none of this is ever explained) and aging the Morlock to death in a few seconds, the time traveler comes back, frees Mara, and sets the machine to blow up, which it quickly does, turning all of the Morlocks underground to dust just as the protagonists reach the surface and safety. So, uh, he saves the day by basically blowing up his machine despite not, uh, really possibly knowing what the consequences would be. This, like virtually the whole of the rest of the film, is just thrown at us with no explanation, and now our hero is presumably left to start a new world with the (of course) beautiful and intelligent Mara, having in a few days forgotten all about his past.Pearce is awful, looking like an ugly sad puppy through most of the film and never being remotely convincing as a man of science; Mumba is nice to look at but that's about it. Some of the art direction and sets are kind of cool, but in a very self-conscious way look, isn't this awesome! Like the Eloi village, a bunch of weird shell-shaped structures on a cliff face that really don't seem feasible or likely. Not that much of anything in the film as a whole seems feasible or likely, for that matter. It's just, rush ahead, and hope nobody notices how stupid it all is. Well, I did.My hopes for future Wells adaptations remain dim, very dim...

Let me start by saying you haven't truly seen this film if you saw Godzilla 1985. The American cut of this film is a plain molestation of the original cut. King of the Monsters was a not too shabby flick, but this is horrendous. 12 minutes were cut out, which took away from the story. It went from a serious Cold War epic of an G-film with dignity and excellent dramatic tension to a propaganda film portraying Russians as terrorists. Plus those added American scenes are pretty much useless to the story . Raymond Burr returns as Steve Martin, who simply just sits there and watches the destruction of Tokyo on a big screen TV and gives an occasional line of dialogue that, again, doesn't contribute anything to the story. Actually, he tries to confuse us with what Godzilla wants, when it is made clear in the story his goal is to feed off nuclear energy. There's even a whole scene about this! To make things worse, he also from time to time pulls out this serpent medallion and stares down at it, making us wonder, again, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE STORY?! Complete garbage!! If you see the Japanese cut, then you'll stop butchering the film and realize what I did; this movie is great! My top reason for loving this movie is, after nearly ten years of being a campy good guy, Godzilla has finally returned to being a malevolent yet symbolic creature.The SFX were spectacular for their time and his rampage was very well done. The rampage was just as haunting and dark as the original Gojira actually, and you get the true sense Godzilla is a nightmare straight out of hell. Speaking of which, Godzilla looked realistic and I love the snarling feature given to the animatronic head. It gives a lot of emotion and realism to the Monster King. The Super X was a nice edition and was as great as any monster foe. The battle between it and Godzilla was very cool. The story was well put together and didn't go too far. The human characters are involving and the drama is well played. There's a hell of a lot more deep and thought-out characterization in the original cut, as if that even need be said. Plus the music was dark and terrifying, and also gave a feeling of awe to the Monster king. The tone of the film is also dark and pretty serious, even cleverly taking on the issue of the Cold War and nuclear weapons. My favorite two parts are when Godzilla takes out that helicopter, causing it to crash right into traffic, causing in turn a huge explosion. And when Godzilla knocks that building onto the downed Super-X, destroying it permanently.Anyways, this movie brought back Godzilla as a towering menace, and it is no doubt one of THE best G-films, one of my favorites. My spent much of my life with a VHS tape of the American cut and truly had no real idea what this film actually meant. I am more than glad to now own the Japanese original cut in all its glory.

Starting the investigation with Baltus Van Tassel, (Michael Gambon) and his family, Lady Mary, (Miranda Richardson) and Katrina, (Christina Ricci) before turning to the other members of town, Brom Van Brunt, (Casper Van Dien) Reverend Steenwyck, (Jeffrey Jones) Magistrate Samuel Phillips, (Richard Griffiths) Dr. Thomas Lancaster, (Ian McDiarmid) and Notary James Hardenbrook, (Michael Gough) who all seem to have a strange connection with each other that goes back generations in the town, and who regale him with stories about an undead headless horseman who is the culprit in the murders. Unwilling to believe such stories, the murders continue and eventually he is forced to accept that the stories are true and that there's a more sinister reason for the rampage, putting him and the rest of the town in severe danger from the ravenous killer.The Good News There was a lot of stuff to enjoy with this one. One of the film's best features is that there's an incredible look to the film which makes it incredibly fun to watch. The town here looks incredible, from the town being completely enveloped in darkness that gives it an eerie, claustrophobic feeling of evil surrounding everything and everywhere, and the muddy landscapes and weather-beaten surroundings do add immensely to that feeling. Perhaps the best example of that is the woods surrounding the town, which are just incredibly spectacular and worthwhile in creating an impressive atmosphere. From the look of death on the trees to the thick, heavy fog bank that overhangs the ground constantly throughout the entire film and adds an extra dimension to it all with it's atmosphere. Even more visual prowess comes from it's locations, as the different areas in the forest represented, from the Tree of the Dead to the witch's cave and the burned out shack are just fantastic-looking places that work wonders here. The fact that the killer here manages to get a lot of good stuff about it works quite well. From the imposing appearance to the fantastic back-story to the proclivity to decapitation and the different rules about his behavior, it has a lot going for the killer here and he manages to steal many scenes because of who he is. The first scene, where he attacks a couple on a carriage without being seen, is a masterpiece and a later scene where he is confronted by a couple of swordsmen after performing a task, resulting in a rather well-done and exciting fight with the weapons that ends in graphic bloodshed, but everything before it is so good that there's a lot to like about the scene. Pretty much most of the scenes here are just a blast and there's not much that can be wrong for this. The fact that there's a lot more action scenes here than expected, and that really helps the movie hugely. From the chase through the woods with the two horses and the different ways that are brought up from the killer chasing them, to the great finale that gets a lot right about it, this one has some fantastic action scenes in here. In the finale is the best, from the great showdown at the windmill that results in some really explosive action to the fantastic, full-on carriage chase and brawl atop it as it's moving along that works fantastically, this one has a great ending and works really well. The last good plus here is the film's body count, which provides plenty of good stuff about it. This one is mostly built around tons of gags for decapitations, which mostly work well, but there's also other great deaths as one is sliced in half with an ax, stabbed in the leg with a large knife, impaled through the chest with a pointed white picket fence and stabbed with large wooden poles, among other deaths in here that give a fantastic body count. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News There was hardly anything not to like about this one. One of it's only flaws is the fact that there's a rather convoluted and really more in-depth than required back-story here. There's a point where having too much doesn't really help a film but rather harms it because spelling everything out either contradicts something known previously or it seems thrown in for a twist when there's no reason to add one, which is what happens here. This one here works so much better as a film about a horseman killing townspeople in a remote village, but everything with the village elders and the secret-keeping and the twist and betrayal at the end just overly complicates the film for no reason and really could've been simplified here or dropped altogether. That, coupled with the fact that some might be put off by the fantastical elements that creep in during the finale, are the film's real flaws.The Final Verdict With a lot of great stuff to this one and only minor, barely-detrimental flaws to hold it down, this is an incredible film. Highly recommended to those who likes visually-stylish horror films, the old-school Hammer films or of the creative crew, while those who don't should heed caution.Rated R Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity ","genre":null},{"date":"25 April 2009","score":"","review":" Sleepy Hollow is an incredibly fun and nearly flawless slasher.**SPOILERS**After a series of strange deaths, Constable Ichabod Crane, (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the strange murders.

It was about a month after breaking up a 6-year relationship which I didn't want to end, though I should have. She was probably the least-romantic person I've ever met - not that she didn't have romantic notions in the larger sense, nearly everyone does, but the romantic part of relationships she didn't get. Or her idea of romance was just so remote and unexplainable that I could never figure it out, and she could never have told me. Why 6 years, I'll never know. She probably hated this film. I, on the other hand, am as enraptured by it now as I was on that first viewing 13 years ago and the couple of times in between. From the first shot of the harbor of Cherbourg panning gracefully down to an overhead shot of candy-colored umbrellas in the rain, to the final mirroring shot of an equally artificial-looking Esso station in the snow five years later, it's pure sentimental, stylized magic. Some have mentioned that there isn't much in the way of character development in this admittedly very simple story of young lovers parted by war and ultimately finding new relationships and lives apart from each other - but I think they're missing the point. It's not supposed to be terribly real, or rather it is suffused throughout with a sense of heightened reality, exemplified most obviously in the entirely sung dialog and in the brightness of the color scheme, but also in the intensity of emotions that could, after all, be experienced by any of us. It doesn't matter that I don't really know Geneviève or Guy - they are any young lovers and what the film is about, it seems to me, is that bittersweet feeling we all have towards our first loves. At the end of the film, both are married and it is fairly clear that they have made the right choices - one thing I find fascinating is that the two leads are both rather weak and passive, and in both cases they end up with stronger, more aggressive and more competent partners. Had they ended up with each other, what kind of future would they have had? The music - well, you can't take the music out, or it does, in fact, show its thinness. Here's a great quote from Jonathan Rosenbaum's long review regarding composer Michel Legrand's contribution to the film Though Legrand isn't credited as the film's co-writer, his collaboration with Demy, who wrote the lyrics, suggests that he may well deserve to be, for this is a film in which the score and the narrative are inseparable, shaped to the same architecture. Demy once noted that Umbrellas should be described as a film 'in song' the way that some films are 'in color.' If one can't get past the notion that this is, in fact, a romantic fantasy amped up to the nth degree through color, through its plot absurdities (one night of passion resulting in Geneviève having to marry the diamond merchant, Guy's beloved godmother dying on the same day he learns of Geneviève's marriage and quits his job, etc) and most of all through the hyper-romantic music which runs the gamut from jazz to chanson, then there's not much I can say. You have to fall under the spell and take it as it is, not ask for what it doesn't provide - asking for more realism in the relationships seems to me to be missing the point. For me the only real flaw in the film at all is Deneuve, who at 21 really is a little too old for the naiveté of Geneviève, but this is a very minor point in a film that I can never grow tired of. I like Demy's next musical, The Young Girls of Rochefort, possibly even more -- and I'd suggest all who love this to make that a priority.

He has the typical job, is obsessed with the material and is nothing more than a thing to the world. The Narrator is someone not fulfilled with life; making is way in and out of AA and other support groups in order to maintain himself emotionally. His counterpart and associate is Tyler Durden. Tyler represents something that is greater than man, an unreal ideality that lives on behalf and threw the Narrator. Tyler is a character that inspires man to be more than just man. There is a relation between Tyler Durden and man, and the role of Tyler in the world.What Tyler Durden has is ability and power. For example, there are many fights throughout Fight Club and the fight that Tyler Loses, he actually wins. Tyler Durden stands on a plane with Jesus and Nietzsche's Overman, a crossbred between God and man. What is inspirational about Tyler is that he and the narrator are the same person. The narrator, who is a man, crosses a barrier and becomes something greater than man. Tyler is not human; he is more an idea, and a symbol of revolution. The Narrator's relation to Tyler is a role of assistance. Tyler inspires the Narrator, gives him a place to live, mentors him and together they start a revolution. The two characters are more productive together than they are separately, though they are dependent on the other. The Narrator suffers from insomnia and later the audience realizes that he suffers from a split personality disorder. Through his mental disabilities the narrator turns himself into Tyler. The narrator is able to break away from the boredom of everyday life by being Tyler Durden. The idea of a club where people fight without protection and at their own discretion, where the first two rules standout as fight club being a club of secrecy, becomes a form of therapy for men, then a way of life for society. The narrator realizes the unnecessary of materials, and then realizes that work, water and other basic needs are not needed. The narrator frees himself from the security that food, shelter and water provide. Where at one time he was consumed by the material, trying to fill his apartment with the perfect Liz Clayborn piece that would capture the perfect mood for his kitchen, the narrator realizes the meaninglessness of projects that only seem to serve a purpose of life. The blessing for the narrator comes when his apartment gets blown up and everything in it destroyed. The narrator falls to apathy, but from his apathy comes freedom. He doesn't care if his teeth fall out or if he has to wear the same clothes to work every day. His actions toward a fight club have purpose and meaning, because what the fight club eventually does is starts a revolution. Toward the end of the movie the audience as well as the narrator discovers that the narrator is Tyler Durden. Through this realization the narrator becomes aware that Tyler, though his mentor was destructive, and had to be gotten rid of. In the end who ends up prevailing? Though the narrator ends up living, he causes himself to shoot himself, in order for Tyler to perish. Furthermore, Tyler's legacy lives on, Tyler never physically existed, and if he was never physically he can be disposed of physically. The narrator attempts to get rid of Tyler in an ideal way, by physically attacking himself. Though he does disappear, again, he never existed. At the end of the film, the credit card companies are destroyed and the beginning of the end comes to a close as the chaos prepares to unfold on the earth. These actions, these doings, are because of Tyler Durden. The idea of him lives out physically through the destruction of earth. The effects of Tyler become more real than Tyler. At the same time the narrator overcomes the superman, Tyler. Showing that it is capable for man to not only surpass mankind, but at the same time to overcome himself.

Leaving behind the two children they were involved with in the first film, our two outlaw wannabes find themselves enlisting in the cavalry after unwittingly helping in a bank robbery.Conway and Knotts's fiddlefooted fumblings are happening at the same time that army supplies are being systematically robbed from Fort Concho with commandant Harry Morgan having no clue why. And Morgan's got other things on his mind as well. His daughter Elyssa Davalos is arriving to marry her fiancé, Lieutenant Robert Pine. But a most amorous private played by Tim Matheson keeps getting in the way.It was a stroke of genius at the Magic Kingdom when someone got the idea to team Don Knotts and Tim Conway. Like Bing Crosby and Bob Hope who had very successful careers as solos, when they teamed they really clicked. I only imagine that the individual projects both men were involved in kept them from doing even more films together. Each had a really good feel for the timing of the other and the comedy styles blended well.Disney Studios gave them a good cast in support as they always did. Ruth Buzzi has a nice turn as a blind lady who keeps trying to raise the town alarm about a bank robbery. But the absolute best was Kenneth Mars as Marshal Wooly Bill Hitchcock, a man who can't stand to lose. A feared legend of the west, he can't close the deal on Knotts and Conway, because strange fate keeps intervening. He gets driven to madness the same way Inspector Dreyfus is with Clousseau.Best scene in the film are Conway and Knotts as they bungle their way into burning the whole fort down, a bit taken from the Gary Cooper comedy, Cassanova Brown. Second best scene is Knotts and Conway in drag as saloon entertainers, taken of course from Some Like It Hot.Reused material or not, the stuff is very funny and more than kids will get laughs from two comic geniuses in The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.

This movie fit a class that I run into from time to time the movie that engages me well for the whole movie, such that I don't find out that I hate it until I get to the ending. In this case, it was the kind of ending where the movie doesn't so much end as run out of stuff. That is, there's no real resolution that ties everything together or anything, and you realize that what we've seen is more a series-of-events rather than a cohesive plot. Was it a happy ending? A sad ending? I still can't tell. But it certainly was an unsatisfying ending.If the plot isn't coherent, neither are the characters. I *still* don't understand a lot of the characters' motivations. Why was Wilcox such an obnoxious, stubborn fool about letting Helen stay one night in the house? When Meg has clearly and superbly delineated his hypocrisy, it just bounces right off of him. He doesn't concede the point, he doesn't deny the point, he just ignores it. That was just a weird way to behave. If nothing else, it paints the guy as a complete, irredeemable jerk. So the movie seems to strike a triumphant note when Meg finally tells him she's leaving him. That was the kind of wonderful moment which made it seem like the film was going somewhere. But then, *poof*, nothing comes of it, she's still with him and kissing him at the end. Huh? She ultimately makes no sense as a character, one can never see what she sees in this jerk, or why she constantly kowtows to him, despite being a strong enough character with everybody else. Then there's the brother, Tippy or Flippy or whatever his name was. Why? Why is he in this movie? He does NOTHING. He adds nothing, does nothing, says almost nothing, he's more a piece of the set than a character. Someone else here also pointed that out. And speaking of props-rather-than-characters, there was Jackie. The first thing I noticed at the end of the film was that she was given NO resolution. So ultimately, she, as a character, went nowhere and amounted to nothing. You could have entirely omitted her and nothing would've been any different. It was also pointed out, very appropriately, the way that Helen's character is slapdash. There's the whole big deal about her stealing umbrellas, then that utterly disappears. Comes off as pretty contrived. And what about the whole original thing with her having the aborted affair with young Wilcox? That too went nowhere and amounted to nothing.And, by the way, I waited half the movie for the family-history tidbit about the original Mrs. Wilcox having a brother or uncle or someone who asked for that other woman's hand and was rejected-- I waited half the movie for that to become relevant, trying to figure out who that might've been and how they tied in. Answer? Went nowhere, meant nothing, just another irrelevant detail. This movie was a complete soup of irrelevant details.Yes, the performances were fine (given what the actors had to work with). Yes, the sets and costumes and all provide a fine period recreation. And the music was quite good (but more about that in a minute). For those three things I gave it three stars instead of one. But the fact is, at the end of the movie I find myself frustrated and cheated. There was no real plot, and, in the end, there wasn't a single character in the movie that I *liked*. I had liked Meg for almost the whole movie, but when she went back with The Jerk at the end, that was just too much for me.And finally, let's talk about the music. I was enraptured when they did the bit with the Beethoven fifth (some of the finest, most moving music ever written). Especially when the naked piano version from the lecture hall morphs into the full, powerful orchestral score. I was excited, thinking, Excellent! They're using the wonderful 3rd movement as a leitmotif! This'll be great! But no, as with all else in this film, it means nothing and goes nowhere. It comes back exactly once, and only as a concrete flashback, when Umbrella Man is dreaming of the day he met Helen. What did it signify? Nothing. Just the concrete event.In short, this film did a great deal to raise my expectations and hopes and extremely little to actually fulfill them.

There are few films that whip out dialogue like this one.Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan, in his most famous role) are approached by one Miss Wanderly (Mary Astor) to place a tail on a fellow named Floyd Thursby. It is only later that night that Spade is informed of Archer's murder while following Thursby (we find out that Thursby himself had also been killed). Within a short period Spade meets Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre), a very cool customer - a shady one at that - has several meetings with Miss Wanderly and deals with Archer's widow (with whom Spade has obviously had an affair). It also follows that the police are leaning on Spade for the crimes committed.Eventually we learn that Cairo has some relationship with a character named Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet in the role of a lifetime) and that all the parties Spade is dealing with are in some manner interested in the whereabouts of a figurine called The Maltese Falcon. This would be a great example of Hitchcock's MacGuffin device.In true film noir fashion, we are never sure of the motivations of any of the characters. No one appears to be what they say they are, including Miss Wanderly. I know of no murder, or any other crime, for that matter, that was solved by a detective in my lifetime. But here The Maltese Falcon delivers a theme that has been the fodder for literally countless murder mysteries &#x96; books, films, radio and TV.You will hard pressed to find a single movie script that more closely follows the original novel.

It isn't on the menu anymore, but the restaurant still is a going concern in downtown San Francisco, the setting of this story. That isn't in the movie.For sheer gritty dialogue, terrific casting and a real mystery to boot you would be well served to make this an addition to your movie studies. It is a true classic. Citizen Kane is always touted as film with no flaws; The Maltese Falcon has some tiny errors unearthed by students of film (validating this film's importance, of course), but none of them materially affect the movie.
