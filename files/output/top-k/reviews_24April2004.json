Today, when the defining climax comes in a sports movie, they can conviniently rely on slow-motion to create drama. If you've ever taped a basketball game or a baseball game, it's fun to take just that game winning shot or game-winning homerun and watch it frame-by-frame to be able to disect exactly how that batter was able to do that, and movies of the 90s (Angels in the Outfield, Iron Will, the Rookie, etc, i could name about 20 others) have picked up on that. But Chariots of Fire was able to create a lot of that drama without any slow motion or much of the technology that we have today. Instead, I think those races in the end are so captivating because the characters themselves engage us.     The story takes place in 1920s Britain, and yes, it is true, people back then were able to run pretty fast, even though they wore funny-looking shoes. The two main characters are both sprinters with different motivation. The first, Harold Abrahams, is a promising young student at Oxford with a chip on his shoulder, he's Jewish and feels like an outsider. One of the things the film does really well is get that paradox across to us, we see the guy fit in really well, he gets girls, he gets to act in the school play and sing corny Brittish songs, and of course since he's so fast, he obviously has the respect of the other runners, but on the other hand, there's that slight difference between him and everyone else. It's partially a self-fulfilling prophecy, him feeling like an outsider makes him an outsider, but also some of the finer details of the film reinforce the point, the shots of the university, itself, look so gothic and non-Jewish. Either way, that subtleness really is part of how the film is so delicately made and able to give a grasp of the guy's kind of inner motivation.      At the same time, the movie follows a parallel plot of another sprinter Eric Lidell, who's dashing good looks and speeed win him many fans, but he's not really into that, he's a missionary and very devoted to God, but he loves running too, and as he tells one of the other sisters he works with, he feels that his two passions complement each other, and that he thinks that when he's running, he feels God's strength and he can also use his fame to talk about how great God is, so he follows through on that.      The movie tells two captivating stories, with a great historic-period feel, but it is kind of interesting how the character's two paths never really collide, but rather seem to kind of coexist on the screen, harmoniously. Considering the two run the same event, and with the clashing ways in which religion motivates the two, you'd think that would set the stage for conflict, but oddly, it doesn't happen like that. The two first meet, and have a tense and contrived good luck to you exchange before the race in which one loses (I won't say which one), and when they get to the Olympics, Eric refuses to run the 100 because it takes place on the Sabbath, even though he's been training for that for months. While, there's some dissapointment that these two aren't gonna battle it out as predicted, that moment in the movie says a lot about the character, and I think by making the movie more about their inner journeys within themselves rather than verse each other, the movie boldly defies the predictable route.

Ranging from awful (SUPERMAN III) to merely mediocre (CRITICAL CONDITION), his Reagan-Bush output didn't produce anything decent until he reteamed with Gene Wilder for 1989's SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL (which, granted, was no classic). MOVING wasn't his worst movie, but it certainly didn't help his career. Playing a meek suburbanite, Pryor's raw comedic persona was castrated with a silly name (Arlo Pear???) and a bland, inoffensive script. Watch him in this movie and note how defeated he appears. In a decade Pryor went from STIR CRAZY and BLUE COLLAR to a feature-length sitcom that could have starred anybody.That's not to say MOVING is without merits. It provided Dana Carvey with his funniest role that didn't co-star Mike Myers, and Randy Quaid (a good actor who can do comedy as opposed to a good comedian) earns a lot of laughs here in a dual role. But the efforts of the supporting cast are wasted by a script that should have gone through more re-writes. A comedy about moving your family across the country could find a lot of humor in the small but countless frustrations that can happen when undertaking such a challenge. Instead of wringing laughs from human foibles, here we've got stupid professional movers who do things to be funny, therefore making what they do unfunny. That old guy wrapping every toy separately? The other guys breaking furniture and taking a side trip to New Orleans? It's dumb, and not believable, and not funny. (However, Carvey acts like he's in a whole 'nother--and better--comedy. I gotta admit his shtick in drag was hilarious.)The movie has structural problems too. It spends half the movie packing their things and dealing with the slob neighbor, and -- bam! -- it jumps to the family's new home. What happened during the 3000-mile drive to get there? Did the kids get on the parent's nerves while cooped up in the back seat the whole time? Surely there are possible cross-country mishaps that weren't already explored in NAT'L LAMPOON'S VACATION, right? (One minor thing. What road did they take out of Jersey? They're on some blacktop with a sign stating they're leaving the Garden State. Um, don't they have to cross the Delaware River to enter Pennsylvania?)And I wonder if a black family from Jersey would assimilate so easily in suburban Idaho. Since anybody could have been cast in the role, was this movie written with Pryor in mind? Doesn't seem so, since this family is white in every way except skin color. Their closest friends are an elderly white couple, and their daughter, played by Stacey Dash, appears to have blue eyes (leading me to believe she should have been cast instead as a Wannabe in Spike Lee's SCHOOL DAZE). Forgive me for raising racial issues in a lightweight '80s comedy, but wouldn't this affluent black family from the East Coast have any reservations about relocating to Aryan Nation? A 1990 census shows that Idaho was over 94% Caucasian while Blacks made up less than one percent around the time the movie was made. (American Indians, at 1.3%, were more represented.) Wouldn't this have been a factor in their decision to move there? Finally, for a movie that's barely ninety minutes long, MOVING coughs and wheezes to the closing credits. It somehow feels both overlong and too short, if that makes sense. And there's a chase scene to wrap things up. A chase scene to end a bad comedy? What else is new?

A 1990 census shows that Idaho was over 94% Caucasian while Blacks made up less than one percent around the time the movie was made. (American Indians, at 1.3%, were more represented.) Wouldn't this have been a factor in their decision to move there? Finally, for a movie that's barely ninety minutes long, MOVING coughs and wheezes to the closing credits. It somehow feels both overlong and too short, if that makes sense. And there's a chase scene to wrap things up. A chase scene to end a bad comedy? What else is new?

What's sadder in the case of all three films is they waited so many years inbetween films that they couldn't even use the same actors. The same bastian\/atreyu\/child-like empress in a two part film would have made far more sense then the huge gap between I and II that made the actors too old too come back. But even with that, they age Bastian up, aged his father down, and, I believe, age the child-like Empress who shouldn't have aged at all.The best thing that can be said about NeS II is it was loads better than NeS III, though forced to re-cast it still tried to hold onto the spirit of the original characters. The problem was NeS I & II should have been a two part film made with the same actors. Because for the second half of the book he didn't come 'home', he went right into the 'Fantasia' portion of the story.

If you are a history nut and don't like the way Scorsese has presented his characters then try and look at it the way it presents itself as a film.  Willem Dafoe is excellent and is up there as the best of the actors that have portrayed Jesus over the last fifty years of film.   David Bowie was sadly miss cast as was Keitel but Barbara Hershey is nothing more than outstanding as Mary Magdalene in the darkest portrayal of her yet.  This is what The Passion lacked in the story of the relationship between Jesus and Mary but Passion is not about Jesus' life, it's about his death and that's where these two films are different.  Scorsese's version is more about love and temptation and the things that make us feel good and bad about ourselves whether we are doing the right thing or not.   Jesus has sexual feelings for Mary in this and he probably did really.  I mean I am not one to start a debate on whether he did or not but Jesus was still a human being but a human being with a special gift but why should that make him any different to other people.  His message was love and love was what he felt so why not love Mary.  I am not saying that he definitely did but what is so wrong if he did.  Why should we waist our time and make over one thousand complaints to Channel 4 in the UK all because a film based on a novel by                     Nikos Kazantzakis suggested that Jesus had desirable feelings for a woman.   I am sure somebody can argue with me on that and tell me something I don't know but it's important to remember who were are and to remember that because people have gifts doesn't make them different as a human being.   Because Albert Einstein had some amazing inventions does it make him a better person than me because he has a knack for coming up with new and inventive inventions.  Not really but Jesus is the son of God supposedly so who am I to argue but we have been made to believe that by what we read.

We then fast-forward four years and we hear Jack Lemmon at a podium in front of a big crowd, this time conceding to his opponent and giving a speech, obviously a lie, about how much confidence he has in his opponent to run the country. We start to think the movie is about to settle down, but before we get to know any more about the characters, we're fast forwarded 4 years, where Garner's character Matt Douglas has just lost to Kramer's former vice-president (Akroyd), and if that's not a long enough introduction, we fast-forward 3 more years we finally begin to settle in, and after the movie has given us enough motion sickness, we see Kramer and Douglas, feeling nostalgic and unfulfilled about their mediocre administations. When you think about it, it's nothing more than a midlife crisis. After that, however things kind of get confusing. Haney frames Kramer for a fraud as a way for the administration to defer blame.

As long as the film either makes a profit, however small, or is enough of a tax write-off to keep the producers afloat, the sequels will keep on a-coming. In some cases, such as X-Men 2 or Aliens, this is a good thing. However, they are a small minority that prove the rule, regardless of their excellence in themselves.Horror franchises are the worst offenders in this regard. It's not so surprising when you consider that horror is a difficult genre to make work, and that no writer wants to be associated with a horror film that fell flat (what's the writer of Halloween III up to lately?). There are, of course, only so many different ways one can kill people before it becomes blasé, so to speak. But, as recent films like Ringu or its American equivalent have shown, Hollywood can get significantly more original with its horror than it has tried for most of the last twenty years.The original Halloween, much like the original A Nightmare On Elm Street or the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was a novel concept that brought something new to the genre. In the case of Halloween, that something new was a silent killer who at times seemed more sane than his doctor. Of course, it also helped blow the number of murders committed by the mentally ill way out of proportion in the mind of the public, but it also exploits the fact that the extremely mentally ill are much more creative (Ed Gein, for example).The Halloween franchise should never have made it past the second episode. Where the first episode spent time creating an atmosphere and set up characters one cared about, the second episode could be summed up with hey, bimbo, try power-walking, he'll never catch you that way. The worst part is that every episode since could be summed up in exactly the same manner. The fifth film made an abortive attempt to restore this tension, but failed.Fast forward to film number eight, and the best idea that the writers can come up with is sticking a mob of dopey twenty-somethings into the Myers house as part of a reality TV show. Not only is this a creative vacuum, it also opens up a million plot holes. For one thing, if the street that the Myers house is located on is still part of a residental zone, one has to wonder why the house hasn't simply been torn down and either had another house built on it, or been replaced by a small park. Another big plot problem is the stupidity of the cast. A murderer taking so long to dispose of a body, dragging a video camera all the while, is just begging to be caught.There's also a big problem with cinematography. One would have thought that if the idea of resolutions lower than 35mm film in theatres hadn't been firmly killed by cinematic turds like Blair Christian Project, it certainly has been buried by the likes of Baise-Moi or Attack Of The Clones. A signifcant portion of the film is seen through the eyes of web cameras, however, and the abrupt transitions between the formats do not make for a pleasant viewing experience.This is to say nothing of the fact that in spite of trying to make the film more now (did I mention the poorly-research pop-psychology subtexts?), the plot essentially boils down to Michael Myers shows up in Haddonfield, kills a bunch of random strangers, someone 'kills' him, the end. Not exactly what I would call even slightly creative. Compare this with Ringu's ending, and it is easy to see why American horror films are so derided, even in their country of origin.I am not surprised in the slightest that the rating for this film is 4.4 out of ten. As I sit and watch it now, I don't think of how creative or interesting the story is, as I did with parts one and three.

When Thandie Newton says to Mark Wahlberg in THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!, it is a relatively meaningless piece of dialogue, because, even though Wahlberg is apparently a nice guy and pretty good actor, he is no Cary Grant, and his character has done nothing to garner such praise. But then again, Newton is no Hepburn. And CHARLIE is certainly no CHARADE.CHARADE is one of the most pleasing pieces of fluff that Hollywood has ever made. Despite a notable body count and a few suspenseful moments, the film is really a romantic comedy. Despite its intricate plot of double crosses, fake identities and a mad search for some missing loot in a picture-postcard Paris, it is designed to amuse. It is Hitchcock-lite; as directed by Stanley Donen, a man best known for directing films like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the film also is constructed like a musical, stringing together a few remarkable set pieces with a silly plot and clever banter. But most of all, CHARADE is an excuse to pair up Grant and Hepburn, two experts in the field of romantic comedy. If ever a film were personality driven it is CHARADE, which sports not just pros Grant and Hepburn, but a batch of gifted character actors such as Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Nobody would ever mistake CHARADE for great filmmaking, but as sprightly comedy tinged with dark humor it is hard to beat.But for some inexplicable reason it was remade in 2002 as the rather blandly named THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. I can only assume that the filmmakers realized that there was no way they could equal the wit and style of the original -- not to mention the difficulty in finding contemporary stars comparable to Hepburn and Grant -- so they opted to play the film more or less straight. That may have made sense if the plot of the original was anything to be taken seriously. But remaking a comedy-thriller as just a thriller and stripping it of its Hollywood gloss for a gritty realistic look really does not make a lot of sense. Add to that some ill-conceived politically correct updating -- a dash of lesbianism, a bit of feminism (the police detective is now a woman) and a multiethnic cast -- and the style and the content of the film seem mismatched. Jonathan Demme, a director who once showed a knack for making light and quirky comedies like HANDLE WITH CARE and MELVIN AND HOWARD, now makes mostly dark and dreary dramas like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. He has become a serious filmmaker in the worst sense of the word.The film might still have been above average with proper casting, but the best that can be said for Wahlberg and Newton is that they are okay, but they never come off as a romantic couple. Certainly the sparkling chemistry of Grant and Hepburn is missing, but then the film never even tried for that tone in the first place. Only Tim Robbins, taking on the Walter Matthau role, seems to remember that the source material for the film was a comedy.As is, CHARLIE is a perfectly competent and perfectly forgettable little thriller.

Despite its intricate plot of double crosses, fake identities and a mad search for some missing loot in a picture-postcard Paris, it is designed to amuse. It is Hitchcock-lite; as directed by Stanley Donen, a man best known for directing films like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the film also is constructed like a musical, stringing together a few remarkable set pieces with a silly plot and clever banter. But most of all, CHARADE is an excuse to pair up Grant and Hepburn, two experts in the field of romantic comedy. If ever a film were personality driven it is CHARADE, which sports not just pros Grant and Hepburn, but a batch of gifted character actors such as Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Nobody would ever mistake CHARADE for great filmmaking, but as sprightly comedy tinged with dark humor it is hard to beat.But for some inexplicable reason it was remade in 2002 as the rather blandly named THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. I can only assume that the filmmakers realized that there was no way they could equal the wit and style of the original -- not to mention the difficulty in finding contemporary stars comparable to Hepburn and Grant -- so they opted to play the film more or less straight. That may have made sense if the plot of the original was anything to be taken seriously. But remaking a comedy-thriller as just a thriller and stripping it of its Hollywood gloss for a gritty realistic look really does not make a lot of sense. Add to that some ill-conceived politically correct updating -- a dash of lesbianism, a bit of feminism (the police detective is now a woman) and a multiethnic cast -- and the style and the content of the film seem mismatched. Jonathan Demme, a director who once showed a knack for making light and quirky comedies like HANDLE WITH CARE and MELVIN AND HOWARD, now makes mostly dark and dreary dramas like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. He has become a serious filmmaker in the worst sense of the word.The film might still have been above average with proper casting, but the best that can be said for Wahlberg and Newton is that they are okay, but they never come off as a romantic couple. Certainly the sparkling chemistry of Grant and Hepburn is missing, but then the film never even tried for that tone in the first place. Only Tim Robbins, taking on the Walter Matthau role, seems to remember that the source material for the film was a comedy.As is, CHARLIE is a perfectly competent and perfectly forgettable little thriller. But that is not enough to make it anything more than just a dour stepchild of a minor classic.

The young black man, understanding of the racial tension associated with intermarriage, tells the in-laws-to-be that he will only marry their daughter if both of their parents approve without any hesitation. Poitier, as always, comes off as noble. While he loves their daughter, he understands the limitations and boundaries of his skin color and with a sort of feudalistic sense of morals, he must set the feelings of the girl's father above those of his own.  The film, taking place almost entirely in the San Fransisco home of the parents in the span of one afternoon, is pretty simplistic in its structure but it draws the audience into the central focus of the movie, and when that is something as provoking and controversial as intermarriage, in 1967, it's worth watching. Some of the scenes, like when Tracy's character orders the wrong flavor of ice cream but ends up liking it, as a metaphor for the entire movie, while a bit obvious is kind of cute. That's how the movie works, it's highly focused, it's not subtle it sends the message loud and clear, the cast is small, every character is there to represent some point of view on this marriage and all are highly conscious, in terms of making a statement, the movie no doubt accomplishes that goal, and many movies do fail at that. However, in terms of story, the movie wears a little thin. The movie failed to keep me engaged into what was happening, partly because very little was happening. This movie relies too heavily on star quality and interesting dialogue to push its way through a couple of hours. The movie is like an escalator, the opening montage shows the love-struck couple making their way joyfully through the airport to pick up their bags and into her house, where she is greeted by her mother. Joey tells her mother about the man she's in love with but refrains to mention two things that she bought the man home and that she's a Negro. Joey, who is portrayed as giddy and careless, then sends her mother into shock when she discovers these two things. The same thing happens over and over as the  tensions build up toward a climax where Mr Drayton, who's been kicked around all day gives a dazzling speech in which he bring out into the open every single unsettling thing and threatening comment he has heard that day and announces his decision to give his daugher his blessing.  That speech was the movie's most memorable scene in the movie because of the parallels to back-door attitude of race in this country, and moreso because we're rooting for Mr Drayton. In my mind, Tracy delivers the standout performance of the film. Poitier and Hepburn are two of the greatest legends ever to grace a screen, but Poitier just played Poitier and Hepburn gave us Hepburn. It was Tracy, who was giving us something unexpected. He seemed to be the only complex character in the movie who was grounded more in reality than a set of racial stereotypes.

Tarleton was not the near-satanic presence that Tavington embodies, in fact quite the opposite. It's safe to say that if the boyish Tarleton, and not Jeb Stuart, had been commanding Lee's cavalry at Gettysburg, he would not have been dashing about stealing wagons instead of shadowing the Union army. The outcome of the battle, not to mention history, might well have been different. Still, the Tavington character is the one element in the film that really resonates.

Superman, to me as a child was IT. This beautiful movie struck me so hard I watched it over and over again.....I surely hope they don't remake this, WHO is superman if not Christopher Reeve? This may sound nuts to some, but I think this should be in the IMDb top 250. There isn't one boring moment in this movie and the older one grows the more timeless this movie stays. Everything was done so well, I couldn't get it out of my head as a child. Superman and it's incredibly beautiful haunting music may have made me a movie lover.I have yet to see a major motion picture superhero movie that comes close to this.

The longer it's going on the more confusing it gets. And somewhere after the mexican woman performing on stage the movie lost the battle against the fast forward button. I found the movie to be too slow paced and some scenes seemed to have nothing to do with the story really. Well, why watch these odd stage performances for nearly 10 minutes if they are not actually saying anything? This movie is certainly not in my taste. Yes, I guess my precoded male genome found certain scenes to be of a very primitive interest... but that is not what makes a good movie or makes me vote for it one way or the other.  Everything was slow! The actors were slow, the scenes were slow, the plot\/story was slow... Then also, I just didn't get a lot of the stuff that was going on later... maybe it's the fast forward buttons fault, but anyway. Before I started pressing that button, the movie had hardly built up to anything anyway, so how would something be able to come out of that almost nothing anyway?To make it short It lost me big time when I lost interest. This an odd movie. Artistic but odd and if you only feel slightly as confused as I do, don't be afraid to admit it, because I guess there are a lot of people who don't dare saying other than that this was a great movie, just because it is hard (if at all possible) to make sense of it.If you like mystic odd movies I'd much rather recommend that you watch Brazil, which really is an odd masterpiece!

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"24 April 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The middle section and niftiest of the Man With No Name trilogy starring Clint Eastwood, For A Few Dollars More is the breakpoint where the series jumps from effective revenge drama into more ethereal, epic territory. If it's not as great as the third film, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, it's still one of the most brilliant westerns, spaghetti or otherwise, ever made.The plot this time is more convoluted than it was the first time out, in A Fistful Of Dollars. A bounty hunter who goes by the name Monco (Eastwood) gets on the trail of a crazed killer named Indio (Gian Maria Volante) and his gang, only to find another bounty hunter, Col. Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), is just as close, and even more intent on collecting the reward for Indio's demise.The mood of the spaghetti western, that of a world where life being cheap except for those who collect money for taking it, is firmly established early on, where we witness a seemingly random killing during the opening credits, followed by several more courtesy of Monco and the Colonel. Monco at least seems willing to try to take his prey back alive, whereas the Colonel is less fussy. Director Sergio Leone made an effective vehicle with Fistful Of Dollars, one that launched Eastwood as a major star, but it is here he begins to make the case for a complex vision of the western as an existential stage for man's villainy, glory, and doom all at once.Calling it a spaghetti western makes it sound cheap. Sure, it's Italian, but if you have to note the country of origin, wouldn't it be better to call it a horse opera? The long, drawn-out pauses that establish mood, the way different parts create their own tone which meld seamlessly into the next, the complications in the unfolding of the narrative that set up exciting alternatives to audience expectations, the sense of divine judgment in a world where the existence of divinity itself seems in question, and finally that incredible Morricone score (much more diversified than we heard in Fistful, with some recognizable melodies and nice use of off-tones like the harmonica and that everpresent Jew's harp) all point to something with the heft and scale of Verdi. It's a western unlike anything that came before.Another welcome development is the humor. We got bits of that in Fistful, like Clint's reaction when he slugs a woman by mistake, but here there's some sections where the audience is encouraged to laugh even as the foreboding, alien mood of death and grief is being established. Like Manco's brief moment with the old man, Prophet, which has some nice eye-rolling from the tight-faced gunman; and the memorable match-lighting moments between Van Cleef and a nasty little hunchback played by Klaus Kinski. (Sauerkraut western?) Even Indio cracks wise on occasion, as when Cuchillo discovers where his knife went. That shouldn't be there, should it? he asks, almost innocently, though with appropriate menace.There are some logic gaps in the storyline, though they are not as distracting on repeat viewings as the ones in Fistful. Volante has some effective moments as Indio, but then he goes over the top in other scenes. I think letting him wear the Adam Ant eyeliner in prison was a mistake, and so is an odd section of Morricone's score early on where he throws in some Dracula organ music. These are quibbles, and not enough for me to deny that it's my favorite Leone western. But taking a broader view, it's not as good as The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, with the important insertion of Tuco's character, the Civil War backdrop, and a more effective and deliberate focus on the role of God in such a world as this. But if few movies of any kind are as good as `The Good, Bad, And Ugly,' this is a stirring establishment of the themes that film would work very hard and well at resolving.The best thing in this film is the relationship between Eastwood's character and Van Cleef's. It's a dance of distrust, and as much as Monco sets himself up as the antagonist, you have to wonder what the preternaturally poised Col. Mortimer has up his sleeve. Is he really playing it the way he says? Clearly he has some hidden motive, and given Van Cleef's sinister, devil-like visage, so effectively set up in the early scenes, you can't really blame Monco for his suspicions. All this is in the way of setting up one of the most satisfying resolutions in any western, where Leone makes his case for a director worthy of John Ford's heavy mantle.Has it really been 40 years since this came out? Funny this was the offspring of a Kurosawa imitation, since as a '60s icon, the No Name trilogy has become imitated on a scale second only to the Beatles. Tarantino, Scorsese, Raimi, the list goes on. As was said of the famed architect Christopher Wren, if you want to see Sergio Leone's memorial, just look around.
