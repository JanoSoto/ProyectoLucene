[{"date":"16 September 2012","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Arlington Road is escapism for the mentally challenged. This is so obviously contrived it is bordering on ludicrous. The central characters are card board cut outs and behave like the characters in Thunderbirds. Jeff Bridges (a good actor...normally) gives us a way over the top lesson on how to be a highly anxious and concerned professor. Finding holes in the story is as easy as finding toxic waste when you go fishing. After 10 minutes you pretty well know how its going to turn out. Its always sad when the best I can say about a movie is....well at least they had a go. Perhaps they really did have a target audience in mind when they made this. I sure am glad i don't belong in that group.
