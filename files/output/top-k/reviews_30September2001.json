I read through the negative comments, and I see how people didn't get it- it sounds like they all came in with pretty lofty expectations. Rushmore delivers in every way, but it's a very quirky movie. There are so many wonderful subtle moments- like when Mr. Blume realizes that Max has put bees in his hotel room. His look goes from admiration, to amusement, to pure anger in about 3 seconds. And notice how Dirk Calloway is sweeping up cocaine after the 'Serpico' play is over. Or how about the time when Max's dad is getting him out of jail, and the guard hands him his shoelaces (so he wouldn't hang himself). Max says can you drop me off at school, Dad? I have to get a teacher fired. Max's dad says I wouldn't recommend that, Max. Or the scene where Max goes to the hospital to visit Dr. Guggenheim, who is in a coma. Max hands Mrs. Guggenheim some flowers, but they look like a bunch of weeds. Mrs. Guggenheim replies These are glorious! There are so many of these moments, but as you can see they are things that you may miss the first time you watch it. I myself thought the movie was so so, I didn't really get it either when I saw it in the theater. But then I saw it on video, and I really liked it, then I got the Criterion DVD, and fell in love with it. So is this still my litmus test movie? Yeah, I think it is.

I saw the sneak preview of this movie in the theatre and at the time I remember my friend and I making the obvious jokes like, This movie blows, tee, hee, hee. For some reason this kind of dull wit seemed appropriate, something George and his Boston chums would find funny. And that really seems to me to be the crux of the biscuit. I mean, c'mon, are we supposed to take ol' Georgie boy seriously? Are we really supposed to feel for him? See him as a victim? Well, yes. He's the party boy who gets busted, an opportunist and a business man, a father and a criminal. Demme, Cassavetes and McKenna do a good job of glamorizing George then stripping him of his glamor. But this never breaks his will. Consequently, we empathize with George. Sure he's a bad guy, but he seems loving to his family, friends and the women in his life. This makes him noble in character, though fallen. Comments have been made that Goodfellas and Scarface are better films in this genre. This may be true sometimes, but what makes George Jung different from Tony Montana is his refusal to turn savage. Whether this has anything to do with the real George Jung is arguable. But certainly the movie portrays George as a cool headed, driven businessman who never turns to acts of violence. Montana, on the other hand, goes through a transformation, descending into an inescapable paranoid madness. What we really don't get from Blow is how cocaine ruined so many lives. I don't want to sound like a say no to drugs campaign here, but the effects of heavy cocaine use haunt us still. George doesn't seem to feel any guilt about the role he's played bringing cocaine into the  lives of so many people. I suppose we could look at his failed marriage and estrangement from his daughter as a model for the consequences of drug involvement, but I don't think it resonates this way. The film I would compare Blow to is dePalma's, Carlito's Way. Carlito is a similar noble character that can't really escape who he is. I think in a way that's what happens to George in Blow. He blows it because he doesn't learn from his experiences and somehow just can't be any different than he is. An interview filmed in prison (on the DVD) with the real George Jung by Ted Demme is interesting, though at times awkward. One moment in particular shows Demme backpedaling after commenting on how he felt meeting George for the first time. What follows is a bit of a*s-kissing on Demme's part and a moment's realization for George that, yes, he is a criminal and an outsider even though his life story was turned into a major Hollywood film. It is an absurd twist on celebrity status. I mean, would we feel the same way about Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, if Hannibal Lector was a real person holed away in a prison somewhere?

While it is by far the most disturbing film of 2000, this movie is thought provoking, intelligent, true-to-life and utterly convincing. I can promise you right now this is a movie you're not going to forget in a while and a movie that is unlike any other drug movie ever put to the silver screen. Requiem for a Dream is so graphic with its violence, adult themes, drug taking and sex it may become a little too much for some people. I was frankly almost sick. So if you're a faint-hearted person I recommend skipping this movie and maybe seeing the equally good The Basketball Diaries. Okay, back to the film. It is one of the best movies of 2000 and has a unique power. As soon as this movie was over I just wanted to go back and see it again. It's official &#150; this is the first movie in history than really properly portrays how heroin and speed and every other drug can dislocate us from ourselves. This movie has been classified as drama but it is really a horror film. It is so realistic, true-to-life and graphic about drugs and how they effect our lives that I was utterly terrified. I will never ever take drugs after seeing Requiem for a Dream and if I ever feel the need to I'll watch the movie and forget all about it. The performances in this movie are absolutely breathtaking. Marlon Wayans is a star and Jennifer Connelly is shocking and great as a girl who will do anything to get something to smoke. Jared Leto is unequally fantastic and by far the best young actor in this gripping movie. However, it is not a surprise that Ellen Burstyn gives the best performance. She is truly terrifying, believable and masterful as Sarah, who is using a dangerous diet and just wants to be on television. This movie has many memorable and terrifying scenes but I will not ruin it for you.

Will it work?Our story starts off in the present day as a grown man named Bobby Garfield learns about the death of a friend.  Arriving at the funeral he asks someone about another friend that all 3 use to do everything with.  Unfortunatly he finds out she had some time ago died as well, and in grief Bobby returns to his old neighbourhood where he grew up to reminisce.  From this point on, the story flashes back to the early 60's where Bobby recalls an old man named Ted Brautigan staying upstairs in his moms house.We soon learn about Bobby's past childhood.  His mom never had time for him, his father died when he was five, and his mother dispised her husband saying he was a gambler and owed her money.  But it seems perhaps his mother's judgments are clouded, since during Bobby's 11th birthday instead of getting the bike he desperatly wants, his mom gets him an adult library card.  She remarks 'We can't afford things like that on my salary' while she continues to spend lavishly on clothes and garments.  It's as if Bobby knows something isn't being told but he doesn't want to know the truth.  After all the library card was free...With the arrival of Ted on the scene Bobby now has a father figure, and the movie shifts toward their relationship.  Nobody knows of Ted's background.  All he asks is that Bobby read him the paper for a dollar a week, and to tell him to keep out for the low-men.  Is he a kook?  Bobby asks what do they look like, and Ted only replies that they drive big cars, and cast long shadows.  Is Ted a criminal? A child predator? Bobby asks if they're FBI or cops and why they would want Ted?  Which Ted only replies, They have something I want.Therein lies the sense of horror uneasy-ness set out like in a King adaptation, but set in a backdrop of childhood nostalgia.  What is it about Ted?  We get a slight glimpse early on when Ted mentions fleetingly (perhaps by accident) to Bobby not to worry about the bike he wants so badly even though Bobby has never mentioned it.  Bobby replies how did you know I wanted a bike? to which only Ted can reply, All boys want bikes.However it soon turns out that their chance meeting is no coincidence, and it is this setup played out as we wonder who Ted is, who are the low-men, what is it that Ted has and what will happen.  The story takes some time to get started along.  The period is captured perfectly, and has great cinematography (alot of it was shot in Virginia Beach and in Virginia) but it takes us the audience a little while to get into the film at its 2+ hour length.  Still, it manages to keep you occupied.  The location shots of the neighborhood house in the 60's fall season past contrasted with the winter delapidated present only prove how brilliant the cinematography really is.Nevertheless, the film takes off at the halfway mark when we soon learn more about who Ted is, and his effect on young Bobby.  After all Ted remarks to Bobby how his friend Carol will be the first girl he will kiss, and while we see young Bobby disgusted by this thought, we can then understand why in the present he is grieving so much.  In life we probably have met older people like Ted, and lost people like Carol. We will never be the same after they are gone and you wish, like Bobby, that your childhood could be around forever.  This is the essence of the 'Heart of Atlantis' and it works wonderfully.  The film has that total 'Green Mile' feel to it, and while slow at the start has an ingenious story and emotional payoff that you don't see coming that hits you with a hammer to the heart, and a smile from ear to ear.

Well, I thought that opinions are not to be discussed, but I got to say this one SHAME ON YOU!!! This movie is one of the best in movie history, I have no doubt, and I can start figuring a why to explain its overlooking by the academy awards and others it is a violent slap in the face of all the people who think they are safe in their monochordic lives, their credit cards, their stable jobs and their month paychecks, which are used for owning things which end up owning ourselves. The philosophy of the movie is brutal, and never before seen in a movie made in USA grounds. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt turn out establishing themselves as two of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen, and David Fincher leaves us drooling for his next feature. This movie will stagger even the most coldly hearted, as it depicts the life of a character whose name we don't know (not until the end, that is), who we know just by the name of Jack, and who lives a more than normal live shirts, kakis, ties, a desk job, a nice paycheck and his nights spent decorating his house and seeing the tv-shopping. Jack has a problem he can't sleep. He will find the cure for this problem, but he will also find lots of other things. I can guarantee it, you have never seen anything like this movie, and never miss out the first 30 minutes, which have a frenetic rhythm to go with Jack's first-person point of view of his life before his problems. I thought that Se7en was one of my favorite movies. It still is, but it isn't alone. The fact that both movies come from the same director, it means a lot - it means that David Fincher is a powerhouse director who has a lot to give, and from who we may expect great and landmark-ish things from the future.

I thought it was one of his best pieces of writing. When I heard that it was being made into a film, I had thoughts that this film could be like STAND BY ME, a wonderful mystical tale of childhood friendship in the 60's with sly under-tones of terror and bittersweet enough to deliver a moral ending of understanding. Boy was I wrong.This piece of crap is a total disgrace to Stephen King's book of the same title and I recommend that everyone who saw this movie should read the book as well.Scott Hicks (SHINE and SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS) sugar-coats this tale with picture-book scenery and shots of Maine that look just splendid. The people here who need to be slapped back into reality are the screen-writers and whoever else that tampered with Stephen King's original work to adjust it for the big screen.The book centered on Bobby, Carol and John. Their childhood friendship was the basis of the story and their almost-magical bonding was what held the stories together. Stephen King explored their friendship and the different turns their lives took once Ted Brautigan is introduced into the story. Ted Brautigan is examined as a somewhat mysterious character, but a character you cared about and wanted to know more about when you discover his 'special power'. Stephen King placed dark under-tones into his tale with the introduction of the 'low men' who were after Ted and the suggestion that they almost seemed 'not of this world'. Bobby's mother is portrayed as a purely evil woman, an unreasonable pathetic character that you can't help but tread on egg-shells around every time you read her entering a scene.Stephen King further explores the gifts that Ted Brautigan helps Bobby to master, his psychic abilities and the friendship the two share. After Ted has been captured by the 'low men', Stephen King further explores the three friends as they grow up, in both college AND as adults and how the events they witnessed as children have effected their lives today. We discover the history leading to the deaths of both Carol and John, and the sentimental value placed on the baseball glove that Bobby receives in the mail once John has passed away.Is any of this featured in the movie though? ABSOLUTELY NOT. This movie is ridiculously sugar-coated with confusing pap that it would make the average viewer dig their fingers into the arm-rest of the chair that they are sitting in.Anthony Hopkins was entirely the wrong choice to play Ted Brautigan in this movie. In the book, I saw Ted as a man in his 40's. Here, it's an old man teaching a young boy new tricks. Bobby's mother is as tame as can be. Yes, she wasn't very likeable in the movie, but she wasn't half as evil as her character was portrayed in the book. The final scenes in the film show Bobby and his mother laughing together as they drive off in the car, a bike tied to the roof. I was thinking to myself, Why didn't the producers just have Bobby and his mother skipping off down the street into a rainbow? You would hardly even notice that John even existed in the film - he is shown in about two scenes of the film, and Bobby's friendship with Carol is only portrayed as 'puppy love', something that was handled more seriously in the novel.When David Morse (who portrays the 'older' Bobby) starts narrating again at the end of the film after he introduces himself to Carol's daughter while revisiting his childhood home, I was thinking There's no way that this could be the end of the film, and then the credits appeared. The film itself ran for about an hour and 45 minutes and we learned nothing of the characters. When Anthony Hopkins is taken away in the car by a group of average-looking men, no one in the audience really cared. This was a character who we wanted to shed a tear for in the book when he is taken away in front of Bobby. Here, he disappears from a diner instead of the bar where he collects his gambling 'winnings'.This film did not know what it wanted to deliver. Instead, it decided to settle on beautiful scenery and heartfelt scenes that try to tug at the heart and that for the most part, wins over the female audience. If anyone who read the book saw this travesty, they would be throwing popcorn at the screen.Personally, I think Stephen King should stop selling his novels for screen-plays. Until Hollywood can get it right, they have no right to meddle and tamper with things they have no idea what to do with.This film gets a huge thumbs down from me.

Good direction, interesting cinematography, effective incidental music. The acting, while good, wasn't as impressive as most critics seemed to think. Kevin spacey appeared to be reprising his role from The Ref, a movie Annette Bening seemed to have watched for pointers from Judy Davis. One can find performances of this quality in any good television drama.But when the clever surface is stripped away, what remains is a string of more 60's countercultural clichés than any single movie has strung together in quite a while. We have Hollywood's standard picture of suburbia, with trim lawns and expensive furniture hiding a maelstrom of perversion and misery. (I live in suburbia, and don't know people like this.) There is the henpecked Dad (Spacey), who works in the movies' ultimate symbol of phoniness, advertising. His wife (Bening) is in real estate sales, in a town where the housing market is dominated by a handsome but shallow, money-grubbing capitalist and womanizer. The only real human characters are their geeky, sensitive daughter and the geeky, sensitive boy next door, with whom the movie's sympathies obviously lie. And what does the boy do to finance his postmodern works of video art? He sells pot, and lies to his father about virtually everything. But that's okay, Dad is an ex-Marine who loves guns, collects Nazi memorabilia, beats his son, drives his long-suffering wife to insanity, and hates fags. Of course, he really is a fag--we all know homophobia is just a mask for latent homosexuality. As to guns, they are naturally only of interest to nut cases with sex problems, including Real Estate Mom, who is driven to obsessive target shooting by the end of the movie. And in a way, the movie revolves around the daughter's best friend, the canonical cheerleader who seduces her friend's Dad, and otherwise wallows in sluttiness.How does Dad transcend this, get his life back, and become a truly sympathetic character? By smoking dope with the kid next door, blackmailing his boss, getting a new job flipping burgers, buying the Camaro he always wanted, and basically turning on, tuning in, and dropping out.This all would have worked had it been satire, and I suppose some might claim that it is, but it didn't come across that way to me.

Of course, he really is a fag--we all know homophobia is just a mask for latent homosexuality. As to guns, they are naturally only of interest to nut cases with sex problems, including Real Estate Mom, who is driven to obsessive target shooting by the end of the movie.

The director, Michael Cuesta (who implausibly cowrote the screenplay with two other people--and the picture still feels amateurishly underwritten) is reported to be married with kids. I wonder what the wife and kids made of the scene in which the teen-boy hero accompanies his pretty-boy friend on a break-and-enter spree, and the pretty boy, entranced by his stolen swag, puts on a string of pearls and a fur coat, sexily putting a Shhh! finger to his lips. (Lot 49 Films, the movie's distributor, knew well enough to make this image the cornerstone of their trailer--which is in every sense smarter than the movie.) Or how about the ostensibly straight boy hero's pining for his mom--which expresses itself in his putting on lipstick? (He even knows enough to make a lip-smacking Mwwaah! to stick it on correctly.) Or what about the wrestling tussle that turns into a near-love scene? Cuesta seems clueless about what he's making, and the tone he's setting. I suspect he genuinely thinks this is a gritty after-school special. Instead, it comes across as un-self-aware Larry Clark.The rave reviews--indeed, the theatrical release--of this movie are a mystery; the movie is so ineptly written and directed there seems to be nothing in it of interest, except for pederasts. And the British actor Brian Cox, who won performance-of-a-lifetime raves in Deborah Warner's production of TITUS ANDRONICUS, doesn't do himself any favors as the kindly, fatherly paedophile Big John. Implausible as an American and as a Marine, Cox is so creepy from the get-go that part of the movie's point--the ability of predators like Big John to fit in--gets lost. And the putative subject of the movie, the oddly chaste and tender friendship that develops between Big John and the hero, takes up about five minutes of screen time--less than is given over to the movie's vealcake shots.Much of the movie is bafflingly bush-league. The hero's dad (Bruce Altman) gets hauled away by the Feds, but no one bothers to look in on his kid; he just gets to hang out on his own, unsupervised.

It has the atmosphere of a classic detective thriller. First of all, it is a sequel to Kiss the Girls.(Which is often forgotten by many). It's a sequel that stands on it's own,(like such not considered sequels as U.S. Marshals,and Hannibal just to name a couple)which is why I like it. It does it's own thing, rather than proceeding to take off where it's predecessor left off. I really don't want to ruin anything for you so I'll just say this.GOOD qualities Morgan Freeman delivers another good Alex Cross performance The rest of the cast is good The suspense is top quality And there's a Surprise Plot twist! (You'll never see it coming) It's not too long and over drawn like Kiss the Girls(Don't get me wrong Kiss the Girls was awesome, just a tad bit long)BAD qualities You can tell the opening action sequence is CGI(But it still is a good action sequence) Jay O. Sanders is back(He was in Kiss the Girls too) but for only 2 minutes The deleted moments of the film were deleted,but why? They were good!(I had seen them in the theatrical trailer)So Along Came a Spider gets a 9\/10, ****1\/2 out of *****, 92% out of 100%, A- from an A+, Very GoodP.S. Not considered sequels usually have the best character from the predecessor and don't need a number to indicate that they're sequels! They really don't need their predecessor to be good or even be possible. These movies could be possible even if predecessors didn't come out!

Tss. Doctors would diagnose me as a naive romantic, and, indeed, this is exactly the film for me and any other courtly love adoring pathological melancholic (note I also like Zeffirelli's 1968 Romeo and Juliet and even Hugh Hudson's 1984 Greystoke Tarzan film(!) - I even, pardon me Lord, sat through Titanic and actually liked it, though Di Caprio was way too young).But it's hard to get to the crying point, especially since, as it has been abundantly pointed out by others, the soundtrack is mindbogglingly bad. Especially the up-beat pop tune with which the film opens (I mean, Christ, what was the point of making a mysterious opening if it was going to be spoiled by such a score?) Then it becomes clear we're in the middle of the eighties here, you know, that era where more aerobic videos got sold\/hired than regular films. They obviously wanted to make this more of a film for a teenage audience that had gotten used to The Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire and other stronzo. And it returns again and again! Especially the action scenes (during the first half) get utterly ruined by it, though their fairy-tale aspect gets strengthened. These are the ruined scenes Philippe's escape from the moment he falls in the water, his & Navarre's first fight with the Bishop's soldiers at the inn, the fight at the village where Ladyhawke gets wounded, and some scenes in between.What made me cry, then? First, the beautiful images! Astonishingly, for a story in which day and night ar so essential, you are very often left wondering when it is exactly dark or when it is light. You might see this as a flaw, but no. It's caused by the very efficient use of colour lenses, blue during several 'night' scenes, though I think they were filmed during daytime, and orange\/sepia\/red during the most of the day scenes. It makes the trees look aflame, and puts a magical atmosphere over the whole film. See it in widescreen and a pristine copy, or else you'll lose a lot of the visual quality.The second tear-provoking element was... well... the soundtrack. The main theme, though successfully destroyed in the opening track, is simply beautiful, and summarizes the hope pouring out of this film (here goes the romantic...). At several crucial points in the film, this wonderfully melancholic tune comes in, springing from a more dark, brooding theme.The third reason were the actors. Though the acting might not have been perfect (good fantasy does not necessarily require that - see Conan), the casting was! Hauer is a wonderfully heroic Etienne de Navarre, and Michelle Pfeiffer, with her unworldly overwhelming beauty was the ideal Isabeau d'Anjou. She was 27 at the time, and combined with her relatively short-cut hair (also see Into The Night from the same year, fans!) she is just THE princess for whom we all want to get on our horse and fight the bad guy. The real charm of the film comes from the duo Broderick\/McKern, who add exactly the playful quality which makes the drama stand out and not slide off into cheap, implausible, heavy melancholy. Apparently they still didn't think that was enough, hence the soundtrack... John Wood gives us a lovely caricature of the evil Bishop - the man breathes evil.The fourth reason was the happy ending. I'm a sucker for happy endings. A good film seems pointless to me if there isn't a happy ending to it. Don't misunderstand me Romeo and Juliet also has a happy ending (they both die, so no one's left to mourn the other). I don't mean the traditional Hollywood happy ending is really my cup of tea.

One of the things that makes this film so intriguing is that it could have been made at any time. I mean, just from watching it, you can't really tell when it was made. It has been one of my favorite films for almost 20 years now, and it wasn't until today that I actually realized when it was made. Watching it again last night, I had convinced myself that it was made sometime in the early to mid 80s, and I was shocked to find out that this year is the movie's 30 year anniversary. Until now, pretty much the only movie I associate with 1971 is A Clockwork Orange, and it's just strange for some reason to find out that this classic movie was made so long ago.At any rate, Willy Wonka is a tremendously imaginative and inspiring film. It's a family film, but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes- the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence `family' film. On the other hand, this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience, like Cats & Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well, and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids (funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets&#133;) who were at this candy factory, and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory. One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and, even more, the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made, rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films (hey, some of them are really good&#133;). There are, of course, some exceptions, such as `Cheer up, Charlie,' which I have been fast-forwarding through for as long as I can remember, but for the most part, the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candy-making genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory, but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life (`Anything you want to, do it. Want to change the world, there's nothing to it&#133;'), but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable, such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat (curiously named `Wonkatania'), which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later. The dialogue in the film contains some of the most interesting little tidbits in the entire movie. Wonka's lines, in particular, are wonderfully strange and amusing (`A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men.'). He is a truly eccentric and fascinating man, and Gene Wilder captures the character flawlessly, as he delivers the lines from the brilliantly written script. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare movies that comes along and completely changes the way that fantasy films are made. It's all about having fun in life and being hopeful against all odds and, most of all, being able to have fun in life. There are times when you have to let things go for a while and just act like a kid. Eat candy, run around and play, steal fizzy lifting drinks and bump into the ceiling that now has to be washed and sterilized, it doesn't matter as long as no one's looking. That's such a trivial little quirk of Wonka's (who sterilizes their ceiling?) that it becomes obvious that the movie is trying to say that it's okay to break the rules every once in a while. Have fun in life. Besides being absolutely mouth-watering (to this day, I still fantasize about sinking my teeth into one of those gigantic gummy bears), the movie is an uplifting adventure that warms the heart and sends people of all ages away with fairy tale candies dancing in their heads and wonderful songs just behind their lips. It is an always-welcome vacation from reality for people of all ages, and it should always be remembered and loved for that. This movie will ALWAYS be a must-see.

It had a great trailer and has made a gigantic amount of money. I think the movie was a lot like the first Rush Hour, but it had a lot of new ideas and plenty more laughs and action in store. First off, the movie is best if you like Chris Tucker. I really enjoyed his performance and he brought up most of the obvious laughs in the movie. Okay, I'll be honest and say Jackie Chan's humour was much more natural and Tucker did annoy me an itsy-bit in places, but I still enjoyed his performance. Chan, while quite high on laughs, had the best action scenes and kicked some serious butt. The two actors have awesome chemistry and seeing them work together once more is a delight. I also enjoyed Zhang Ziyi's performance, she is still strong and sexy and fresh from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The first Rush Hour had an awesome ending, and all I can say for this movie is exactly the same but more praise. The ending kicked some serious booty! I just loved the whole casino deal and the bomb being in Jackie Chan's mouth provided some serious tension and suspense and lots of awesome action, neat one-liners and tonnes of funny scenes and ideas. Apart from all the funny stuff and sweet as action, the film also had some drama. The back-story to Tucker and Chan's fathers both being killed on the job was not exactly touching but it was a emotional attachment between the two characters and I appreciated it. But, to be completely honest, I didn't care for drama in this movie, I just wanted a laugh-a-minute good time at the flicks and I sure as hell got it! Okay, there were a couple of flaws in the flick, as I said before its a lot the first movie and is not exactly original in storyline but the gags are very new and cool and most importantly, HILARIOUS! I thought the movie was particularly annoying with that lady who we never know is a secret agent or a member of Zhang Ziyi's gang until the end. There wasn't much joy there. However, this movie is still a lot of fun and the bloopers are even better than the big picture itself! You just got to love those bloopers! So, overall, the movie had tonnes of energy, was fun to watch and had me rolling in the aisles! Summer fun if there ever was some!
