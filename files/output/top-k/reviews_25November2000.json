If you thought 6th Sense was worthy of This Year's Best... read another review (though it would be strong this year).It is hard to write a review of this movie w\/out giving too much away. Every little detail is crucial, and understated on so many levels.  David Dunne plays a security guard who survives a train wreck.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Elijah who tries to make him see how he survived the wreck.Anti-action movie is really all you need to summarize the movie.  This means that movie is laboriously slow, like M.Night was paid overtime to shoot this movie, and anti-climatic.  Not to say that the climax was a let-down (the popular definition); but moreover, that the climax did not raise one out of their seat, yet still pounded them over the head, like a 2 ton weight, with realization, much like the 6th Sense did to most viewers. The details are subtle, though very crucial, only the discerning and the sophisticated will be able to appreciate it.  Nonetheless, _Unbreakable_ is very effective in its story-telling, creating a genre all its own.  I cannot think of any movie with which _Unbreakable_ can compare.The biggest problems with the movie is the pace, like I said, and the poor exploration of the climax (i.e the twist - I dislike using that word) in relation to Elijah.  It puts too much effort on the viewer to remember those details (especially w\/the sleep-inducing pace).  _Unbreakable_ could still be effective as the anti-action movie, and anti-climatic, yet still give the viewer twist.

It seems to me that to a certain extent, it ruins the whole moviegoing experience to go into a movie with an idea or theory of what direction the movie should take or what you should see.  Or even what the movie is really about.  Just sit back and enjoy the movie and let it take you on its story. Then, if you will, dissect it after it is through, not during the film.  At least that is my opinion.  This has some bearing of what I think of Unbreakable.  It has received average reviews (though I put NO weight whatsoever into a critic's opinion).  However I have noticed that a lot of the user comments here as well as other places leads me to believe that a lot of people did not understand this movie for anything more than face value.  A lot of moviegoers, too many, have short attention spans and a limited grasp of the movies they see (including the critics).  I will not harp on this or the users any further, but it stands to be said and I am willing to believe I am not the only person with this opinion.This being said, you should expect a lot of symbolism and hidden meaning, with this film being written and produced by Mr. Shyamalan.  You don't quite expect the movie to have a comic book theme, but hopefully you realize it is NOT about comics, as this is just the tool\/vehicle used to carry the story of David Dunn\/Elijah to the audience.  Sadly, most people did not realize this and wonder why the film could not have more action or deal more with the comic book side.  The movie has a slower than usual pace, but if you saw the Sixth Sense (don't try to draw parallels) you figure out this is very deliberate and helps tell the story as it was intended.  Changing the pacing would have risked turning this movie into X-Men, and that is totally not what Unbreakable was intended to be, despite the references.I really enjoyed the movie and recommend it.

Night Shyamalan has again created a wonderful film that is unique and surprising.  Pacing is something Shyamalan pays a lot of attention to and it pays off here just as it did in Sixth Sense.  The story is well thought out with wonderful touches of social commentary that are anything, but preachy.The cinematography and camera work are superb and well matched by the sound design and editing.  The costumes are perfectly real while still putting the characters into the look necessary to represent their place in the heroic cycle that this film represents.  The drama is real, be it harsh, funny, or thought provoking. A great examination of what is a hero.I would say that this film is very in the tradition of Hitchcock; it has a man who doesn't want to be a hero becoming the hero, this man must face things within himself that he doesn't want to, a woman\/love is his primary weakness and the thrills come from the pacing and drama that creates the tension we all know and love. The action and music are the spices!Enough about the more technical stuff.  This is the best comic book movie ever made because it concentrates on the subject of the Hero as Icon and explains why comics have had the power they have always had.  Comics are very much like movies an let us hope the audience realizes this by the end of the film. The power of words and pictures (or no words at all) is astounding and if you don't think this is true then you need to think about this idea a good deal more.  This film many well be as misunderstood as the medium of comics, but it will help many see them a little bite differently.The best thing though, is this was still a fun film with good suspense and action for those who need either, or.The acting was top notch as we expect from the primary actors with Samuel L. Jackson showing us again why he is the man, or one Bad Mother----. Willis is once again the super hero he is nearly always cast as, but never so blatantly. This film would not be what it is without these two actors. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark also wonderfully accent them leads and their themes.A must see for folks who just love film, who love comics, or who love good father and son flicks.

As a romance, it's astoundingly successful, and though a period piece, its central philosophy of joy and passion are completely timeless, though maybe too subtle for our somewhat cynical modern intelligentsia\/art house crowd, and it's definitely too complex and honest for a typical date movie audience.

Unlike many other films, it just gets better with each viewing, and like a good piece of classical music or art, the more I come to understand the film, the more I get out of it and love it. Truly one of the most flawless works I've ever come across- the acting is superb from minor to major players, the screenplay a deft adaptation of a great book, the art direction and costumes worthy of the Oscars they won, the score sweeping and romantic, and the filming gorgeously visual. A ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of the few movie adaptations of a book that succeeds not only in being a good rendition of the original text, BUT A GREAT MOVIE IN AND OF ITSELF. It was made for love, to be loved, and the fact that it is so generally successful is just icing on the cake. As a romance, it's astoundingly successful, and though a period piece, its central philosophy of joy and passion are completely timeless, though maybe too subtle for our somewhat cynical modern intelligentsia\/art house crowd, and it's definitely too complex and honest for a typical date movie audience.

The authorities keep taking away his writing instruments (the 'quills' of the title), but he perseveres, using wine, blood, even feces to keep scribbling away.I realize they're trying to make some political points here, but they're not well thought out.

George Clooney gives a lackluster performance, and fails to help us see why his character perseveres as the plot complicates. Ice Cube shows great promise but his potential is wasted in this film. Likewise for Nora Dunn and most other supporting players. I winced several times, and not at the bloodshed, but how this story was told.The sound track is incredible. I'll give it that much. A veritable cornucopia of fun music from the latter half of the twentieth century. Quite a contrast to the remarkable UNfun of the movie itself.The tale is based at least loosely on eyewitness accounts of events that took place at the end of the Persian Gulf war. It sheds crocodile tears to the end of noble chivalry, revealing the truth of why man fights man in these dulled and amoral times. However, it tells us nothing we didn't already know. The reasons to take arms are not for justice, but for material wealth. This is repeatedly slapped in our faces as if to convert us. The priest is preaching to the choir. Repeatedly the characters question why they were even fighting this war. They were in the thick of it and yet never understand why. We know why. We know the Persian Gulf incident was fought over crude oil and gold bullion.The tale also attempts to offer hope that despite mankind's unquenchable thirst for wealth and control of others, deep down we all want to be kinder and gentler to one another. However, the same preacher voice doesn't sell this convincingly, and the end result is a hollow shell of a film that does not captivate. Instead it just leaves one sick in the stomach at the very thought of one's own humanity.Are we all like this? Are we all this shortsighted, vain and greedy? Surely each one who reads these words thinks not I but to judge the characters in this film for their actions, both noble and savage, we judge ourselves. Would we do the same if the score of twenty three million American dollars worth of Kuwaiti gold were within our grasp? What price tag do we each place upon the loss of life? The loss of innocence? The loss of sanity?The dialogue is melodramatic when it should have been simple, and at other times simply hollow. The poetry is sporadic and not believable, and when more poetic words would have been preferred, we get rot gut. The plot is based on real events, but it is still a hard hook to swallow, and pulls at the insides. The suspension of disbelief should not be necessary for a story that is this true to life.The first actual gunfight is edited in such a way as to give each bullet a pertinence equal to a presidential address. The camera becomes the bullet for practically every blow to the head. The eye candy is tart and sour. It becomes less like a war movie and more like a Punch and Judy puppet show. The message of needless bloodshed is wrapped around us like a head lock and is suffocating. Again, we KNOW. It's pointless. Why drive the point home like a stake in a vampire's heart? The bloodshed is simultaneously necessary for realism's sake, and more irrelevant than the video game Quake Arena Three. The discoloration and affectation of some scenes is a noble attempt to stylize for visual interest, but it falls short and is superfluous. The characterizations are weak and diluted. Needless to say I was sadly disappointed in Three Kings.The film does attempt to answer the questions Why must man kill his fellow man? Why do we keep having pointless wars? The answer is a simple and pathetic one. Why, for sand of course! For baubles like cell phones and expensive cars, just to toss them aside or blow them away at the next opportunity. We fight for fear of powerful leaders who command us to hate one another and hoard the wealth so that we must remain subservient. We kill one another not only because we can, and because it is easier to kill disagreement with small metallic pebbles blasted at great speeds with modern technology, than it is to realize that every man woman and child on this planet has the inalienable right to necessities, and dare I say even comforts, despite their disagreements of politics, religion and sociality.The question this production should have asked instead was this Why do we keep making pointless war movies about pointless wars?

Alas, despite all my prayers to the contrary, all of the above proved to be horridly real.  As a result, the film sank to levels of trite mediocrity that *even* the Titanic did not reach. I had difficulty understanding why Roger Kumble would give the film the setting I described above, but whatever his reasons, the social conflicts described by de Laclos proved impossible to set in this place and time. As an example, let us take the sub-plot of Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair) and her seduction by Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Philippe).  It is true that when the original author described this scenario in the upper-class Parisian society of the 1700's, it was a social requirement that a woman must go to her wedding bed a virgin.  What she did after the marriage was her own affair (literally so), but this requirement was strict.  And so, when Vicomte de Valmont seduced Cecile de Volanges in a successful attempt to make her, and her future husband laughingstocks--the conflict was both real and important. However, Roger Kumble neglected the fact that 18th century Paris and 20th Manhattan, while similar in some respects, are not identical.  The fact is, in an exclusive prep-school, no one cares whether or not Cecile Caldwell is a virgin, particularly not her boyfriend (who might even be grateful to be relieved of the burden of de-flowering her).  Result--the subplot is out of place, and utterly pointless. There are a few more difficulties, but this is the major problem of the film.  However, no matter how tragically the film is disfigured by the faux-pas described above, the trite script, the two-dimensional roles, the Deus ex machina ending . . . these remove the last bit of potential.
