It could had turned into an interesting movie, that dealt with the issues of moral and medical ethics but the movie never really does so. It makes clear, pretty much from the start on already, who the good- and the bad guys are. And the good guys are extremely good, while the bad guys are totally evil and immoral. It's making this a very black and white and standardized thriller, that progresses in a mostly predictable manner, while still managing to throw in some good moments as well.But really, when watching this movie you just can't help but think how great it potentially could had been. It seems that all of the right ingredients were there but the film-makers just didn't really had a good idea how to handle them, so they went for a more safe and straight-forward approach. This really feels like a studio thriller, made to cash in on the stars that are all in it.But don't be fooled. Even though Gene Hackman is highly billed, he actually is hardly in the movie at all. Just a couple of scenes at the start of the movie and after that it takes a long while for him to appear again. He's only prominently present during the final minutes of the movie, as if he signed a contract that ensured he only had to appear in no more than 5 sequences with Hugh Grant. During those scenes he of course still outclasses Hugh Grant and makes you want to see more of him in his role.And while it was an overall good genre movie to watch, it still managed to annoy me with a couple of things. It's mostly nitpicking sort of stuff but still, it bugged me. For instance that the fact that the homeless people in this movie, who play an important role, never ever remotely look like an homeless person. All have perfect teeth and they and their clothes look far too clean. It's stuff like this that takes you out of a movie.It's also a movie that in the end is leaving more question than answers, especially when you start thinking back about it. It's actually a very unlikely movie, with a very unlikely story and main premise, that gets only made half believable while watching this movie. But just like everything else, it doesn't really push through and plays things far too standard and safe. A shame, since there was far more potential for this movie really.Definitely watchable but it just never becomes great in any way.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a pretty good thriller and also a quite original one, for normal '90's standards but yet the movie never manages to become a truly great, tense or exciting one.The story is what's making the movie good but at the same time it's also the thing that is keeping this movie down.

In other words, things were given precedence over other things instead of the other way around. What seemed to get more attention was the aspect of special effects and the characters were left in the dust,...sand whatever. There are just too many scenes that contain so much CGI, that it's difficult for the viewer not to imagine seeing the actors onset with a blue screen surrounding them. All main characters from the first movie are back in this film. Plus there's an add on. Rick O'Connell and Evelyn conceive a child named Alex. And of course to make the screenplay fun they make Alex an energetic brat that loves to be just as adventurous as his mother and father. Nothing like family genes to keep the entertainment high in this franchise. Rachel Weisz looks even more attractive in this film and she's not as klutzy as she was before, which is good for an undead vanquishing mother. Her brother Jonathan still learns nothing in this film and its funny to see him try and do things right and ends up failing. Nothing changes with his character that's for sure. What's doesn't work is how the story involves so many ideas and concepts that it looks like this film could have maybe passed as the first film. Arnold Vosloo returns as Imhotep, the evil, life-absorbing mummy who cares for nothing except his girlfriend and himself. He didn't even care about his high priest that helped him get to where he had to go. Jerk! Adding to this though is a character called the Scorpion King played by Dwayne Johnson seems to take hold of the reigns in the finale of this film. Wasn't this film about Imhotep returning for his own needs? Well yes, but his focus is to gain control of the Scorpion King's army who is not yet destroyed, yada yada yada. So in a sense, no it's not really about him returning. Imhotep's in this film to create a race against the O'Connell family but he's not the important person the O'Connell's need to kill.The special effects of this film really starts to overwhelm its characters when the end of the film approaches. The action sequences are still cool to watch but to see giant armies of dog headed zombies, massive forests surround a pyramid, and the Scorpion King himself is just not convincing enough to be real. I think director Stephen Sommers took a chance with that. Although this film was a success, I think they could have held off on the majority of the CGI. It was almost like Universal was saying, Look how much stuff we can cram into this 24 inch screen,...seriously, you don't have to overload a film with CGI to make it look good. Just look at the first one, it's a perfect example.The title of this film can be somewhat misleading due to the fact that Imhotep is in this film but is utilized only as another plot device.

Although Mercury Rising was financially not well received, the film is a terrific thriller, solid acting, great story and just all around entertaining! One reviewer said this was more of a drama about autism and that's ludicrous. This is a thriller about a young boy who happens to have autism but to call this a drama or about autism at all is misleading. The film is part mystery, part thriller, part action and will entertain from beginning to end.

Both my older brother and sister read it in middle school, but somehow I missed it. I have been aware of the story for many years though. I am definitely going to go pick up the book now. Furthermore, can anything be more cliché than to pan a movie because it didn't live up to the book. Anyways, I had the luck of going into this movie without that bias.I have read many other books that involve political analysis, such as George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm. I find these kind of topics fascinating.First of all, I disagree with the people that saw this movie and see it only as boys go savage. It shows that reviewers simply don't understand the deeper level this movie goes to, which is why do people behaved civilized at all. How does a democracy survive? How do dictatorships happen? What is civilized? How do you make people cooperate?I personally have been in situations, such as adult recreational sports, where I volunteered as a team captain. It's a perfect analogy to Lord Of the Flies, because a team captain has no real authority. I'm not paying people, and I can't kick people off the team, and there are real limits to anything I can do. Every time I have done that there is always some punk that decides he wants to take over, or doesn't have to do what he is told. This happens regardless of how minimally I am trying to dictate anything.So, how do you prevent anarchy? How do you keep from being overthrown? Every society starts out like this. Sure, once someone gets in power there are many people that can't compete with them, but at the top of any hierarchy is competition and relationships. How is order created?So, after I watched this movie I thought, what did Ralph do wrong?Here is my answer. First of all, Ralph should have not created a complete democracy. Instead he should have created a council subgroup of kids that would be elected into their positions. He should have also been elected, and would have easily won in the beginning.By tying the council members positions to his position, they would have supported him in case of any rebellion. True authority is cemented in affiliation. Also, if someone else wanted to take over they would have had a civilized means to do so, next election, and wouldn't have to resort to rebellion.Also, anyone not doing their fair of work on the island would have to be judged before the council. This way his authority would have been enforced through a form of group discipline.Many tribal societies function like this, despite the fact that some might judge them to be uncivilized. In fact, this is also how modern democracy\/representative governments work.Jack on the other hand did just about everything right in building his brutal dictatorship. He built his own council out of boys that decided to rebel with him from the beginning. So, he already had his power base. He used fear of the monster to create a constant state of emergency to keep people from questioning his authority. He used violence to keep everyone in line, and he eventually attempted to kill off all his opposition.Stories and movies like this are very important to keep us aware of the way we are manipulated by those who want power. By simplifying the situation they serve as a window to show us how our larger societies function.If you learn anything from this movie at least learn to be suspicious of any political group that cultivates fear in you of outside forces. By making you afraid and convincing you that we are the ones that can protect you, they are using the oldest trick in the book.

This leg of the trilogy touches more the adventure part than the science, and really demonstrates an In your face type adventure movie. The effects for the dinosaurs in this one are just as gorgeous as the first movie, but seem a heck of a lot scarier. You've got the classic T- Rex's, which really give a significant edge to this film. The T-Rex's appearances in this one are a lot more stressful than the first, as they seem like a gigantic apocalyptic threat to the humans that are invading the island. One of my favourite T-Rex scenes was the one with the trailer falling over the cliff. Steven Spielberg really went to the next level with his dinosaurs creating something magical and unforgettable. They brought in newer dinosaurs that were less present in the first, but they also depraved others from screen time. The terrifying Dilophosaurus was not present, and even the Velociraptors which had great emphasis in the first were less present in the second film. But even without their presence throughout the movie, they had a few scenes in which they proved to be absolutely incredible. The field scene was a great asset as well as the abandoned control station. Despite some of these dinosaurs being absent, the movie still establishes a balance between adventure, fright, and dialogue. The acting in this film was a bit of a shuffle from the first, the original characters like Sam Neill and Laura Dern were not present here. Therefore Jeff Goldblum took up the position of main character. Along with him, other known actors were added to the roster such as Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite. With all these significant actors, Spielberg was able to pull off a real adventurous rat race. Other than the dialogue being mediocre, the acting was spot on. Apart from the acting, effects, and overall story being nice there's still a few things that are not 100% clear in this movie. For instance, near the end of the movie a boat crashes at the San Diego dock and inside contains a male T-Rex which evades from the boat and roams free in the city. Moments later, members of the cast go inside the boat to check out what happened to the crew, only to find their body parts all over the boat. It is very unclear as to how exactly this whole scene happened. It would've been nice to add one extra conversation, or scene determining how exactly this whole event occurred. Besides that, the downtown San Diego sequence was an incredible add on to the terror and stress that the dinosaurs had to offer. Although we've seen this before in a different movie, King Kong, this has something totally different and I don't think it should be seen as a rip off. Other than that the movie is, from start to finish, a trip back to the 1993 memories of the first Jurassic Park. After 4 years, this is an excellent refresher of one of the greatest adventure trilogies ever made. 8\/10 is my rating,not up to par with the first and I still had a few problems with the story line here and there, but definitely worth your buck, and two hours of your day. Now go and enjoy this underrated masterpiece.

The year 2007 saw the release of the 'Final Cut' version of the film, and I felt obliged to watch it for that reason. The first time I watched the movie I felt confused and didn't really get the message it contained. Some time later I revisited the movie, and boy was I amazed! I am not only fully convinced that Blade Runner accounts for the best science fiction film ever produced, I also think it's one of the best movies ever made in any genre. I find it very disturbing that the film's intelligence and superiority hasn't been fully recognized here on IMDb, owing mostly to the fact that so many people who have reviewed this film have neither the patience nor the intelligence to understand what the film really is about.The film begins by introducing the viewer to the dark future of Los Angeles with a very powerful and visually sublime opening scene. Technology has advanced to the level where it is possible to manufacture human beings so that they cannot be detected from the real ones without a specific test. This test relies on the fact that although these humanoids, referred to as replicants, are highly intelligent and much more agile than real humans, they lack empathy. Because of their violence replicants have been banned from Earth with special police units, blade runners, hunting down and killing those who can be found. One of these blade runners is Rick Deckard, who gets a task of killing a group of replicants who have escaped to Earth from an off-world colony.The nature of the replicants becomes obvious at the very beginning of the film, when one of them brutally shoots down a blade runner. Throughout the film the replicants show their violent and emotionless behaviour as they advance toward their goal to meet their maker and gain more life, as they only have a programmed life span of four years. The replicants befriend J. F. Sebastian, a lonely but kind genetic designer who is the one character that gives humanity its true face amid the dark and sinister atmosphere that prevails throughout the film. The brutal murder of Sebastian along with the creator of the replicants truly make the distance between humans and replicants grow tremendously.The film's philosophical question is the meaning of being a human. Despite the compassionlessness of the replicants the gap of them and human beings is questioned throughout the film. Particularly when Deckard cold-bloodily tells Rachael that she is nothing but a manufactured machine with unauthentic memories in a hauntingly sad scene, the treatment of replicants as nothing but engines becomes morally questionable. The true turning point takes place in the end of film, where the replicant saves Deckard's life. In his powerful last words the replicant makes Deckard aware of the fact that even he has feelings. The undertone that human behaviour of disregarding the replicants is unmissable and really sums up the message of the film. For how can human beings judge the replicants when they themselves can show such hate and monstrousity that even surpasses that of the ones they are hunting down? Especially Rachael shows just how humane even a replicant can be. The astonishingly powerful visuals act as a reminder that the humans have indeed left the very world they are living in scarred and dark. This is emphasized even more when the magical score of Vangelis is played in the background. His use of synth-driven melancholic music succeeds so fantastically well in preserving the gloomy atmosphere of the film.I urge anyone who have mixed feelings about the film to watch it again within a few months. No doubt your feelings about the film is changed when you are better prepared for the film which demands that the viewer is patient and analyzing - this is no Adam Sandler comedy where the viewer can just sit back and enjoy the show without any brainwork involved. The film is just like the very theme behind it - the more you comprehend humanity the more complex it turns out to be.

With the men folks finally getting control of their wives who have become totally uncontrollable and out of hand. It's when the Eberharts Walter & Joanna, Peter Masterson & Katharine Ross, together with their two young daughters Kim & Amy, Mary Stuart Masterson & Ronny Sullivan, move from the big noisy and crime ridden city of New York to the peaceful and quite setting of Stepford Connecticut that their troubles instead of ending begins.Everything is so peaceful and quite in Stepford that it drives those living there almost crazy until they finally,after months of intense conditioning, get the hang of it. Especially disturbing to Joanna, who's a professional photographer, is the by the books and follow orders of the women or wives in town who are so dedicated to their husbands and housework that they seem to be under some kind of mind control. This all soon drives Joanna to drink just to feel that she's normal. It's later when Joanna's old man Walter joins the local Stepford Men's Association that things really start to get out of whack for her.Always away and leaving her alone with the kids and the housework Joanna feels that old man Walter is spending his days out on the town with some young chick instead of playing cards and pool with the members of the mens club. The truth of what Walter is really involved with, in the super secretive Stepford Men's Association, is far worse then Joanna could have ever imagined. It also drive Joanna to seek help from her new found friend in Stepford Bobbie Markowe, Paula Prentiss, who unlike the other wives in town still seems to her her head on straight. That's until she becomes Zombified when she planned to leave town and her mind controlling husband for good. Unknown to both Joanna & Bobbie their husbands are planing to straighten them out in keeping them in line and following orders like all the other wives in town! And what's even worse their doing it with both Joanna & Bobbie unknowingly helping them do it!***SPOILERS*** We get an inkling of what lead to this Zombifying process of the women of Stepford Connecticut from the President of the Stepford Men's Association Dale Diz Coba, Patrick O'Neal. It's when the Women's Liberation Movement started to take hold and turn wives against their husbands that Diz and his fellow outraged husbands came up with this idea of putting their wives back into line. That's by expunging their brains of all the bad things,in Diz and Co. minds, that the Women's Lib Movement put into them. In doing this it took very drastic and sometimes even criminal actions to put their plan into full operation.

Certainly, we high-school boys filled the local theatre, laughing uproariously down to the sobering finale that suddenly reminded us WWII was more than just a comedic backdrop. Seeing the movie again after so many years, my feelings are mixed. I still laugh at Frank's (Lemmon) hyper-antics, the doc's (Powell) droll wit, and the hapless palm trees. Plus, I still like Mr. Roberts (Fonda) and chafe at Cagney's tyrannical Captain Bligh.However, the drunken shore-leave scenes now leave me cringing. The boisterous antics seemed funny at the time, but now seem silly and obvious. Plus, I'm also aware of how such drunken escapades disrespect the local people and their customs and affect our national image around the world. Maybe such a concern seems unduly fussy when it concerns a comedy, but the humor in these scenes is clearly fit for high-schoolers.Nonetheless, what lifts this service comedy above its many imitators is its intelligent sub-text. No need to dwell on the details since other reviewers have spelled them out. But the laughs overlie a deeper parable about earning respect (Pulver), living with boredom (the entire crew), abuse of power plus class envy (the captain), and finally, dealing with war death (the audience). Thus, the laughs have a well-constructed serious side that gives them a point. Unfortunately, this time around I didn't experience the joyous abandon of those innocent high-school years. But there were still plenty of guffaws, along with a new respect for the artistry of the mix. No doubt it's true that people and things do change. Yet I wonder how much, because I still like the movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2012","score":"","review":" As I recall, the movie was a 1956 smash hit.

The plot centers around Harry Block (played as only Allen himself could), a man suffering from writer's block as he prepares to accept an award from his old university, but this is only a loose strain to give the story a narrative though. What it's really focused on is Harry himself, his mind and his characters.In the traditional Allen sense, we get some external monologuing as he explores the mind of this neurotic, stuck and seemingly hopeless man, but he does it in a way that I've never seen him work before. The style of comedy is of course that Allen allure that no one could imitate, but there's also a vulgarity to it that I've never seen him go for before. There are words that I never thought I'd see in a Woody Allen film and the jokes are incredibly graphic, but it gives it this sense of brutal honesty that I haven't experienced from him up to this point. It's absolutely hilarious and quite true, it felt comically in the same sense of Louis C.K.'s work; vulgar and borderline offensive, but totally true to the point where it makes it's audience take a long look in the mirror.As we explore Harry, his few friends and his many exes, we are treated to short vignettes taken from his previous written work. Allen explores the mind of a writer so thoroughly it's mesmerizing, giving us looks into how true the you write what you know expression is, with characters that are directly based on his past lovers and himself. Each short story is hilarious in it's own right, but also sheds more light into the character himself, which is the ultimate draw of the film. I've never liked a performance from the writer\/director more than I have here. He's got the neurosis and cynicism that he is a master at, but there's also an authenticity and darkness to him that I felt was more exposed than I've seen him before.His editing work is a masterstroke as well as he depicts Harry's real life as fractured, making quick cuts in scenes so that nothing seems to be fluid but it gives it this stream-of-consciousness touch that becomes fluid in itself, in detailing what he wants to accomplish. When we see his work displayed, there's no fragmentation, no awkward cuts, everything runs smoothly. The final scene of the film states the themes a little too strongly, as he practically spoonfeeds them to the audience, but it's a brilliant display of how a writer can become so broken and fractured in his own life that the only way he can achieve any clarity is through his work. A dark, touching, hilarious film with a strong message. Plus, it opens with Julia Louis-Dreyfus getting bent over and plowed in front of a blind woman, and you don't get much funnier than that.
