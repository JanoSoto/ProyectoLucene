[{"date":"17 July 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek is the name of an ogre who lives in a swamp.  He is a grump and hates everyone and would rather be by himself than make any friends.  One day though, he discovers that fairy tale characters are flocking to him for protection after he reluctantly saves a talking donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy.  In a desperate atempt for Shrek to get everyone away from him, he goes to a midget wannabe King and demands that they remove the vagrants off his swamp land.The King agrees so long as he rescues a princess and returns her to him so he can marry her.  What insues is an Ogre that rescues a damsel that falls for him even though he is an unwilling participant at first, but of course we find out the Ogre has a heart and wants to be with the princess instead of giving her to the King.In short this movie is hysterical, unique, qwerky, and massively entertaining.  Eddie Murphy steals the show as a wisecracking donkey, and the animation is really top notch.  Many parodies abound, and the humour is directed more towards adults than it is for children (not that they wouldn't like it) making it more enjoyable.The perfect fairy tale for adults!!Rating 8 1\/2 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek is the name of an ogre who lives in a swamp.

It is a truly dreadful movie with a limp script, bored actors, hackneyed pacing and lack of any true content, surprise or interest. And this is what is so wrong with Hollywood these days. Rather than take a chance with something new & exciting, they stick to formula and squeeze a few more quid out of the movie-public.I can only imagine Sam Neil, Macey & Leone were really hardup for cash when they took on this load of rubbish, because it certainly hasn't done much for their acting abilities or street cred.There is nothing to commend in this movie, in fact it looks positively dated right from the outset. Movies like Shrek, Final Fantasy & Lord Of The Rings, are what people are (or will be) gunning for, as storylines & 4th generation cgi become more intelligent & subtle.JP3 lacks all these qualities and is now becoming an embarrassment. I get the impression its going to go the Jaws route, with a franchise of JP sequels  such as JP-3D, JP - This Time Its Personal, JP Bites Back!!!They should've killed the golden goose after JP1 and let the fans remember the original in a more redeeming light, rather than having it hauled down & smeared with its bastard off-spring.This film is pants!!*\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 2001","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film stinks of cheap Hollywood exploitation.
