This is very camp, very 80's (the third act feels like Saturday Night Fever - disco, disco, disco!!). One of the plot deveolpments and two of the characters are a blatant rip-off from Carrie.In spite of this, some good scares, suspenseful moments, and twists.

There's a scene that rips off The Matrix. Then there is the I can see you but can you see me scene. This is a must see film.

Halloween is one of the earlier examples.A taught, excellent thriller, one of the first real slasher movies, with John Carpenter directing with panache. The camera angles, the point-of-view-of-the-killer views, the darkness... all create genuinely unsettling moments of unease. Every frame is filled in the outline with something, a tree branch etc. and Michael Myers seems to be lurking everywhere.Many nods to Hitchcock throughout, the most obvious being the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut role - her mother, Janet Leigh, appeared in Hitchcock's Psycho and the infamous shower scene.Halloween has thus far spawned 7 sequels. Unsurprisingly, the original remains the best.Fantastic!
