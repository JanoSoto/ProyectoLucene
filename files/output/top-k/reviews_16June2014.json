But, on the other hand, there are some really good things in this movie that I think are really underrated.ANIMATION This might be one of Disney's best looking movies. It should be, a film that is celebrating nature and becoming one with all creations of the Earth should have some good visuals; only these aren't good visuals - they're great! You never see the outlines on anyone or anything. The colors work really well together, and the style of how everything blends is great! I love watching the animation during the Savages number; isn't that what you'd expect to see from Disney?SONGS\/MUSIC Obviously the songs are some of the best things in this movie. Here we get Alan Menken back, along with lyricist Stephen Sondheim. We all know and love Colors of the Wind, which, again, is great to both watch and listen to. The lyrics and singer are great, but listen to the music in that song! The orchestrations are great! I mentioned Savages before, and that's a great antagonist song! I don't know if I'd call it a villain song. Radcliffe does manipulate the people to get what he wants, but everyone on both sides of the battlefield hate each other. The antagonist here is hate, and it's displayed perfectly in this song. I watched this movie recently and was reminded of the song Just Around the Riverbed. It's nice, I guess. Again, the orchestrations are really good.ROMANCE The more I think about it, I really like the romance in this movie between Pocahontas and John Smith. It stems from something. You can see how they began falling in love with each other. Usually it's so easy for Disney characters to just meet and fall in love. Here, however, they spend time together. They talk, they learn about each other and their differences. I like that they're not working to fall in love, that's not why they're together. They are initially learning from the other person, and they fall in love in due time.CHARACTERS These aren't the most memorable characters, but they're not bad...not all of them, anyway. I find the animals annoying...Actually I only find the hummingbird and dog annoying when they're with the raccoon, so maybe it's just him. The other characters are OK, but what really surprised me was my interest in Pocahontas' character. If you read my review for The Little Mermaid, you may be thinking, You panned Ariel for rebelling! Why do you like Pocahontas? Here's the thing the first time Pocahontas' father told the village to stay away from the White men, Pocahontas was already with John Smith, so she technically didn't disobey that time. After that, though, her rebellion actually brought peace and harmony between two different groups of people. And her rebellion wasn't due to selfish ambition. It began with her curiosity of these different people, which led her to ask the question Why are we segregated? She was trying to put a stop to the war and discrimination between them. That's not only selfless, but also brave and responsible! And, yes, her actions did get someone killed, but imagine how many more people would have died if the war she tried to stop had taken place. Ariel? So long as she gets her Prince, what the crud does she care what happens? Pocahontas is a great character and role model!STORY I think this is what people take issue with the most. The story is old and boring - we've seen it too many times. This film isn't doing anything new or exciting with the tale of greedy White men conquering the Red people's land, so it's not that interesting. We know that tale, we know the story of Pocahontas, and we know what Disney's going to do to make us smile and live happily ever after. There aren't any surprises or nuances, so it doesn't really matter. There are only two things that shocked me...and they were stupid things. First of all, a tree can talk. What? Second of all, did you see the change in how Pocahontas could suddenly understand and communicate with John Smith? How does that work? How is it possible? You can't take a story about a real person and real events and mix it with fairy tale! The ending was changed, but that's something we can at least say is possible; we can go along with that because people can do that in reality. What ISN'T possible in reality is speaking in another language just because the leaves blow, or having your grandmother be a tree! What the crud!? CONCLUSION While the story doesn't grab me and most of the characters are bland and unforgettable, the animation, music, romance, and our main character are enough to keep me coming back and watching this movie all over again! Give Disney credit, delivering this message isn't as easy as one may think it is. In fact, kudos to Disney for doing it period, especially with the characters in this movie. I think this is supposed to make up for the racist Indians we got in Peter Pan. If you love or like this film, I understand. If you don't like it, again I understand. Bottom line, hopefully we can acknowledge both the strengths and weaknesses of the movie. Surly we can all paint with all the colors of the wind. BOOYIKA!

But all the same it has because a big part of everyone's lives, from childhood to adulthood and throughout the decades we all have shows that we remember, became a part of history, as well as those new shows we all get excited for.This film I feel is another under the radar gem, it's also a childhood relic since I saw it when I was about 10 and is both one of my favorite parody films in the subgenere and one of my favorite films in general. This was a parody movie that I feel was just made for me because it's pretty much parodies on top of parodies which to me is just a dream come true and something that I don't feel has been done again since. It would be awesome to see a parody (a good one) on a comic book or anime franchise where a single hero or a group of heroes go into one segment out of the norm into another.This film is pretty much a live action Mad Magazine, as each of the show\/situations both characters jump into are practically a Mad Magazine cartoon you would flip to, pretty much taking things were familiar with and turning them upside down. But mainly I love the premise which is part of why I love it, it's sort of that dream we all kinda have in the back of our minds of being part of a TV show and in the action. If there is a few TV shows I'd want to be a part of it would be Doctor Who, Sailor Moon, and well you get it, I'm sure you have your lists as well (admit it). This film takes that concept and has fun with it. I even like that there is a bit of a horror fantasy element which makes it both bizarre and funny, but it makes sense since most humans watch TV so why wouldn't Satan think of using this opportunity to take souls. But in a way it sort of also makes the film kinda a Christian movie, since there is this element let alone a theme of redemption and family values throughout the film.The characters are solid, from the late great John Ritter as Roy Knable and Pam Daber as Helen Knable which is ironically funny since both of them are of course TV sitcom vets. Also their last name is kinda funny since it's a play on words for able or could be a slight reference to the biblical character Abel.Roy is funny and he's not a bad person, the problem with him is his head's in the wrong place which of course is TV. This guy is clearly trying to tune out of reality because to him reality sucks. I can sort of sympathize and empathize with that feeling, we can see in little segments that left and right he is getting crap canned almost every day from working in a job he hates, let alone a butt head neighbor's dog attacks him every time he goes to work and comes back home. The only high point to him is TV, even though really it should be his family and his fencing talent; but like in any morality tale he's about to learn that the hard way.Helen is also funny and she's sympathetic because their marriage is crumbling and part of that is obviously from Roy's chronic TV viewing. It's obvious their marriage needs a jump start and well fate or should I say the Devil is about to give them that.I really like the back and forth between both Roy and Helen, you could say in a way this film is a bit of a romance comedy but done right, because the couple are not teen or young adults which I personally feel have been done to death. But actual grown adults that are married and do what any couple should do, interact and help one another.I even like the two kids, the sister I'll admit I had a bit of a crush on. But I really like the little brother, he's not a stereotypical nerd this kid I think is actually cool, smart, really knows his way around communication technology which becomes useful in the film, but most importantly takes a active approach in things.I really love the pacing and the adventure aspect of it, you could say in a way it's like a video game, as the couple are constantly going from one new situation after another much like levels and have to survive each of them.I don't want to give too much away, one segment if the noir show which is just fantastic for me since I'm a fan of the genre. And I simply love the blend of both visual and verbal humor, all the clichés in that genre are there. I really like the narration of Roy in the segment which cracks me up.And of course that cartoon segment, which was animated by late animator Chuck Jones whom is known for doing the The Looney Tunes cartoons. It was just funny also because it has some of the clichés as well. I really thought it was funny how Roy applied cartoon logic to get both him and Helen out. But also a visual joke seeing Helen open her wallet to see a photo of her kids and we see the cartoon mouse versions of them.And the film surprisingly has a good message which is simply to not watch too much TV and most importantly to simply tune into life, it can be better if you decide to tune in.This is a parody worth tuning into.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"16 June 2014","score":"","review":" We all watch TV, whether that's really a good or bad thing only time will tell.

Movie is love story of two neighbors with interesting twist. Lovers have pretty much similar faith and life situation, they both have their fiances out of the town and eventually they end up spending time with each other and since both are alone without their couples dealing with themselves in their daily routine they falling into very weird appreciation between each other.

Music plays big role, songs chose very wisely but honestly there were like 3 different tracks throughout the movie so it made it a little boring.

No Way Out is one of those exciting thrillers, in many a moon, if with only a slow lead up to the accidental murder of Hackman's mistress (Young), by the man himself, where a hard slap sends her over a balustrade, to her death. Naval seal officer, Tom Farrell (Costner) was making love with Young, prior, where Hackman's knock, was kind of his cue for getting the hell out of there. Hackman plays a powerful minister of defence who has his homosexual assistant, a fantastic Will Patton, do his dirty work for him, where a cover up comes into play, only Costner has been assigned to head the investigation, so he's pretty much dug himself into a grave. This situation of story structure is what makes the movie exciting, where the walls start to come closing in, and Costner feels only too obliged to really tell the other operatives about what really went down, but of course can't, for a few reasons. The car chase scene, that ends on foot was thrilling, where Costner tries to hinder some agents, who are about to uncover evidence that places Costner at the scene of the crime. It's these situations and others that make the film exciting. It's Will Patton who has to commended though, while Hackman adds slight menace. Too, we have the Q and A scenario, with Costner in too deep, defending himself, in the interrogation, which of course puts the other scenes in the before phase. Too again, I don't quite know how Hackman's fate ended. I'm pretty sure he died. I'll guess I'll have to watch this film again. I for one haven't got a problem with that. I guess my only gripe with this exciting espionage thriller, was just the little too long, start, involving the getting to know you stuff, between Costner and Young who get very cozy, as shown in that montage. This plays against the title song, where too Costner and friend live it up The Philippines, in some play\/off time, amongst some dancing titties. But this much earlier screen time shared, between our lovebirds, did make her tragic death, more effective. Recommended highly, before Costner went on to make those trifle batch of three hour, bore to death flicks.

The movie is the foundation for the SG-1 show (duh) and ties directly into the first season of the show.

Nice to not have a mother ship carrying 40 times the number of fighters than possible to making the fight a winnable one. So as it came down to the end when the people rise up against RA and they clear the way for the team to beam the bomb onto the ship and blow it to pieces it may have been a familiar story, but with many important differences. RA's forces were not overwhelming so that their being free to get to the bomb\/stargate was believable. RA was a kid with the arrogance of 1000's of years experience kicking mankind's rear so it seamed feasible that he would see no threat in the small team. Also nice that being a techno thief of more advanced technologies he would understand what a nuclear weapon was. Overall a good story laying a good foundation for the series. Nice to see the dork version of Dr. Jackson fumbling around with how to speak a dead language instead of just walking up and being fluent in ancient Egyptian making for a more realistic backdrop to the whole story. There were gaps in the story as a movie, but with it being the basis for a TV Series those gaps were perfect so the series had questions to answer and a reason for SG-1 to need to start up and follow up on what happened 10 years earlier given the chance.

Initially it was to be directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky with input from Salvador Dali, both men famed for their surrealist leanings. This collaboration did not ultimately happen but the movie was eventually directed by another famous surrealist film-maker, David Lynch. At the time he had come off the back of the big success of The Elephant Man, while his name had been made by the unique nightmarish Eraserhead. From what I can recall, Lynch hadn't actually read the novel and was most interested in possibilities inherent in the name Dune itself. He agreed to make it on one provision and that was that if he did, producer Dino De Laurentiis would allow him final cut on a subsequent movie of his own. So in this way, Dune was directly responsible for Lynch's next film, the classic Blue Velvet.What of Dune itself? Well, I myself have not read the novel so I am depending entirely on the film for the story. Without prior knowledge of the book it is quite hard to follow overall it has to be said. Key information is presented briefly and a rewind function certainly helps! Its story basically is about two rival houses &#x96; the House of Atreides and the House of Harkonnen &#x96; that inhabit separate planets and vie for dominance. The Emperor of the known universe plays them off against one-and-other, over a substance known as the Spice. This precious material allows for the folding of time and subsequently, long distance space travel. It is the only substance known that can do this and is therefore hugely precious. It only exists on the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. One of the people involved in this drama, Paul Atreides, emerges as a messiah figure prophesised by the people native to Arrakis, the Fremen; he changes things irrevocably.It's quite obvious that Dune was given the cinematic treatment off the back of the success of the Star Wars films. It has similarly high production values. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all of a very high calibre. It's extremely visually impressive. It could be argued that Lynch's personal style is lost in this huge big budget production in a genre unfamiliar to him. To a reasonable extent this is certainly true. But there are some clues in the lighting of shots and of course the cast, several of whom he worked with on other films. And also the more grotesque details were seemingly not in the book itself and added no doubt with Lynch's influence. So there are some elements of his style here for sure. I find Dune overall a film that improves with repeat viewings. The fantastic production design really helps but I also like how, despite surface similarities, it goes for something altogether more left-field than the Star Wars films.

Do you want to see a perverted old man lusting after a woman more than half his age, burn people in their homes, and enslave a deformed man? You do! Then, boy, does Disney have a film for you! To be serious, I saw this movie for the first time last year (like The Little Mermaid), and I was blown away by it! There are problems I have with it, yes, but in all, it's unbelievable!ANIMATION The animation in this movie is really impressive! I don't think it's as grand as The Lion King, but it comes pretty doggone close! While Beauty and the Beast looked like it could take place anywhere, this movie makes me feel like I'm in Paris! Not the romantic, fantasized Paris, but the real, regal, grand part of Paris! It's rich, it's historic, and it's awesome!SONGS\/MUSIC God bless you, Stephen Sondheim and Alan Menken! God bless you both! The music in this film will blow you away! I'll admit that while A Guy Like You is a cool song, it breaks the tone of the movie. It'd be better somewhere else. Topsy Turvy is good for the movie, though, in the spirit of the gypsies. Out There is nice, and I enjoy God Help the Outcasts. But let's discuss the two greatest songs of the film Hellfire is absolutely amazing! We've never had a song as intense, disturbing, or creepy as this song, and it's great for that! We also get visual representation of the struggle Frollo is experiencing, and it's incredible! But by far, my favorite song in this movie is The Bells of Notre Dame!!! Good grief, this is one of my favorite openings to a movie! The way they tell the story, the lyrics, the movie, the singer - PRAISE GOD, the singer! Did you hear that last note he hit??!! I didn't think he'd get all the way up there, but he did! I need to meet him and shake his hand!ROMANCE There's not a lot I have to say about the romance in this film. It was nice that Quasimodo didn't get the main character, though. You'd expect that in a Disney movie, but the movie ends without him getting the woman...and he's OK with that. That's very rare, but nice. And I'm just going to pretend that crap-in-a-hat sequel didn't happen! The bell's beautiful...on the inside. WHAT?!?CHARACTERS Again, most of the characters are just OK; there's nothing too special about them. The gargoyles are annoying as crud, but they get one or two chuckles...if that. Frollo, though, is incredible! He's probably my favorite character in the film! What makes him stand out is that he's not so much evil as much as he is corrupt...Or maybe he's really evil too, but here's what I mean Frollo commits all these horrible deeds because he thinks he should. He argues that it's what God wants him to do. He sees nothing but goodness in himself. It's actually quite tragic when you think about it, but that's what we love about him!STORY I've never read the original Victor Hugo book, and I understand this story goes out of order, but it still follows the story closely, so I'm not upset by that. I think the way Disney tells this story is fine. It's really good, in fact. I also like that this story doesn't say Christians are all hypocrites. Any other movie would have done that; it would have been so easy to have done that because of Frollo's actions. But because of the Archdeacon (I should have mentioned him earlier, he's really cool!), we understand that Frollo is just a corrupted man and a hypocrite; not all Christians are like that. And with the God Help the Outcasts song, we see hopeless people seeking help from God, not letting Frollo's evilness blind them from seeing the light. I love that!CONCLUSION I'd be lying if I said I think Hunchback is anything special, but it's good and enjoyable.

These songs are terrible! Being that I grew up on the style of music of the songs and I love it, you'd think I'd enjoy these songs. But no, I don't! These songs are some of the most bland and forgettable songs I've ever heard! I watched the beginning of this film twice within 30 minutes, and I totally forgot the Gospel Truth number!

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 June 2014","score":"","review":" Before making his name well known in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino worked as a video store clerk before directing his first feature length movie. Reservoir Dogs was his first feature and boy, it was very good. In fact, I believe that when they pick out the best Tarantino movie of all time, my best guess is that they will have a field day with this film and his other works.The story centers around four professional criminals with false aliases. They are Mr. White,(Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde, (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink, (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. Orange, (Tim Roth). All four men are involved in a robbery that went wrong. The bosses, Nice Guy Eddie, (Chris Penn), and his father, (Lawrence Tierney) got the message clear. But, what went wrong and who is the rat? Told through sharp dialogue and in flashbacks, the criminals try to figure what to do in this situation. The plot of this movie is dialogue driven and every piece of information is either spoken directly from the characters or told through flashbacks.Tarantino has a ear for words. In fact, this independent film was made on a low budget and doesn't consists of any big budget special effects or explosions. While I was watching Reservoir Dogs, I was reminded that the artistry of the movies is not about action, but dialogue. It seems that in this world of today, movie goers are somehow drawn to the loud and sometimes obnoxious world of action. But, this is more than just your average crime caper film. An example of just how sharp Tarantino writes dialogue is the opening scene where we see the gang having a conversation in a diner. With this, we, as the audience, feel like we are eavesdropping on their conversation. Even more to the point, these characters aren't really talking about the actual crime they are going to commit. Rather, they are talking more about Madonna Like a Virgin than the robbery. That kind of trademark is always essential in all of Tarantino's movies. The main characters talk about pop culture and especially make movie references in either a diner or a restaurant. The performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and others including Penn and Tierney are very good. Keitel, who was also in another daring performance in Bad Lieutenant that same year, gives a commanding performance as Mr. White. Out of all of the main characters in the movie, I happen to enjoy watching Keitel's character walk through this movie, trying both to figure what happened and also keep his loyalty and respect to his boss. Tim Roth, who played Mr. Orange, is wonderful and also very realistic. The reason why I mention realistic is that throughout the entire time, Mr. Orange can be seen bleeding out on the floor for a very long time. Also, the bonding between Mr. White and Mr. Orange resembles a symbol of camaraderie between two soldiers who have went through a harrowing and violent scenario. But, one character who is different from all of the other characters is Mr. Blonde, who is played by Michael Madsen. He is very twisted when it comes to violent. One famous sequence in the movie is when he tortured a cop by tying him up in a chair and cutting off his ear. Later on, he threatens to set him on fire. That kind of violence is not glorified, but a lot of people were stunned and disgusted by that scene. For me, Tarantino know how to cut away from the violence so that you don't see the razor slicing the cop's ear. Tarantino often writes movie references in his scripts and at certain times, bring influences to other genres as well. This is evident in Reservoir Dogs. The characters stated movie references from the 60's and mostly the 70's, creating a sense of pop culture. I know for a fact that for all of its intentions, this movie deserves to seen more once. It is twisted because of the story of a gang trying to recover the diamonds and also figure out what went wrong. It is screwy in the way that these characters talk and act toward each other. Unlike other crime movies, the characters who portrays criminals are more calm and more relaxed than other movie criminals. In other crime movies that I've seen, the criminals act rough toward each other and also to the women. Here, there is one minor female character, which is the waitress in the beginning of the movie. But, after that, no other female speaking parts.Reservoir Dogs works as a mystery film, as a violent and bloody gangster picture and also as a movie of its own. If there is one other thing that I would say is that Quentin Tarantino will be around for a very long time. ★★★ 1\/2 3 1\/2 stars.

The characters stated movie references from the 60's and mostly the 70's, creating a sense of pop culture. I know for a fact that for all of its intentions, this movie deserves to seen more once. It is twisted because of the story of a gang trying to recover the diamonds and also figure out what went wrong. It is screwy in the way that these characters talk and act toward each other. Unlike other crime movies, the characters who portrays criminals are more calm and more relaxed than other movie criminals. In other crime movies that I've seen, the criminals act rough toward each other and also to the women. Here, there is one minor female character, which is the waitress in the beginning of the movie. But, after that, no other female speaking parts.Reservoir Dogs works as a mystery film, as a violent and bloody gangster picture and also as a movie of its own. If there is one other thing that I would say is that Quentin Tarantino will be around for a very long time. ★★★ 1\/2 3 1\/2 stars. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"16 June 2014","score":"","review":" Before making his name well known in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino worked as a video store clerk before directing his first feature length movie. Reservoir Dogs was his first feature and boy, it was very good. In fact, I believe that when they pick out the best Tarantino movie of all time, my best guess is that they will have a field day with this film and his other works.The story centers around four professional criminals with false aliases. They are Mr. White,(Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde, (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink, (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. Orange, (Tim Roth). All four men are involved in a robbery that went wrong. The bosses, Nice Guy Eddie, (Chris Penn), and his father, (Lawrence Tierney) got the message clear. But, what went wrong and who is the rat? Told through sharp dialogue and in flashbacks, the criminals try to figure what to do in this situation. The plot of this movie is dialogue driven and every piece of information is either spoken directly from the characters or told through flashbacks.Tarantino has a ear for words. In fact, this independent film was made on a low budget and doesn't consists of any big budget special effects or explosions. While I was watching Reservoir Dogs, I was reminded that the artistry of the movies is not about action, but dialogue. It seems that in this world of today, movie goers are somehow drawn to the loud and sometimes obnoxious world of action. But, this is more than just your average crime caper film. An example of just how sharp Tarantino writes dialogue is the opening scene where we see the gang having a conversation in a diner. With this, we, as the audience, feel like we are eavesdropping on their conversation. Even more to the point, these characters aren't really talking about the actual crime they are going to commit. Rather, they are talking more about Madonna Like a Virgin than the robbery. That kind of trademark is always essential in all of Tarantino's movies. The main characters talk about pop culture and especially make movie references in either a diner or a restaurant. The performances by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and others including Penn and Tierney are very good. Keitel, who was also in another daring performance in Bad Lieutenant that same year, gives a commanding performance as Mr. White. Out of all of the main characters in the movie, I happen to enjoy watching Keitel's character walk through this movie, trying both to figure what happened and also keep his loyalty and respect to his boss. Tim Roth, who played Mr. Orange, is wonderful and also very realistic. The reason why I mention realistic is that throughout the entire time, Mr. Orange can be seen bleeding out on the floor for a very long time. Also, the bonding between Mr. White and Mr. Orange resembles a symbol of camaraderie between two soldiers who have went through a harrowing and violent scenario. But, one character who is different from all of the other characters is Mr. Blonde, who is played by Michael Madsen. He is very twisted when it comes to violent. One famous sequence in the movie is when he tortured a cop by tying him up in a chair and cutting off his ear. Later on, he threatens to set him on fire. That kind of violence is not glorified, but a lot of people were stunned and disgusted by that scene. For me, Tarantino know how to cut away from the violence so that you don't see the razor slicing the cop's ear. Tarantino often writes movie references in his scripts and at certain times, bring influences to other genres as well. This is evident in Reservoir Dogs.

I was even fascinated with the concept of lost\/undiscovered relics and the Holy Grail of course is one of them, let alone on a side note I'm a Christian. Parodies comedies are another thing I really love and when I heard that there was a parody on this legend, I had to check it out and I wasn't disappointed. This film is one of my favorite comedies, parodies in the sub genre, but also one of my favorite films in general. On a side note this was the film that got me into the Monty Python Flying Circus skit show which at the time I never heard about.There's really not much to say, this is one of those parodies that are done right like in most parodies it takes a story and turns it upside down and on it's head, while the characters all play it straight all unaware their in a parody. The whole flying circus ensemble are all in the film and they all as usual do a great job at making us laugh let alone, the fact they all play multiple roles in the movie.Both the verbal and visual jokes are just fraking hilarious. Though I wouldn't say everyone of them are hits, like that whole verbal joke on swallows I always thought was boring but that's me. But that's what you get with most comedies and parodies, it's the ones that hit that count the most. Like in their skit show, each of the jokes are hilarious because of how smart or strange they really are; let alone how the film isn't afraid to go the extra mile sometimes with it's blood and violence which was revolutionary for it's time, it's now common in shows like South Park.There are so many scenes that are just memorable that I don't want to give them all away. From the introduction of the Holy Hand Grenade it's pretty much a verbal and visual joke going together, from the fact the item has a biblical passage, let alone it even exists in the Christian faith at all. But of course my favorite scene is The Tale of Sir Lancelot, where we see Lancelot battling. Well OK, I wouldn't really call it a battle, it was more of a slaughter as we see Lance is just constantly killing everyone in the castle not even stopping to take a breath, what makes it really hilarious is the fact that no one is putting up any resistance they've all practically set themselves up to be killed. I even love that swashbucking music which makes the sequence both exciting and all the more hilarious because it reflects just how crazy things really are.I love how in a way the film itself is a character, from it's fourth wall breaking to just how aware of how low budget the film is made. Like the whole pretend horse thing which is hilarious because you easily see the person making the film is a complete money grubber that he didn't want to shell the money to buy real horses. Though all the same it's just hilarious how the actors for pretend horses still perform really well, as if they really are on horses. Let alone the ending which cracks me up because it's a payoff to a really strange subplot that's been going on, the subplot seemed like another episode from some procedural show. You could say it's if the procedural shows like CSI, NCIS, or any other you can think of ever crossed over with a fantasy story which when you think about is kinda a crazy but cool concept.This film like the legend of the grail is ageless.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"16 June 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The King Arthur legend is no doubt one of my favorite fantasies and throughout the years there have been multiple interpretations of the legend in the visual medium, so good and some bad but all the same that legend like so many other stories has lived on even to this day.

When someone goes off alone (despite being on a haunted ghost ship with literally the entire old crew dead by murdering themselves) that is when it gets spooky, every single time.

I suppose that the flashing of creepy things SHOULD scare people but by that point, you have already seen a few scenes from Silence of the Lambs so the rapid maggot scenes really fell flat. I will give it props for having a woman and a Black man survive at the end. That was honestly most unexpected since I sat back waiting for each person to be knocked off in turn and really just expected the whole new crew to die screaming. If you find this scary, then you are not use to SciFi in this particular genre or you are shocked by formulaic horror. The dialogue is terrible. The gore is semi-realistic in parts but not really when it counted. I still wonder where all that blood came from which flooded the bit of the ship at the end. Also... see The Shining for that particular scene. It just felt like it was ripping off other GREAT movies and left me waiting for it to just end.

I believe the major theme of this movie is how war dehumanizes the average person. What was once reprehensible is now commonplace. The movie begins in Paris Island at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot. There are several of the more prominent characters in the film. Matthew Modine is private Joker, Arliss Howard is private Cowboy, Vincent D'Onofrio is private Leonard Lawrence (Gomer Pyle), Adam Baldwin is Animal Mother and R. Lee Ermy is Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, the senior drill instructor. The first half of the movie follows the recruits through boot camp getting them ready to go to Vietnam. Joker and Cowboy are good friends throughout the film. Private Pyle is an overweight recruit that is slowing everyone down and has no motivation and as a prior soldier myself, that is the last thing you want when you're going to war. Throughout the first half of the film all of the other recruits are constantly getting into trouble because of Private Pyle. After an incident regarding a donut that was hidden in his foot locker Private Pyle did not get in trouble anymore, the rest of the platoon did. This did not last long before they strongly motivated Private Pyle to try harder. It worked for the rest of the time while they were in boot camp and he eventually became an infantryman in the Marine Corp. All of the motivation that the other recruits gave him proved to be too much because he ended up killing himself and drill instructor Hartman. The second half of the movie takes place in Vietnam where it takes the remaining characters through the perils of war. The dehumanizing of the marines starts in boot camp as demonstrated with Private Pyle but it becomes evident when they get to Vietnam. The use of the music to let you know something is about to happen is very prevalent while they were in Vietnam. It makes the suspenseful scenes even better because you know things about to liven up. Also the use of camera angles is a great technique used in this film. They are really good when the platoon is approaching the town behind the tanks and the camera is following behind showing the town as they approach. It almost makes you feel like it is your turn to run down the road to find cover. Also when the sniper is trying to pick off members of the platoon in the town center, the camera angles go back and forth from the platoon to the sniper. The zooming technique is also very effective in this scene. The dehumanizing effects of war and preparing for war are evident in this movie. Similar themes like the one found in Full Metal Jacket can also be found in films like Platoon and Deer Hunter. These are movies about the Vietnam War also and the effects that war can have on a person. Overall Full Metal Jacket is a great movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
