Well, that was Gladiator, which tells the same story as A Knight's Tale, of a man who should be nothing much, rising to become something great.  But, Oscar notwithstanding, the previous film was, you know, kind of boring.  AKT is exciting, fun, uplifting, and has a couple of good, if familiar, pieces of music.  Carter Burwell gets the Music By credit, but it appears on screen while the music of Queen is playing, which was a strange bit of timing, to say the least.  Queen and Bowie are both in the soundtrack, and the early impression I had was that the characters would cleverly remain in-period while 20'th century music played.  Alas, this neat idea seems to have been too hard for the filmmakers, who let the anachronism get into a party scene where everyone's modern dancing should have stayed medieval.  No great harm is done by this mistake, though, and the rest of the film's simple, charming story of a peasant who pretends to be a knight so he can make big money jousting is everything you want it to be.  There's even a woman blacksmith cum sidekick, for those who insist that all such stories pretend, a la Xena\/Hercules, that women could enter the professions of the ancient world.  To their credit, she doesn't make a big deal about her sex, nor does she become the hero's love interest.  She's just one of four sidekicks--one of whom is a very funny Chaucer--who work as a fine ensemble.  The real love interest, who is a snotty princess no one could love after getting to know her, is kind of annoying and hurts the film.  But, there has to be a lady to fight for, and over, in a jousting movie, doesn't there?The whole thing is poppycock, but that's okay.  The jousting scenes are thrilling, the humor is funny, and the characters get only as sappy as necessary when admitting how they really feel about each other and their destinies.  There's some violence, but it's mild as movies go these days with very little (maybe too little, at times) blood on screen.  If you liked Gladiator, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Excalibur, Knight Riders (anyone remember that one?), or even The Karate Kid, you'll like this one.

Let me make it clear.  Christine is my favorite book that Stephen King ever put on paper.  Not only was it a horror novel, it was a story about the disentigrating friendship of a couple of lifelong buddies that captured teenage life perfectly and hit just the right emotional chords.  Even though it was a book, it utilized music perfectly by putting in excerpts from a lot of rock tunes.  It also fleshed out every character to a tee and gave you a background for each of them by giving you their point of view. It's one book that I absolutely HAVE to read every Fall.SOME SPOILERS AHEAD, YA'LL. Christine is the story of Arnie Cunningham.  He's your classic high-school geek.  You know the type.  He's the kind you see scurrying down the hall, between classes, hoping that he would go unnoticed to avoid torment and humiliation.  Arnie has exactly one friend in Dennis Guilder.  Dennis is Arnie's polar opposite.  He's popular, he's a football player, and he's a ladies man.  They've been best friends since child-hood and Dennis has spent the whole time watching Arnie's ass and keeping him from getting beaten. (you see, in the book, the biggest part of the story is told in first-person by Dennis)  Things take a sudden change of pace when Arnie sets his sites on this dilapidated 1958 Plymouth Fury.  Arnie buys the clunker for about $300 and has his mind set on fixing it up, much to his parents (and Dennis's) disapproval.  The car becomes somewhat of an obsession to Arnie.  It also gives him so much confidence that he does a complete 180 turnaround from class-geek to babe-magnet\/high school badass.  Pretty soon, anyone who's done Arnie wrong (or anyone who plans on doing Arnie wrong, for that matter) becomes roadkill.  Mess with Arnie, become a hood ornament.  The car, er..I mean, Christine has a mind of her own and anyone who she sees as a threat turns up missing.  Christine also has a wicked jealous streak.None too happy about losing his best friend to a car, Dennis decides to investigate things a bit in hopes of understanding  (and stopping) the transformation in his best friend.  He learns the history of the car and its previous owner, and learns maybe a bit more than he wanted to know.Christine is a damn good flick.  It's a book transfer done right with just the right amount left intact.  My only real bitch is that things happened a bit too fast.  Arnie changed a bit quick and I didn't like how the story of Roland D. Lebay was just touched on.  That needed further explanation, in my opinion.

To prove that if it's meant to be, they should continue this, she has him write his name and number on a five dollar bill and promptly puts it out into the universe by buying some breath mints.  She writes her name and number in a book she just bought and will sell the next day to a bookstore.  If she finds the bill or he finds the book, it's meant to be.  To push their luck (as if this other scenario wasn't crazy enough) they get in separate elevators at the Waldorf Astoria and if they meet on the same floor, it's got to be fate they're together.  Well, they don't get off on the same floor (close though) and this gets the ball rolling to where we meet these characters years later, where they've moved on to other relationships, but still thinking about each other.  We find out how intertwined their lives really are and spend the rest of the picture seeing if fate will indeed bring them together.I liked the movie but didn't love it.  It's great acting, especially by Jeremy Piven as Cusack's best friend and Eugene Levy as an annoying, but still helpful, Bloomies clerk.  This movie tries to capture that whole Sleepless in Seattle old school romance thing, but it just doesn't have the magic of earlier romantic comedies.  Now whether this is simply b\/c it wasn't there in the movie or I(and we as moviegoers) have seen this formula way too many times, I'm not entirely sure.  It's probably both b\/c this isn't a new concept romantic comedy, but it was the filmmakers' job to sell us this idea and in my opinion they didn't.  While there's definitely good things about this movie, there weren't enough for me to recommend this movie beyond rental status.  Now I will say this would be a great first date movie, as it raises a bunch of good questions is there fate?  Will fate bring you to your soulmate?  Is there a such thing as your soulmate and would you know it? It even goes into how to keep the love\/romance alive in a prolonged relationship.The romantic in me wanted this movie to be much more than it was, and it wasn't that my expectations were so high.  It's just that this movie is so low.

Pay it Forward is such.Trevor McKinneley (Haley Joel Osment) is starting seventh grade at his local public school.  When he arrives in Social Studies, he meets his new teacher Mr. Symmonett (Kevin Spacey).  He has a special plan for each class each year that he will tell them to find something to change the world and make it a better place.  Trevor is one who takes it very seriously.He immediately comes up with the concept of pay it forward.  To do someone a favor and instead of them paying it back to a person, they do someone else a favor and ask them to do the same.  Trevor finds a homeless man Jerry (Jim Caviezel) and gives him food and shelter for awhile at his own house where he lives with his mother (Helen Hunt).  She in semi-divorced to an abusive husband.  She is a recovering alcoholic who still turns to a bottle of whiskey that she hides.  When she discovers the stranger her son has brought home, she is shocked and furious.She goes to her son's school to confront the subject that Mr. Symmonett has bestowed.  After the anger passes, as in any film of this kind, a certain tension arouses.  Trevor makes an attempt to get them together. Eventually, a relationship has begun to grow.  All of this in in the midst of several things we have seen in film, TV, and more, and can get old, but it can be let to slide if the film is overall rewarding.The idea of pay it forward has become a failure from what Trevor has seen.

Soon, things are disrupted and Trevor's father appears.Trevor's mother feels she should give him another chance and drops what she has with Symmonett for the time being.  Then we discover why he has the burns he has.  That his father was abusive towards his mother, so he took a step to him.  As a result, casoline was poored on him and a match lit. This is suppose to be the persuason to talk her out of going back.  It is, of course, a sentimental and sapped seen whcich, again, we have seen many, many times before.  There is still hope however.Eventually, Mr. Symmonetts predictions were right and the husband is no better.  After this, it seems that the life improvement Trevor wanted is starting to come into tact.  His mother goes to visit her mother who is an alcoholic at the poverty lanes.  She makes peace with her and accepts her into the family.Finally, we come to a track of a very big step in which a reporter from LA comes to inform them that Trevor's concept has reached all over the country.

Mr. Symmonett and Trevor's mother come together and re-institute their relationship with affectionate passion.  Here, a nice movie.  One to bring a date on, even take your kids.  A feel-good movie.

The actors need to get their priorities starightened.  Gives film, what I live for, a bad name.

One of the most influential films of all time, in fact. But I still believe that it is overrated. The main problem is the story. It really doesn't captivate me. The story drags on and I really don't find myself caring at all about it. To add to that, I found that the acting really wasn't as outstanding as I had heard it would be. Many great things have been said about this film, and most of them are right.

Then the cable guy then forces Steven to be friends with him. He tries the hardest to make Steven his best friend. But then he no longer wants to be friends with his cable guy. That's when the stalking starts...Ok, maybe this isn't a horror film. But it's a comedy\/thriller\/drama. I think it just needs a review for those who haven't seen this, and needs to see it. I bought it Acouple of days ago, and I have seen if more then five times. It literally gets better each time I see it! I don't get why a lot of people hate this film, it's awesome!The Cable Guy is one of Jim Carrey's best movies to date. I don't get why most people hated this. When I first saw it in the theater I didn't like it... Mainly because I saw it just to see Jim Carrey be off the wall slapstick hilarious. But this is different, so I didn't like it when I first saw it... But each time I saw it after that, it just kept getting better, and better. This film just gets funnier each time you see it. The dark humor is excellent. Every one should give this a second chance if they hated it the first time you see it. It's not really HAHA funny, it's more... He's weird funny. Jim Carrey gives a great performance. We see he is truly insane. The acting is great. I'm not a big fan of Matthew Broderick, but this is still great. Lot's of clever scenes. Jim Carry facial expressions are awesome.This film has a lot of memorable scenes, and quotes... Some memorable scenes is the part where Jim Carrey sings Somebody to Love. Another scene is at the medieval times restaurant, let's not forget the basketball part. Let's not forget the whole ending, everything is great! I love it when he is on top of the satellite and he gives his little The Future is Now speech. Another great quote is when he says Dry land is not a myth. I've seen it. Kevin Costner. Waterworld. I don't know what the big fuss is about. I saw that movie nine times. It rules!Another thing I love is how the Cable Guy's whole world is like a movie. He thinks just about everything is a movie in his life. He some times gets stuck in the movie world, and he doesn't know what's real or not. This is one of the millions of reasons why this movie is brilliant, and thrilling.The musical score rocks! I love the song that is playing when he's playing basket ball, and the song that plays when he and Steven fight in Medieval times. Great musical score! This film reminds me about a lot of Hitchcock's films. Excellent thriller.Lot's of cool cameo's by famous actors. Andy Dick plays as the medieval guy. The director Ben Stiller has a reprising cameo. Great directing by Ben Stiller! Great acting by Jim Carrey. Everything is great!Ok... The dvd isn't that great. You get a flip sided, for wide screen or full screen. You also get screen selection, and 5.1 Dolby digital. Nothing to special on this dvd. It's to bare bones. They should make a special edition for this great film... It disserves better.All in all this is a great film. If you haven't seen it, see it. If you have seen it, see it again. If you have seen it and like it, buy it...10\/10 stars.
