[{"date":"26 May 2012","score":"","review":" Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band.Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs.Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony.Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she deserves it after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks...It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'.It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual.But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together.If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol.A movie that will brighten your day up.
