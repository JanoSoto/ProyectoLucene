The person who I felt most bad for is the grandma because she becomes paranoid and it's just hard to watch. However the other characters just go to jail, gets arm amputated, and the girl just becomes promiscuous.

I am a sucker for any samurai film, so I was really excited to see that Jim Jarmusch was directing a crossover film with samurai's and mafia families. I was very disappointed, I mostly think that I didn't like it because of the mood I was in. Also, I wasn't expecting this be an action film of any kind, I really expected it to be a philosophical kind of film. While it was very philosophical at times, most of the film was very boring and very weak at times. I feel so bad for giving this movie a four out of ten, it pains me to write this review. I personally don't think I get it. Maybe I do get it and this is just a bad film. Its not a film Im very angry at, its just a movie I was expecting more out of. What disappoints me the most is that this is directed by Jim Jarmusch. I am glad to see him doing different stuff like this, and he is a great director.

The Sheltering Sky is like a great body without a soul, a tragedy. What's the point of having the most dazzling and beautiful cinematography of all when you don't have a story to tell, don't have something to say and a purpose? Nothing. It knows how to relax your eyes both in a good and bad way; the good way being the most fantastic images and scenarios you'll ever gonna see; in the bad way because after one hour it starts to get boring, tiresome, pointless and it goes nowhere. Again, here's a story of people from the high class world (played by John Malkovich, Debra Winger, Campbell Scott and others) that seems to find a beautiful and intriguing place to live in Morocco, Africa, to finally realize that life's not that easy in places like this. If the main premise of the film was to show the difference between travelers and tourists then what I saw was that travelers are dumber than tourists who simply enjoy all the things of a foreign country and then they'll turn back home (as Winger explains in the beginning tourists go into a journey thinking of returning home right after they got in the new place). The tourists will have bad luck, all kinds of disease, infidelity affairs and other bad things.It is a good film to look at it, its visual, locations, culture, you feel in a different place, but in terms of story it's very empty, with no profundity at all. I expected more from Bertolucci and this film. But when your previous film win 9 Oscars and it's a art and historical masterpiece called The Last Emperor is very difficult to quite recover from there, to release something that touches the same grandiosity. The Sheltering Sky tries to be an epic but fails by being meaningless, just images and bored talks between characters. I'm not gonna say nothing about the performances because they weren't good neither bad, just too low considering other works. Gladly I haven't bought the DVD, but sometimes I wish because the images presented are so unique and wonderful that you simply have to watch it and try to hold it in your mind, for relaxations purposes.

It did not have to be awful--in fact, it ought to have been good. Many of the actresses in this film are excellent and are stars in their own right; the supporting cast of men looked solid.The acting was good. That was the only redeemable bit of the movie.The fact that Sandra Bullock can be watchable even in the dregs like this movie speaks more to her talent than the movie's success.If there is one theme however that films about women insist upon time and time again, however, it is that looks can be deceiving.The direction of this film was terrible. The editing was worse.The core story of this film--abusive mother becomes alcoholic in her old age after having raised a bipolar, far-too-straitlaced daughter.They yell, they scream, they have conflicts and they resolve them.Now, this movie could have been made in a new and exciting way. It could have been great. It could have really called our mothers to task for using alcohol as a coping mechanism for all and sundry, and it could have called ourselves to task for using work and lack of a social life as a way to avoid the past. It could have opened our eyes to the ways we fall into whatever relationship opportunities present themselves rather than make truly genuine and thus difficult decisions.It could have; it did not.The movie spent half its time in flashbacks, which has never particularly been a favorite story-telling mechanism of mine. It spent its entire middle engaged in fairly useless fighting between the main character's mother and fiancée and father, which wasted time. The flashbacks' significance or impact on Siddalee were rarely explained, leaving us to guess as to Why We Should Care. For those of us who did not grow up in the South, the sudden entrance into a way of life we had no familiarity with whatsoever was jolting, to say the least.

I thought they simply could not understand the beauty of such a multi-generational film. I thought they were just being jerks.I have since learned that they were right.This movie IS awful. It did not have to be awful--in fact, it ought to have been good. Many of the actresses in this film are excellent and are stars in their own right; the supporting cast of men looked solid.The acting was good. That was the only redeemable bit of the movie.The fact that Sandra Bullock can be watchable even in the dregs like this movie speaks more to her talent than the movie's success.If there is one theme however that films about women insist upon time and time again, however, it is that looks can be deceiving.The direction of this film was terrible. The editing was worse.The core story of this film--abusive mother becomes alcoholic in her old age after having raised a bipolar, far-too-straitlaced daughter.They yell, they scream, they have conflicts and they resolve them.Now, this movie could have been made in a new and exciting way. It could have been great. It could have really called our mothers to task for using alcohol as a coping mechanism for all and sundry, and it could have called ourselves to task for using work and lack of a social life as a way to avoid the past. It could have opened our eyes to the ways we fall into whatever relationship opportunities present themselves rather than make truly genuine and thus difficult decisions.It could have; it did not.The movie spent half its time in flashbacks, which has never particularly been a favorite story-telling mechanism of mine. It spent its entire middle engaged in fairly useless fighting between the main character's mother and fiancée and father, which wasted time. The flashbacks' significance or impact on Siddalee were rarely explained, leaving us to guess as to Why We Should Care. For those of us who did not grow up in the South, the sudden entrance into a way of life we had no familiarity with whatsoever was jolting, to say the least. There was little-to-no context given to any of the revelations meant to explain it all. There was too much the rest of the time.Meanwhile, no one stopped drinking, Siddalee never got the opportunity to actually confront her mother regarding her mother's abuses, and Siddalee's father never left the woman who tortured him for so long.Meaning, no one ever got the opportunity to be human--instead they became caricatures in a story 'bout how Forgiveness Heals All.This is a story about crazy white people doing crazy white people things and never acknowledging or even seeming to realize that the things they were doing were completely 100% insane and pointless.Nice job, y'all, and I DO mean that sarcastically.

After his aunt and uncle are killed Luke realises his destiny has been chosen for him and he and Ben are going to have to take on the empire, and from this point movie history will never be the same again.Much has been said about this movie and it almost feels redundant to discuss it, but, as it was the first film I saw at the pictures I feel almost duty bound to add my two penneth to the mix and so I will. This film was groundbreaking in terms of effects, but what we have learnt since Star Wars is that all the good effects in the world can't save a poor movie. The thing that makes this movie as damned good as it is, is the mixture of urgent direction, wonderful performances, a damned good script, that often gets blasted as being terrible, (If it was the film would also be terrible ...it isn't, ergo sum ...), a pioneering use of sound effects that really reinforce the more alien characters with a real sense of emotion (specifically Chewbacca and R2-D2) but of course the last big star of the movie is John Williams sweeping epic score, which even today is probably one of the greatest pieces of movie music ever.These days I understand why a film like Casablanca and Citizen Kane cannot be appreciated by a modern audience because they are so hailed for their enormity on their first appearance that it often cannot be re-experienced by viewers after that. The first time we watch Star Wars we don't actually know that there is anything but Jawas on Tatooine, or that Obi-Wan Kenobi (That wizard's just a crazy old man) is a secret bad-@ss or that Han Solo, good for nothing mercenary, is seen right through by Jedi Knight Ben Kenobi. We who experienced it the first time will always feel it again, but the modern audience, who know so much about the film, cannot.The film is full of classic moments, from Ben Kenobi's reveal, R2-D2's fall, Luke switching off his targeting computer, Han's constant irreverent humour, Ben's that's no moon, and a dozen more, but even after all these years my favourite moment is that knowing look that Ben gives Luke at the end of his duel with Vader. His wry smile and the blend of music and performance by both Hamill and Guiness is sensational and still gives me goose bumps now. Amazing.Since then the impact of the original three may have been watered down by the prequels, but as much as you can't polish a turd, you also cannot dim the brightest star.

That would be Homer Smith, an independent contractor who reluctantly gets roped by some German nuns into building a chapel for them having stopped near their convent initially to just get some water for his car. While he seems to get along fine with the others, Homer often has some choice words to say to Mother Superior Maria (Lilia Skala) especially concerning money and her ordering, comparing her at one point to Hitler. When the sisters stop at the outdoor mass, Smith stops at the nearby diner where he strikes up a friendly conversation with the proprietor, Juan (Stanley Adams), as they humorously discuss the sisters. Eventually, he leaves and then comes back, having gotten into trouble in between. He also offers his services to construction foreman Mr. Ashton (Ralph Nelson, this movie's producer\/director). There's more to the plot than what I just described but now I'll just say that while Poitier is quite funny and charming, his character's motives are not always clear especially in the beginning when he seems condescending to the nuns especially when teaching English and singing Amen to them (I put quotations on the word singing because the voice you hear when that is performed is actually that of Jester Hairston, the song's writer). Still, Sidney does give his usual good performance though I do not think it's one of his best, certainly not compared to No Way Out or A Raisin in the Sun. But, on the other hand, Lilies of the Field isn't too overly sentimental as I'd feared these last 30 years of just hearing and reading about it. So on that note, it's highly recommended. P.S. That initial conversation between Aston and Smith when they call each other boy was one of the most edgy things I've heard from an early '60s movie!

Still, Sidney does give his usual good performance though I do not think it's one of his best, certainly not compared to No Way Out or A Raisin in the Sun. But, on the other hand, Lilies of the Field isn't too overly sentimental as I'd feared these last 30 years of just hearing and reading about it. So on that note, it's highly recommended. P.S.

That would be Homer Smith, an independent contractor who reluctantly gets roped by some German nuns into building a chapel for them having stopped near their convent initially to just get some water for his car. While he seems to get along fine with the others, Homer often has some choice words to say to Mother Superior Maria (Lilia Skala) especially concerning money and her ordering, comparing her at one point to Hitler.

It's always a temptation, I suppose, for writers and directors to do something serious. Comedies are supposed to be all froth and no substance, while drama is to be paid attention to and applauded. But it's hard to blend the two. Woody Allan did it once or twice, as in Annie Hall. Shakespeare's dark comedies weren't as successful as either his comedies or his tragedies -- that's in my opinion anyway, and I happen to be the world's leading expert on Walter Shakespeare.In Wilder's case he made some straight dramas (Double Indemnity) and some exceptional straight comedies (Some Like It Hot). After 1960 he began to produce comedies with touches of sadness and they more or less worked. The Apartment was an example of this trend and so is Irma La Douce. Jack Lemon is the ex cop who inadvertently becomes the pimp of Shirley MacLaine, the eponymous Irma, in Paris. They fall in love of course. She insists on supporting him in the finest fashion but he grows jealous because, after all, every passerby is banging the woman he loves. MacLaine, possessed of greater savoir-faire, is puzzled by Lemon's discomfort.So Lemon borrows 500 francs from his friend Mustache, dresses up as an English nobleman, and in this disguise arranges to meet his girl twice a week and pay her enough money, just for playing solitaire, that she can dispense with all her other clients. Lemon, dumb as an ox, beams with pride as he pulls this stunt off, until Mustache reminds him that although money is now changing hands, none will be coming in. He borrows from Mustache, the phony Englishman gives it to MacLaine, she gives it to Lemon, and Lemon gives it back to Mustache. So in order to keep this system an open one, Lemon begins to sneak out of the flat and work all night in the market, an unsustainable effort. Then it gets complicated. Lemon is arrested for his own murder.It all comes together and works, in a stage-bound and slightly old-fashioned way, rather like Wilder's later The Front Page. The performances are very good indeed. MacLaine is matter-of-fact about her profession, very pretty, and sexy too, pale and slender. Lou Jacobi is Mustache and does fine with the role of the grandiose friend who teaches Lemon how to be British. But Lemon is superb as the nervous and exhausted lover. Andre Previn's score is lively or wistful, as the circumstances demand, though it may depend on Borodin.It's pretty funny and you'll probably enjoy it.

Mike has to convince brother and Ice Cream Man Reggie (Bannister) &#x96; yeah, an ice cream man who's more interested in saving a young boy than&#x85;never mind &#x96; that something's up at the mortuary and he does. After a little investigating, the evil thugs, that comes in all shapes and spheres, attack at will, whenever, wherever.This should be labeled as the first live-action Mike in Wonderland movie because whoever made this was seriously tripping. And if one were to follow it coherently and agree it's a well made film, is equally using. Eh, to each his or his own, and I have no problem with horror flicks that make up their own sense of reality and rules, but when you consistently break them, make new ones, and fade in\/out of the real world&#x85;I just find it uneven and sloppy writing.And don't get me started on the unanswered, incoherent and literal out-of-this-world revolution in the finale. Simply put they wrote themselves into a corner and felt this was the only way to explain everything, as if apologizing for writing something that even Stephen King, on his most strung out day of old, would say WTF!?
