[{"date":"17 February 2008","score":"","review":" Friendship. Love. Respect. Growing up. These are the themes that run throughout THE IRON GIANT, an Oscar Award winning animated film from 1999. Kids films without substance are very familiar to most parents, but The Iron Giant hearkens back to a time when family and friendship meant everything.Although unusual in the sense that a boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) befriends an alien robot simply called The Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel), this animated feature still teaches kids the responsibilities of friendship and how devastating it can be to lose one.The set-up is common in that we see the military and government agents as bumbling morons who misunderstand the intentions of something as large and as powerful as a nearly indestructible robot. But understanding eventually reaches them, too, through the actions of Hogarth and his new alien buddy.More interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers ...as well as a fatal ending (sort of). Parents should be prepared to comfort their kids when The Iron Robot launches himself into space in preparation to save his best friend (Hogarth). The words Superman are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words.But there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones. Watching fellow humans complain to the local constabulary about suddenly absent mouthfuls of trucks, towers, and other metal munchables is pretty comical, as is a great scene where The Iron Giant does a cannonball jump into a favorite swimming hole of Hogarth's.A fun and serious film with themes that most parents will find a positive influence on the pliable minds of their young ones.

Not the best movie ever made, but my personal all-time choice for the take one film to a desert island scenario, bar none. The plot line defies simple one-liner description, introducing us to the swaggering, wisecracking truck driver Jack Burton (Russell) whose friendship with a young restaurant owner in San Francisco's Chinatown (Wang Chi, unforgettably portrayed by Dennis Dun) leads him into a wonderfully over the top confrontation with an ancient Chinese sorcerer (Lo Pan, played by James Hong). A mix of comedy, fantasy and kung-fu action-adventure, Big Trouble in Little China is a wild ride, full of fun and excitement. Russell is magnificent, creating an unforgettable character in Burton, who is the polar opposite of the actor's other famous action-adventure hero, Snake Plisskin from Carpenter's Escape from New York. Where Plisskin is grim and taciturn, Burton is a character who never stops bragging and chattering for a second. (I always wished the two characters could have met -- they'd have hated each other in sight...) The rest of the cast ably supports Russell, at times even unabashedly stealing scenes from him, which he nimbly steals right back in cascading comedic fashion. The earnest, super- competent young Wang Chi is heroic enough to carry any kung-fu epic, especially when backed by the immortal Victor Wong as tour bus driver\/wise Chinese sorcerer Egg Shen. Jack is all brag and bluster, but his courage lives up to his swagger in the long run though he is hilariously out of his element as a back-street tough guy facing real magic, monsters and martial-arts mayhem the likes of which he never before imagined. Along the way Jack meets Gracie Law (Kim Cattrall), a crusading lawyer who finds herself attracted to Jack despite his incessant posturing when she sees the real hero inside him. The movie is nothing but fun from one moment to the next. I never tire of it, even after hundreds of viewings. This is a cult classic to rival such fan favorites as Buckaroo Banzai, Star Wars and Tremors -- a must-rent, must-own, must-watch-again-and-again wonder. Please let the remake artists leave this one alone -- it is perfection as it stands.

Now, before anyone calls the men in the white suits to come pick me up, I should add that I would have never watched it without the rifftrax commentary. The commentary turned what would have been an experience akin to visiting one of the seven layers of Hell into one of the funniest things I've ever sat through. Hysterical! The plot, not that it matters, involves recent high school graduate named Lucy (Britney Spears). Together with two other friends, they travel across country, each with a different goal for their trip. Along the way they discover the true meaning of friendship. (Did I just write that? What a load of crap!) I'm not sure who told Britney Spears she could act, but they should be drummed out of the entertainment industry post-haste. In a word, she's abysmal. Her co-stars don't fair much better, but with a script like this, anyone would look foolish. This thing is just wretched from the word Go. Crossroads is one painful experience.
