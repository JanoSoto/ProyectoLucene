The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle sounded so good on paper that I thought there is no way this could be a total dud. There are some funny moments but it's usually a bad pun from the cartoon character Bullwinkle, who is unknown to me. The best one was when the FBI-agent KS asks Can you rapell? and the answer Sure, I been repelling people for years. Well, back to De Niro. I think he made a mistake playing Fearless Leader. He seems ill at ease most of the time and when he finally parodies his most famous line You talking' to me it almost makes you wanna duck for cover. Sure, he is entitled to do so but with a German accent? He sounds like Dr. Nick Riviera (not German but still annoying). The constant smirk he has on his face is also disturbing.As for Rene Russo and Jason Alexander, they actually do a pretty good job. They are silly in just the right way and also a little touching in the scene where they consider giving up evil. Randy Quaid gets worse and worse in every film he's in (who would have thought that he once played Lyndon B. Johnson in the 80's). When he hikes up his pants at the end of the movie and says Good job. ... well, the less said about that the better. Finally, we get to Piper Perabo, who is completely unknown to me. She was in Coyote Ugly but I haven't seen that one. She could be Julia Roberts long lost sister. Same look, same smile, just with blonde hair. Like Roberts you can't really judge her before you have seen her in something more challenging than this.The cameos through the whole movie is mostly decorative, although i liked John Goodman's as a highway patrolman in a parody of Cops. Whoopi Goldberg as a judge named Cameo going nuts over Rocky and Bullwinkle is just plain stupid and finally Jonathan Winters in three different cameos is rather dull. So to sum up, the movie could have been great but silly puns and famous people does not a good movie make.

What director, Tom Dey, has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media. Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks How is this different from Cops?, when Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with De Niro's character, Mitch Preston (hilariously boring name by the way). That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't previously noticed.The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with Murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking Why would I do another movie playing a cop? Chase Renzi is portrayed to be a Hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again, she is merely doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. One line says it all Who doesn't want to be on TV? Maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film, merely set to entertain, but it does give it a little spin that I hadn't noticed before.As for Murphy. You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. One thing that I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. George Michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.So, I trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a big chance doing this.

Ernest Dickerson has a good grasp of the iconography of horror films, but he can't put them together well enough to make a good scary movie. He borrows concepts and images liberally from Clive Barker, Dario Argento, and Mario Bava - but all it shows is that he's a good copycat, not that he's a good stylist. From the idea of evil reviving itself by consuming a victim (Barker's Hellraiser, but cinematic ally dating at least back to Hammer's Dracula, Prince of Darkness from 1965), thru the rain of maggots (Argento's magisterial Suspiria), to the disembodied hand reaching out of the darkness to torment the dead man's lover (Bava's masterpiece, Whip and the Body), there really is nothing here that we haven't seen before and better. The conceit of setting it in a ghetto with an all-black cast promises an interesting variation on your basic revenge from beyond the grave scenario, but beyond the music and fashions it's still a pretty clichéd film. One of the problems is that Dickerson just can't seem to leave well enough alone - like the maggot scene. OK, it's raining maggots and it's terrifying, we get it already, is it really necessary to go for the gross-out by showing people EATING them? Or the scene where Maurice is killed - again, the dog-spirit eats Maurice to give form and substance to Bones' cadaver, we get it, it's not necessary to linger on the details of the chow-down. It's never scary - just disgusting. Even his attempts to inject humor are forced and heavy-handed, with the idiotic scenes of Bones carrying the heads of his victims and having them carry on an interminably pointless conversation. And again, he doesn't show it to us once, there's at least three long scenes with the chatty heads so whatever humor there was is pounded into unconsciousness thru repetition. But the most glaring problem with this movie is that we are asked to sympathize with a character who is, at bottom, just as big a bad guy in life as the crack dealers who murder him. Dickerson tries to show us Bones as the protector of his 'hood, but come on - he's exploiting his people just as much with his numbers game, or did it never occur to anyone to ask how Bones got the money for his supah-dupah fly crib when everyone else around him lives in complete poverty?

Ernest Dickerson has a good grasp of the iconography of horror films, but he can't put them together well enough to make a good scary movie. He borrows concepts and images liberally from Clive Barker, Dario Argento, and Mario Bava - but all it shows is that he's a good copycat, not that he's a good stylist. From the idea of evil reviving itself by consuming a victim (Barker's Hellraiser, but cinematic ally dating at least back to Hammer's Dracula, Prince of Darkness from 1965), thru the rain of maggots (Argento's magisterial Suspiria), to the disembodied hand reaching out of the darkness to torment the dead man's lover (Bava's masterpiece, Whip and the Body), there really is nothing here that we haven't seen before and better. The conceit of setting it in a ghetto with an all-black cast promises an interesting variation on your basic revenge from beyond the grave scenario, but beyond the music and fashions it's still a pretty clichéd film. One of the problems is that Dickerson just can't seem to leave well enough alone - like the maggot scene. OK, it's raining maggots and it's terrifying, we get it already, is it really necessary to go for the gross-out by showing people EATING them? Or the scene where Maurice is killed - again, the dog-spirit eats Maurice to give form and substance to Bones' cadaver, we get it, it's not necessary to linger on the details of the chow-down. It's never scary - just disgusting. Even his attempts to inject humor are forced and heavy-handed, with the idiotic scenes of Bones carrying the heads of his victims and having them carry on an interminably pointless conversation. And again, he doesn't show it to us once, there's at least three long scenes with the chatty heads so whatever humor there was is pounded into unconsciousness thru repetition. But the most glaring problem with this movie is that we are asked to sympathize with a character who is, at bottom, just as big a bad guy in life as the crack dealers who murder him. Dickerson tries to show us Bones as the protector of his 'hood, but come on - he's exploiting his people just as much with his numbers game, or did it never occur to anyone to ask how Bones got the money for his supah-dupah fly crib when everyone else around him lives in complete poverty?

Having seen it numerous times over the ensuing years, it stills holds a special place in my heart - and helped to launch my 'love of the movies' as a teenager. Bravo George Stevens!

Having read Mutiny on the Bounty, I was impressed by how accurate it was yet remained entertaining and compelling. The cinematography is a winner too!For a more realistic alternative to clichéd movies about sailors (be it pirates or submariners) this picture is indeed the best choice.
