[{"date":"5 December 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is another funny feel good Robin Williams movie. This is based on the real person Hunter (Patch) Adams. I have always thought Robin was more entertaining to watch when he is playing someone that is similar to his self. The real Patch Adams was a doctor who believed that treating the person first so that it could be a little easier to treat the illness. Sometimes when people get sick they don't get better, when you heal someones soul with a laugh or two it can sometimes make the end more dignified or lessen the amount of suffering. The death of a loved one is hard and when we know that their pain was eased because they didn't suffer as much when they died it can put us at ease too. Now days in the medical profession it can be easily wrapped up in treating a sickness that it can be forgotten to realize that there is a actual person and not just a number. This film all the more remarkable being a true story with a man who cherishes the chances to help people. The community at large do not agree with his practices and at every chance try to keep him from trying to help. Being the good hearted person he is and his stellar grades that seem to bring more criticism then praise keeps breaking the rules and sneaking into the hospital before his time. This and the appreciation from the patients and staff drive him even more to question authority and the status quo. The powerful message that this movie portrays is sometime breaking the rules when it's in the best interest of everyone can sometimes be a good thing. Robin knew in his heart that everyone needs to laugh every now and then and that laughter can sometimes be the best medicine. He also wasn't just a jokester or class clown he knew when to be serious and he treated all the people around him with respect and dignity. The way he lived would be recommended for everyone. There are some people who criticize the movie for being a big joke, or him being a jerk, or even that laughter is a cure for sickness. This movie doesn't really portray laughter as that. It says that if you have cancer and are going to die do you wanna die miserable and depressed or laughing. Its lessen the suffering and making life enjoyable again. There was a scene with a angry dying man with cancer who would throw things at the nurses, continuously kicking people out not wanting any help. Being the persistent and kind person he is he keeps trying to help the man showering him with kindness and jokes when finally the patient laughs and dies happy. All in all a funny heartwarming movie. See this if you like Robin Williams, comedies or positive movies.

With the tear jerking moments and the thoughtfulness of a little boy make this a great sentimental movie for most and possibly too unrealistic for others. You then think if it is unrealistic does it have to be can we make this a reality in our communities. While a 5th or 6th grader (Hayley Joel Osment) in a social studies class is given a difficult task to come up with a idea to change the world and to put it into action. That is where the idea of pay it forward is started. Osment does a first-rate job in this very emotionally charged role. Here you have a boy who does not have a father figure, does not really have a happy life. He has a emotionally unavailable mother who is a habitual alcoholic and struggles with two jobs. This leaves him with his own imagination to get him through his day. Which is projected well on screen as the fragile boy. The teacher played by Spacey fits him perfectly, his compassion, with a slight bitterness and at times is unpredictable and we cant help but feel engaged with his character. Although Hayley did a great job Spacey had some great dialogue. The way he attracts attention to his character and invites us in and then he spoils the experience with a single revelation. In this movie when he reveals how he got his scars are so dramatic and so perfectly retold that it brings a tear in your eye. Helen is just as superb as ever. The way she delivers her performance as a trailer trash, alcoholic that still has a alluring side to her. While she might not get the best pick of dialogue, she showed top form and added to the movie in a memorable way. Seeing her we may not long for her as our mom but we hope through the whole movie that she finds her way to take care of Trevor. You would think with a lot going against him you would then be wrong this only fueled his desire to help people and having a innocent view that maybe he can help his mom and teacher. He does end up succeeding in helping some people there even comes a TV story about him and the ripple effect he had on the people he helped and the people they helped. Watching this and living in the world we do today you see life is full of conflict and without paradoxes. Changing the world is a lot of work and takes conviction that not a lot of us have. You see a movie like this with a pie in the sky idea and you think this could never happen. It would go a long way if people were able to achieve this goal to make this suffering world a better place. If you have not been able to see this movie it is a must rent. You must take this movie under consideration and take the chance. With Trevors statement in the movie maybe we should try so we can see the whole world isn't really as bad as we may see. We all may want to mark our place in the world, but what would the world be like if we did a big favor to someone and they did the same to other people. I do wish they showed some more attention to the idea of pay it forward. But seeing in the end when the 2 big lives he helps change for the better. The end of the movie to a lot of people was not desirable I think it was necessary cause it ended up catapulting his idea. In conclusion this is more than a worthwhile film that shows a powerful message that there is good in the world and the differences one person can make. If you enjoy heart warming films then this is a absolute must watch. If you are tired of the same old rehashed movie ideas, unoriginal movies then another reason to see this. As the title says don't thank someone for telling you about the movie pay it forward and tell others.

Many years before American Pie came along, this little treasure did. The actors here, most who never went on to anything, are so good and damn believable, they simply melt into their characters. Sadly one actor, Wyatt Knight, a.k.a. Tommy Turner, the impish teen who was always at war with Ms Beulah Ballbreaker, the overweight female soccer coach, topped himself last year as suffering from some cancer. One guy, pee wee (Dan Monahan) the laughing butt of his friends, wants so desperately to get laid, one classic hoax scene near the start of the movie, has him scared out of his wits, running down a highway, naked. He even has a penis chart he keeps tabs on. At the advice of one of their friends, where his own advice nearly gets him half dead, they head to this bordello out in the Florida glades run by fat corrupt owner, Porky, who's brother runs the sheriff house next door, just as corrupt. Porky's promising them a night to remember, rips them off, the most cheesed off of the boys, Mick (Roger Wilson?). The Sheriff even smashes up Mick's car a little, to stretch his warning, to never return. Mick goes back and back, obsessed with getting even with Porky, the second time, the most dramatic, with him ending up in the hospital, so a certain revenge awaits, as the boys of Angel Beach with a help from authorities (Mick's brother a cop) get revenge, two fold and pee wee finally gets laid. Porky's is not all a comedy. It has a little drama, where a little is to be said about racism too. One of the new kids, Brian, a Jewish boy, isn't accepted by one of the mob, Steve, because of this. But we see why. Steve's dad, a real piece of .... has drummed it into him as well as his fists where he's a regular punching bag of his Dad's. Porky's is better than a lot of sex comedies, whether it's Up The Creek, Where The Boys Are, or the unbelievably cheesy and degrading, Screwballs. It's a sex comedy on a higher plane of worth, dealing with real characters and real issues. The eye peeking scene through the girls shower block is funny, but what will really crack you up, so much, you almost feel like you're having a heart attack is the next one. Ms Beulah Ballbreaker, such a miserable so and so, who pulled onto something she shouldn't of, is describing to the small and gawky principal, 70's, in great length the incident, but more so her plan of strategy which has the three basketball coaches in the background, in fits of laughter as this scene will have you. It's one of the funniest scenes in movie history. One head, drowning in a bowl of chili scene, may put you off it for good, plus witness the world's biggest rubber, that fits perfectly over Pee Wee's head.

Many believe that Wayne made this film, like the character, knowing that he was dying but apparently that wasn't the case but even so he managed to get talent like Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard, Hugh O'Brien, John Carradine, Richard Boone, Scatman Crothers and James Stewart to appear. Apparently Wayne had more filmed lined up before his death three years later but none of them ever came to be and that's probably a good thing because THE SHOOTIST really sends the legend out on a very high note. I say this because so many legends end their careers with bad or at best mediocre movies but at least the biggest movie star in the history of cinema got to go out on top. A lot of the greatness here has to go to Wayne who is simply wonderful in the role of the dying man. I think Wayne's heartfelt performance here also adds to the myth that he knew he was dying because you really do feel as if you're watching someone on their final days. It's quite a tender performance but that toughness is still there and believable. The supporting players all fit their roles nicely and there's no question it's very nice seeing Wayne act with them one final time. Director Don Siegel does a very good job at keeping the film moving in between the action scenes and he does a very nice job with the more quiet moments. THE SHOOTIST is also a throwback to the Westerns that Wayne was making earlier in his career but there's no doubt that the actor got to go out on top, which is certainly fitting.

Reeves - Jack Traven - the hot hotshot SWAT guy (oh the uniform!) who's a bit gung-ho daredevil deeply nuts next to the brilliant Daniels - Harry Temple - calm and measured, very sensible partner, apparently the brains of the duo, Hopper - Howard Payne - is the bad guy - and that's not a spoiler, you find that out in the first ten seconds of film and he plays crazy not stupid wannabe 'eccentric' very well, and Bullock - Annie apparently has the surname Porter but I'm sure it's not mentioned in the film - the useful pretty suspended-license-passenger who drives the city bus and keeps it above 50! Great chemistry between Bullock and Reeves, and whilst you can see she's acting in places, she's a fabulous gentle foil for hard macho character and almost makes him see that people are frail as he's so used to throwing himself around. Amazing and poignant scene where Jack gives up for a short while, and she calms him... goosebumps. And more goosebumps later in the scene where he didn't have anywhere to be just then and doesn't leave her ...The action doesn't let up.

The answer was simple to make another movie just like Goldfinger!Guy Hamilton, the director of Goldfinger, were brought back to direct Diamonds Are Forever the eighth Bond movie overall, and the seventh EON Bond film to be made. The movie was based on Ian Fleming's fourth James Bond novel of the same name. After Lazenby had bowed out of the series, the producers went to Sean Connery waving with a huge paycheck, and Connery eventually agreed to return as James Bond! So we had Guy Hamilton and Sean Connery back in action! What could possibly go wrong? The movie itself is the answer to that question...The movie starts out with Bond hot on the trail of Blofeld... like in the previous movie. Bond is eager to get revenge on Blofeld, in return for Bond's dead wife. We are just thrown into the plot with no explanation. The pre-credit sequence isn't exiting at all... it's just a rushed little revenge story, that doesn't really work very well. The rest of the movie centers around an international diamond smuggling ring, that Bond is meant to infiltrate and in the end... follow the trail of the diamonds. It's not a bad plot. But the movie quickly pulls you away from all of that and begins to concentrate about random stuff like James Bond in a circus and Blofeld dressing in drag. It's just so dumb and lame that I don't even want to comment more on that. In the end the plot is decent, but the execution is lame and dumb.Sean Connery returns for his sixth and last appearance as James Bond, and even he is lacking! He just seems bored like never before, and he was really to old to play the part at that age! But I don't blame him. Connery had clearly moved on from the role of James Bond, and while it was a shame, it's also fair. Connery had already given us 5 remarkable and fantastic performances as James Bond, and he created probably the most beloved character in cinema history! It's a shame that he finished his Bond era with this piece of crap! But Sean Connery is Sean Connery, and the stars I have given this movie is most to his glory! Jill St. John plays Tiffany Case and she has got to be one of the worst Bond girls ever. She can't act, and her chemistry with Connery just seems awkwardly out of place. At least she is very beautiful! Charles Gray (who also played Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice) is our main villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. And he sucks! Don't get me wrong, Gray is a good actor but he should have been remembered for his supporting role in You Only Live Twice, and not for this! This movie is the absolute low point for the character of Blofeld. Gray's Blofeld is just some jerk, with a big and cheesy cowboy smile on his face, who clones himself. Hell, he even wears drag in this movie! This is not the epic Blofeld we were introduced to in the previous James Bond- outings! Lana Wood plays Plenty O'Toole, and boy is she sexy and also weak. Her acting is non-existent and so is her chemistry with Connery! Bruce Glover and Putter Smith is the homosexual henchmen of the film. Their portrayals are a bit homophobic, but as villains they're creepy enough, I suppose. They're OK. Norman Burton is fourth and the worst Felix Leiter ever to have been portrayed. Burton basically created a comedic character that wasn't funny. We do have the awesome trio Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell returning, respectively.Diamonds Are Forever is one of those movies, that I don't have anything particular nice to say about. It's just so dumb. And while some movies are dumb but kind of entertaining (Moonraker and Die Another Day) this one isn't even the slightest entertaining. So it's both dumb, bland and boring. There isn't even a single character in the movie that I like, except for James Bond and all of the other recurring characters! Guy Hamilton seems to have completely forgotten how to make a good Bond movie! Goldfinger is probably my favorite Bond movie, while this is definitely my least favorite! There's a big difference considering they both come from the same director! How this movie has a higher rating on IMDb than License To Kill is beyond my imagination! But it is a Bond movie, and I have a very strong bond to the movies, so I always kind of enjoy watching it even though I still hate it. The movie has aged well, you could say.

The answer was simple to make another movie just like Goldfinger!Guy Hamilton, the director of Goldfinger, were brought back to direct Diamonds Are Forever the eighth Bond movie overall, and the seventh EON Bond film to be made. The movie was based on Ian Fleming's fourth James Bond novel of the same name. After Lazenby had bowed out of the series, the producers went to Sean Connery waving with a huge paycheck, and Connery eventually agreed to return as James Bond! So we had Guy Hamilton and Sean Connery back in action! What could possibly go wrong? The movie itself is the answer to that question...The movie starts out with Bond hot on the trail of Blofeld... like in the previous movie. Bond is eager to get revenge on Blofeld, in return for Bond's dead wife. We are just thrown into the plot with no explanation. The pre-credit sequence isn't exiting at all... it's just a rushed little revenge story, that doesn't really work very well. The rest of the movie centers around an international diamond smuggling ring, that Bond is meant to infiltrate and in the end... follow the trail of the diamonds. It's not a bad plot. But the movie quickly pulls you away from all of that and begins to concentrate about random stuff like James Bond in a circus and Blofeld dressing in drag. It's just so dumb and lame that I don't even want to comment more on that. In the end the plot is decent, but the execution is lame and dumb.Sean Connery returns for his sixth and last appearance as James Bond, and even he is lacking! He just seems bored like never before, and he was really to old to play the part at that age! But I don't blame him. Connery had clearly moved on from the role of James Bond, and while it was a shame, it's also fair. Connery had already given us 5 remarkable and fantastic performances as James Bond, and he created probably the most beloved character in cinema history! It's a shame that he finished his Bond era with this piece of crap! But Sean Connery is Sean Connery, and the stars I have given this movie is most to his glory! Jill St. John plays Tiffany Case and she has got to be one of the worst Bond girls ever. She can't act, and her chemistry with Connery just seems awkwardly out of place. At least she is very beautiful! Charles Gray (who also played Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice) is our main villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. And he sucks! Don't get me wrong, Gray is a good actor but he should have been remembered for his supporting role in You Only Live Twice, and not for this! This movie is the absolute low point for the character of Blofeld. Gray's Blofeld is just some jerk, with a big and cheesy cowboy smile on his face, who clones himself. Hell, he even wears drag in this movie! This is not the epic Blofeld we were introduced to in the previous James Bond- outings! Lana Wood plays Plenty O'Toole, and boy is she sexy and also weak. Her acting is non-existent and so is her chemistry with Connery! Bruce Glover and Putter Smith is the homosexual henchmen of the film. Their portrayals are a bit homophobic, but as villains they're creepy enough, I suppose. They're OK. Norman Burton is fourth and the worst Felix Leiter ever to have been portrayed. Burton basically created a comedic character that wasn't funny. We do have the awesome trio Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell returning, respectively.Diamonds Are Forever is one of those movies, that I don't have anything particular nice to say about. It's just so dumb. And while some movies are dumb but kind of entertaining (Moonraker and Die Another Day) this one isn't even the slightest entertaining. So it's both dumb, bland and boring. There isn't even a single character in the movie that I like, except for James Bond and all of the other recurring characters! Guy Hamilton seems to have completely forgotten how to make a good Bond movie! Goldfinger is probably my favorite Bond movie, while this is definitely my least favorite! There's a big difference considering they both come from the same director! How this movie has a higher rating on IMDb than License To Kill is beyond my imagination!

Written entirely through the medium of letters and journal entries, it is an intimate tale that is spine chilling in it's intensity. It doesn't rely on gratuitous frighteners, but plays on all our deepest darkest fears, the things that go bump in the night and not being safe anywhere against this kind of threat, and losing our mortal souls.The film captured the feel and nature of the book well. With Gary Oldman in the titular role - a very talented actor - and he played it elegantly and with a lot of style. Winona Ryder played Mina\/Elisabeta, his star-crossed lover. I've always admired her and she suited the period nature of this film, and I liked the semblance of innocence in her way of playing her character compared to her worldly friend Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost). There's a lot that was a little cheesy, and the acting wasn't the best - everyone seemed to play it a little hammy. Much was made of some of the English accents in the film (ie how bad they were) by Reeves and Ryder but I'm afraid I judge the Director for not picking up on them. There's a lot that's a bit silly in the film, and the accents weren't the worst of it. Even the great Hopkins (Helsing) was touched by the silly-stick and played up his role to the nines. In short it certainly wasn't a dry production as he also ramped up the arrogance and insanity of his role too. At the time of release much was also made of the bestiality scene between Dracula in his wolfman form and Lucy in the garden, I have to say she was brave to take on that! It's shocking, a little, the first time you see it but it's really not bad. The famous Renfield (Tom Waits) was cringeworthily gross, as the craven and mad slave of Dracula. Reeves as the long-suffering Jonathan Harker was not at his best in this, but how do you research walking into a client's home to find he's crazy beehive haired vampire? He comes across out of his depth in this, and I don't know why. He's well cast as Harker, though, he suits the period gentility and properness exceedingly well, but perhaps he was playing up his discomfiture about his character's predicament (justified!) - especially finding himself in bed with three blood-smeared wenches! So much of this film was great, though, despite the over-the-top acting, laughable at times, but it works.Very well. This story is frightening, but it's not in the way that typical horror movies are, and the humour helps you manage it, but there is also intense love and seduction in this story; it is mainly a love story after all. The poignant scene where Mina meets Dracula and a wolf escaped from the zoo walks in... lovely. So much deeper than cheap horror. Victorian sensibility had the Vampire at odds with God, his immortal soul lost to salvation. Prior to Stoker vampires were vile loathsome creatures but he made them magical illusory and a seductive beauty who tempted impressionable young ladies into his eternal death. The film gives room for the spiritual morality tale, accurately and with a sense of the hugeness of what it represented; Vlad Dracula turning his back on God as he felt he had been abandoned after losing his love. Finally, the music used in the film was very good - Love Song for a Vampire by Annie Lennox was superb - and the costumes were stunning, particularly the dresses Winona Ryder got to wear. It's a beautiful film, if you see past the dripping yowling toothy wenches and Monica Bellucci stealing babies.

It is a comedy but the comedy is a lot more subtle than anyone may think.It is about a crook who meets a thief and they fall in love but then they plan schemes that are so big it is amazing how easy they seem to be. They plan an operation that would capture a fair amount of cash, and some jewels, from the heiress and boss of the first cosmetic (in those days it was mainly perfume) business in Paris and probably the world. It sounds like L'Oreal so much that the only difference between the young widow who is heading the business and Ms Bettencourt who has finally been court-ordered out of freely managing and using her money is their age.Yet that did not prevent the gay photographer who had been her late husband's lover to take her over and manipulate her like a piece a play dough. Never too old to be submitted to that game.The second difference is that the crooks are a couple and the danger for them is that the man may fall for the heiress, really fall I mean, and that solution is caressed for a short while but the dramatic suspense it creates is short lived in the end.The third interest is that the film clearly shows how the main board member of the business is using his position to enrich himself with discrete transfers from the business accounts to his own knowing that the heiress or boss or widow will never understand the procedure but the new secretary who is the crook and thief who infiltrated the business to get to the lady's safe knows about it at once and can reveal it. It takes a crook to know another.But then how funny it is to see the victim of all these rotten crooks refusing to call the police because of the scandal it would create. They did not know yet that a good and deep scandal is the best publicity for a business, as long as the scandal does show any support to the wrong side, and there Lubitsch is a very subtle man. The crooked board member who is stealing from the business on a regular basis has a secret first name he does not like. In 1932, guess twice what it could be? Adolf of course, and even if you write it the French way Adolphe it does not change and in the film it sounds just like Adolf, the other Adolf of 1932 who was starting to loom high over Europe.But a funny film after all far from such political considerations.

I don't know whether it's because this is directed by a woman (Bigelow) but it plays out differently to a lot of other action films; it's got more plot, emotion and variety to most, the characters are portrayed as fuller more rounded figures, and certainly in this you aren't sure whether the bad guys are as bad as all that. The lines are hazy, and this is the crux of the plot, and Bodhi (Swayze) is such a charismatic character, in life as on film, and Swayze was born to play this role - he is perfect, and plays the right mix of sensei idealist and slightly bonkers fanatic beautifully.It is one of my top ten films of all time, it having Patrick Swayze AND Keanu Reeves has something to do with it (a lot) but it's just such a rip-roaring ride, and has some epic scenes - the first sky-dive scene is almost ballet! The surfing is great too, and there are some lovely artist wave riding scenes. It's realistic, not overly stylised, and it isn't all Hollywood. It's original and much copied (Fast and Furious is almost identical) and I don't understand why it didn't do better in terms of awards and recognition.Point Break is a step away character-wise for Reeves, and was apparently a risk for Bigelow casting him as action-man and from the opening scene of 100% Utah! he's action all the way and he does it well with a physicality that impresses. He's a perfect 'partner' for Swayze who was always known for his physical prowess, and the chemistry between them seems really genuine. John C McGinley is awesome as Ben Harp, the Captain, and as in Scrubs does some incredible monologues at speed, vein throbbing in his head. Hilarious. The interaction between him, Utah and Pappas (Busey in a great role) is the comic relief. Lori Petty (Tank Girl) is well cast in this. She works well with Reeves and makes for fluid interlude between the action\/cop shots, weaving in and out of the story as part of the central theme but also outside of it.The writing is flawless, and all the primary actors bring it to life cleanly. Some great quotable lines in this, my personal favourite being, Utah, you're about to jump out of a perfectly good aeroplane, how d'you feel about that? This is a cult classic and rightly so - one of the best movies of the early 90s. The only reason not to like this film is if your film watching sensibilities don't extend to nudity, bad language and violence; the worst of it in the one scene in the middle where the stake-out goes down. You can fast forward that bit but you'll love the rest, I'm sure of it.

Her performance was so captivatingly bad that it was difficult for you not to notice. The good thing is that you will probably be watching it on DVD so you can skip forward any scene she is in, because her presence in the movie and all her lines could have been deleted and the movie will still be good to watch.The movie stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire who reprise their roles from the first two films as Michael, Kay and Connie. Robert Duvall however refuses to be in the movie due to a salary dispute.The movie plot takes off in 1979 like 20 years after the end of the second part, with Michael (Al Pacino) old and nearing retirement.His Children Anthony and Mary grew up with his wife after she got custody when she and Michael divorced. Tony his son did not want to have anything to do with his father's business, this withdrawal by Tony left a gap in the Corleone family and Michael had to mentor his brother's son Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) for a role he would have preferably given to Tony. Vincent like his father Sonny was hot tempered and acted before thinking, this led to a dispute between him and Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) who handles some of the Corleone family business interest.With Michael's life nearing an end he trains his new successor Vincent to take his place but Michael was not prepared for the tragic end to his era as the Godfather, an end that left him alone and with nothing.The movie was a commercial success, and received mixed reviews. It however didn't win any Academy awards unlike its predecessors who won the Academy Awards of Best Picture during their release and also other notable Academy Awards.
