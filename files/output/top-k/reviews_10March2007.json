It was a time where focus was spent on money, fame and fortune, rather than talent and a decade that introduced the rise of the sequel. It was also a very popular decade for horror films, particularly slasher films and yet there are very few exceptional horror achievements from the '80s. I've never been too fond of horror as a genre. I find it a clichéd and unproductive genre; although it is a genre that has so much going for it and when done accurately you might be lucky enough to have the pleasure a skin-crawling masterpiece. You see, horror needs imagination and originality to work; it has to blend genre elements together to craft something genuinely unique. Horror is a genre that has so much to offer. Alas, it is a sad fact when you acknowledge just how little is accomplished due to focus on spawning money-laundering, gore-filled sequels. Yet, there is something so appealing about Wes Craven's triumphant '80s classic&#133;A Nightmare on Elm Street is crafted around the now infamous bogeyman story, which has become somewhat globalising by marketing sequels and Halloween costumes. The film follows the story of a group of suburban American teens who are being stalked in their dreams by a murdered, superficial serial-killer named Freddy Krueger. So the teens decide to fight against the creature inside their dreams. The film is centred on a heroine (a popular Wes Craven trend, e.g. Scream) and oddly reminisces specific elements of John Carpenter's masterpiece Halloween. A Nightmare on Elm Street undoubtedly has its flaws, although these are flaws that are disguised by some of the truly brilliant factors that the film holds. Yes, it has become somewhat dated, yes, the young actors\/actresses hold nothing special performance wise, yes, the film is at times cheesy and yes the script is extremely bland. But when you have the brilliance of a film where the editing manages to create a parallel universe, thereby the dimension of reality and dream-state are fused together (the viewer notes the film's dimension through subtleties in the direction) creating a horribly surreal and literal nightmare. A Nightmare on Elm Street is extremely intelligent in the way it wants to attack your sub-conscious. This is another method at creating a lasting fear for viewers unnerved by the actual viewing of the film and rather will be thinking about it when they are ready to fall asleep. Fact is, everyone can relate to A Nightmare on Elm Street due to the fact that everybody has had nightmares and this is the reason for it being considered (for some) a terrifying film.Filmed on a low-budget and using a mixture of dizzying camera techniques A Nightmare on Elm Street does not stop at being unique. The use of a few set-pieces and masterful props are perfect at creating the atmosphere for a horror film. There is a strong use of poignant lighting and shadow techniques scattered throughout the film. These take wonderful focus on the grotesque make-up for the iconic villain Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven uses sly editing processes and music to delve inside the film's story. The narrative has been paced at a steady speed, never feeling rushed and unnecessary meaning that you are inside the tension throughout the entire running-time. There is an amusing touch of dark comedy littered throughout the film, primarily gained from Krueger's insane antics. It really is a shame that Hollywood is obsessed with making unnecessary sequels to solid films which get away with unexpected climaxes and open endings. The American film industry seems to be obsessed by the idea of having everything wrapped up in a tight package for today's audiences. If you want a highly entertaining, influential, iconic and productive horror film then look no further than A Nightmare on Elm Street. It remains fantasy horror at the top of its game and a respectful ode to '80s cinema.

The film opens with two travelers, David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne), who are walking on foot in the middle of nowhere. After stopping into an English tavern, they depart again, but Jack is savagely killed by a beast, and David suffers a bite wound. The beast is killed, but soon after the horrifying incident, David begins to have some very strange things happen to him. He begins seeing his mutilated, dead friend, Jack, talking to him as if he were still alive. Turns out that David is now a werewolf himself, and when the sun goes down and the full moon lights up the night sky, he transforms into a beast himself, and begins unintentionally killing people in the London area.This film is probably the strangest mixture of comedy and horror that I've seen - but there is no problem here, because it works. Blending these two genres is tough, because both are very extreme and opposite of each other. One would think that a werewolf film mixing these genres could easily be a mess, but this film works quite well. The storyline is based around a werewolf, which while it isn't a completely original idea, still remains unique because of the remaining elements in the plot. It's far from your typical werewolf film, and I liked that about it a lot. It's clever, spooky, and really all well-written, and this is proved with it's versatility. It can be very scary and times, but remains darkly hilarious throughout. This is not a surprise though, with the film being from the guy who directed the college-campus comedy classic, Animal House a few years before working on this project.This film isn't all laughs though, there is plenty of horrific moments to be had here. The first attack (in which Jack is ultimately killed by the werewolf) is scary as hell and completely unexpected. The scary moments in the film are mainly (and expectedly) during the werewolf scenes, and there is quite a bit of gore to be seen too for any of those gore fans out there. There is also some very stunning makeup effects, primarily being the werewolf transformations. Computer generation didn't exist in 1981, but the makeup and special effects (all handcrafted) are truly amazing, even more so considering the time they were created. The cast is led by David Naughton, who isn't the best actor ever, but it doesn't really matter. He plays the character believably enough and is very funny. Jenny Agutter is the female interest, and is also very good in her role, and Griffin Dunne plays David's dead best friend, providing quite a few hilarious one-liners, despite his grisly post-mortem makeup.While it isn't for all tastes, An American Werewolf In London is arguably one of the best werewolf movies ever made, or at least one of the best in a very long time. This film blends two genres together just right, invoking both scares and cringes, and some good laughs as well. While it may be a bit of a strange combination, it works. Recommended for those who don't mind their horror served with a side of comedy. 9\/10.

While I must admit I am nostalgic about this as it was an important part of my childhood I did think the film still has that certain something about it. I can't understand what some people want with effects these days, and I agree with some of the comments here; the effects in the film look better, stylistically, than many modern films. You still can't beat a good model and good lighting, there's something about the human eye that can still, at the moment anyway, tell computer generated graphics a mile away and they are never totally satisfying.As for the plot, I'd forgotten how dark it was and it's worth watching again just to get that feel for it. Also in those days, and I guess this may insult some of the people that have written comments here, but frankly when I was young, we could actually, like...sit down and like, actually...watch a film and take in the dialogue without getting bored. My generation could do that you know! That's what surprised me with watching it so many years later, all the intense action really is in the last twenty minutes or so and the film builds up pretty nicely up to the end. There is a sinister mood to this which must have influenced me as a child but was too young to fully pick up on what was happening, for those of you that are older and remember the black robots you'll see what I mean.As for the ending, what a bold move that was! I've read numerous points about what the end is actually supposed to mean but even so, you don't get many films that end as ambiguously as that these days. It's so much the better for it.If you haven't seen it in a while, take a trip down memory lane. If you're a Sci-Fi buff, give it a whirl as parts of if are thought provoking. If you're a modern film viewer looking for popcorn type entertainment it's probably best not to bother, you'll end up disappointed. But if you do, remember this was a Disney film, trying to strike a balance to ensure it was real family entertainment and yes, it does absorb a lot of ideas and styles from other films of the decade. Nonetheless there still is something creepy about Maximillian...

But the movie as a whole is just OK. Not dreadful, definitely interesting but something seems a bit lacking. I wouldn't call this a great movie but it's moderately involving although it develops slowly.Cusack and Thornton both turn in good performances as do Jolie and Blanchet as the wives. I really really thought Billy Bob was incredible and he jumped out at me the most. It was weird watching this because it came out a long time ago and seeing Jolie and Blanchett was a kick. I thought they were both great in somewhat small roles though Cate's was larger then Jolie's. The part of the confused Nick could have been tailor made for Cusack but it is Billy Bob who comes close to stealing the film at times as the complex and quiet Russell.Pushing Tin, even though it had a great cast, with complex characters doing fascinating work, wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be. First off, it takes a rather long time to get going(there were times the movie didn't really seem to have much of a plot) and even once it does get going it drags at times. And the brief bits of the air traffic controllers themselves, hard at work, were so involving I wished there were more of those scenes. Ultimately the rivalry between Nick and Russell was not all that interesting, it was more on the obnoxious side and came this close to actually being rather dull. It did become interesting when Nick goes to visit Russell in Colorado. In fact the scene by the water is just great. But it takes SO very long to get there and a lot of what happens along the way isn't terribly interesting. I didn't like Nick very much at all through most of the movie although that changed a bit after the above mentioned scene with Thornton. But there was a flatness to a lot of the movie, and a lot of it didn't seem to flow real well either. I was rather disappointed.Ultimatelty I wish the story had focused less on the power struggle of Nich and Russell and more on the relationships between all the people. The moments where the audience sees these people on the job are thrilling but there's not enough of them. And I wish there had been more characters and a different sort of main plot. I don't think this is dreadful or even bad. I would give it a 6 or 6.5 of 10. I don't think this is the type of film where one would turn it off mid stream but I do think it could have been better.

Seeing it today I'm reminded of the classic work Bob Rafelson, director, and Nicholson did back in the 70s, even if they already reached their peak on their first film, Five Easy Pieces. But at the least Blood and Wine represents a return to form for Nicholson under the director he worked with most, either as actor or writer (he co-wrote Head), especially in the F.E.P. role of a SOB, which, of course, is usually as easy for Nicholson as raising up his eyebrows. His character, Alex, is a criminal, but not a very good one, as he isn't entirely able to balance out his goals as a jewel thief and as an adulterer with Lopez's Gabriella. It doesn't help that his wife (Judy Davis) has a son from a previous marriage (Stephen Dorff), who has it in for Alex big-time. Meanwhile, that jewel necklace is almost up in the air, and all his craggy partner, Vic (Michael Caine), can do is cough a lot and act more as a dumb muscle than as a consummate professional.So in these ingredients, Rafelson and his writers have a classic, cooked-up noir with enough style by its actors and locale to make up for what would be considered 'too violent' to show back in the forties (probably too sexy too, what with Lopez's 'assets'). Rafelson knows this material needs the best cast, and assembled is the best cast for the job, where desperation, greed, proper morality and just a moment of piece of mind get shifted around but are always the constants that all these characters. Nicholson is, well, Nicholson, cold to the bone but also a great liar, violent, passionate, but won't stop till he gets his way. He's not breaking new ground or setting up himself for the usual awards circuits, but it's still very cool to see him playing Alex as believable work of sleaze, almost in the tradition of Bogart (he actually does just as good, if not better, here than he did in Rafelson's 'Postman' remake). Dorff, meanwhile, could be considered the weakest link with a cast like this, but he holds his own fairly well within his character's basic lines, especially when considering the roles he'd have to take later on. Caine is a natural at playing against type, which doesn't really exist for him, and disappears into this pragmatic but vicious parolee. And actresses like Davis and Lopez fit into their roles in the noir mood with equal levels of ease. I wish I could see Lopez in more roles like this where we might not believe totally her intentions for either of the men in her life, but is not necessarily cruel like the old femme fatales either.Released, as they say, under the radar back in 96, Blood and Wine uses its Miami and Florida locales like they're still lush and lustful and engaging, and the danger here isn't diminished from what's usually expected in the urban cities and dark alleys. Rafelson's got his A-game on here with an enjoyable story where we can guess pretty much where it will lead- the wills of men tested head-to-head- but it's a lot of harsh fun getting there.

Such people, like Luis Bunuel back in 1929 when he did UN CHIEN ANDALOU, live in their own Universe and It moves at its own pace.

Even when it touches certain themes best left for the Marquis de Sade (such as coprophagia, rape, incest, dismemberment, voyeurism, bestiality) it does so in such a balls-out hysterical way it's impossible to take it seriously.

Spain has Almodovar, but there was a time when he was daring to go that extra mile and rip the concept of what a movie should be to shreds, before he became a respected director and has gone to mainstream yet high quality films. England had Jarman. We still have John Waters, and thanks to him, we can enjoy the Hunh? kind of movie that PINK FLAMINGOS is.Give an extremely subversive, creative person enough freedom of expression and a camera and you will have a bona fide movie director. Way back in a time before the advent of YouTube and viral videos, you had those people who genuinely, despite their almost nonexistent academic knowledge of cinema per compounded many times over by this genius that, like the fire which burns Divine's trailer down, raged through their finished product, had something special -- something indescribable, indefinable -- that made them automatic cult figures and icons-to-be for an entire future generation.It didn't make them a threat to the movie industry and it doesn't now. Such people, like Luis Bunuel back in 1929 when he did UN CHIEN ANDALOU, live in their own Universe and It moves at its own pace. John Waters could hardly be called anything at all his movie, which premiered nearly 35 years ago, was greeted with dazed reaction. Some called it the best thing since CRIES AND WHISPERS. Some called it trash. Pure filth. People didn't really know what to make of it then, and even now, when purportedly we've come a long way, it stands on its own pedestal, defies explanation, defies a rating, and shrieks out its outrageousness by ways of the furious persona of Divine who does things that can only be summarized in one word gasp.What plot there is, well, here it goes Babs Johnson (Divine), also known to tabloids as the Filthiest Person Alive lives in a trailer outside Baltimore with her son\/lover Cracker and her daughter Cotton. Another couple, the Marbles, have plans of becoming themselves the Filthiest People Alive. They run an illegal baby ring for lesbians via two kidnapped girls via the man servant who gets them pregnant. Once the Marbles burn Babs' trailer down, Babs vows revenge. Then she takes it just a little bit farther up the scale, and what happens later has to be seen to be believed.Does it aim to shock? Well, for those who like their movies classy and elegant, this one will probably kill their party. It features some of the most bizarre scenes ever filmed, and there is that one moment right at the end when Divine decides it would be rather fun to do something unspeakable with what comes out of a small dog's rear end. The music John Waters uses is so jarringly out of place that it makes the scene insane, and it will take a strong stomach and willpower not to scream (in equal parts laughter and disgust) at how there the movie goes.Now, here is the hard part can I recommend PINK FLAMINGOS? I would have to say yes, because it's become a part of outrageous cinema. Its documentary, home-movies style is a main part of its charm it makes a complete mess of a movie brilliant. Even when it touches certain themes best left for the Marquis de Sade (such as coprophagia, rape, incest, dismemberment, voyeurism, bestiality) it does so in such a balls-out hysterical way it's impossible to take it seriously. All anyone can do is watch in awe, and see the man who in later years became tamer and went mainstream with HAIRSPRAY, who once was as punk as Sid Vicious. This is as hardcore as hardcore gets for Waters. And that is a compliment.

It could've used a little more subtlety, but I can't complain because whereas film buffs are more used to multi-layered films, this is about as subversive as mainstream audiences could handle. Its also a very detailed film, so repeated viewings are required.David Fincher is an overrated filmmaker, but for once he created a masterpiece. The film has the same MTV-style editing that makes everything as quickly paced as possible, but for once it serves a purpose rather than just style. The acting all around is very good. Edward Norton once again proves to be one of the most talented actors in Hollywood today, with his narrator a truly classic protagonist.

Helena Bonham Carter is just as fine as either Norton or Pitt. Its a shame she didn't become a bigger star.

The plot appears to have been drawn from a Dark Horse comic story, about breeding Aliens for profit. 20th Century Fox could have developed a great screenplay. Instead, Joss Whedon is brought in to create one of the lamest scripts in movie history. Definitely on par with ROBOT MONSTER. The dialogue is appalling.

Terrible visual larks are thrown in for good measure. There doesn't seem to be anyone who isn't overacting. Except maybe Ryder, who turns in a plank-like performance.

How very subversive, and avant garde!. The end result is forced, and seems to serve only these ostentatious artistic scenes. Logic is nowhere to be found in this tale. Christie cuts himself loose and thereby sacrifices himself, for his little buddy, for no apparent reason. He isn't incapacitated, the acid on his face looks little worse than a bad case of acne.

Spiders on space ships? What do they catch to eat? Never mind, it is symbolic of their struggle against the aliens. Spider, bugs, aliens... get it? Tres anarchistic!

Although it does not stick too close to the facts it is still great. I mean, in real life Eliot Ness never threw Frank Nitti off the building, he actually committed suicide. The acting in this film is some solid acting. Sean Connery's acting is fantastic, and Kevin Costner has his moments. I do not know why people say that the music in this film is horrible. It is great. Sure, at some scenes the music does not fit in but overall it is great.Here is the plot of this movie. A man named Eliot Ness is after Al Capone. After an embarrassing confrontation with umbrellas Ness gets Jim Malone, Oscar Wallace, and George Stone to help him take down Capone. They become the Untouchables. Then, Capone's hit-man named Frank Nitti threatens Ness's family. He gets the family out of town. Then, Wallace is killed. One Untouchable down. Then, Malone is brutally killed. Two down. Capone is eventually brought to court. Ness then kills Nitti. In the end Capone is finally arrested and sentenced to eleven years in prison.Overall, this is a pretty good mafia movie. It had good acting and had a great real-life story that could be turned into a movie. I also thought that the scene at the train station steps when Ness helps a mother with her baby and then Capone's men come and their is a shootout but Stone saves the baby is a brilliant scene. Also, the death scene of Malone and Wallace are fantastic and depressing. Both scenes had some of the most saddest music that I have ever heard.

It is a western, but it almost has a modern feel to it, and a lot of good filming not just crazy shoot em' up gun fests. And one scene, probably one the best scenes i have ever seen when Johnny Depp finds the dead fawn in the woods, and he feels the bullet hole and lies down next to it and cradles its body, what an awesome scene, up their with the Pulp Fiction Uma Thurman cocaine convulsing and Wild At Heart, when Nicholas Cage stops with his girl on the high way to dance.

Plots MUST change in order to suite these opposing medium's. A book will entice or allow one to explore and create the images of a world through their own imagination, thus the images portrayed are purely a creation of the reader's imagination, hence leaving interpretation entirely up to the reader. A film is purely visual, and 'feeds' the images and must attempt to portray an interpretation which the viewer must accept and cannot reject. If we look at many highly sought after film's created by highly prestigious filmmakers, such as Steven Spielberg and A.I.

In the case of Lord of the Flies, I too feel that the film was in a sense 'lacking' a certain presence or charisma, however I thought that the changes in plot were essential in the portrayal of the story through the medium of film. The FILMS characters would have benefited if they had been explored more deeply, so as to allow for more empathy from the viewer, such as Ralph's nostalgic memories or Simons constant graphic nightmares, or the obscene illusion of the Pigs Head conversing with Simon.

None of this occurred in the film, which I feel is the main reason for the disappointment experienced amongst the viewers. If one would like to read a book for a story, one should read a book. However if one would like to be in a sense 'fed' a story, then one should watch a film. That is the blatantly austere reason for the term used on films such as Lord of the Flies BASED upon the novel by Sir William Golding.
