However, I do of course have some gripes. The biggest one is the huge lack of Godzilla in this film. You'd think that a film called Godzilla might actually feature, ya know, Godzilla, but instead we get a completely different monster that we're expected to think of as Godzilla. Now don't get me wrong, GINO (Godzilla In Name Only, as pretty much every G fan knows) is an awesome monster. He's very well designed, and pretty damn cool. But really, the movie should have been called something else, because calling it Godzilla is false advertising. Heck, the director, Roland Emmerich, didn't even like Godzilla movies very much, making one wonder what on earth made him want to direct one (money). But in spite of all this, this is still a highly enjoyable monster movie.Now the thing that I like the most in this movie are the scenes with the monster. They're all very enjoyable. First is the scene where GINO attacks a Japanese fishing ship. It's very effective when the monster shows up on the sonar and everyone is freaking out, and then the awesome pause where we hear that ominous groan the creature makes before all hell breaks loose and its claws break straight through the ship. Next of course is when GINO shows up in NYC, with a brilliant shot to reveal him rising from the sea, and a subsequent scene which shows as little as possible of the monster as it rampages through the city streets. Of course there are also the scenes where GINO goes up against the military, which are all enjoyable scenes.Now for the things that annoy me, apart from the movie not actually featuring Godzilla. For one thing, the characters. They are all 2 dimensional idiots. The only likable one is the french guy, who's name I cannot recall. Next is the fact that they set up the monster as a sympathetic creature, and yet expects us to celebrate when it dies. It spoils a kind of sad moment when it dies, and there's silence, and suddenly everyone bursts into applause. And of course, there are the baby Godzilla's. They kind of felt like an unnecessary addition to the story, pretty much just filler. So over all, I think it's an enjoyable movie with some great moments, but of course, it does have a good number of flaws, and calling it Godzilla was just milking the name, because it was really its own thing. Anyway, that's all I have to say on the matter.

In anticipation of The Master (Which I still haven't seen!) I've been revisiting his other movies, and now truly believe him to be among the greatest directors of today. Boogie Nights was simply incredible, and even Hard Eight showed a lot of potential in the filmmaker, despite an apparently terrible editing process. Then there's Magnolia. Such a strange movie, but at the same time it's the most familiar.If I had to sum up Magnolia, I'd say it's about life. With that, comes all of the sadness, all of the humor, and joy of life. Make no mistake, all of these emotions and more are fully fleshed out in Magnolia. Each character has his and her moments of triumph, of defeat, and of complete confusions as to the meaning of their current predicament. And are there characters.With such a star-studded cast you can easily see that this movie could've flopped. Talent-overload. Under the direction of Anderson, there's no reason for worry. Each character has their screen-time, and is allowed to develop before our eyes as the day progresses. Tom Cruise as the sleazy self-help misogynist, spewing sexist propaganda at his seminars. Making his interviewer uncomfortable as he bounces around, maybe on drugs. Philip Seymour Hoffman as the nurse to a dying Jason Robards, and the confused and seemingly bipolar Julianne Moore as Robards' wife. There are just too many characters to fully describe in a coherent review. Though, John C Reilly's character simply must be acknowledged. Playing a good cop, Reilly channels humor into his lines, and yet he's just such a nice guy. Innocent, but not stupidly so. Another great performance comes from young Jeremy Blackman, a pre-teen whiz kid who is used by his father as a source of income. William H Macy as the disgruntled employee who used to be that whiz kid... See what I'm saying? The list goes on and on, and all of these performances are just perfect.The idea of swapping between these characters is, like I said, a seemingly impossible task. But Anderson switches it up frequently enough that we feel enough exposition on one character and are ready to see where the other is at this point. It's addicting, almost like following a TV show.Performances aside, we all know Paul Thomas Anderson is a technical genius. Employing his trademark long takes in several breathtaking scenes, this is very much an Anderson film. Smart writing, great camera-work, and a varied soundtrack are all now signatures of Anderson.I did mention some flaws. Mind you, these in no way major flaws but I found them distracting. Notably, two I can think of. The first is a scene later on in the movie. A song by Aimee Mann plays and the camera cuts to the main characters, all sitting in their homes in a state of sadness. They all sing along to the song. To me, this makes it clear that this is a movie, these are actors. It takes you out of the drama. Especially for a movie so rooted in deep emotion, this is a distraction. I just thought it was kind of silly, and unnecessary. They could've had the song playing and shots of the character sitting quietly and that would've been just as dramatic.My second complaint isn't entirely a complaint, just a remark. The frogs. I went into the movie knowing about the ending, so I wasn't surprised by it. I bet I would've been more surprised and disappointed had I not known. It just seems like another wild thing that takes you out of the realism of the rest of the film. I understand and like the theme of random, strange, unexplainable incidents, but I think frogs is just too far-fetched. Though perhaps that's the point? Maybe Anderson is making fun of his own thematic devices. I don't know, maybe I just don't understand the movie entirely.But really, don't let my little complaints change your mind. Even the frogs, which are undeniably bizarre, can't change the fact that the film up until that point is a work of brilliance, and it would be a disservice for a film-lover to pass on this just because of the ending.

This is a review of the 188- minute version, and perhaps that influences some of my opinions.Took in all kinds of things- why does the statue move? What does it say about Alexander? I tried to get a grasp on who's in the family but then it all- falls- apart. Maybe I'm not yet ready for this type of film, but my god as an objective viewer I was sadly, sadly disappointed. The exposition at the very long Swedish version of the Godfather's opening fails which bearded man is which? Who is the old lady? Who the hell are Fanny and Alexander's parents? On that note, where's Fanny? The titular character doesn't appear for nearly an hour and never does more than stand around and sometimes stick up for her brother, but she has about as much emotion as Bella from Twilight- yes, that comparison just happened. I didn't know who the father was until he died (that's not a spoiler) and didn't connect with who the mother was until we see her grieving in admittedly an excellent scene, one of the best.The kicker is that the family is interesting but it doesn't come to much. Helena, the grandmother, is a wonderfully warm presence and one of the film's great cheers. Gustav Adolf is very lively, but I am baffled that the whole family is OK with him having impregnated his mistress, one of Helena's housekeepers. His wife is OK with it! Everyone treats it like a normal thing! Carl and his wife are just miserable, but their plot goes nowhere, and finally Isak is cheery and likable. The film's greatest, saving strength is its acting the performances are sublime, and the chemistry between actors is that of a tight- knit family. The tyrannical Edvard is not even that horrible of a person, only a stark contrast from Oscar, but his portrayal and the way the film plays out leads us to see him as a monster.So after the ridiculously long party, and once Oscar dies, we see what the new home life will be like and then the intermission occurs. After that things change radically and things become surreal. It's captivating, especially with the minimalist piano (fantastic music throughout) but I was never sure where real life ended and fantasy began. In its context, talking to the dead makes sense but miraculous mirages? That's the best answer even Bergman came up with, miracles. Telepathy? I couldn't buy it after seeing a family drama for 2 hours.So the plot trips all over itself, made extra painful by the aforementioned acting and the exquisite script, with amazing dialogues that translate well to English. That essentially sums up the film top- caliber everything except for a failure to build initial thoughts on characters, and having a terrible plot rife with holes. I'm reminded of a Shakespearean comedy I think they get buy just by having his name attached. Midsummer's Night Dream is awful. This is not awful, but not nearly what I expected.

I tried to get a grasp on who's in the family but then it all- falls- apart. Maybe I'm not yet ready for this type of film, but my god as an objective viewer I was sadly, sadly disappointed. The exposition at the very long Swedish version of the Godfather's opening fails which bearded man is which? Who is the old lady? Who the hell are Fanny and Alexander's parents? On that note, where's Fanny? The titular character doesn't appear for nearly an hour and never does more than stand around and sometimes stick up for her brother, but she has about as much emotion as Bella from Twilight- yes, that comparison just happened. I didn't know who the father was until he died (that's not a spoiler) and didn't connect with who the mother was until we see her grieving in admittedly an excellent scene, one of the best.The kicker is that the family is interesting but it doesn't come to much. Helena, the grandmother, is a wonderfully warm presence and one of the film's great cheers. Gustav Adolf is very lively, but I am baffled that the whole family is OK with him having impregnated his mistress, one of Helena's housekeepers. His wife is OK with it! Everyone treats it like a normal thing! Carl and his wife are just miserable, but their plot goes nowhere, and finally Isak is cheery and likable. The film's greatest, saving strength is its acting the performances are sublime, and the chemistry between actors is that of a tight- knit family. The tyrannical Edvard is not even that horrible of a person, only a stark contrast from Oscar, but his portrayal and the way the film plays out leads us to see him as a monster.So after the ridiculously long party, and once Oscar dies, we see what the new home life will be like and then the intermission occurs. After that things change radically and things become surreal. It's captivating, especially with the minimalist piano (fantastic music throughout) but I was never sure where real life ended and fantasy began. In its context, talking to the dead makes sense but miraculous mirages? That's the best answer even Bergman came up with, miracles. Telepathy? I couldn't buy it after seeing a family drama for 2 hours.So the plot trips all over itself, made extra painful by the aforementioned acting and the exquisite script, with amazing dialogues that translate well to English. That essentially sums up the film top- caliber everything except for a failure to build initial thoughts on characters, and having a terrible plot rife with holes. I'm reminded of a Shakespearean comedy I think they get buy just by having his name attached. Midsummer's Night Dream is awful. This is not awful, but not nearly what I expected.

At first he uses these powers for his own gain but when his Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief Peter decides to use his powers for the benefit of New York City. As his Uncle Ben said, With great power comes great responsibility. While this is going on, Norman Osborn the head of OsCorp has taken a super serum and has gained super strength and a twisted alter ego. He dons a glider and body armor to become The Green Goblin and begins terrorizing the city. He has made it his personal goal to get Spider-Man to join him on his personal crusade against order. Spider-Man has to balance being fresh out of High School, his relationships with his friends and Aunt, and stop Goblin from hurting innocent people.The plot is what you'd come to expect for an origin story but some parts of the film when looked at today are considerably dated. Most of the CGI while impressive for its time looks very fake when compared to the effects we're used to today. Even back then they looked a tad off. For instance scenes where the Goblin is flying on his glider or when Spider- Man is climbing a wall or jumping off something are pretty obviously CGI. It doesn't take you out of the feel for the movie per se but it looks a little jarring.What might take you out of the moment is some of the dialog. Comics in their day had some pretty corny dialog but recently movies have been averting the corny dialog. And even though this movie was one of the first superhero films to revive the genre some of the dialog feels very forced. The scenes with Peter and Mary Jane (his love interest) are sometimes good but other times they feel awkward and that's probably what they're going for since Peter is supposed to be awkward but when he's Spider-Man it still feels a bit awkward. The Goblin's dialog is like it was taken out of the Adam West Batman TV Show. That isn't terrible in fact it's actually really enjoyable but if we're trying to take him seriously as a threat his dialog has to have a little more threatening tone to it.But the film still holds up on the emotional side of Spider-Man. The scene where Uncle Ben is killed is still sad and the relationship Peter has with his friends and Aunt May are performed very well. It's just the dialog that makes it feel a little forced. And the fight scenes are still engaging and filled with energy. The cast pull their characters off as if they were made for the parts. Tobey Maquire does a good balancing act as Spidey and Peter Parker keeping Spidey's sarcastic sense of humor and Peter's nerdy behavior. Kirsten Dunst plays a decent Mary Jane, James Franco pulls Harry Osborn's relationship with his father very realistically, and Willem Dafoe is in my opinion the best actor they could've picked for Goblin and Norman. The one that stands out as the best though is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jamerson. There is no doubt about it he is the perfect Jamerson. His quick humor and motor mouth fit the character to a t, and I can't think of anything bad to say about his performance. So while the film has a lot of flaws it's still a fun movie to watch. It's a nice introduction to Spider-Man if you've never heard of the character(surprisingly enough) and a good film on its own.I give Spider-Man a 7.5 leaning to an 8.

As she was leaving she witnessed lambs getting slaughtered. She tried to save one but had to let it go because of it's weight.Hannibal eventually reveals that Buffalo Bills real name is Jame Gumb. His mother died at the age of 2 and started killing at 12 when he murdered his grandparents. Buffalo Bill has kidnapped Catherine Martin played by Brooke Smith who is the daughter of the Tennesse senator Ruth Martin played by Diane Baker.Clarice finds out that if she does not get to Buffalo Bill fast enough then Buffalo Bill will kill Catherine.

She shoots him 6 times and is hailed as a hero.In the films final scene Clarice gets a phone call from Hannibal who says that he has respect for her and does not wish to kill her. He then spots a Docter who was rude and harsh with him and says that he will Be Having An Old Friend For Dinner. This film is a masterpiece and held my attention the entire time.
