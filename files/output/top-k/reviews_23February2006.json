Her husband was a scientist who was deeply into his work and through those long days and weeks he makes a big breakthrough in science by inventing a teleportation machine that can transmit matter from one spot to another. After some glitches he fine tunes the device and decides to test it by using himself as a guinea pig. While, in the process of this test, a housefly gets caught inside with him and when he emerges from the other capsule he shares its genetic structure and physical attributes.The Fly is classic Sci-Fi \/ horror from the 50s and what a nice surprise this was! Unlike many of its kind in the 50s, this one didn't have a childish feel. The context may seem silly here, but its executed with enough skill and handled in a relax manner by director Kurt Neumann to set above the rest. Just don't be expecting a monster on the rampage tale. This one veers more towards a much more broaden and imaginative story with a certain eeriness contained in its psychological material rather than visuals. Even though it doesn't scare you witless, it still does provide a couple of memorable and ingenious shocks that are hard to put out of your mind. The film opens with the horrific outcome of Helene's husband Andre and then it goes into flashback mode where we learn the fate of Dr. Andre Delambre. What does make it surprisingly good is that we're treated with such passionately vivid characters and a interesting set-up that pulls you in by taking a more serious approach with a dabble of irony along the way. The talkative first hour slowly builds up to its taut last half-an-hour, where we get a smart and venomously bleak climax. Although, it could have done without that preachy conclusion. The rational script by James Clavell works by being incredibly dense with it thriving on some quick wit and sincerity. The story is more about a woman trying to save the man she loves as he slowly fights the genetic effects of the fly's DNA. He may seem hideous on the outside, but inside he is still more so human and he's trying his best to keep control of his dieing humanity. This is proved by how much he cares for his family's safety when he's willingly to take his own life for the best of everyone. It's practical story telling at its best. The look of the film is top shape with it being shot in vibrant Technicolor and the key is that the deformity is kept hidden, but when it's revealed it actually stands up rather well. It's ugly, that's for sure, but still it looks rather competent. They're also an inventive touch when we see the creature for the first time with multiple frames being used to represent the reflection from human fly's eyes. In Cronenberg's version we see the grotesque transformation, but because of the times and effects we don't see it here, but more so the aftermath of the mishap. All of the devices and gadgets in Andre's lab are well presented and the mounted score adds in a forceful touch with nice crisp sound effects. The performances are more than great by the likes of Al Edison, Patricia Owens, and Herbert Marshall and even though Vincent Price had a supporting role, you'll be in awe of his effortlessly suave performance.An excellent classic of its field that's more concern about telling a moving and fascinating story than just giving us pointless action and cheap thrills to spice up proceedings. The more you stick it out, the more compelling it does become.

This is clearly an anti-bourgeois film, one with a liberal message of hippie politics; it was a drug culture movie, the defining motion picture of a generation of free love, school drop-outs and loners who sat around drinking beer all day moaning about how awful life was.Perhaps I sound overly critical of a film whose purpose is to examine (or more appropriately define) an era?

No, its fault is that it tries to sympathize with him &#150; Benjamin is a spoiled rich kid, and it's hard to feel empathetic towards him when he wallows about drinking beer poolside, staring into his aquarium and ignoring everyone around him A self-absorbed cynical.Yes, Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) is going through an awkward change in his life.

By holding a reasonable discussion, the depravity of the casual sex is lessened. It all benefits Benjamin, no one else.Furthermore the characters have little depth. Benjamin falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, in what seems an instant. Their abrupt decision at the end of the picture (which I won't spoil) is now laughable, because in 1967 it offered an optimistic, endless adventure for the wide-eyed teens, I suppose; but now it just leads to foreseeable misery, and comes across as juvenile and ridiculous.The film has influenced a wide array of modern directors, most noticeably Wes Anderson, whose style of film-making is based around similar themes of contempt, quirky humor and oddball characters, typically led by a cynic. (For example, Bill Murray in Rushmore or The Life Aquatic.) Its cultural impact is phenomenal, being referenced in such popular entertainment as The Simpsons and an endless array of movies.

I'm not sure of the exact release date (I'm pretty sure it was sometime in November 1931), but it's a testament to the film's quality that it's still held in such high regard seven and a half decades after its initial release. I wasn't born until 1979 and didn't see the movie until 1997, but it still blew me away. I've seen it dozens of times since, and I never get bored with it.What makes this film so good? It's not particularly scary to a modern audience, but it still possesses a charm that belies its age, and while many regard Bride of Frankenstein as superior, you can't have a sequel without the original, can you? The thing about Frankenstein is that, unlike the 1931 Dracula, which is rather static and stagy, both technically and in terms of acting (I'm surprised that Universal were able to reuse so many of the sets in later productions, given that Bela Lugosi, Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye all seem intent on not just chewing the scenery, but devouring it), Frankenstein possesses remarkable depth and subtlety.Volumes have been written about Boris Karloff's performance as the monster, and it is truly mesmerising, but credit must also go to the remarkable supporting cast, and foremost among these is Colin Clive (who was actually the star of the film, and not the then-unknown Karloff). Clive gives a superb performance as Henry Frankenstein, illustrating the character's obsessive side without ever losing touch with his essential humanity. Clive was sadly a real-life Jekyll and Hyde (he was an alcoholic) and in Frankenstein he reconciles the two conflicting aspects of the doctor's personality perfectly.Dwight Frye as Frankenstein's assistant Fritz is also excellent, portraying the odd little hunchback with just the right sinister touch. Frye had played another oddity, Renfield, in Dracula, and he once again balances the differing sides of his character well, going from fear of the monster to tormenting him sadistically (which costs him dear eventually).Edward Van Sloan's Doctor Waldman may not be as entertaining as Ernest Thesiger's wonderfully camp Doctor Praetorius in Bride, but he leads the proceedings an air of authority, his rational approach providing a good counterbalance to Frankenstein's madness. John Boles and Mae Clarke as Victor Moritz and Elizabeth are not as showy, and Boles is rather bland (note that the character did not reappear in Bride) but they are fairly likable and inoffensive. Frederick Kerr gives a wonderfully blustering performance as Henry's father and Lionel Belmore is good as the burgomaster (his argument with Kerr is quite amusing), but the real highlight is of course Karloff as the monster.Whereas later Frankenstein monsters had a tendency to be somewhat robotic (which is why Karloff stop playing the character after Son of Frankenstein), Karloff's performance is remarkable for the humanity he invests in the character, something that never disappears under Jack Pierce's iconic makeup job. The important point is that Karloff plays the creature as an innocent, more sinned against than sinning. Although the monster does kill and kidnap, he does so not out of a sense of malice, but rather because he lacks the intelligence to do any better (his brain is after all a criminal one). Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the scene with Marilyn Harris' Little Maria; the way Karloff plays the monster's changing moods, from happy innocent to horrified when he realises the girl does not float like the flowers, is unforgettable.Frankenstein is memorable not only for its acting, but also its technical and visual aspects. The set design is superb, from the spooky tower where Frankenstein conducts his experiments with its Kenneth Strickfaden-designed machines, full of sound and fury, to the burning windmill at the end, but the real credit has to go to director James Whale, who took over a project rejected by Bela Lugosi and featuring a mediocre script and turned it into one of the greatest movies of all time. The original script had the monster as nothing more than a savage beast (which is why Lugosi turned it down), but under Whale it was extensively reworked, with the pathos and humanity that have made it a classic added. Although Frankenstein was not the first Universal horror movie, without it there wouldn't be the term Universal Horror, just a stagy vampire movie starring a rather hammy Hungarian. Because Frankenstein confirmed that audiences had a taste for this type of movie, it opened the floodgates for virtually every other scary movie made since 1931.

I didn't really think much of it until I sat and watched it - and I'm really glad I did. ONCE WERE WARRIORS is an EXTREMELY powerful and moving film about a poor New Zealand Maori family who is being torn apart by alcoholism, abuse, and the surroundings\/environment that they live in.Jake (the father) is a heavy-drinking, working-class, tough-guy - who spends more time at the bar with his mates than at home with his family. When he is home, he is usually either passed out drunk or has all his mates over to party and basically tear sh!t up. Jake also has a violent temper and doesn't mind knockin' the ol' lady around when he's fired up...Beth is a loving but emotionally-damaged mother and wife whose own demons get the best of her and keep her from doing what's right for her family. She is also into the sauce and has long since lost control of her family and her own life...Nig (the oldest son) has just joined a violent gang and has not time nor interest in his family...Grace (the oldest daughter) is a sweet and creative girl with aspirations of being a writer, but her surroundings and constant negative environment make any sort of hope for a better life nearly impossible...The youngest son, Mark (aka Boogie) is in with the wrong crowd and constantly gets into petty trouble, to the point that he gets sent away and becomes a ward of the state...There are two younger children as well, but we only see them in passing and they don't play any huge roles in the film.ONCE WERE WARRIORS centers around this extremely dysfunctional family - and Beth's weak attempts to hold them together despite all the negative influences that constantly surround all of them, and that they allow to remain in their lives. Jake and his drinking, partying, and uncaring attitude towards his wife and family make it impossible for them to dig themselves out of their pitiful situations, and lead to some truly heart-wrenching and sickening consequences - and Beth's lack of protest and refusal to leave this bad situation only makes matters worse - leaving the children stuck in the middle.OWW is a powerful and emotional film that is very realistic in it's depiction of poverty, abuse, addiction, and hopelessness. But this film is not nihilistic or mean-spirited. At the heart of it is a story of hope against all odds, and in this sense is inspiring. OWW is in many ways hauntingly beautiful and strangely funny. Jake for example is as big a dick as they come - but he can also be amusingly charming and witty - when he's not drinking. Although the subject matter is completely different, OWW reminds me of the Brazian films, CARANDIRU and CITY OF GOD (2 other excellent films...) in terms of it's stark and honest portrayal of poverty and it's effects on people.

Jake and his drinking, partying, and uncaring attitude towards his wife and family make it impossible for them to dig themselves out of their pitiful situations, and lead to some truly heart-wrenching and sickening consequences - and Beth's lack of protest and refusal to leave this bad situation only makes matters worse - leaving the children stuck in the middle.OWW is a powerful and emotional film that is very realistic in it's depiction of poverty, abuse, addiction, and hopelessness. But this film is not nihilistic or mean-spirited. At the heart of it is a story of hope against all odds, and in this sense is inspiring. OWW is in many ways hauntingly beautiful and strangely funny. Jake for example is as big a dick as they come - but he can also be amusingly charming and witty - when he's not drinking. Although the subject matter is completely different, OWW reminds me of the Brazian films, CARANDIRU and CITY OF GOD (2 other excellent films...) in terms of it's stark and honest portrayal of poverty and it's effects on people. Definitely one of the emotionally strongest films I've seen in quite a while.

The reason for it is because after every time I watch a great sci-fi film, it'll always leave me with a new theoretical concept to think about after the movie's over. I'll admire the film-maker's creativity and excellent ideas with these well-built sets.I had very high expectations for Blade Runner, it had an early 80s Harrison Ford and an interesting concept that I read from a few brief plot summaries. Unfortunately for me, this was the most disappointing film that I've ever seen.The film's main plot is that there are Replicants, clones that were in off-world colonies (now illegal after a mutiny), that land in a very dark futuristic version of Los Angeles. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner, his job is to kill or retire these six Replicants. Rutger Hauer plays Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicants that landed on Earth. The feel of the film is a very dark, a gloomy vision of the future.I loved Harrison Ford's performance as Indiana Jones and Han Solo is one of my favourite movie characters of all-time but he didn't display any of his acting talent in Blade Runner. He doesn't show any emotions at all and he was just annoying. The rest of the cast wasn't any better except for Rutger Hauer. I liked the way he spoke in this film and his speech at the end was great (I won't deny that).Another of my major complaints is that the pacing of the film is so unnecessarily slow. It just lagged on, it felt as it was three and half hours long when it was just over two hours. They are so many scenes that could've been cut, especially the numerous montages of Deckard driving through the city.The film is not all bad though. The sets are very original and the cinematography really stands out. The score is great, I really loved the music at the ending credits that gave it a science fiction feel.Overall, I really hated this film. There is a lot of aspects of it that I just despised but I do praise all the work that was done to build all these amazing sets. The ending to me, didn't make any sense at all and the bad acting made me stop caring about the characters. Also, the slow pacing just made the film completely uninteresting.

The film touches on many different subjects, such as the youth counterculture and friendship. The film follows the residents in the fictional small town of Anarene, Texas in the early 1950s. The main action revolves around Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and his best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges). Right from the beginning of the film we realize that the town is small and there is no a lot to do. The kids hang out at the local pool hall ran by an enigmatic man called Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the local theater, which is also owned by Sam. We find out that Sonny, Duane, and their classmates are getting ready to graduate soon and each kid is having trouble deciding what they want to do after school.Duane goes out with the most popular girl in school, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), who enjoys the popularity she receives considerably. Things begin to change in the town for all the kids in town. The coach of the basketball team asks Sonny if he could drive his wife to the doctor's office. We see Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) as a very unhappy woman. Sonny notices this also and the two begin an affair. Meanwhile, Jacy tries to find a man to whom she can lose her virginity. It is apparent that she really does not want to be with Duane anymore after she ditches him on Christmas in order to go to a skinny-dipping party at another guy's house.All the characters, one way or another, want something more than what they have. Sonny wants a relationship, which he gets with Mrs. Popper, Duane wants his relationship with Jacy to last, and Jacy wants always to be the center of attention. The older characters in the story, Sam, the waitress at the local diner, Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), reminisce about how things used to be when they were younger and how much things have changed since then. Sonny's world is turned upside down when he learns that Sam has died. The boys always thought Sam to be a kind of mentor. Sam leaves his pool hall to Sonny, who continues to run it. After Duane leaves town, Sonny decides to break off his relationship with Mrs. Popper for a relationship with Jacy. Sonny even gets in a fight over Jacy with Duane when Duane returns. This results in Sonny being injured. Sonny even marries Jacy when she asks him. The marriage does not last long though and we soon find out that Jacy only married Sonny to get attention.In the end, Jacy leaves to go to college, Duane decides to go into the service to fight in Korea, and the last local business, the movie theater, shuts down. Duane, Sonny, and their friend Billy (Sam Bottoms) watch the very last showing of the very last movie shown at the theater, Red River (1948), a John Wayne Western. At the end of the film, Billy is killed when a truck hits him. Billy was a deaf mute, which is why he never heard the truck coming. Sonny is very distraught because everyone around him has either left, like Duane and Jacy, or died, like Sam and Billy. Sonny gets in his truck and drives away from town. It seems as though he might leave but then he turns around and drives back to town. He goes to see Mrs. Popper, who seems to be the only constant in Sonny's life. First, she rejects him, but eventually decides to forgive him and comfort him.This film seems to have all the themes of the movies of the time. It has the rebellious counterculture theme that was so prevalent in films such as Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Easy Rider (1969). It also contains the affair theme also found in The Graduate (1967) by showing Sonny's affair with Mrs. Popper. It has the theme of friendship also found in Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy (1969). The film also contains the theme of alienation, which pertains to all the aforementioned films. In the end, Sonny is left alone. The only person he has left is Mrs. Popper and his relationship with her is not stable nor is it moral.The Last Picture Show is a film about changes and how people react to those changes. The town changes so much throughout the movie as do the characters. Sonny does not react to change well at all. He seems very devastated when Sam dies, and he is even more devastated when Billy dies. He does not want Duane to leave and he even marries Jacy in order to keep something constant in his life. The only thing that seems constant to Sonny is his relationship with Mrs. Popper. When things get bad, he goes to her. The film is also about the death of the old west. The last film at the theater shown is a John Wayne western, which signals the end of that fictitious and glorified way of life. The film also deals a lot with nostalgia. Most of the characters have feelings of nostalgia. Duane wanted to keep Jacy and marry her, Jacy wanted to stay the center of attention, and Sam wanted to be young again. All of these characters come to terms with the changes occurring in their life while Sonny does not. When he gets scared, he runs to Mrs. Popper for comfort. The film is very interesting and well worth watching. It has interesting and unique characters, which the actors portray well. Just as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, There is nothing permanent except change. This quote seems to describe the central issues in The Last Picture Show to a tee.

Because this is a film that first appears to be slapstick with quick quotes, funny lines, and hilarious dialog, it is often disregarded, but it is really significant movie art.Not to become too philosophical, but it is also a kind of serious movie, with extreme undertones of satire regarding the ultimate human joke, that is a subjective, or is it objective philosophy towards life, love, and death? It makes ultimate fun of the subject matter of it's entitlement Love and Death. Woody Allen was quoted once as remarking that this was the favorite of his films, at least of that comic creative period of his during the1970's. I would have to agree with the director, as this tiny little 90 minute gem is my favorite Allen escape into the ultimate question, and the most perfect flight into the darkness of human insecurities, about immortality, as treated with humor.Woody is really on with his stand up shtick in this film . His jokes come a mile a minute, with only a few duds, but mostly his deadpan delivery strikes home with logical humor. An amazing comic in his hey day, Allen was truly one of the funniest men on the planet in the 20th century. And joining him in this film is his perfect straight woman which will always be Diane Keaton.One cannot ignore this amazing actress, and classically beautiful woman, Diane Keaton. The persona she projected during her formative acting career in the 1970's through 1980's was inspired and stunning. She was both a comedienne genius, but also an impressive dramatic female presence, in particular in the Godfather series, and in the so tragic brilliant but flawed film Looking for Mr. Goodbar. Diane possessed a sort of lovely vulnerability, with high cheekbones, steel blue gray eyes, with quick and slight movements, long and tragic fingers, and a delicious overbite that brightened her unique, compelling, sensuous, optimistic, yet always fragile smile.The rest of the cast are chosen for their physical look. In particular the part of French Emperor Napoleon. This is a sort of period piece set in the time of the Napoleonic wars, and it is interesting to see the mock battles between the French and Russians seemingly almost Barry Lyndon accurate when they were not made fun of.The final barometer of this film is that Love and Life are about suffering and that Death is better than spending an evening with an insurance salesman.Love and Death A Woody Allen film than many critics rate as mediocre is misunderstood, as this lovely treatise on the satirical side of making fun of philosophy, by the comic master, Woody Allen, is by this critic, highly recommended to any thinking man's DVD collection. I look forward to viewing it again soon.B. A.

Because this is a film that first appears to be slapstick with quick quotes, funny lines, and hilarious dialog, it is often disregarded, but it is really significant movie art.Not to become too philosophical, but it is also a kind of serious movie, with extreme undertones of satire regarding the ultimate human joke, that is a subjective, or is it objective philosophy towards life, love, and death? It makes ultimate fun of the subject matter of it's entitlement Love and Death. Woody Allen was quoted once as remarking that this was the favorite of his films, at least of that comic creative period of his during the1970's. I would have to agree with the director, as this tiny little 90 minute gem is my favorite Allen escape into the ultimate question, and the most perfect flight into the darkness of human insecurities, about immortality, as treated with humor.Woody is really on with his stand up shtick in this film . His jokes come a mile a minute, with only a few duds, but mostly his deadpan delivery strikes home with logical humor. An amazing comic in his hey day, Allen was truly one of the funniest men on the planet in the 20th century. And joining him in this film is his perfect straight woman which will always be Diane Keaton.One cannot ignore this amazing actress, and classically beautiful woman, Diane Keaton.

Sonny is headed down the same path of life that Sam lived. When Sam dies and Sonny inherits the pool hall from Sam, he basically turns into Sam. Sam lead a pretty dull and lonesome life mostly because he was trapped in the town, and by giving Sonny the pool hall it causes Sonny to get trapped in the town too because he can't leave the pool hall. He tries to leave after Billy dies, but he can't he is trapped.When Sonny, Sam, and Billy go fishing Sam tells Sonny the story about his affair with Lois Farrow many years ago. He tells Sonny they were wild and they loved each other and it was his true love but it ended because she grew up. He also said that they used to come out to the 'tank' where they were fishing and swim (naked) and be crazy together. Sonny then lives this story out with Lois's daughter Jacy. He has a fling with her and they go out to the 'tank' and get a little crazy and then they decide they are going to get married, but Jacy changes her mind. She purposely leaves her parents a note so that they will find them and stop the marriage. She does this because she has grown up and doesn't want to have the fling anymore so now the affair between Sonny and Jacy is over the same way that Sam and Lois's affair ended. And much like Sam Sonny will probably never find another girl to really be with because the one he really wants got away. The movie begins with the empty town and the wind blowing through to show how really empty it is and then we see Sonny going to the pool hall and Sam is there. Sam has no one except for the kids that come visit him and play pool. He was wild in his day like Sonny because of the story he tells and because when Sonny and Duane go to Mexico you can tell Sam wants to go, but he has grown up and matured. When Sam dies Sonny starts to take his place and live his life. He inherits the pool hall, he takes care of Billy, he has the same affair, but most of all he matures and becomes lonely. Duane goes to Korea to fight and maybe never return, Billy dies, Jacy goes to college, and his affair with Ruth Popper ends. In the end when he goes and visits Ruth she tells him he has finally grown up so that shows he has matured and his wild days are over. He is going to live the same dull lonely life as Sam did. Then the film fades out the same as it started. The camera pans back out of the empty town and this shows that the story is repeating itself because Sonny has taken over Sam's life. Sonny will live to tell the same story that Sam did to a young man someday and he will live the same life as Sam did. The story could start over with Sonny as Sam's part and another young man as Sonny because of the fact that Sonny is living Sam's life. The ending is the same as the beginning.
