After the Nightingale receives a mysterious distress signal from over 3000 light years away, the ship's captain (played by Robert Forster) decides to respond. They have to go through something called a dimension jump (a way of travelling from one place in the universe to another very quickly) and discover the sender of the message, who has a strange artifact he wants to take back to earth in order to get rich quick.Painfully boring. Yes. The leads in this are James Spader and Angela Bassett. Both are decent enough actors, but neither could save this, and even their performances were far from their best. It was handy that in order to go through a dimension jump everybody has to strip naked. To give credit to those responsible for this, aside from a clear topless shot of Danika (Robin Tunney) and some blurry naked shots of Dr. Evers (Bassett - or, more likely, her double) this aspect of the story wasn't exploited. The ship has a rather strange robot dressed as a World War I fighter pilot because the captain is a history buff and a talking computer with a personality - sort of like HAL from 2001 except that this one is a female named Sweetie (please) and it's fallen in love with crewman Benj (Wilson Cruz.) I said that I couldn't think of anything good to say about this. Actually that's not true. It's less than an hour and a half in length.

Scrooge didn't quit being a man of business, give everything away, and take a vow of poverty. He simply stopped being less of a turd head and more of a Mensch. It's a lesson that resonates as much today as it did in 1843. It's that our choice isn't necessarily between two extremes -- socialism and Ayn Rand. There is a middle road that some of us seem unwilling to recognize.I think this is what Hollywood called a high concept movie. A Christmas Carol has been done to death. It's been done seriously and made into a musical. Now it's time for another telling of the tale, but this time let's make it a comedy with a the usual sentimental ending.There are a horde of recognizable faces on the screen, from Robert Mitchum to John Housemann, but the movie belongs to Bill Murray as the modern Scrooge, head of IBC who insists on a live broadcast of A Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve, even though everyone knows that people should be enjoying their family dinners and not glued to the telly.Frankly, it didn't sound promising. And in fact it had its unfunny violent slapstick moments, as when the Spirit of Christmas Present, Carol Kane, kicks Murray in the family jewels and drops him howling to the floor. That's not the only example of mayhem that pushes the envelope.Yet, even though we know what's going to happen, it's possible to get swept up into the story. There are, of course, CGIs but they don't overwhelm us. They're used judiciously, which is refreshing in itself. And Murray just can't be too serious, especially during the cornier moments when he should be. As the end credits role over Murray standing on the TV set and surrounded by cast and crew, all singing Get A Little Love In Your Heart, an emetic scene in itself, Murray addresses the camera and shouts things like, Okay, now just the people on the left side of the theater! And then he shouts for All the women! No, no -- the REAL women! It sounds as if he's deliberately sabotaging the clichéd scene and, in the process, bringing a little subversion to all the painful joy. FEED ME, Seymour!, he shouts. It has nothing to do with the story but it's an allusion to The Little Shop of Horrors in which Murray played the part of a dentist's pain freak. Still, Murray's efforts to undercut the clichés notwithstanding, it goes on too long. Nobody, not even Santa Claus, could have relieved the distress of that ending.It's not a masterpiece but a lot of effort has gone into it, it's sometimes actually touching and sometimes quite funny, and there are gags that work.

D2 The Mighty Ducks is a circus; a cacophony of conflicts, dopey characters, fighting, eccentricities, miscommunications, clichés, and inpenetrable goofiness. Here's a movie sequel that continues to beat a dead horse into the ground by offering the public a sequel to a Disney movie that can only be liked by reciting the word nostalgia or nostalgic. At this point, it isn't that The Mighty Ducks films are bad movies in the usual sense, but it's that they are so unambitious, uninspired, and bland that it makes it hard to accept them as take it for what it is entertainment and harder to like them on the typical good movie level. Emilio Estevez, still portraying the greatly motivated man driven on the idea of success, reprises his role as Gordon Bombay, who the opening credits show us has gone on to be a minor league hockey player being seriously considered for his first NHL appearance until he injured during a breakneck game.Now, Bombay's chances are done and he talks to a close friend about making money, until opportunity knocks when the idea of him coaching Team U.S.A.'s hockey team in the Junior Goodwill Games is proposed. Bombay quickly signs a suit's contract, bands the Ducks together again, and they quickly rustle up the skills and the motivation to win at this year's event and show audiences that Ducks stick together.Need I go further? Should I mention that the kids are now teenagers, yet are still as brazen and as goofy as they were in the first film? Should I go on to mention that Bombay becomes too consumed with coaching a more honored and admired team, and lets all the pressure gets to his head to the point where he is scolding and yelling at his players? Ned I mention that this newfound consumption on Bombay's part has greatly upset a number of players, fueling Ducks-heckler Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson) to aggravate the players? And do I even need to mention that in the third act the Ducks will discover Tyler's surefire knucklepuck and graciously adopt him to the team? One can also make note of the never-ending barrage of one-liners the film haphazardly includes in order to sound hip, motivating, and high-spirited. When one of the only girl players is called a lady, she forcefully replies, I'm no lady, I'm a duck! And when the Ducks face their opponents from Iceland, the crowd chants, We will, we will quack you! in attempt to see how much the audience can cringe in a small period of time.This is kids sports movie-making 101, although it's not harmful as much as it is non-beneficial to any of its viewers. It provides sweet, genial escapist delight and I believe that's what a number of Disney-movie fans seek, which in that case, renders D2 The Mighty Ducks a success according to them. To me, the film is overly long and winded, still far to content with capitalizing on the surprise success of its predecessor, is chock full of clichés, and anchored by its dull characters and formulaic premises. I guess you can also say I'm getting tired of hearing We are the Champions at the end of the picture further capitalizing on the in-game spirit. At least the film knows one thing and that's how to properly utilize Estevez.Starring Emilio Estevez, Joshua Jackson, Michael Tucker, and Kenan Thompson. Directed by Sam Weisman.
