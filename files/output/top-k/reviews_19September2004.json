Everyone saying that this was one of those 'must see classics' finally got to me.I was very pleasantly surprised. I must admit i tend to favour more recent films - these days i like to look out for groundbreaking acting, superb camera movement, stunning cinematography etc , but 'It's A Wonderful Life' just goes to show that all that does not make a good film. Its the story, its the characters.Released in 1946, a whole 36 years before i was born, i thought this would just be another film that the oldies loved, but is just no match for todays masterful film-making techniques. I was wrong, and that makes me happy...The film is all in the story, detailing George Bailey's struggle to get out of his small town, but always putting others before himself and continually sacrificing his chance to live his own life and see the world. By the end, his life takes a nasty turn or two, and he ends up considering suicide to make available his life insurance money to help his family - until a gentle angel named Clarence arrives to show him what life in his town would be like if he was never around...Very well acted (for its era) and very well told, 'It's A Wonderful Life' really is one of the most uplifting films i have ever seen. Frank Capra gently takes us from step to step with our subtly heroic lead, throughout the highs, the almost lows, and the real lows, and you really feel for the guy - He is never presented as perfect - he sometimes yells at his family, his friends, he gets frustrated like all of us, but always does what he can to right his wrongs, and help his townspeople. We like this guy because he's decidedly human, but a good man overall.The films big payoff comes in its finale - after George realises how much he has to live for, he immediately sets about doing just that, embracing his family like he hadn't seen them in years, despite his financial turmoil and seemingly grim future.If this film had been made today, no doubt the ending would be deemed cheesy and unrealistic - today it seems impossible to have a happy ending without the film being accused of taking the easy way out, which is crap - let people end their movie in the way that seems best to them. This film however, though simply shot and unremarkably acted, is truly affecting. George finally realizing that he was cherished and appreciated all along by his friends and clients is a touching moment, and to be honest, i was in tears, crying like a baby with a smacked arse by the end credits.I really urge anyone who has not seen this film to give it a go, even if you think its way, way off your normal movie map. I like Michael Bay films for crying out loud, and i still loved this! Go watch.

For me, this is the one of the signs of a great movie. Another sign of a great movie is where the viewer can relate emotionally with several of the characters; which is rare. In a good movie one can relate to at least one character but in American Beauty, one can relate to several characters at once. We have all had these primal feelings of desire, loosing ourselves in material needs, posing for the neighbors and those around us. This Movie strips those all away and gets down into the trenches of the basic human being. Humor and irony perfectly combined into a movie that is so well done that you can watch it and completely miss out on everything that is important.Lester (Spacey) always being driven (literally and figuratively) around by his wife is not only a metaphor for how this world is run by women and their desires and how men get caught up in a world of trying to please them and become pus_y whipped in the process. Women don't respect a man who isn't a man yet they work feverishly on molding them into something they don't respect. Carolyn (Bening) is so wrapped up in impressing people she doesn't know or care about, that she completely forgot what it is to live a fulfilled life. She has already whipped Lester years ago and there is nothing more that is fun for her to do. Don't bother to see this movie if you only have time to see it once. Watch it without distractions. Let it digest for an hour to a day and watch it again. Great movies grow and blossom just like the American Beauty Rose.Take this movie and let it inspire you to become more than you are but what you could be if you give up the nonsensical things you think are important. In the end we all die alone and nobody cares if you were perfect but they will remark on if you lived your life to the fullest and this is what should be most important to you also.

The characters where believable, the plot was interesting and stimulating, with out being too taxing on the mind, and the musical score was very well versed by the actors (kirsten Dunst is amazing during her little solo, completely blew me away, i hope i can return the favor some time....) and the comedy is light, but plentiful, a great film to go to bed with.As much as i admire the film for its story and consistency thru-out, i have to say that without these obviously talented actors, of which kirsten dunst gives the most outstanding performance, the film would have been yet another unfortunate let down, as my generation has seen so many of thru the years. I cannot stress enough though, how i enjoyed this film and how it has left, a hopefully lasting, impression on my mind.I like to think from every story we learn something, perhaps realizing the mistakes of others, before we make them ourselves, or how sometimes, we all ready know enough, or too much, for which we should be grateful we have the minds to realize we know nothing at all (if that makes sense). At the very least, now i can appreciate the works of mr burt bacherack, and mr elvis costelo, my eyes are open now, thank you very much. I believe soon though, that this will become a forgotten film (un-duely, of course), and those of its genre will be classified as a phase which cinema saw a rise of stars, and these mearly the tools to aid their ascent, but a good film, non the less, and i strongly recommend it to everyone.P.S The credits reminded me of That 70's show, which i haven't seen in along time, so thank you for a great film, and some happy memories.

When they are served rotting, maggot infested meat some of the crew object, only to find themselves singled out and placed in front of a firing squad. With the marines seconds away from firing the deadly shots, ordinary seaman Grigory Vakulinchuk steps into the breach and intervenes to save the men by appealing to the firing squad to ignore their orders. When the officers take their revenge and kill Vakulinchuk, all are bonded together in the struggle; a bond that reaches to the city of Odessa where the rebellion grows, leading to a bloody and historic series of events.It is hard to imagine that anybody who has seen quite a few films in the past few decades would be unaware of this film, but it is perhaps understandable that fewer have had the opportunity to actually sit down and watch. I had never seen this film before but had seen countless references to it in other films and therefore considering it an important film to at least see once. The story is based on real events and this only serves to make it more interesting but even without this context it is still an engaging story. The story doesn't have much in the way of characters but it still brings out the brutality and injustice of events and it is in this that it hooked me &#150; surprisingly violent (implied more than modern gore) it demonising the actions and shows innocents falling at all sides in key scenes. The version I saw apparently had the original score (I'm not being snobby &#150; modern rescores could be better for all I know) and I felt it worked very well to match and improve the film's mood; dramatic, gentle or exciting, it all works very well.The feel of the film was a surprise to me because it stood up very well viewed with my modern eyes. At one or two points the model work was very clearly model work but mostly the film is technically impressive. The masses of extras, use of ships and cities and just the way it captures such well organised chaos are all very impressive and would be even done today. What is more impressive with time though is how the film has a very strong and very clean style to it &#150; it is not as gritty and flat as many silent films of the period that I have seen; instead it is very crisp and feels very, very professional. Of course watching it in 2004 gives me the benefit of hindsight where I can look back over many films that have referenced the images or directors who have mentioned the film in interviews; but even without this 2020 vision it is still possible to see how well done the film is and to note how memorable much of it is &#150; the steps and the firing squad scenes are two very impressive moments that are very memorable. The only real thing that might bug modern audiences is the acting; it isn't bad but silent acting is very different from acting with sound. Here the actors all over act and rely on their bodies to do much of their delivery &#150; word cards just don't do the emotional job so they have to make extra effort to deliver this.Overall this is a classic film that has influenced many modern directors. The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly!

The story is engaging and well worth hearing; the directing is crisp and professional, producing many scenes that linger in the memory; the music works to deliver the emotional edge that modern audiences would normally rely on acting and dialogue to deliver and the whole film is over all too quickly! An essential piece of cinema for those that claim to love the media but also a cracking good film in its own right.

Some films provide a set of memorable images that will stay with the audience for a long while (Citizen Kane, Psycho, Alien, T2, Signs.) And then there's Dario Argento's Suspiria, which is a relentless montage of unforgettable sets, camera moves, composition, and color.Watching the film, I was amazed. Never have I seen a more classic example of 'not what, but how' rule of cinema. Sure, I've seen hundreds of stalking\/chase scenes, hundreds of suspense scenes, hundreds of action sequences involving hundreds of stunts and effects and I'm dozing off in many films. Argento makes his sets, the lighting, the camera all characters in themselves, and thus finds a way to keep his scenes both interesting and intense when he wants them to be.I slept through XXX; I was afraid to blink in Suspiria.Argento is not afraid to let the camera linger, to slowly follow characters as they creep down his elaborate sets, and leave the audience suspended from one perspective for long periods of time. Thanks to the new wave of epileptic-cutting style (Hollywood) film-making brought on by the invention of Avids, I'd nearly forgotten how much more tension, how much more suspense, and how much more interesting a scene can play from an elite handful points of view with strategic cuts.As far as style goes this is, hands down, my favorite horror picture, and the only thing holding it back from being my favorite horror film is the dialogue and some of the characters' childishness. Yes, I have read from more than one source the reason behind this, but it still really irritates me - coming from the mouths of these actors, it makes their characters come across as a bit dimwitted and also as a cheap way of spelling out the plot. From the mouths of children; however, it would be appropriate and perfectly acceptable.I want to rave endlessly about the magic of Argento's use of the frame - how he sets up his death sequences, wonderful use of extreme close ups juxtaposed to extreme distanced shots, a wonderful zoom that starts on two characters talking and finishes on their reflection, Goblin's classic score, and how Argento paints the screen with blues, reds, greens, with masterful precision to direct your eye to his focal points, but I'd be wasting my breath because this is a film that must be experienced firsthand.

Aside from being (quite surprisingly) skilfully photographed in Arri's three-dimensional process, the film has very little to recommend it. Indeed, aside from the unconventional manner in which Jason X was processed, this marks the only episode in the franchise where the photography wasn't strictly by the numbers. No other FT13 director has even attempted to use the 2.351 aspect ratio, and it is quite a surprise to see it used so effectively here.The 3D effects, to give the makers some credit, actually work well. Not in the sense that they enhance the story, but at least to the extent of giving the audience something to be entertained by. The shots of arrows, eyeballs, or yo-yos flying out of the screen are well-realized here. The wide angles, while nothing that the likes of Clint Eastwood or Sergio Leone would be impressed by, still give the film a dynamic missing from its predecessors or successors.Unfortunately, skilled photography and well-realized special effects are not enough to save a film by themselves. Without at least a good story, any film is doomed, and aside from the recent tenth installment, a good story and the FT13 franchise are mutually exclusive. The story content in this episode could have been easily written on a single leaf of A4 paper. Somehow, you have to give a director credit for being able to make ninety-four minutes of feature film out of something so patently uninteresting. Okay, eighty-seven minutes if you discount the stuff that was recycled from the previous film.The acting, as is always the case in an FT13 film, is largely reflective of the script. In other words, you'll find more interesting or convincing performances in your average grade school play. You know a film is garbage when the most memorable performance involves a man sitting on a toilet. Then again, the sound effects and dialogue involved tend to deliver a summary of the film that few other scenes can. Every bit of dialogue here is truly abominable. It seems a trademark of FT13 directors that they cannot even make a conversation about a day's work feel vaguely natural.The characters are probably the worst feature of any FT13 film, but this is an exceptional example. Try to name one unique aspect of the characters shown in this film, and you'll soon see what I mean. If there has ever been a film more reliant on stereotypes to fill character space, I have yet to see it. Probably the funniest characters in the whole film are the biker gang, and they're hardly distinguishable from the rest of the largely white-hat cast.Two stand-out features of this film, widescreen 3D photography aside, are the truly riotous disco music during the opening credits, and this being the episode in which Jason acquires the signature hockey mask. I have to say, however, that with the hilarious break-dancing motif of the opening theme, it would have suited the style a lot better if Jason had held onto the cloth bag.Not surprisingly, I gave the third FT13 film a one out of ten. They were obviously expecting that simple 3D effects would make the film. While this is supposedly the most profitable 3D film ever made (which is nothing to brag about considering how much most others have grossed), history will otherwise not remember this particular 3D film in kind terms.

Aside from being (quite surprisingly) skilfully photographed in Arri's three-dimensional process, the film has very little to recommend it. Indeed, aside from the unconventional manner in which Jason X was processed, this marks the only episode in the franchise where the photography wasn't strictly by the numbers. No other FT13 director has even attempted to use the 2.351 aspect ratio, and it is quite a surprise to see it used so effectively here.The 3D effects, to give the makers some credit, actually work well. Not in the sense that they enhance the story, but at least to the extent of giving the audience something to be entertained by. The shots of arrows, eyeballs, or yo-yos flying out of the screen are well-realized here. The wide angles, while nothing that the likes of Clint Eastwood or Sergio Leone would be impressed by, still give the film a dynamic missing from its predecessors or successors.Unfortunately, skilled photography and well-realized special effects are not enough to save a film by themselves. Without at least a good story, any film is doomed, and aside from the recent tenth installment, a good story and the FT13 franchise are mutually exclusive. The story content in this episode could have been easily written on a single leaf of A4 paper. Somehow, you have to give a director credit for being able to make ninety-four minutes of feature film out of something so patently uninteresting. Okay, eighty-seven minutes if you discount the stuff that was recycled from the previous film.The acting, as is always the case in an FT13 film, is largely reflective of the script. In other words, you'll find more interesting or convincing performances in your average grade school play. You know a film is garbage when the most memorable performance involves a man sitting on a toilet. Then again, the sound effects and dialogue involved tend to deliver a summary of the film that few other scenes can. Every bit of dialogue here is truly abominable. It seems a trademark of FT13 directors that they cannot even make a conversation about a day's work feel vaguely natural.The characters are probably the worst feature of any FT13 film, but this is an exceptional example. Try to name one unique aspect of the characters shown in this film, and you'll soon see what I mean. If there has ever been a film more reliant on stereotypes to fill character space, I have yet to see it. Probably the funniest characters in the whole film are the biker gang, and they're hardly distinguishable from the rest of the largely white-hat cast.Two stand-out features of this film, widescreen 3D photography aside, are the truly riotous disco music during the opening credits, and this being the episode in which Jason acquires the signature hockey mask.

It starts out with the Russian nuclear submarine headed for the American coast for unknown reasons, and the US of course gets a bit worried about this...Using some new high-tech device, the Russian sub is capable of going into stealth mode, thus being able to move about in the ocean without being noticed by radars. This worries the US government even more, but Jack Ryan, a guy who seems to be an expert in nearly every field imaginable, comes up with a theory that the Russians are not trying to attack the US, but in fact defect. And that's the start of this political thriller.There's really not much of interest here, besides Sean Connery and Sam Neill, perhaps. But the movie does have an all-star cast. Joining Sean and Sam are Alec Baldwin, James Earl Jones, Stellan Skarsgård, Tim Curry and many more. All of these great actors, however, are given minor roles with little to no screen time. The only real actors who are featured in two scenes, or more, are Alec, Sean and Sam. But Alec doesn't really deliver a great performance (why do people like him?) so it's up to Sean to hold the show up.The movie is actually pretty boring. Most of it consists of three things Alecs character thinking, Sean and Sam talking in the Russian submarine or Alecs character thinking in a submarine with Sean and Sam talking in the background. It's pretty dull, really. What else is there to say?As usual in these kinds of flicks, the Russians are the bad guys. In this movie, their plan is actually to blow up the states. I doubt the real life Russians would actually want that, but hey it's Hollywood (and Tom Clancy) so here it's allowed (but it is getting a bit tiresome).There's really not much to say about this film, except that Sean Connery and Sam Neill are the only real good things about it. So if you're a die-hard fan of them, go see it. But if you're not, don't bother. It's not that great.4\/10.

This closeness becomes more like them both sharing one self in two bodies as they study in the same area and eventually become experts in the field of gynaecology. They share everything and few can tell them apart; an arrangement that works well until Beverly falls for a patient (Claire Niveau) and finds that there are things he doesn't want to share with Elliot. As Bev confronts the idea of them being separate for the first time ever, he starts to fall apart mentally and, when Elliot tries to reach out and help him he too is drawn into confusion over identity and an inability to find where one of them stops and the other starts.Being a Cronenberg film I knew to expect body horror and, shall I say, an 'unusual' theme and in many ways the film delivered in spades but in a much more cerebral fashion. The plot is not easy to explain but it is a totally convincing breakdown of both Elliot and Beverly as they lose contact with the lines between them (if the lines ever really existed). Of course it is rather extreme but it is relentlessly interesting in terms of the script and the characters. The gynaecological part of the film allows Cronenberg to explore his more usual body horror stuff but this all came second to the much more interesting material that exists in the script. Cronenberg appears to be as fascinated as me by the characters and he directs with a cold eye, letting the creepy atmosphere come from not only the story but every shot, every set and every performance; not only this but this is one of his more accessible films without losing much of what makes Cronenberg Cronenberg.Of course a massive part of the film working is two perfect performances from Jeremy Irons, who I have not seen better in any other films. Using special effects as well as the old 'over the shoulder' technique, Irons is able to convincingly be on screen in two characters at the same time, but it is not the shot framing that makes it convincingly two characters, it is Irons' performance that does that. His Beverly is so feeble and has a convincing breakdown; while his Elliot appears much more together but suffers in a different way from the same struggle. Obviously being identical, it is due to Irons that the two characters come across so very different but yet seem just like the same person. In every little scene he manages to stay in character no matter what &#150; it's hard for me to describe, you need to really see it for yourself. Bujold is good in support early on but, as the twins' story gets more complex, her characters feels a bit intrusive and uninteresting, but generally she is good. However, to talk about anyone beyond this is to suggest there is room for them in the film &#150; there isn't. Instead the film is pretty much dominated by two people &#150; and they are both Jeremy Irons, producing two great performances that were vital for the film to work.Overall this may be a little too weird for some viewers but many more will find it to be one of their favourite Cronenberg films on the basis that it has the qualities that makes him him but is also a lot more accessible as well. The body horror is there in the background but it is the psychological scarring and confusion that is of much more interest; the script is great even if the plot goes to the usual Cronenberg excesses but it is two perfect performances by Irons that makes it all come together in a compelling and interesting film.
