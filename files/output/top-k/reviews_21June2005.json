Here we have two of Hollywood's most respected actors demonstrating that they cannot handle such a convoluted story such as this. In fact, give this story to even any of the actors throughout the history of Hollywood this story and I don't think anyone could have pulled it off. Let's get right down to it, the story is what hurt this film. I agree that I don't think Katharine Hepburn should have dabbled in comedy, especially with a script like this, but I guess she could only work with what she had &#133; which was nothing. Air, space, and dead time would have created better viewing than this story did, but alas, director Howard Hawks decides to fill that space with annoying songs, backwards stories, and characters that never quite leap out of the puddles of mediocrity that they sleep in.What really hurts this story is that there is too much happening to allow any real comedy to develop. From the uncharacteristic meeting between David and Susan to the dinosaur bone to the leopard in the yard, I never quite saw the humor in it. In fact, I hardly laughed at this film at all. I felt Hepburn gave one of her worst performances as this annoying rich girl that gets upset whenever she doesn't get what she wants. Grant tries to counter the horrid acting by Hepburn by playing his character a bit low key, but the chemistry never quite develops. There is no spark between the two. I never felt like they were really in love. Hepburn's comic timing was incredibly off in this film, causing most of the film to follow her lead. The rest of the cast would try to overcompensate for her misjudgment causing even more chaos in this film. One scene that immediately comes to mind is when Susan and David, with the dog, are singing to Baby on the rooftop. All of their voices together were like fingernails on a chalkboard. Was this to be funny? I am glad that we have evolved a bit further than this in that genre or it may have died directly after this film was made. Comedy is not something that can be taught. You either have it or you don't, and I do not believe Hepburn had it.No matter how bad the acting was, it still didn't compare to the nightmarish story. Perhaps I missed something throughout my 102-minute viewing, but the elements of this screwball comedy just never congealed together that well. Coupled with the below par acting, this film really never got off the ground. As audience members, we were mislead from the beginning and never quite found our stepping for the remaining moments. For example, during the opening credit sequences and on the discs of the DVD there are images of Hepburn and Grant helping the leopard eat and live life as if it was their child. It shows the leopard in diapers and in other whimsical hijinks, but we were not privileged enough to see that in the actual film. If that had been a bigger part of the story, than I think perhaps the comedy aspect would have been greater. We needed more moments with Baby instead of trying to build a relationship between David and Susan literally out of nothing. With a lacking chemistry, a poor excuse for a story, and comedy that was perhaps written by Baby herself, this 102-minute film felt more like 302 minutes of living, breathing torture.Overall, I just could not get excited about this film. This was one of those movies that took me two nights to finish because I just couldn't wrap my hands around anything substantial. I wanted greater comedy, but outside of Grant, our characters just acted annoying rather than funny. Hepburn was completely miscast in this feature, and the entire twenty minutes at the end of the film seemed rather rushed and aggravating than whimsical. I was hoping that this film would be more about the leopard instead of the people, but director Howard Hawks took it in a different direction, which ultimately hurt the outcome. This should have been a movie about a leopard co-starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, not the other way around. I didn't enjoy this movie in the least, and still wake up sweating at nights after nightmares of Hepburn, the dog, and Grant singing to the leopard.

A man who has made movies like Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, 2001 A Space Odyssey and so many more excellent movies, doesn't deserve any less than to be seen as one of the greatest ever. But I really wonder what he had in mind when making this one. This was his last, but in my opinion also his least...The movie tells the story of a doctor who becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife has admitted that she has had sexual fantasies about a man she once met. She hates the fact that he doesn't admit that he has had similar fantasies in the past and keeps torturing him with the idea. This leads him into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a hooker, but when he pays a visit to a nightclub where he meets an old friend, he learns about a special secret society where sexual rituals are performed. Intrigued by the unknown, he decides to attend one of their congregations, but almost immediately finds himself in a lot of trouble. Not only is his own life in danger, so are his marriage and the lives of his wife and daughter...Before you think that I didn't like this movie because of all the nudity or the sexual content, I want you to know that such things don't bother me at all, certainly not when they add to the story and are brought in a very nice way (like in this movie for instance). No, what really bothered me about this movie was it's incredibly slow pace. I'm used to watch alternative and 'foreign' (read European, South American and Asian movies), but this certainly was one of the slowest that I've ever seen. Some will say that it helps to see the 'dream-like' state the characters are in... Possible, but it certainly didn't work for me. I got bored after a while and almost thought about hitting the fast forward button (something that I've never had before with other movies). I'm not saying that I wanted to see several action scenes in this movie either. Those who know me or those who have read several of my reviews on this website will know that I'm far from a fan of action-filled movies. I hate big explosions, a couple million rounds fired at an innocent bystander,... I really don't like that and don't need it to enjoy a movie. What I want is a very powerful story, some excellent acting and some nice camera-work. That, I did get from this movie at regular moments.Kubrick certainly knew how to create a certain atmosphere, thanks to the clever use of music and original camera work. And the fact that he chose Kidman and Cruise as his two main actors wasn't a bad choice either. But it is never enough to save the entire movie and the main reason why it got a lot of its publicity is probably because the director died before the project was closed and because Kidman and Cruise decided to end their marriage shortly after the movie was released...

It has inspired many producers, writers and directors, but not everyone of them has done a very good job with it. Some of these movies weren't exactly good or very believable, making it hard for the others to find an interested public. But if you are interested in the subject and you want to see a good movie about it, than I can definitely recommend this one.The title of this movie Interview with the Vampire The Vampire Chronicles already reveals a lot about what you can expect from it. It tells the story of a young journalist in San Fransisco, at the present day, who follows a man through the streets and ends up in an anonymous room with him. When the journalist starts to interview the man, the stranger tells him that he is a vampire, being over 200 years old. The journalist doesn't believe him, but after the man proves it's true, he tells his story. He once was a plantation owner outside New Orleans in 1791. His wife died when giving birth to his child and he had lost all will to live, when a vampire named Lestat offered him the chance to become a vampire himself. He accepted, but soon realized that life as a vampire isn't all that great either. Then he met a little girl, Claudia, who influenced and changed the rest of his eternal life...Next to a good story, you'll also get some nice performances from the top cast that played in this movie. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas... all did a very nice job, each portraying a vampire with an entirely different nature, but it was the young Kirsten Dunst who surprised me the most. Even though she was only 12 at the time, she already showed what a good actress she once would be.All in all this is a movie that will be loved by all the fans of vampire movies, but even when you aren't too much a fan of this movie, I think this has plenty of good things to offer. Think for instance of the decors, the clothing, the story and the acting. It all works very well together and that's why I give this movie a 7.5\/10.

She's still one of the prettiest women in Hollywood and I sure would like to see her a little more often. But if you ask me if there are any other reasons why you certainly shouldn't miss this movie, than I'm afraid that I'll not be able to give you a decent answer...The movie's story is about a brutal murder on an important millionaire in San Francisco. When the assistant district attorney investigates the mysterious death, he discovers that the first suspect in this case is a friend of his, who is married to an important lawyer. While he has to suppress his personal feelings in order not to lose sight on the reality, he will have to entangle a close knitted web of blackmail, prostitution and intrigue...I can easily understand why so many people are disappointed by this movie. It uses about every possible cliché that you can come up with bizarre murder weapons, blackmail, adultery, criminals in high places, kinky sex, hidden cameras, a chase scene, nudity, knives, guns... And normally I would have a lot of problems with that as well, but in this case I already knew what to expect. I'm not saying that this means that it all a sudden became a good movie, but knowing what to expect certainly made it a bit easier for me not to be too annoyed by it.But even when I try to forget about these flaws, I can never forget about the fact that the acting isn't exactly, to put it nicely, spectacular. But than again, what else can you expect from a cast that has only two more or less known names in it. Most of the actors have played some minor roles in other productions, but they have never been able to make name in Hollywood and there is a good reason for they aren't worth much... David Caruso didn't do a bad job and Linda Fiorentino was nice to watch, but that isn't enough to save this movie. I give it a 6\/10, probably only because of Fiorentino.

Supposedly an incredibly stuffy woman she defied social and family pressure to be seen to find delight in the company of a man of low-ish social status. It would be ridiculous to even contemplate that our current Queen could and would find the psychological strength to enter into this kind of forbidden relationship and friendship had she been made a widow like Victoria in her late 30's. In fact I find it impossible to think that she would be capable of finding delight and be able to appreciate the warmth of a rough and ready but obviously sharp and proud figure like John Brown and fall, for a time at least, like Victoria, under the spell of such a dominating but low-status personality. The current Queen is definitely of the upstairs-downstairs personality and is\/has been capable of only appreciating company inside her own narrow social circle, so if she had have faced widowhood at the same age as Victoria, we could automatically discount anything beyond the strictest formality in her relationship with her staff.Both women were\/are quite adept and had\/have a native intelligence and were\/are fools to no one yet we live in an age when snobbery is supposedly dead or at least laying low and that Victorian Britain was this incredibly uptight place, yet Victoria, in her time and place finds both the personal strength and the imagination to defy convention.Wouldn't such behaviour contradicting such pre-conceived images about the up tight nature of Victorian society make such assertions over-simplistic and indicate that the rather shallow and partial perspective we are taught to hold on such an age needs a corrective (UMM always wary of using THAT word these days) change on the rudder? Some of the scenes would seem to beg some explanation. Brown was apparently beaten up and then Victoria was told he had been in a fight through having had too much to drink and at the same time Prince Edward was trying to get Brown the sack. Though this type of semi-biographical film always has scenes and events inserted from a certain perspective for dramatic effect I would imagine that the beating up was real enough and not dramatic license. If this event did happen then was Prince Edward behind the planning of the beating? The fortuitous timing would certainly point to that conclusion.This relationship had tragedy built in. We can only surmise if it is worth someone like Brown to live in the limelight knowing very much in his heart that he is like a moth attracted to a flame and that he was due, after a period of being a essential companion, to suffer years of benign neglect. From what I can gather from the film he was by her side for 4 years at the very most and that he then spent the entire 1870's and early 80's in obscurity once she had re-entered her role of monarch to the British public.In fact the scene with Disraeli on the mountain top shows that he knows that once she is out of the Balmoral & the Highlands that his time as crucial companion will come to an end yet he is unable to refuse Disraeli clear invitation to use his influence to make her re-enter the orbit of being the public monarch. Again I think the Disrali-Brown meeting, whatever it's location, the substance of that discussion, though given dramatic license, must logically have taken place, though the film portrays that the single momentous, as it happen, event that brought Victoria back from the role of grieving widow into the role of Queen one again was Prince Edward falling ill with Cholera.The film is quite brilliant at bringing out that moment which began the marginalisation and eventual elimination of John Brown's reign of influence over Victoria and his eventual psychological and physical destruction. It would be a spoiler to describe the actual scene but it is exceedingly well done and you are left in no doubt that this is the end for John Brown if not for Victoria. So who really then was the tragic figure in all of this??? Had he saved her only to be led inexorably on the road to eventual self-destruction?Maybe the main reason why I related so much to the JB character highly intelligent man who has a commanding presence who is forced to suffer from being subordinate to those of inferior intellect from an inability to kow-tow but is afflicted with a fatal weakness whose consumption dominates his whole life so closely echoes the memory of a Scotsman with whom I was a student 35 years ago.I saw him occasionally in the years after as he failed to rise up the greasy hierarchy and each time, as I saw the physical evidence of his decline, wondered what it is that drives a seemingly immensely strong personality onwards into an inevitable self-destruction and death.Alcoholic oblivion is a temporary fix which enables you to neutralised those feelings of unfulfilled status but whose inevitable result is your own demise.Whilst it may not be an exclusively Scottish way to live and die the culture of heavy drinking seems an incredibly destructive force on otherwise unstoppable charismatic personalities through the generations.

My first encounter with this much-anticipated followup to the classic original came at a Drive-In back in 1978. At the time I was 16 and a huge fan of the first movie, having seen it several times back when I was only 13. With a carload of teenagers around my own age, we took the summer drive one evening and watched the new sequel. I was greatly disappointed at the time realizing, even at that young an age, that this was an uninspired cash-in with no real story and a quickly contrived plot to utilize a group of know-it-all kids who are on a carefree sailing trip only to become fish food for the newest Great White shark.

It seems like all hope is lost until daddy Brody shows up in a stolen police boat and lures the shark to bite down on an electric power cable which puts a fiery finish on this dashed-off chapter of the JAWS saga.The real assets to the film are director Jeannot Szwarc (who inherited it when original director John Hancock retreated) and returning star Roy Scheider.

Scheider had recently walked off THE DEER HUNTER and Universal agreed to forget about it if the actor would do the Jaws sequel.

So rather than wait it out, Universal wanted to go ahead with the sequel at any cost and what the price turned out to be was a great story. As it turned out, we got the aforementioned teens in peril approach, with a film aimed at a younger audience. JAWS 2 is not without merit; some of the shark sequences are well staged, and one scene that is especially chilling features Ann Dusenberry as a terrified teen found cowering inside her tiny boat after her boyfriend has just been eaten by the shark; it sends shivers down the spine.

That's something I don't really understand about Hollywood Why do they always have to make remakes of European and Asian movies? Is it because they can't bare the thought that someone else might have come up with an idea for a movie that actually worked or is it because they believe that no-one will have seen the original version and therefor will believe that the remake is actually an original movie? I don't know, but I find it quite sad actually. Still, if it is a good movie, I can see past that... The story is situated in Alaska this time. When Detective Will Dormer is sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town, he accidentally shoots his own partner while trying to apprehend a suspect. But instead of admitting that he shot the man, he uses an unexpected alibi. But that doesn't make it easier for him, it only adds to his guilt and makes it almost impossible for him to cope with his emotions. Add to this the fact that he can't sleep because of the midnight sun, the murder case that needs to be solved, the investigation that has been opened against him, some blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander, orchestrated by the man they were chasing and you know that it is all getting much too big to handle for one man...I can't say that I had ever heard of Nikolaj Frobenius or Erik Skjoldbjærg before, but they sure know how to write an interesting script. The story is nice and there are enough twists to keep you guessing until the end about who actually did it and once you know that, why he did it.

Verhoeven and screenwriter Joe Eszterhas are responsible for this pretty mess. It is so incredibly bad that you can't help but laugh. You ask yourself Were they serious when they made this film? You know they are, which makes you laugh even more.Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) arrives in Las Vegas with dreams of being a dancer. She hooks up with Molly (Gina Ravera), who is a designer and works behind the scenes at The Stardust Hotel and Casino. It is during a visit that Nomi meets Cristal Connor (Gina Gershon), and things between the two get mean. Nomi at this point works at the Cheetah, run by the incredibly slimy Al (Robert Davi), and is offered a part in the Goddess show at the Stardust. Nomi and Cristal constantly go for each others throats, and Nomi wants Cristal's spot, her man Zach(Kyle MacLachlan), and fame.To be honest, this is pretty much a pornographic version of All About Eve. Don't believe me? Check out the scene when Zach confronts Nomi about who she is (Just like Addison with Eve!). The dialog is incredibly laughable (I bought it at Ver Sayce!), and there is a lot of contradictions Nomi constantly says she is not a whore, yet every single thing she does to get ahead suggests that she is! Plus, James (Glenn Plummer), lectures Nomi about AIDS and doing questionable sexual stuff, yet he gets caught with a fellow stripper AND gets her pregnant! (And that part about Nomi's time of the month? One word GROSS!). Finally, I must gripe about the rape scene. The film's only moral character ends up getting raped by a singer (More like a poor man's Michael Bolton) and his 2 bodyguards. This was just incredibly horrible and pointless. Again, this is a laughably bad film that was supposed to have been taken seriously, and failed miserably. If you enjoy watching cinema train wrecks, then this is the must-have in your collection. The V.I.P. Box Set is a must have not just for the little goodies (shot glass, cards, drinking games), but for the commentary by David Schmader, which makes the film even more fun!

First off, as many have said, this film tries way way way too hard to be meaningful and poetic. It falls flat on its face looking very cheap and cliché. The movie is directed like it is an episode of C.H.I.Ps. There is so much winking at the camera and being tongue in cheek. The so called humor also is unbelievably stupid. The acting was very bad and it was terribly casted(Lee Marvin was at least bearable). None of the characters were interesting and the storyline was so disconnected since the movie just appears like a bunch of separate vignettes. Back to the directing, it is shot like a 60s film(I have nothing against 60s movies) and it just does not fit the script, which is wretched, and this movie could have worked better as a 30 second Go Army ad on the TV. The ending of this movie relates to my titling of the summary. When Lee Marvin liberates the concentration camp, he comes across a dying young boy and carries him on his shouldered. We slowly see the boy keeling over as her dies on Lee Marvin's shoulders as he walks on. This could have been a GREAT and touching scene, but then of course we get cut off by Robert Carradine's annoying narration and the rest of the scene gets cut to the crappy storyline. The other parts of the liberation are done so poorly that let's just say the victims of this terrible war would be rolling over in their graves.
