Don't take that the wrong way, the movie entertained me, but those entertaining parts were few and far between. Between what? Well, nothing (Nothing as in bland snow-cast lands) And I'll say the movie was awfully long feeling for only being one and a half hours or so.The humor of this comedy if mostly created by those over-exaggerated (I hope) accents. And when everybody else is laughing at that and I felt left out. Lucky for you, you're probably in that 'everybody' category.Other parts were entertaining though, a number seemingly useless actions, shots of funny things we all do once in a while and of course, the all superior chit-chat type of humor. Basically the type of humor Steve Buscemi is known for; the kind I like.But between these glory blessed scenes of humor are a few nice-to-watch action sequences and frankly, quite unentertaining conversations. But where the movie fails the most -- where it could've been made better, is the overall atmosphere. It isn't edgy like 8 Mile or laid-back like Pulp Fiction, it's more along the lines of . . . nothing. Not only that the scenery consists of homey feeling houses and as I said before, snow. Officially, I'm not retiring to Fargo, North Dakota after watching this movie. It seems much too cold and depressing.And while some of the scenes could have been polished up, sped up, or even cut out, the acting is fairly funny and a few characters are good, while others are bland and bad. Steve Buscemi's Carl is of course my favorite character, and the conflicting pair between him and Grimshrud creates a few good jokes. Shep Proudfoot adds a little spice and Marge the expecting cop is nicely done as well. But the rest of the characters just seem to annoy me, especially Jerry Lundegaard. He appeared very self-centered (as he was meant to), and there was nothing to like about him. But somehow he did'nt seems villainous enough to be the bad guy, leaving him looking like neutral\/bland character.So in the end, it just seems that Fargo has something bad to bring done each good things it has going for it, thus earning it a nice average 5 out of 10. While my friends seemed enjoy it, I nearly killed myself watching it the second time through. So for me, it is more or less not worth a rent.

This is really a mesh between a Quentin Tarantino crime picture and a Robert Rodriguez horror film.The first half involves Tarantino and George Clooney as Richard and Seth Gecko trying to get into Mexico and away from the FBI and the Texas Rangers since Richard broke Seth out of jail, helped him rob a bank and spilled a considerable amount of blood doing so. They kidnap Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and first-timer Ernest Liu) and use their RV to get across the border. When over the border they go to the Titty Twister, a rowdy bar for bikers and truckers, where Richard and Seth plan on meeting their friend Carlos, sometime between dusk and dawn, so they can give him a cut of their loot. Little do they know, the Titty Twister is a front for a group of vampires who prey on unsuspecting truckers and bikers.From Dusk Till Dawn is a violent, campy, and mostly entertaining movie. Tarantino wrote the screenplay and does a stellar job as Richard Gecko, and Rodriguez directed it which makes it feel a bit like Desperado and Pulp Fiction thrown together with some campy horror.The main things I liked about this movie were the actors. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are really convincing as two criminal brothers. When Seth finds the dead, raped body of a woman who was supposed to be their hostage, he asks Seth if it's his fault and if he (Richard) thinks that's what he (Seth) is like. I also liked Harvey Kietel as a minister who seems to have lost his faith and Juliette Lewis, who I usually find annoying, as his daughter. Plus, Salma Hayek is ultra-sexy as an exotic dancer.I preferred the first half of the movie to the semi-campy gore-invested second half. The vampires look like a cross between zombies and vampires, which I don't think works very well, and the special effects are obviously fairly low budget, plus I'm not a huge gory-horror movie fan. While the effects are fairly cheesy, I got the feeling they weren't supposed to look very real anyway since their are a lot of jokes and visual gags. A group talk about ways to kill vampires is amusing and pokes fun at vampire movie clichés and Juliette Lewis has a funny scene where she is unsure about stabbing a possibly bitten trucker.Overall I'd give From Dusk Till Dawn seven stars of of ten, it's a entertaining movie with some fun performances and an original story, but the effects are awkward since it's hard to tell whether they are purposely cheesy or just low budget. Check it out if you get the chance.

Check it out if you get the chance.

This is a world full of tough, gritty and eccentric characters who cheat each other on everything from rigged unlicensed boxing games to multi-million pound diamond heists. This heist is central to the wide montage of characters in Snatch who all want a piece of the action.Snatch has one of the greatest opening credits in film history. It follows then, that the rest of the film should be equally entertaining and stylish, and it just about makes it. It is a viciously styled thrill of crime, humour and attitude almost solely propelled by the dialogue and interactions of its characters. There are no sugarcoating action effects or stunning visuals to detract - the core is the focus, and the core is its many dynamic characters, like Bricktop, Turkish and Tony and the hilarious situations they get themselves into. The stupidity and amateurism of these 'gangsters' provide for the comedic effect, as is Richie's style.The only slight flaw, as I can see it, is the lack of cinematic harmony. In other words, there is no traceable thread throughout the film - more likes a series of entertaining scenes. You know how some people are just born to write, and others have to practice to get to the same level or articulation and vocabulary - but ultimately, the idea of 'what sounds good' cannot be taught and the natural writer will be the better one. It is probably the same in direction, and Guy Ritchie is not a natural talent as there is no harmony. It's pretty good yes, but not harmonic.When I say more 'assured' direction on Richie's part, I mean that in Snatch, every scene and character serves a purpose - unlike in Lock, Stock where longer segments were often used. But above all, you can tell that the director had fun with the script because it translates so well in the film. It is more hilarious than anything, and the accents provide for half the comedy.

I picked this up at my local supermarket to-day. Ninety-nine pence, less than one pound from the bargain bin. As soon as I saw Billy-Bob was in it (I'm a fan after Monster's Ball & A Simple Plan) I thought it would be a good idea. The fact that the Coen Brothers were behind the film sold it to me - last of the big spenders eh?It was a VHS cassette, in black & white monochrome. The atmosphere was set from the start. The narrative from Thornton was delivered in such gravelly , gravitas laden tones it just made you sit up and take notice. How evocative were the props in the way of old barber shop fittings and the drop dead gorgeous cars - big old American gas guzzlers ,as aerodynamic as refrigerators some of 'em but boy did they look good. I have no idea where this movie would have been set. I would guess probably the mid-west somewhere but I could be hopelessly wrong.It was a splendidly interwoven plot with great contributions from all the cast. I was surprised to see a young Scarlett Johannsen in this film, I don't know much about her and have only seen one of her other roles (Lost in Translation) but she had something about her here. The feeling I had reminded me of first seeing Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider , three decades after its first release. It was obvious Nicholson would go on to stardom. This was Scarlett's 'Easy Rider' in my opinion. Her actions in causing the accident was a little bit out of character for me but maybe I'm just naive. Fifty-five years old, but still happily naive !The sombre, austere lighting and spartan sets created an air of simplicity and this film was just made for the black & white medium.Holding my attention from start to finish this unusual piece of work will not be enjoyed by everyone, but if you have some depth, do not always need crash, bang and wallop to enjoy your cinema then I recommend it highly.

The plot is beyond amazing and it's events are very well connected. Surely, the movie starts great with the serial killer's situation, then it becomes slow moving but that's good because it gives you important information. The ending is shocking, brutal... The direction is great. It has a feeling of old monster movies mixed with 80's Slasher craziness, and even some comic book references. The werewolfs are extremely cool and believe me, you can't get better werewolf f\/x than this. The gore is great also.

The atmosphere is creepy all the time and that is mainly because of the excellent cinematography. This is a dark movie in all the sense of the word.Please, watch The Howling because it's probably the best Werewolf movie in twenty years and because it's an important Horror movie from the 80's. The movie starts directly to the point. A brave t.v. reporter (Dee Wallace Stone) meets with a serial killer known as Eddie in order to get important information that could lead to solve the mystery of a killing spree in the city. When she meets him in a XXX store, he tries to attack her but police quickly shot him before. This traumatic events lead our heroine to seek the help of a psychologist who recommends her some rest in a special place he owns.

The community is very weird. This community is a Werewolf community which has members such as serial killers, sexy vamps, and even old men among it's members. What is the mystery about the community? Who can help our heroine? Could it be that human society has something to do with it? The Howling is a perfect example of how something is much more better than what it looks.

The cinematography was OK; the lighting kind of weakened it. And the acting was good. They weren't the best, but, fairly talented.However, it was disappointing.

A few of the actions there were really unnecessary, some of the elements of the house that welcomed protagonist Eleanor (Lili Taylor), I could see was sort of copied from Rosemary's Baby, as I said - were unnecessary. I think they were put there to make intense moments in the film or take it far, But as my title suggests, they just couldn't.Let me state some examples (if some of these were in the book, I can understand why they were there. If not, then I cannot). Near the end, an enraged Luke (Owen Wilson) suddenly went mad, tearing away at Hugh Crane's portrait with a candlestick and then raving away that they should burn the house down, thus angering the spirit of Hugh Crane. This gets him killed. First of all, I don't think they should have gotten him killed. Luke was just a fellow insomniac, as he likes to quote so much, with opinions and reputations no worse nor better than any of the other characters in there. He had no reason to die. It wasn't going to alter the film so much, nor was it going to teach anything, and it wasn't going to make it better or more intense. In fact, it just made it worse. I was thinking, whoa, why'd he just do that? Even so, if he really had to die, then he could've done it in a better way, instead of that random, suddenly-going-mad drama (that was very unlike him) that he broke into. The part where the carpet drags him to the fireplace and he is smashed (or gorged) by that chimney opening thing was scary, but honestly, if the film went like it was supposed too, it wouldn't have to have been there.And especially so, what was the conflict between Hugh Crane and Nell? At one point she says that he wants her, then later it's revealed that she is one of his great-great granddaughters, indicating the obvious fact that Crane won't let her go like he didn't let his other children go. But sooner or later (or the middle of that), Nell sees herself pregnant in the spinning room illusions. Now what? He wants incest with her too? Even if that pregnant thing has got nothing to do with Hugh Crane or her, it's too random. Why'd they put it in there? And if it's not random, that some of the hidden facts in there set if off, then I demand an explanation telling exactly why.Overall, I would have enjoyed this film if it didn't have such excess intensity.

Each day I would come home from elementary school (I was probably 6 years old when the series debuted) turn on the television and be whisked away to the far off reaches of the galaxy.I regret that I wasn't able to see Transformers The Movie at the theater. Being from rural Kentucky we only had one cinema and unfortunately Transformers didn't draw enough interest to be shown on the big screen. I saw it several months later on VHS, but it was definitely worth the wait. The plot is fairly rudimentary (good vs. evil), but there is so much more to Transformers. It was definitely the cartoon for intelligent children. I never truly appreciated the complexity of the series until I got older. How many shows of this genre have dealt with topics such as death? The concept of death is sometimes difficult for an adult to fully grasp, let alone the children who were the target audience. In the movie we witness the demise of some of the most popular characters in the franchise (although this was likely done to usher in the season 3 bots). I do believe that the death scenes hurt the overall success of the movie and the subsequent Season 3, but were very necessary elements to the film. I mean c'mon the Autobots and Decepticons were AT WAR! How many wars have ended without casualties? The series wasn't quite as graphic, but often times Optimus Prime was faced with very difficult decisions (Watch The Ultimate Doom for instance).The animation in the film is superb...as is the soundtrack. With the exception of Dare to Be Stupid there isn't a weak song in the movie. Leonard Nimoy pulls off an amazing voice characterization as Galvatron and I was also pleased as usual with Peter Cullen as Prime, the late Chris Latta as Starscream, and the legendary Frank Welker as Megatron (among others).The only quarrels I have with the movie would be the dance scene with the Junkions (while their friends are being gobbled up by a gigantic moon-gobbling planet), and the introduction of Blurr and Wheelie. In a perfect world they would have been fed to the Sharkticons ). The introduction of the matrix of leadership seemed to come out of thin air.

From what I had always heard about the man, I fell into the trap of assuming this movie would be nothing more than a self-serving, contrived view of his life. Boy was I mistaken. This was a very good movie, thanks in part to an excellent performance by Woody Harrelson as Mr. Flynt and a wonderful supporting cast.The film chronicles Flynt's struggles as a poor boy growing up deep in the hills of Kentucky to his transformation into one of the most influential advocates of the freedom of speech in the world. Along the way, Flynt meets some very interesting characters, including his soon to be wife Althea (Courtney Love) and the sister of President Jimmy Carter.The People vs. Larry Flynt contains elements of a Hollywood classic. It is the story of a man who, although quite eccentric, conquered the world. He turned a few seedy bars in southern Ohio into a multi-million dollar publication almost overnight. But just when you thought he was on top of the world, he suffers a devastating loss when appearing in court in Georgia. Flynt kept a low profile for several years, becoming sort of a recluse and became addicted to painkillers. Larry Flynt definitely had his share of personal demons, as we learn that fame and fortune almost always come with a price. His life was so surreal that at times during the movie I asked myself 'Did this really happen?' I am almost convinced that some portions of this movie were embellished a little to make the film more dramatic (especially the courtroom scenes) but for the most part it is historically accurate.Directed by Academy Award winner Milos Forman (for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1975), the film is aesthetically pleasing. Forman really knows how to get the most out of the actors in his movies. At times you forget that Woody Harrelson is portraying a character, you actually begin to think that he really IS Larry Flynt. There are also notably good showings by Love, Edward Norton and even a cameo from the real Larry Flynt, who plays a judge.I'm giving this movie a score of 8\/10. The People vs. Larry Flynt is one of the better comedy-dramas of recent years and definitely worth checking out. If you are a defender of our First Amendment Right and a proponent of free speech and press, then you will enjoy this film. I only regret that I didn't watch it sooner.

It is the story of a man who, although quite eccentric, conquered the world. He turned a few seedy bars in southern Ohio into a multi-million dollar publication almost overnight. But just when you thought he was on top of the world, he suffers a devastating loss when appearing in court in Georgia. Flynt kept a low profile for several years, becoming sort of a recluse and became addicted to painkillers. Larry Flynt definitely had his share of personal demons, as we learn that fame and fortune almost always come with a price. His life was so surreal that at times during the movie I asked myself 'Did this really happen?' I am almost convinced that some portions of this movie were embellished a little to make the film more dramatic (especially the courtroom scenes) but for the most part it is historically accurate.Directed by Academy Award winner Milos Forman (for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1975), the film is aesthetically pleasing. Forman really knows how to get the most out of the actors in his movies. At times you forget that Woody Harrelson is portraying a character, you actually begin to think that he really IS Larry Flynt. There are also notably good showings by Love, Edward Norton and even a cameo from the real Larry Flynt, who plays a judge.I'm giving this movie a score of 8\/10. The People vs. Larry Flynt is one of the better comedy-dramas of recent years and definitely worth checking out. If you are a defender of our First Amendment Right and a proponent of free speech and press, then you will enjoy this film. I only regret that I didn't watch it sooner.

But when he goes to James Cann and is denied a steady job due to lack of education, he takes up with Joaquin and gets into a whole bunch of trouble. Charlize plays Mark's cousin and Joaquin's fiancée, she defends Mark and therefore results in tragic consequences with Joaquin.The film is over all pretty good, but not enough to really grab my attention.

I don't really find him that character that annoying or offensive. He has a couple of moments that make me chuckle, but for the most part he's not funny unless your five. His character is a very self conscious attempt to pander to that kind of audience and it just fails. Furthermore, Jar Jar isn't important to the story. Many of the other characters in the story give Jar Jar annoyed looks and go about their business to more interesting parts of the story; I do the same as a member of the audience.I LOVE those more interesting parts of the story! First of all, Liam Neeson is my favorite actor and it's a treat to see him play a Jedi. It's perfect casting. I also enjoyed the fact that Qui-gin Jinn seemed to have some grey areas; he was definitely a good guy but there was something ambiguous about him that I appreciated.The main thing about this movie is that I got to see many of the things that were mentioned in the other three movies. The Senate. Anakin and Obi-wan meeting for the first time. R2 and 3PO meeting for the first time. Anakin as a child. Jedi knights in their prime, fighting the bad guys. It may not be exactly what I've been picturing in my head since I found out that there was a backstory. For the most part I don't really care. I wasn't expecting the second coming. I was expecting a new Star Wars movie. That's exactly what I got. And in spite of Jar Jar, I love it just as much as I do the first three movies. There's no doubt that I would probably be more into it if I were twelve. But it's nice to forget that I'm not for two hours.

We have to consider perhaps that is how his character was written.....Does ANYONE click on the more button for Trivia? If you had, you'd have read that Costner wasn't the only actor considered for the lead. You also would have read that he was interested in the story BEFORE it was written into the novel, and encouraged Michael Blake to do that first, then the script. I feel it was a big plus that Costner was involved from the very beginning. Paid-off well in his directing.In the goof department, I found a huge one which no one else mentioned. When they have captured Dunbar and have him all banged-up in the tent, some soldiers are standing in the doorway looking at him. One was of Asian descent, which plays well for not showing discrimination today, but there would NEVER have been an Asian in anyone's army in this country in those days - they were forcefully segregated. Maybe a reminder that Native-Americans walked over land-bridges from China? Did anyone else notice that Dunbar started to become Indian when his moustache disappeared? No scenes to show Indians shaving.....Dancer with Wolves is a fabulous movie to get lost in, no matter how long it is. Gotta get the DVD ! Costner surely got it all together for the cinematography, the casting was very good, costuming authentic. I don't find anything to dislike and a lot to really like in the film. I, too, think Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) should have won an Oscar for his brilliant performance, as should have Rodney A. Grant (Wind in his Hair). I saw him shopping in Ralph's and he looked exactly as he did in the movie - very friendly, what a hunk. Mary McDonnell was perfectly cast, and did a great acting-job. Red Crow was the ultimate chief, as Nathan Lee as Smiles a Lot was stellar.
