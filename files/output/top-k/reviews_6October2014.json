A lot of filming was made at Bunker Hill Community College, but also at one or two pubs, a park(not the one where you park your car) and a local diner. It takes place at approximately the course of six months, judging how the movie proceeded. Will, a janitor at M.I.T, is a man of personality. Although he is a man of secrets, one in particular crosses your mind. He loves to read. This is rather weird because of the fact that his crew, or friends, are rather dull-witted to be honest. Because his love of reading, he has developed a habit of being well-read on all subjects. One day, Prof.Gerald Lambeau posts a math quiz on the public board in the hallways. After some time when nobody still hasn't solved it, Will decides to try, and scores right away. Prof.Gerald later discovers this, and goes of on a search for the one who solved it, thus Will wants to remain anonymous. When the Professor later finds out that Will is the one who solved it, he tries to negotiate with the Judge to keep Will out of jail, Will having recently gotten in a fight. In the deal however, Will must once a week meet a psychologist for his anger management. And of course as in any movie, Will also meets a girl, Skylar, that will turn out to be a turn for Will's life...A scene I remember in particular is when the first or maybe the second meeting when Will brings up Sean the psychologists deceased wife, whom Will does not know about, and presume that she is no more in his life because of she left him or was cheating. This outrages Sean because his wife and himself had a really close bond and they truly loved each other. Just as Will was to finish his sentence, Sean grabs Will's neck and says; If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end you. After this they split apart, but I believe that this awoke something in Will, some sort of empathy for Sean, because Will is a foster child who had a crooked childhood and maybe feels like he's missing something too...I would say that this movie is about following your dreams, not being afraid at trying something new, taking the big step and be brave enough to fulfill it. The theme is mainly drama, but maybe a little bit of a romantic theme as well.I actually liked this movie, I can't really though put my finger on it. It's a very deep movie with a lot of emotions. If i would rate it, I would give it a 9\/10 because i believe that all movies need a bit of comedy, which this one lacked.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 October 2014","score":"","review":" When people talk about Leonardo DiCaprio and his films, they seem to overlook this film, What's Eating Gilbert Grape. While the film takes it time and can be overly melodramatic, this is an excellent drama that will make you cry, make you happy, and will as hell sure make an imprint in your memory. It's about the small-town friendship and most of all, it's about family bonding. This film has a beautiful script and many of these quotes are actually quite memorable.Lasse Hallstrom's film is about a twenty-year-old named Gilbert Grape who is nearly fed up with his small-town life. He has a mother who weighs nearly five hundred pounds and is the joke of the town. He has two sisters and a special-needs brother that he constantly cares for. He works for a small grocery and he satisfies the need of a lonely mother while her husband is away at work. But when a camper girl named Becky comes to town, a romance is blossomed and now Gilbert is at the ultimate life stage.The acting is absolutely tremendous. Johnny Depp, in one of his few straight-forward roles, does a fantastic job as the depressed man who cares for his family. I think the real standout is Leonardo DiCaprio. Without this role, I don't believe we would have gotten the future films of his that we all come to love. That being said, this as well may be Leo's best performance and he has given many. There are also great performances from Darlene Cates, Mary Steenburgen, and Juliette Lewis.Overall, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a film that stands out in the very crowded year of 1993. Of such films like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Philadelphia, and Carlito's Way, this film may be my favorite. It will provide you with a range of emotions whether it's laughter or sadness and this film excels in provoking emotion. It's a little predictable, but then again almost every drama is. Thanks to a magnificent script and fantastic acting all across the board, this is one of the best dramas ever made. I rate this film 10\/10.

This film was made at a time when sequels didn't have any rules, to us it usual means a continuation a next chapter in the same story. But this film they decided not to do that at all, they figured after the events of Halloween 2 that the franchise was going to be an anthology series where each year their would be a new film based off of the Halloween season and these films could also be franchises on their own. Personally I think that's an awesome idea, which is why it's a shame it never took off, I honestly felt a great opportunity was lost, think about how many more film non related to Michael Myers we could of had; what a shame.Only problem I have is a certain twist near the end which just came completely out of left field and didn't serve any purpose or make sense to the entire film. Other than that everything else is fine.Anyway this film I think is great, the production value I think is great, this film was done on a modest to low budget and I think it was money well spent and once again proves how limited budget films can produce the best results.I like the use of the enviorment it is just constantly creepy, in a way it's kinda like with the video game series Silent Hill since that game always take place in a dark small decrepit town. From how run down the town slightly looks, the constant surveillance cameras that are everywhere in the town, to how small and far the place is. It really gives that atmospheric feeling of isolation. Even like the use of the night as well as the color of the sky which at times is red it really helps the atmospheric feeling due to the amount of darkness but just simply created a dark foreboding atmosphere as if there is an evil force about to overwhelm us.The effects are on par, from one really great kill which is seeing someone getting their head ripped off literally and spurting a fountain of blood. Though for me the real highlight was seeing those creepy men in black androids which spurt out mustard blood. They sort of remind me of the cyborgs or even clockwork robots from the TV show Doctor Who since these things run, not on cyber technology but on clockwork which is I think a different idea on the concept of robots but also makes sense since robots operate based on a complex assortment of parts together and running.The protagonist Daniel Challis solid, I like actor Tom Atkins whom I think is slightly underrated and I think is performance is solid. Not much to say for him, he has a dry charisma, smart, but I like just how doggedly determined he is at finding the truth and putting a stop to the evil plot as well as how well he can handle himself against danger.The antagonist Cochran is great, played well by the late great Dan O Herlihy, he's one of my favorite fictional villains. On the outside he seem like a really nice guy. But of course this is just an act as he is really an evil Druid warlock and the whole corporation he has crated is a front for a Druid witch cult. He can really give you chills because he still has charisma when evil but it's just the amount of coldness and sinisterness that is attached to it. One scene with him that stands out is when he gives a monologue on one of the stories about Halloween which always gives me chills because that's actually a real story.The best things for me about the film are the music which I think is great, most of it is mainly synthesizer music but I think this film makes great use for it and fits perfectly. I like the theme song which is solid but to me it's the end theme song that stands out and is probably one of my favorite themes because it has a mood feel like a sense of urgency and doom.The suspense is great it goes at a good pace, just like Daniel you really feel a sense of isolation and doom, that danger could be at any turn and could attack at any moment. You're intrigued at seeing the protagonist finding out what the heck is going on. Though you are already at least one step ahead of him where we already have some knowledge of the enemies activities; which makes it more suspenseful because were hoping Daniel can somehow put it all together and find a way to thwart the bad guy's plans before it's too late.I really like the story which I think is really creative and a very interesting idea, on turning all the commercialization of the holiday the typical masks and TV against us which is always a common thing in the suspense thriller genre on taking away everything were comfortable with and latching danger onto it. Even like the fact that these evil Druid Witches are using the power of technology to aid their evil magic, which I feel displays the dynamic of both alchemy and science becoming indivisible. It almost feels like something that could be plausible since we always invest a certain amount of trust in companies whenever we purchase certain products and lets face we all watch a certain amount of TV everyday; who says any of the corporate entities don't have a sinister agenda which to me makes the film all the more scary.Overall, I think this is a great sequel that like any Halloween mask is worth trying on and Happy Halloween.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"6 October 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is another under the radar gem that's both underrated and misunderstood.

You're intrigued at seeing the protagonist finding out what the heck is going on. Though you are already at least one step ahead of him where we already have some knowledge of the enemies activities; which makes it more suspenseful because were hoping Daniel can somehow put it all together and find a way to thwart the bad guy's plans before it's too late.I really like the story which I think is really creative and a very interesting idea, on turning all the commercialization of the holiday the typical masks and TV against us which is always a common thing in the suspense thriller genre on taking away everything were comfortable with and latching danger onto it. Even like the fact that these evil Druid Witches are using the power of technology to aid their evil magic, which I feel displays the dynamic of both alchemy and science becoming indivisible. It almost feels like something that could be plausible since we always invest a certain amount of trust in companies whenever we purchase certain products and lets face we all watch a certain amount of TV everyday; who says any of the corporate entities don't have a sinister agenda which to me makes the film all the more scary.Overall, I think this is a great sequel that like any Halloween mask is worth trying on and Happy Halloween.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 October 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is another under the radar gem that's both underrated and misunderstood. This film was made at a time when sequels didn't have any rules, to us it usual means a continuation a next chapter in the same story. But this film they decided not to do that at all, they figured after the events of Halloween 2 that the franchise was going to be an anthology series where each year their would be a new film based off of the Halloween season and these films could also be franchises on their own. Personally I think that's an awesome idea, which is why it's a shame it never took off, I honestly felt a great opportunity was lost, think about how many more film non related to Michael Myers we could of had; what a shame.Only problem I have is a certain twist near the end which just came completely out of left field and didn't serve any purpose or make sense to the entire film. Other than that everything else is fine.Anyway this film I think is great, the production value I think is great, this film was done on a modest to low budget and I think it was money well spent and once again proves how limited budget films can produce the best results.I like the use of the enviorment it is just constantly creepy, in a way it's kinda like with the video game series Silent Hill since that game always take place in a dark small decrepit town. From how run down the town slightly looks, the constant surveillance cameras that are everywhere in the town, to how small and far the place is. It really gives that atmospheric feeling of isolation. Even like the use of the night as well as the color of the sky which at times is red it really helps the atmospheric feeling due to the amount of darkness but just simply created a dark foreboding atmosphere as if there is an evil force about to overwhelm us.The effects are on par, from one really great kill which is seeing someone getting their head ripped off literally and spurting a fountain of blood. Though for me the real highlight was seeing those creepy men in black androids which spurt out mustard blood. They sort of remind me of the cyborgs or even clockwork robots from the TV show Doctor Who since these things run, not on cyber technology but on clockwork which is I think a different idea on the concept of robots but also makes sense since robots operate based on a complex assortment of parts together and running.The protagonist Daniel Challis solid, I like actor Tom Atkins whom I think is slightly underrated and I think is performance is solid. Not much to say for him, he has a dry charisma, smart, but I like just how doggedly determined he is at finding the truth and putting a stop to the evil plot as well as how well he can handle himself against danger.The antagonist Cochran is great, played well by the late great Dan O Herlihy, he's one of my favorite fictional villains. On the outside he seem like a really nice guy. But of course this is just an act as he is really an evil Druid warlock and the whole corporation he has crated is a front for a Druid witch cult. He can really give you chills because he still has charisma when evil but it's just the amount of coldness and sinisterness that is attached to it. One scene with him that stands out is when he gives a monologue on one of the stories about Halloween which always gives me chills because that's actually a real story.The best things for me about the film are the music which I think is great, most of it is mainly synthesizer music but I think this film makes great use for it and fits perfectly.

In Devil, Roedel's a soft-spoken, timid kid who seems to want no part in the erupting Civil War. Indeed, it is only in response to the violence committed by Unionists, and the peer-pressure exerted by fellow Southerners, that Roedel takes up a sixshooter and starts killing Bluecoats. Like the hero of Lee's Hulk, Roedel essentially morphs from a man to a beast, a six-shooter equipped Bushwacker who kills without batting an eyelid. What's odd about Devil, though, is the subtly at which these changes occur. As the film progresses, Roedel shifts from a genteel kid to a killer and then back to a genteel family man. Similarly, a character called Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright) shifts from an outright slave to a man bound to an unspoken life-bond and finally to a free African American. Throughout the first half of Devil, Holt is virtually invisible. And when he is addressed, it is often indirectly or in the form of a racial slur. Gradually, however, Lee brings Holt to the forefront of his picture. Holt questions why he is fighting for segregationists, racists and observes first hand the hypocrisies of the Confederate cause. The film then ends with Holt and Roedel addressing one another by their full personal names. In affirming their identities, both are asserting a freedom or sense of self not bound by place, time or ideology. But Lee knows this is but a feeble affirmation; his film ultimately asserts that identity is always subservient to history. One seldom owns who he is.Devil is bookended by a pair of weddings. During the first, Roedel likens marriage to slavery, and chastises any man who'd wed a woman. Through a bizarre sequence of events, however, Roedel finds himself forced to marry the pregnant lover of a close friend. Ironically, it is this enslaving wedding which emancipates Roedel from the war. As husband and father he's thrust into a new role, a role which carries with it a clear set of pre-packaged actions; flee the conflict and protect his new family. In countless similar scenes, the sheer arbitrariness of history, identity and so belief and behaviour, is highlighted. Take sequences, for example, in which Roedel's rejection of the beliefs of his German American father have little to do with Roedel's understanding of Unionist causes, and more to do with an unspoken loyalty to his neighbours. These neighbours' hatred of Roedel &#x96; he's seen to be a traitorous immigrant - is likewise capricious; Roedel fights for the South, IS a Southerner, but they nevertheless hate him because of the identity of Roedel's German father. Unsurprisingly for a film preoccupied with how roles and rituals are unconsciously play-acted, Ride with the Devil systematically undercuts and subverts the expectations typically brought to films set in the American Civil War. Such films typically revel in the splendour of antebellum Southern life, unironically celebrating and sentimentalising the luxury and civility made possible by the horrors of chattel slavery. But Lee, though he also ignores any overt depictions of slavery, never romanticises either the North or South. Both sides are brutal, horrible, but both are also humanised and shown to be swept up in movements they don't quite understand. In several scenes, for example, we watch as Confederate militiamen go to lengths to exhibit proper etiquette (directed at both blacks and women), and yet in others we witness bloody raids, like one sequence in which Confederates massacre 180 civilians in Lawrence, Kansas. Such juxtapositions make it spookily clear how easy it is for social animals to ride with devils. Everyone's swept up in something, and humans are rarely strong enough or smart enough to break chains of complicity.For all its attempts at revisionism, though, Ride with the Devil is still quite tame. Lee's Civil War ultimately boils down to good Unionists and evil, racist, Confederates. That both sides were acting with profit, greed and the interests of land owners &#x96; which happened to coincide with the abolition of slavery - is ignored. For all his revisionism, Lee ultimately offers an idealistic portrait of the times. The great film about the American Civil War is still yet to be made.8\/10 &#x96; Excellent, and one of the better westerns (though set in eastern Mississippi) of the 1990s. See Shenandoah, Pontecorvo's Burn, Hombre and The Beguiled. Worth two viewings.

Bud Fox played by Charlie Sheen, is a Wall Street stockbroker in early 1980's New York with a strong desire to get to the top. Working for his firm during the day, he spends his spare time working an on angle with the high-powered, extremely successful (but ruthless and greedy) broker Gordon Gekko played by Michael Douglas. Fox finally meets with Gekko, who takes the youth under his wing and explains his philosophy that Greed is Good. Taking the advice and working closely with Gekko, Fox soon finds himself swept into a world of yuppies, shady business deals, the good life, fast money, and fast women; something which is at odds with his family including his estranged father and the blue-collared way Fox was brought up. Roger Ebert said all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most of the time we know what's going on.

Bud Fox played by Charlie Sheen, is a Wall Street stockbroker in early 1980's New York with a strong desire to get to the top. Working for his firm during the day, he spends his spare time working an on angle with the high-powered, extremely successful (but ruthless and greedy) broker Gordon Gekko played by Michael Douglas. Fox finally meets with Gekko, who takes the youth under his wing and explains his philosophy that Greed is Good. Taking the advice and working closely with Gekko, Fox soon finds himself swept into a world of yuppies, shady business deals, the good life, fast money, and fast women; something which is at odds with his family including his estranged father and the blue-collared way Fox was brought up. Roger Ebert said all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense.

I can't say I feel that differently about its defects, but I don't hate St. Elmo's Fire anymore. It kind of captures the charm of the period even if it grasps annoyingly at times for laughs and pathos. Seven young people just graduated from Georgetown University find themselves up against various life challenges revolving around love. Political aide Alec (Judd Nelson) wants to marry his live-in girlfriend Leslie (Ally Sheedy), but she's not sure. Journalist Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) hides his secret love, while waiter Kirby (Emilio Estevez) and social worker Wendy (Mare Winningham) are pathetically unable to conceal theirs. Billy (Rob Lowe) is married with a baby but can't stay faithful, while Jules (Demi Moore) dances as fast as she can with her office affairs and cocaine habit.It's our time on the edge, is how Billy puts it, but that edge seldom merits our interest. Unfortunately, director-writer Joel Schumacher's indulgent handling of his characters' various angsts creates a gulf for viewers like me. He likes them too much, I think, for them to be successful comic-tragic figures.Too many groaner lines in the script, too, the kind that seem crafted for trailer use rather than real human dialogue Wasted love! God, I just wish I could get it back! I'm obsessed, thank you very much! Let's rock! You break my heart. Then again, you break everyone's heart! Catch-phrase overuse really gets out of hand.I won't say St. Elmo's Fire is so bad it's good, but it's certainly distinctive in a way that I think has improved it over the years. Much of it is in the way of camp value. But it also captures a period in time, and a group of young actors, at a point when pop culture was coming together around them. They became known as the Brat Pack, which made them seem even more insufferably popular than they already were. The Brat Pack moniker was something they didn't accept, and Schumacher whines about it on his DVD commentary, but it made them what they were and in this film anyway, they seem to live up to that image, with their toilet dunking and ritual chants.Another thing Schumacher mentions on his commentary is the dinging he got for the film's elitist tone. He makes the point that the critics mistook content for intent, but it's hard to miss the snooty ways the main characters look down on the poor unfortunates around them who aren't as cool as they are, whether it be a sad naked guy wandering a hospital corridor, a gay designer, or Wendy's schlubby suitor.Welfare recipients are getting better looking, says Billy, which would be wrong in anyone's mouth but particularly so from the sculpted lips of Rob Lowe. It's the kind of line that screams for a comeuppance that never really comes.What works for the film is mainly visual. The wet streets, pastel shirts, neon ties, and Billy Idol wall mural all scream 1980s, but in a better way than they did then. The David Foster score still holds up, as do the two hit songs from the soundtrack. And the actors do work well together, playing against each other naturally and with considerable charm, even if Nelson does fume and McCarthy rub his eyes too much.It's a time capsule film, one that deserves to be in its time capsule most of the time. But it has moments of real entertainment, perhaps nostalgia, perhaps something deeper, a sense of life's passage experienced in a kind of contented bubble you know is about to pop.

He then sets out to prove in a hard way that he was being set-up and to do that, he holds some hostages at a building until his demands are met. Danny Roman then demands certain conditions to be met and one of them is for summoning an indifferent Police Negotiator called Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey) who works for a different police force. This is because there are some fellow Police members within Danny's (Samuel) force that apparently set him up and he cannot trust his own team to openly handle this major situation Danny (Samuel) has put himself in and demanding decisive answers from them too. Danny (Samuel) believes that without Chris (Kevin) taking charge then some members within his own team that apparently framed him will try to kill him because of the conspiracy Danny (Samuel) is trying to solve with hostages in his presence.

Storytelling is about human characters, and monster movies are usually situational conflict stories, with human characters being pitted against monsters. Yes, take note human characters, not actors who scream at everything. Godzilla focuses on people reacting to a monster. In the 1950's, the Japanese were still hurting from the effects of the atomic bomb, and filmmaker Ishirō Honda decided to make a monster picture in which the atomic bomb is realized in the form of a monster. Godzilla spends most of its time showcasing the actions and emotions of human characters in response to Godzilla, a prehistoric 165-foot-tall lizard-like monster who has been awakened by nuclear tests in the Pacific and devastates Japan. We focus on a small group of people in particular; people who are desperate to find a way to stop Godzilla. They have much scientific knowledge and many resources, but these fail against the monster. Yet they keep fighting. Godzilla hurts so many people, and the sight drives them to keep working. Like in many great monster movies, the monster is mostly hidden. We see the effects caused by his presence frequently as tension builds, but we usually do not see him on screen. Tension is greater in movies if we don't see a physical threat for a while. And when we finally do see Godzilla, all we see is his head poking above a hill. But that's enough. His massive size compared to the people below him is truly daunting. And then he unleashes that roar- that beautiful, unearthly, powerful, banshee-like, infernal roar. Later we do actually see him, after his presence and the tension are stoked up even more. Godzilla is massive. When we see him, all 50 of his meters loom over Japan. When a massive electric fence is built around Japan, he simply tears it down with his arms and atomic breath. When tanks fire on him, they cause no damage. He then rampages through Tokyo, burning everything in sight, releasing horrors onto its people. The image of Godzilla standing above a burning Tokyo is one of the most memorable images in all of cinema- blackness, fire, and a looming monster tower in front of us. His indestructibility makes him a perfect metaphor for the atomic bomb. To portray Godzilla, a man in costume is used, making him more mobile and thus more dangerous. The visual effects used for the burning of Tokyo are surprisingly convincing for their times. Practical effects are used, rather than the CGI that would be used today, one of the wonderful things about the great monster movies of the 20th Century. The practical effects are not the heart of the story; they make it more effective. And as people watch and act, Godzilla rages on.

Then after graduation when he didn't get the attention that he was expected to his scientific talent, he made out that important role. After getting married and his psychological problem was discovered I think the psychiatry treatment had a negative and a positive effect on him. The positive part of it is that now he knew that he has a problem, because if his wife told him that he had a problem he may not be able to believe her. But the negative part is that psychiatry treatment makes the patient feel that he is psycho no one would like to be attacked all the time. The atmosphere in the hospital was not helping him to be fine he got an aggressive medical treatment. I think that the psychological treatment is a very good way in dealing with those kinds of cases, because it helps the patients to be able to take decisions, to be engaged with others and to find the solution to the problem that they have.I think that what helped him most is the psychological treatment, because he felt that his wife love him and she encouraged him, so he tried his best to be better. Also the role of his friends was very important, because he started to fill the friends social part and the part of practicing science again. Finally his wife is the key for his success, because she made the other half of his heart that was missing back to him.

Neither for a good and well-paid job, nor for the girl he loved.He didn't believe in this traditional values, like making a career or starting a family. He knew too well that people betray and can turn their back on you when you least expect. He had his life and wasn't gonna change anything.But then he was noticed by Prof. Lambeau who for some reason decided to help this very smart but rebellious boy.

All his knowledge was too theoretical, borrowed from books, not from his life experience. He was afraid to open his heart to new people or new things. Eventually he found some peace as well as also Dr. Maguire who had been hiding from real life since the death of his wife.I liked Skylar, how open she was when she was talking about her feelings to Will, how honest and understanding she sounded.

I was in my junior year of college when this movie premiered. I was struggling academically, and yet I cut a day of classes to wait in a blocks long line to see this film. The rumor of a Star Trek motion picture had been circulating for years before this film was made. Lenard Nimoy had written the Awful I am not Spock, and had held up the filming with his refusal to put on those ears again. Now FINALLY, I would be able to see Star Trek as I had dreamed it COULD be, with a thoughtful script (or so I hoped) and a massive special effects budget. So how did it stack up? Like most fans, my reviews were mixed. First of all, it should be understood that Gene Roddenberry clearly made this movie FOR THE FANS! Those who had not watched (and re watched) the show faithfully were simply never part of this film's intended audience. On the other hand, those who had lived and breathed Star Trek during its years long syndication run, were mostly not disappointed. For example, the very long fly by sequence of the Enterprise in space dock was clearly designed to say LOOK at what we've done to the ship! Isn't it the Enterprise you've been longing for?! The wistful look on Kirks face as Scotty gave him the grand tour was reflected in every fan's face. Boring you say? How can you even think that? Every fan had been dreaming of seeing the Enterprise in space dock for YEARS! The catharsis of that experience cannot be overstated.Which brings me to my first quibble with the movie. During much of the fly by sequence, the Enterprise looks too small. It's as if someone in the model dept. got the scale of the ship slightly wrong or mispositioned the camera. It's just not quite believable as an aircraft carrier sized space ship. Now that is not to say that the sequence is a total flop. When we see the first full frontal view of the ship that first time (with a perfectly scored musical accompaniment) I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up while simultaneously feeling a lump in my throat. And the last stretch of the flyby finally corrects the size perspective. On to the plot and characters. To say that Bill Shatner over-acts most of his lines cannot be overstated. And who choreographed that scene where he extends his (sweaty) palm to Doc McCoy. When he says dammit Bones, I need you. Badly! I half expected them to kiss. Can you say AWKWARD!? I've seen young teens on a first date that looked more at ease. Indeed, only Scotty and McCoy seem totally at home in their old rolls (although Scotty acquired quite a roll and looked like he had eaten far too many Kosmik Kreme donuts). Thankfully, Lt. Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov looked like they hadn't aged a day. Unfortunately, the lovely yeoman Rand looked like she had spent the last few years tanning on Vulcan without sunscreen. I've seen old catcher's mitts that had better skin. Speaking of looking better, who came up with the idea of a bald headed sex worker to be the main love interest? She claimed her oath of celibacy was on record but I can't imagine she'd have to worry about breaking that oath. And while we're on the topic of sex appeal, I must say that the clothing worn by the women (except the follicularly challenged one) was about as un-sexy as possible. I realize that a lot of the extras were long time Star Trek fans, and girl nerds are rarely shapely, but that's no reason to dress so many in baggy jumpsuits.As we look at the overall story, I must say that the plot was pretty un imaginative. A voyager space probe gets a huge boost from an alien machine race that can't be bothered wiping the soot off of the probe's hull and so is named V'ger. Uhm, that plot reveal element is on the level of a high school creative writing class (as is most of the story). So why did I give this movie 8 stars? Because against some mighty unfavorable odds, the Star Trek franchise made it to the big screen more-or-less intact. Yes, the writing was bad, the new characters stupid, and some of the special effects slightly tattered. However, as a reunion of the familiar old faces, it was rather satisfying. As I said earlier, this movie was a gift to the fans who had been dreaming of a Star Trek motion picture for nearly a decade. It would go on to spawn several new TV series based on the show as well as other motion pictures. I would have preferred a better script, but who knows. If the movie had been delayed further, it's possible it would have never been made at all. And THAT would have been a tragedy.

There isn't any depth and the characters never move beyond their occupations. 'Stargate' is a very timid movie. Director Roland Emmerich and writer Dean Devlin mount the film as if the audience is going to walk out if they don't get their special effects often enough. There isn't a moment of wonder or imagination or fun, this movie is a rattling can of special effects, gunshots and oh yeah lotsa blow'd ups.

This movie was made in 1977?! That's a little hard for me to believe. The effects here seemed at least as good as the original (and not digitally remastered) Star Wars, which came out the same year. Like Star Wars, it could only have used models and forced perspective. Am I crazy if I think one or two of the effects here might have even been better? There are several scenes where the smaller (scout?) spacecraft appear to revolve 360 degrees in midair, with remarkable depth and the appearance of a three-dimensional object. Isn't this at least as good as many sequences In Star Wars, with its more static shots of ships seen from only one angle? (In retrospect, I don't know if the version I saw of Close Encounters was itself remastered or improved.)Second &#x85; was my favorite TV show of all time a rip-off of a 1970's Steven Spielberg movie?! I couldn't believe how directly the 1990's' The X-Files seemed inspired by this &#x96; right down to an international government cover-up. The X-Files, of course, was a horror-thriller series, while this is a family film &#x96; which did rob it of a lot of tension. How much suspense can we really feel if we know that this material is suitable for all ages? Indeed, the worst thing to happen to any of the major characters we follow is that he falls asleep from knockout gas.To make things even more fun, I swear I saw a cameo by (an extremely young) Lance Henriksen, who had a guest appearance on The X-Files. (He's one of the scientists at the end.)There was more about this movie to like a hell of a lot too. Richard Dreyfuss is a damn good actor. So, too, is Terri Garr &#x96; despite dialogue that makes her sound like a hysterical shrew. (Cary Guffey was also a great child actor.)The script is smart, with characters sounding like we'd expect them to sound. Scientists are human beings who get excited over amazing discoveries, instead of being amoral automatons and devices for exposition. The kids here sound and behave like KIDS, a lot like the characters behaved in the later E.T. The Extraterrestrial. And the film did a great job of juxtaposing Dreyfuss' everyman plight with larger global events witnessed by a range of other characters.Plus, Close Encounters was just plain fun. I'm not big into family movies, but even I've got to admit, Spielberg really does project a sense of wonder here. This seems like a great film with which to get a pre-teen interested in science fiction.I had a few quibbles, but they were all forgivable.1) Several characters suffer unexplained sunburns after being near spacecraft, and then joke about it. This was 30 years after Hiroshima. Why on earth are they not terrified? If my skin burned after my proximity to strange object, I'd panic.2) One character demonstrates an incredible lack of vigilance with respect to her son.3) If a government conspiracy is so vast and resourceful, wouldn't it make at least some effort to identify and monitor those who have had close encounters?4) If you think about it, the aliens actually do a Very Bad Thing. Aren't lives destroyed by their abductions? It's 30 years later for the returning humans, who never consented to be absent. Yet we see little concern about this &#x96; or even a single sidearm in evidence in the movie's final scene. Wouldn't this be an especially horrible oversight considering the nature of the scientists? They're presumably earth's best and brightest &#x96; perhaps even the best qualified to inform us about defending against an alien invasion. Wouldn't it kinda suck if they were all abducted?5) A newspaper headline misspells kidnapping. (Sorry &#x97; I'm a former news reporter, and I can't get past it.)6) Am I crazy, or does Dreyfuss' character share a romantic kiss with a woman who is not his wife? This seems slightly out of place in a Spielberg movie.7) Dreyfuss' choice at the end reflects nary an afterthought about his wife and children.Still, this is a great movie &#x96; I'd give it an 8 out of 10.http\/\/ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"6 October 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie held two big surprises for me, along with a lot of other things to admire.First were the special effects.
