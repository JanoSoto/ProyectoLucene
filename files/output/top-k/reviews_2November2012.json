All the characters are brilliant, crappy, but brilliant. Nearly every scene is a classic. Peter Jacksons tour de force. Not for the squeamish, but I recommend to anyone who is fan of horror to watch this movie. Especially now. When it came out in the early 90s it was quite full on, considering what special effects were like back then. But this movie has grown into itself, is better now because of its use of at the time fairly good sfx, but now the sfx are hilarious and really make you appreciate the comedic value of the film. The movie has everything,zombies, zombie love, zombie babies, necrophilia humour, kungfufighting priest that kicks arse for the lord, grave robbing, new zealanders, 50s hoodlums, pissing on graves, self aware intestines, the most brutal funny deaths you'll see and a party from hell. From start to finish this movie is an absolute cult classic and deserves such status. Must watch, you'll be smiling the whole way through.

Hocus Pocus, a film which has gone on to be something of a cult classic, gaining replay countless times around Halloween and constantly coming up in the conversation around this time of year, to me, was a very strange, uncomfortable movie experience, mainly because of all the hocus and the pocus, none of it memorable or quite fun.This is a film of many strong stars, various special effects, and stylistic trademarks, however, they are put in a black cauldron and are not stirred properly, if at all. There's smoke boiling all over the top of the cauldron, but what goes on inside of it is nothing shy of uneventful. If anything, the film should be memorialized as a Disney film that tried to at least do something different, creating a darker, more tween-oriented story than their previous films. We open in Salem, Massachusetts, around 1693, where we meet the three Sanderson witches, Winifred (Bette Midler), Mary (Kathy Najimy), and Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), who we learn prey on young children. Their goal is to suck the lives purely out of them to be able to practice witchcraft, but their plan is failed when they are killed by an angry mob of townfolk. Before dying, however, the witches enact a spell which will bring them back to life if a virgin were to light a specific candle on All Hallows' Eve.Fast-forward three hundred years later, on October 31, 1993, and we have our subjects; Max Dennison (Omri Katz), a Los Angeles native who is upset with having to move to Salem, where he lacks any friends and has become the social pariah of the school. Reluctantly agreeing to take his annoying little sister, Dani (Thora Birch) trick-or-treating, he stumbles upon the house of his crush named Allison, played by Vinessa Shaw. Out of pure curiosity, and because they are filled with the inconsequential Halloween feeling, they venture out to an abandoned museum, where Max will light the candle naively and resurrect the Sanderson sisters, effectively establishing that the rumor all these years was true and that witches do in fact haunt the town of Salem.The remainder of the film is chaotic to say the least; a cockamamie blend of a third-rate farce, a distorted premise, drastically unpleasant characters, lame jokes, and a ton of special effects which, more often than not, consume the screen in a murky fashion. While punctuated with scenes providing some entertainment, there are a whole lot of dry spots that plague Hocus Pocus, many of them being with the humans rather than the witches.Yet the Sanderson sisters, the characters which the movie is built around, are not given much interesting to do. They are stereotypical witch archetypes, played by character actors clearly sagacious and intelligent enough to choose better roles. Bette Midler, while being the most entertaining, is still buried under a plethora of makeup which can't disguise her character's lack of soul and wit, and Najimy and Parker's characters might as well be low-rent versions of Larry and Curly of The Three Stooges.There's an audience for a film like this, which has already been established by the mention and existence of a cult. If only I were able to belong to that noble group. Hocus Pocus pleased me with its ambition and versatility, yet bored me with its listless agenda. It favors chaos over pacing, special effects over characters, and shells over identifiable people. And considering that there are many more films aimed at this same market of tween obscurity, that pack stronger morals and more substance, and there are some too that just have the let's have fun message, to pick up and rent Hocus Pocus for the twelfth time on Halloween is like being a witch who continuously haunts the same town every year.

I saw the original and this movie in theaters as a Halloween special by Turner movie classic channel. It was awesome, seeing them both on the big screen. Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are the best of the legendary movie series. I think what makes those two movies such classics is that they were the first real movies based on Mary Shelly's novel and were more closer to the Shelly's book then the sequels. I always felt that the original and this sequel were kind of part of one story, the real sequel was the third film Son of Frankenstein. This is a direct continuation of the last film with the same director James Whale and Boris Karloff returning as the iconic monster. In fact this film is based on a subplot in Mary Shelly's original novel, where Dr. Frankenstein considers creating a mate for his creature. James Whale did a great job directing this film, the pacing is good and the look of the film is great. Unlike the original film this one has a musical sound track that works great in the film. The reason why most people say this is the best of the Frankenstein films is because this has a lot of meat too it, there's more stuff going on here then in the more straight forward, simplistic original. These classic monster movies from Universal in the 30's and 40's are not really scary but still has a creepy quality too it that work wells. The idea of putting dead bodies together and bringing it to life is kind of creepy and makes you question someone's sanity who attempts that. Like in the original film this film begins with a cold opening of sorts, which is one of the best parts of the film. Elsa Lancaster, who plays the bride plays Frankenstein author Mary Shelly who's in a mansion with George Gordon lord Baron, England's greatest signer and Percy Byshe Shelly, England's greatest poet and she begins to tell them the story of the movie. I love how Lord Baron roles his Rs when he talks, it's so appealing. It's a great intro to the movie and I like the idea of having Lancaster play Mary Shelley, there's something cool about seeing her as the woman who wrote the story, Mary Shelley and then later see her as the monster's bride. The film begins where the last one left off but some people didn't come back, Fred Kerr as Dr.Frankenstein's father does not appear here, neither the actor or character return after being a major character in the last one and no explanation of his where about. Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clark as Dr.Frankenstein's wife and she does a good job. I love Colin Clive as Dr.Henry Frankenstein, he's the best and is sometimes underrated in his pitch perfect portrayal of a conflicted scientist who's not bad but is tempted by desire to play god. I love Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, he's a great edition to the story, a scientist crazier then Dr. Frankenstein. He has a good mixture of crazy, humor and a little flamboyant which caused a lot of people to question if he's gay, maybe he is. He has a creepy looking face too. There's a lot of humor here too, like Minnie as Dr. Frankenstein's loud mouth maid, she was not in the original but inexplicably appears here. Although there's a scene that I thought was too surreal, when Dr. Pretorius shows Dr. Frankenstein his 2 inch people that he grew, I thought that felt out of place. I love Boris Karloff as the monster, I thought it was great hearing him talk, unlike in the first film where he was silent. Although I thought it was a bit of a stretch that he went from not being able to talk to within two days mastering the English language. But I like his friendship with a blind hermit, that was well done, showing that he's not a total monster he just needs a friend. The best part of the movie however is towards the end where we get to see the much anticipated bride. The whole scene is awesome! Dr. Frankenstein says his iconic She's alive and I love the way he says it. Elsa Lancaster is terrific in her role, she's only on the screen for five minutes or so but she makes every minute count. It's great silent acting by her, she has the perfect look of a confused, horrified woman who just awoke from the dead. The church bells were great when she was introduced. I love her movements, she just really sells the idea that she just came back from the dead. I love her look as well, she looks kind of sexy in a creepy kind of way and of course her trademark electrified hair was a great idea. I love when she hisses at the monster in her last scene, the way she does it is really creepy. I feel sorry for her because like the monster in the first film, she wasn't given a chance to adjust to life after being brought back from the dead, this is definitely a tragic love story. I wish the bride would've been brought back for a sequel, I would of liked to see how she'd act in the outside world, would she kill people like the monster did? This is one of my favorite films from Universal classic Monster movies. An all-time classic.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"2 November 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the best monster movie of all-time. I saw the original and this movie in theaters as a Halloween special by Turner movie classic channel. It was awesome, seeing them both on the big screen. Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are the best of the legendary movie series. I think what makes those two movies such classics is that they were the first real movies based on Mary Shelly's novel and were more closer to the Shelly's book then the sequels. I always felt that the original and this sequel were kind of part of one story, the real sequel was the third film Son of Frankenstein. This is a direct continuation of the last film with the same director James Whale and Boris Karloff returning as the iconic monster. In fact this film is based on a subplot in Mary Shelly's original novel, where Dr. Frankenstein considers creating a mate for his creature. James Whale did a great job directing this film, the pacing is good and the look of the film is great. Unlike the original film this one has a musical sound track that works great in the film. The reason why most people say this is the best of the Frankenstein films is because this has a lot of meat too it, there's more stuff going on here then in the more straight forward, simplistic original. These classic monster movies from Universal in the 30's and 40's are not really scary but still has a creepy quality too it that work wells. The idea of putting dead bodies together and bringing it to life is kind of creepy and makes you question someone's sanity who attempts that. Like in the original film this film begins with a cold opening of sorts, which is one of the best parts of the film. Elsa Lancaster, who plays the bride plays Frankenstein author Mary Shelly who's in a mansion with George Gordon lord Baron, England's greatest signer and Percy Byshe Shelly, England's greatest poet and she begins to tell them the story of the movie. I love how Lord Baron roles his Rs when he talks, it's so appealing. It's a great intro to the movie and I like the idea of having Lancaster play Mary Shelley, there's something cool about seeing her as the woman who wrote the story, Mary Shelley and then later see her as the monster's bride. The film begins where the last one left off but some people didn't come back, Fred Kerr as Dr.Frankenstein's father does not appear here, neither the actor or character return after being a major character in the last one and no explanation of his where about. Valerie Hobson replaces Mae Clark as Dr.Frankenstein's wife and she does a good job. I love Colin Clive as Dr.Henry Frankenstein, he's the best and is sometimes underrated in his pitch perfect portrayal of a conflicted scientist who's not bad but is tempted by desire to play god. I love Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, he's a great edition to the story, a scientist crazier then Dr. Frankenstein. He has a good mixture of crazy, humor and a little flamboyant which caused a lot of people to question if he's gay, maybe he is. He has a creepy looking face too. There's a lot of humor here too, like Minnie as Dr. Frankenstein's loud mouth maid, she was not in the original but inexplicably appears here. Although there's a scene that I thought was too surreal, when Dr. Pretorius shows Dr. Frankenstein his 2 inch people that he grew, I thought that felt out of place. I love Boris Karloff as the monster, I thought it was great hearing him talk, unlike in the first film where he was silent. Although I thought it was a bit of a stretch that he went from not being able to talk to within two days mastering the English language. But I like his friendship with a blind hermit, that was well done, showing that he's not a total monster he just needs a friend. The best part of the movie however is towards the end where we get to see the much anticipated bride. The whole scene is awesome! Dr. Frankenstein says his iconic She's alive and I love the way he says it. Elsa Lancaster is terrific in her role, she's only on the screen for five minutes or so but she makes every minute count. It's great silent acting by her, she has the perfect look of a confused, horrified woman who just awoke from the dead. The church bells were great when she was introduced. I love her movements, she just really sells the idea that she just came back from the dead. I love her look as well, she looks kind of sexy in a creepy kind of way and of course her trademark electrified hair was a great idea. I love when she hisses at the monster in her last scene, the way she does it is really creepy. I feel sorry for her because like the monster in the first film, she wasn't given a chance to adjust to life after being brought back from the dead, this is definitely a tragic love story. I wish the bride would've been brought back for a sequel, I would of liked to see how she'd act in the outside world, would she kill people like the monster did? This is one of my favorite films from Universal classic Monster movies. An all-time classic.

I admired him because like myself he was an actor, magician and film director. I've always known that Citizen Kane was considered to be the greatest film of all time by many critics and yet, I still hadn't seen it. I finally got the opportunity to watch the film for the first time recently and it's climbed to become one of my favorites. Citizen Kane has themes as old as literature itself love, ambition, corruption and the price of success to name a few. These themes are part of the human condition and some of my personal favorites, so the film strongly appealed to me. The most impressive asset of the film was Welles. In addition to directing and writing the film, he also starred in it. Considering that this was his first film and he was given complete creative control by RKO, it was monumental. The film's cinematography for its time was groundbreaking material, with camera shots that had never been seen before or had just been emerging, such as the use of deep focus so the audience looks at the whole scene. Knowing a little on Welles' personal life, one of the film's most interesting aspects was that in many ways Welles was Kane, gifted and a slave to his own hubris. The film portrays a life of riches as poor substitutes to love. All Kane ever wanted was to be loved like every human being, but he was stripped away from the moment he was taken away from his parents at a young age. He spends the rest of his life trying to relive that childlike wonder, which is what his sled is symbolic of. If he can't be happy, then he makes the lives of those around him miserable as well, such as pushing his second wife Susan towards an opera career that she never wanted. He spends his later years in Xandu, his own castle. He spends fortunes on statues, to the extent that they completely occupy his home and he even has doubles of the same ones. The only two possessions he cared about were his snow globe and his sled, which reminded him of the life he wanted to rekindle. This is filmmaking at its finest. Welles pushed the boundaries and made the film his way, with his people without RKO breathing down his neck. I believe the only criticism a person could give is that it is boring to them, which is a fair complaint considering the plethora of films that are out there today and how much more technologically advanced Hollywood has become since the early 40's. I feel as if ambitious or intellectual men will get the most fulfillment out of Citizen Kane. I personally give it a perfect rating.

This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon as well as one unforgettable experience. It really set the bar form most sci-fi visual mediums we have now like TV shows (Battlestar Galatica revival, EXO Squad, and the criminally underrated Space, Above, and Beyond)as well as became a big influence on video games (Contra, Gears of War, Halo, Dead Space). This film gave us a new way of looking at sci-fi, it was final frontier sci-fi at it's best where it looked futuristic, realistic, believable and accessible.The world is great, this idea of a military of the future let alone in space, the technology that accompanies it. Spaceships, the weapons which look like advanced models of the ones we have now, portable flame units and my the pulse rifles, the sound of the rifles is awesome. The concept of artificial terror forming which gives us the power to make any planet we want habitable. However my favorite technology is the Power Loader, it was the first time I've ever seen a mecha ever, it's basically a simple construction vehicle nothing special in that world but in my eyes just the way it moved and worked I waned to drive one of those things.Music by James Horner one of my favorite composers is great, the score is just fantastic it's just has that exciting and epic feel to it.The effects and production value are superb because it's all practical most from my favorite effects guy the late great Stan Winston. Nothing was half baked the amount of detail in construction they really put a hell of a lot of effort and it shows. I love the dark atmosphere, just the use of limited light and darkness almost gives the film a slight Gothic foreboding sensibility to it as if there could be danger hiding behind one corner or another, you wouldn't know it will hit you until it's too late. The fact that there is more than one Zenomorph in this film and one new one which is the Queen Alien, it is the most gigantic intimidating monster I've ever seen it scared me when I was a kid and still makes me nervous ever time I see it.All that makes the danger all the more increased and puts you on red alert the whole way through. Usually with one monster you have many opportunities to evade but when it comes to an army of them your chances are slim. The way there handled, their behavior they were primal but not stupid. The fight with them was made similar to the Vietnam war and the Zenomorphs were sort of made to be like the Viet Cong who utilized gorilla tactics to bring down their opponents and undermine the high technology they have. The film of course also has that little underline message on humanity versus corruption and dehumanization. Demonstrated from the parallel between the evil destructive Zenomorphs and the unfeeling, cold blooded, destructive Weyland company that is willing to commit murder and breach ethical boundaries in both science and humanity all to make a fast profit.There are a lot of memorable things that were scary like the use of the portable radar and the sound it makes really put me on the edge of my seat, however one part of the film made me jump when Hicks looks up at the ceiling and sees a whole horde of Zenomorphs. As a kid that actually scarred me because I remembered my house had an attic I was afraid those things might be crawling up there. Down to the action sequences which are great their well choreographed, from seeing Ripley going all out in an alien hive but my favorite and it's no surprise is the fight with Ripley in the power loader against the Queen which is one of my favorite fights ever.The character are colorful, interesting as well as memorable. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) a really tough as nails woman with the attitude to go with it, she's awesome my third favorite character and one of the most memorable female fatales in movies ever in my book.

This film gave us a new way of looking at sci-fi, it was final frontier sci-fi at it's best where it looked futuristic, realistic, believable and accessible.The world is great, this idea of a military of the future let alone in space, the technology that accompanies it. Spaceships, the weapons which look like advanced models of the ones we have now, portable flame units and my the pulse rifles, the sound of the rifles is awesome. The concept of artificial terror forming which gives us the power to make any planet we want habitable. However my favorite technology is the Power Loader, it was the first time I've ever seen a mecha ever, it's basically a simple construction vehicle nothing special in that world but in my eyes just the way it moved and worked I waned to drive one of those things.Music by James Horner one of my favorite composers is great, the score is just fantastic it's just has that exciting and epic feel to it.The effects and production value are superb because it's all practical most from my favorite effects guy the late great Stan Winston. Nothing was half baked the amount of detail in construction they really put a hell of a lot of effort and it shows. I love the dark atmosphere, just the use of limited light and darkness almost gives the film a slight Gothic foreboding sensibility to it as if there could be danger hiding behind one corner or another, you wouldn't know it will hit you until it's too late. The fact that there is more than one Zenomorph in this film and one new one which is the Queen Alien, it is the most gigantic intimidating monster I've ever seen it scared me when I was a kid and still makes me nervous ever time I see it.All that makes the danger all the more increased and puts you on red alert the whole way through. Usually with one monster you have many opportunities to evade but when it comes to an army of them your chances are slim. The way there handled, their behavior they were primal but not stupid. The fight with them was made similar to the Vietnam war and the Zenomorphs were sort of made to be like the Viet Cong who utilized gorilla tactics to bring down their opponents and undermine the high technology they have. The film of course also has that little underline message on humanity versus corruption and dehumanization. Demonstrated from the parallel between the evil destructive Zenomorphs and the unfeeling, cold blooded, destructive Weyland company that is willing to commit murder and breach ethical boundaries in both science and humanity all to make a fast profit.There are a lot of memorable things that were scary like the use of the portable radar and the sound it makes really put me on the edge of my seat, however one part of the film made me jump when Hicks looks up at the ceiling and sees a whole horde of Zenomorphs. As a kid that actually scarred me because I remembered my house had an attic I was afraid those things might be crawling up there. Down to the action sequences which are great their well choreographed, from seeing Ripley going all out in an alien hive but my favorite and it's no surprise is the fight with Ripley in the power loader against the Queen which is one of my favorite fights ever.The character are colorful, interesting as well as memorable. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) a really tough as nails woman with the attitude to go with it, she's awesome my third favorite character and one of the most memorable female fatales in movies ever in my book. Dwane Hicks (Michael Bien) is my second favorite because he's the most level headed leader sort of a calm authoritative figure but also just a bad ass, from what he says to his actions. But of course my favorite no surprise is Ellen Ripley (Sigorney Wever) her character helped set the bar for the female fatales to come (Buffy, Betrix Kiddo, Lara Croft, you name it) and she's still number one in my book. From her leadership ability toward the Space Marines which is great she should of been a Space Marine Commander, or even a Commando seeing her going against the Zenomorphs and kicking ass just shows she's a bad ass as well. However it's the emotion she carries which makes her feel all so human. You can't help but feel for her from what she sees and feels from her facial and emotional expressions you see she is a person that is driven by internal rage, from her feelings toward the heartless Weyland company she worked for, her post traumatic experiences, the fact she has nothing really to come back to since her daughter is now deceased. The only thing she really has left is her unstoppable determinations toe save and protect everything that is good from evil of any form because she still believes in the value of humanity, that it's always worth fighting for.Aliens is an experience that take you to space, above, and beyond.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"2 November 2012","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In the early 1970s, Director Kubrick wanted to make a film about Napoleon. For various reasons, that effort failed to materialize. But Kubrick put his research on Napoleon and that historical era to good use later, in a story about a fictional character of that same time period, Barry Lyndon, a roguish young Irishman whose ambition and opportunism would carry him into splendorous surroundings of Europe's high and mighty, despite one setback after another.In Barry Lyndon what we get is thus a Napoleon-like character clever, charming, calculating, and commanding. And we follow this character over an extended period of his life, as he interacts with the grandiose and powerful, en route to a destiny dictated as much by uncontrollable fate as by his own selfish desires.Given the film's very slow pace, I like the way the unseen narrator explains the plot as it proceeds. Such a script device ensures an overview approach to the story, so that we don't get lost in details. Implicit here is the nullification of both suspense and mystery. The title character's ever-changing circumstances, however prosaic, and his responses to those changes, are what matter. The narrator functions thus as an impartial, emotionless observer, a stand-in for Kubrick himself.Production values rate quite high as does the cinematography. Interior scenes especially look really good, with those lit candles amid colorful costumes and makeup. Indeed, some scenes convey an air of romanticized unreality, as characters pose like statues in a museum. The classical background music thus completes the Enlightenment-age mood.Barry Lyndon is a period film with colorful costumes and some interesting characters. With a runtime of three hours and a big budget, it comes across as self-conscious and forced. Its stiffness, as displayed in stagy acting and stilted dialogue, renders it hard to like.

Well, for me, there is one main reason, and that's the terrible miscasting of Joseph Cotten as Sam Flusky. We are supposed to feel great sympathy for this man who apparently loves his woman greatly (e.g. he buys her such a nice ruby pendant, but treats her like trash in front of everybody at the governor's ball), who took responsibility for Henrietta's brother's murder (whom she apparently killed herself), and for whom Henrietta is so much in love and feels so much, despite the fact that we are not shown one atom of a reason why she should be so enamoured of that man. Sam is the epitome of dullness, brutality, roughness and he is a total bore. What the heck is Ingrid Bergman doing with that Neanderthalian equivalent of a husband anyway? Cotten was ideally cast as a cold-blooded killer disguised as a candy uncle in Shadow of a Doubt, but here, he is just plainly miscast and unable to evoke the kind of passion and devotion that she expresses for him even after he throws his rival Charles out of the house and into the dangers of the Australian plain at night like some piece of refuse. He is totally despicable, and poor Ingrid cannot evoke emotions in the viewer no matter how good she is in her role of a poor woman victim of life circumstances and who must rely on Sam the Brute, Sam the Still-Convict for her future, her very survival.And I am even more convinced about my theory that the first choice for filling Sam's role was none other than Burt Lancaster, who had to decline for lack of availability with his schedule (couldn't time travel back to New South Wales, XIXth century -)). Now just picture Burt side by side with Joseph, and tell me for whom would you feel sympathy despite all the misery he causes to his wife by being so totally cold and insensitive and just plain boring as ten nun's diaries ? Burt Lancaster had that aura of good and warmth around him, no matter how much of a villain or bad guy he was supposed to be in his roles. And he would have been ideal in that role ! Take his role in Birdman of Alcatraz as a dangerous criminal convicted for 2 murders (including one of the worst to society, i.e. killing a guard) who finds his redemption in veterinarian ornithology. What a clear demonstration that he would have done extremely well as a Sam Flusky ! I'm sure that Ingrid, who seems to me to have been a very bright woman, would have probably found it easier to make us believe in her pleas for her husband's innocence and well-being.As for me, I simply cannot penetrate through that thick wall of indifference that Cotten has so efficiently built between himself and the rest of the world. Therefore, I just couldn't espouse Ingrid's devotion and love for her iceberg-like husband. Burt was Hitchcock's real choice, and it seems to me that he (and Alma, who loved SOAD a great deal) just thought Joseph did so well in SOAD. He'll do Burt's part very well, I'm sure. And they gave the role to Cotten without perhaps considering some adaptations of the script to accommodate the dramatic difference in the type of character that Lancaster and Cotten evoked on the big screen. I know that changing a script to fit a different actor might not have been Hitchcock's cup of tea (I mean, does anybody talk softly to cattle before sending them to the slaughterhouse ?). But in this case, it might have made the difference between a minor film in Hitch's legacy and one of the caliber of Rope, for instance.Yes, the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that the poor casting choice of Cotten Joe WAS the reason why this whole enterprise ended up being on the verge of a total bore (I gave it a 5\/10, so far my worst rating for a Hitchcock's movie, below Topaz and Torn Curtain, which got a 7\/10).

I just... This movie is about as fun as watching paint dry for hours. That is how bad this film is, and I would be happy to discuss the grudge I have with it!First off, the voice acting is terrible. The characters' voices are either too high or not suitable for them at all. There is one pig cop in this movie, whose voice sounds like it was done by Patrick the Starfish from SpongeBob. I know the actor was trying to do his best to make this character sound dumb, but that voice just doesn't cut it. I'm really starting to not care at this point.

Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman (who also do well) the movie also included names like Rene Russo, Kevin Spacey, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were, although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock - which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine.The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston, but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek, California. The disease is obviously a threat, and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels - an Army doctor trying to figure this out; Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford.When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease, this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released Contagion. The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening, but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. Outbreak avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in Contagion. The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government.Where Outbreak fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller (basically the last 30-40 minutes) which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done, but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet, up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story, and, frankly, I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching Contagion.

Nosferatu and other fair starring Lon Chaney, Sr, were some of the earliest mysteries, suspense, and horror films. But unlike the movie-musicals and romantic dramas which launched the talkies in the 1930's, genre films have often been relegated to B Picture status, and each decade has seen its offerings of whatever genre caught audience's fancies. The 1930's was the era of the gangster film and the horror film, a la Public Enemy, Little Caesar, Dracula and the Mummy, the 1940's was the era of film noir thrillers, such as Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice, and the 1950's was the era of the movie monster. In the 1950's, movie monsters splashed upon drive-in theaters reigned in which the monster itself was the star of the show, inspired by the first bona fide King Kong feature released in 1933. Them, which starred giant Ants, Tarantula starring a giant spider, and the biggest of them all, Godzilla, a freak of atomic science creating a reptilian creature the size of Mt Everest, caused many a female movie goer to clutch their date in rapturous fright.One of the better installments from the movie monster era is Creature from the Black Lagoon. Despite the rather predictable dialog and cookie-cutter characters, Creature is still a decent viewing, for reasons other than the masterful script which, in certain scenes, almost rings of screen writing nearing the genius threshold of Plan 9 from Outer Space. However, what saves Creature is the creature itself and the plot if you're willing to suspend your 21st-century movie-going sensibility for about 90 minutes.The story begins with the discovery of an ancient fossil, a claw no less, surviving from several million years ago. Unlike most fossils, the claw appears to be both man-like and amphibious. A strange missing link between humans and frogs, I guess. An unlikely entourage of scientists, three male and one female, decide to survey the Amazon for more fossils on small expedition boat. Of course two of the male scientists have the hots for the one female, a manage a trois which isn't quite as romantic as King Arthur, Guinevere and Sir Lancelot. The lucky boy who currently has the girl exhibits the desirable trait of being the only voice of reason when the Amazon Lagoon may be their last stop. The other male, the female's former lover who got dumped a few years back, is as hot-headed and uncompromising as an oven set to 425-degrees. The female is supposed to be a scientist too, although her reason d'etre is more about her skimpy outfits than intellectual discourse and contribution, which is so typical of these genre films.Instead of finding more fossils, the team is invaded by a living example of the amphibious man creature. The love triangle between the scientists becomes a love rectangle two men, one woman, and one creature. What saves the film from becoming ridiculous farce is the monster himself, who, in retrospect, has much more character than any of the other males, except for possibly the Latin American captain of the expedition boat. The monster's motives are a bit typical grab anything that looks human with his man-crunching claws. And in later scenes, his presence allows our only female character to engage her vocal chords which, in retrospective, are designed to indicate the very complex and subtle emotions often associated with terror.The best aspect of Creature aside from the creature himself are the superb underwater sequences. When the rival males decide to battle the Creature, instead of each other, they take their gear underwater. The creature glides easily through the lagoon, making him a very believable amphibious creature. My understanding is the creature was played by a professional swimmer in the underwater scenes. Scenes on land and on the boat were another actor.All things considered, a fine 1950's low budget horror flick which may have lost some of its punch over the years but not its charm. The dialog is campy; one of my fav's is We didn't come here to fight monsters, we're not equipped for it. The young lovers squabble over who gets the girl and the scientific fame like junior high kids arguing over who gets to play quarterback. But the monster is still quite a site, constantly opening his strange mouth to breathe when he's on land. And this film inspired many later films with better scripts and bigger budgets like Alien and Jurrasic Park. The film has continued to be part of American b-movie culture with the creature making cameo appearances such as in Marvel comics and the Simpsons. A must-see for horror movie buffs.

The movie contains some very funny moments that's for certain but they're usually spread out and very far apart. Some of the best moments happen early on during scene where three white girls try to let a black man know that they feel his pain. This here is followed by another funny scene where Fritz tries to outsmart the girls into having sex with him. The majority of the other jokes might have been offensive back in the day but I think most of them are quite tame by today's standards. The animation is certainly the highlight as I really liked the look of everything from the characters to the locations.

The movie contains some very funny moments that's for certain but they're usually spread out and very far apart.
