Likewise, calling Janet Jackson a singing superstar is also an understatement. Now where would you find these two names together I hear you say? Well in the sequel to one of the funniest films ever made in recent years of course. Unless you've been hiding for the last 2 months or just never ever listen to the radio, you won't have missed the new Janet Jackson song that goes round and round in your head forever. The catchy summer tune is one of the songs that although annoying, it's kind of catchy. Well `Doesn't Really Matter' is the theme tune to the new Eddie Murphy movie - Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps. But Ms Jackson doesn't just appear on the soundtrack; she's in the movie as well! In the movie, we see the lovable 28-stone Sherman Klump return with the rest of his family entail. If you think your way back to the 1996 re-make of the Jerry Lewis Nutty Professor, then you'll remember Buddy Love, Sherman's alter-ego. Just as Professor Klump thought he'd got rid of him for good, Buddy pops up again - but not without a plan. He breaks free of Sherman's body for good and is determined to ruin his plans to we his colleague Denise Gaines played by the illustrious Janet Jackson. Sherman's new youth formula has fallen into Buddy's hands, and it looks like Klump is losing his intelligence - for good! From the beginning I knew that it was going to be a laughter packed movie because judging by the first scene, Eddie's performances as Sherman, Mama, Papa, Ernie and last but not least Grandma Klump are so believable, that it is as if they are five different people. The second most important Klump character in the film is Granny Klumps whose sexual appetite knows no bounds, and as she spots Buddy sneaking around the Klump family home, she has only one thing on her mind! As a singer, people don't realise that Janet has a long history of acting. As a child, she starred in many American sitcoms including Fame and Good Times and went on to star in the 1993 John Singleton (Shaft, Boyz N The Hood) film `Poetic Justice' alongside the late Tupac (Shakur). `I've never stopped receiving scripts since Poetic Justice,' Janet said, `but there was either a scheduling conflict, the script was too similar to Poetic Justice or I didn't really like it. But when Nutty came along, I jumped at the chance. I mean, who wouldn't want to work with Eddie?' Although as a Janet fan, you may say I'm being biased, Janet really does a good job acting here. `I really wanted people to think of me as Denise. I hope that people will be able to separate Denise from Janet.' And one genuinely can. However, the movie isn't 100% perfect. Where it faulters is in terms of a decent storyline. It felt like a bit of a re-trip to the first movie with a similar plot. The film, though, is hilarious and will have you repeating lines for days after it, but my only recommendation is that you see it twice. The first time round, you are getting to grips with the storyline, and I have to admit, because I didn't catch all the jokes, I didn't find it that funny. But when you go back a second time, as you know the basic storyline (which is there - despite what I said earlier), you can listen in for the jokes, as they are quite hard to catch sometimes. Altogether, Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps is very good - in fact it is one of the best sequels (save MI2) that I have seen. It was always going to be difficult to follow up the success of The Nutty Professor, but seeing that it took over $45 million in its first weekend at the US Box Office, this is sure to be a hit in the UK as well.

The Big Sleep is the only novel of his that I have been able to make it through and even that was an uphill struggle against crippling boredom. The effect was not unlike what I would imagine being pumped full of tranquilizers and being made to run the New York Marathon would be like. A big sleep, indeed...Thankfully, because Howard Hawks did take the time to listen to his audience before releasing the version known best to later generations, he managed to hammer the movie version into something that never gets dull, not for a minute. Granted, you're not sure who's who, what just happened, or when the next dead body is going to hit the ground (this particular mystery has the highest body count of any I've seen in recent memory outside of L.A. Confidential), but the razor-sharp dialogue keeps things entertaining throughout.Bogie could call himself Phil Marlowe, Sam Spade, Rick Blaine, or Howdy Doody for that matter, but Chandler, when asked about his performance in The Big Sleep, probably said it best, Bogart is always superb playing Bogart. Here, he plays that role probably the best that I have ever seen him do it. He takes more of a beating this time out than usual, worked over a couple of times and none too gently, either. The sense one gets is that he's a man trying to get a handle on a situation that keeps threatening to spin out of control. The miracle is that Bogie is able to keep track of the plotline better than the audience (including myself).Of course, I would be remiss if I did not mention a certain lady by the professional name of Lauren Bacall. She provides the film with it's other stable axis. She comes off as mysterious, tough, over her head in trouble, and head over heels in love. The moment where she and Bogie clicked into place for me was the phone conversation with the police line they dialed up. I get the impression that she didn't want Bogie to probe any deeper because she knew that he'd land in the spot she was in. Of course, getting info from her is like trying to pry open Fort Knox with a crowbar. She keeps her cards as close to her chest, if not closer, than Bogie. You never know where she's going to pop up next, but you know it's going to be interesting.Now, to answer the all-important question of who killed Regan,...watch the movie again.

Almost from start to finish the animation is impressive, the soundtrack ethnic and grandiose, the voice talent effective and varied.. but .. but, for this viewer at least, it ultimately proved less satisfying and exciting than I hoped. Perhaps one problem is the familiarity of the story. By opting for what is essentially a conservative retelling of a famous Biblical epic, Dreamworks made me pine for a deviation from the well trodden path, a sense of provoking imagination and adventure, that was all often missing. Ironically for me, the most refreshing part of the animation came in the only real departure from Biblical tradition. Moses' 'hieroglyphic dream' was so amusing, witty and unexpected that, by it's presence, it ultimately showed just how Sunday School-bound the rest of the production really was. And heresies of heresies, when God finally spoke to Moses during the burning bush incident, my mind fled unbidden Monty Python and The Holy Grail - but that's probably just a personal thing.This is a strange, patchwork Egypt to watch as well; but perhaps historical accuracy wasn't of prime concern to the background artists. Here we have the temple of Karnak and the pyramids (in reality built thousands of years and miles apart) all in one grand vista; there we have a hodgepodge of Sphynx, statue and slaves plonked down to look pretty, dramatic, but without real rhyme or reason; now and again Rameses frames his noble features against the arrange of cross-dynastic images lined up behind him - did Ancient Egypt really look like this, a trans-dynastic smorgasbord? A bit more research, a shade more historical perspective would have gone a long way. If Dreamworks produce a film on the ancient Brits, lets hope that learn a lesson and at least keep Stonehenge and Big Ben in different shots!Having said all, what remains is undeniably spectacular, although I for one felt short changed when the Plagues were telescoped and rushed through, thereby losing a lot of animation potential. And perhaps I miscounted, but weren't we one or two Plagues short? Highlight of everything, of course, is the parting of the Red Sea which, leaving aside the logical absurdities of the original story, is very impressive as done here. The brief glimpse of whales (yes, whales in The Red Sea - but we'll let that pass) provided another rare, imaginative touch. But why no fish flapping under the feet of the fleeing Hebrews? On the music side, I was impressed by the opening and Exodus music, although 'You're Playing With The Big Boys Now' seemed trite and sub-disneyesque in the carrying out. But it's the parting of the Red Sea that, as it must do with this story, remains with me the longest . The sense of awe on Moses' and friends' faces at the passing events suitably reflected the effectiveness of this grand finale, as well this viewers own pleasure. I reflected then how far animation had gone in dramatic style and effect over recent years.

One week after screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) receives a Humanitarian Award for Lifetime Achievement, he is fired from a three picture deal at Paramount because there are those who feel that he is `losing his edge.'  His agent, Hal (Bradley Whitford), tells him to take a year off, get his edge back.  With a wife and two daughters, however, Steven proclaims this to be an unviable option, whereupon he falls into a funk with no idea of what to do next.  His wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell) urges him to consult with his best friend and fellow screenwriter, Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), who has been on a roll for the past couple of years, including one in which he won an Oscar.  After some coaxing, Steven gets Jack to let him in on the secret of his success, and it turns out that he has a muse (a `real' muse), and her name is Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone).  Incredulous, initially, Steven is finally convinced, and Jack sets up a meeting for him with Sarah.  She agrees to take him on, and he quickly learns that there are rules and obligations that go along with having a muse, which include a suite at the Four Seasons, being on call whenever she feels `inspired,' as well as getting her dry cleaning done and shopping for her.  All at his expense, of course (`Consider it an investment').  And then there's the little matter of explaining it all to Laura (`Muses exist!  They live amongst us!' he tells her).  She responds as expected, but then Brooks cleverly takes the story in another direction.  Laura and Sarah have lunch together, bond, and soon Steven is sharing his muse with his wife. \tBrooks fine-tunes and finesses the humor throughout the film, taking Steven through his paces as he tries to balance out his obligations to Sarah and Laura with the time he needs to actually do some writing.  But the fact that Sarah is supposedly the daughter of Zeus, and that it is taken for granted by all who believe her to be a real muse, is really at the core of the humor in this movie.  Watching intelligent, successful people falling prey to such gullibility enables us to laugh all the more at a situation that is already hilarious on the surface.  Moreover, when you think about it and realize that there are actually those in Hollywood (as well as anywhere, I suspect) who could, in reality, be convinced that such a thing as a `Muse' actually exists, it makes it all that much funnier still; yet if you extend that thought further, it almost becomes scary.  Ultimately, Brooks and co-writer Monica Johnson have turned out a movie that works extremely well on two levels, with the satire on the surface perfectly complimented by all that's going on underneath. \tAs usual, Brooks has assembled an excellent supporting cast, including Mark Feuerstein (Josh Martin) and Steven Wright (Stan Spielberg), as well as sprinkling effective cameos by Rob Reiner, James Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, and Jennifer Tilly (all of whom play themselves), throughout; and there's an especially humorous bit by Martin Scorsese (also playing himself).  The triumph of `The Muse' is that it is thought provoking as well as laugh provoking; you'll laugh, think about it for awhile, and when it really hits you, you'll probably be smiling and chuckling for the rest of the day.

But taken as a whole, this is a very, very bad movie.Despite the title Endgame, I suspect we have not seen the end of this franchise yet, and I actually consider this a good thing.  The Highlander mythos has brought enough entertainment to enough people (Myself included) to deserve a better curtain call than this.  I have hope for the future of the series.  But this particular installment is just plain horrible.

There are better films, yes, and there are more popular films...perhaps. But Ferris Bueller has always been on the top of my list. This movie succeeds on so many different levels a teen comedy, a satire, a social commentary, even a promotional film for the city of Chicago. I've seen it a few dozen times and every time I notice things in a whole different way.The movie, on the surface, is of course the account of how an impossibly carefree senior named Ferris Bueller decides to skip a day of school and take his girl and his best friend out on the town, while setting clever traps and ruses to foil his clueless parents, his nosy sister and even nosier dean. Even on this level the movie is fantastic. But to me, and probably to many others, the movie is not really about Ferris skipping school and having fun. It's really about Ferris skipping school and trying to get his depressed buddy, Cameron Frye, to have fun and learn to have confidence in himself. Cameron is probably the character most people identify with; uptight, unsure of himself, afraid to stand up to his parents. Everyone has part of Cameron inside them at some point in their lives. No one is ever really Ferris. Ferris is the unblemished perfect soul that the Camerons of the world have to put up with he gets away with everything, has perfect grades, perfect family, perfect girl, and he's always happy. The great thing about Ferris is, he knows all of that, and he's taking this day off to make it up to Cameron.The film has great characters (very few films capture the true nature of high school like this one; Ben Stein was born for this role), and even better directing I love the camera work; the quick, rapid establishing shots are priceless. Even the story is excellent; it's sharp and intelligent (though Ferris sure seems to fit quite a lot of activity into one day). I sincerely doubt there's anyone who wouldn't like this movie.
