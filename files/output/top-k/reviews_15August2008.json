[{"date":"15 August 2008","score":"","review":" Meet Nick and Nora Charles, possibly the best husband-and-wife team in the history of cinema. They love each other, but they also have a lot of fun together. Boozing, solving mysteries, throwing swish cocktail parties and caring for Asta- Smooth, witty William Powell and gorgeous Myrna Loy certainly make a wonderful couple.The plot to The Thin Man really isn't much; it's a catalyst for a heap of entertaining situations and great comic lines.

Let's drink to a terrific film pairing that shows us marriage can actually be pretty swell.
