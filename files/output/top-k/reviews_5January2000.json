[{"date":"5 January 2000","score":"","review":"  Man on the Moon is the eagerly awaited biography of Andy Kaufman directed by Milos Forman, an Academy Award winner whose last biographical feature was the outstanding The People vs. Larry Flynt. I want into this movie with very high expectations because (1) I have a lot of respect for Forman as a director and (2) the early reviews were glowing, suggesting Oscar gold for both Forman and Carrey. Sad to say, I was disappointed. I didn't learn anything new about Kaufman from Man on the Moon, and in fact the movie seemed like little more than a series of sketches strung together in an attempt to illustrate Kaufman's life. The movie gets off to a promising start, showing us how Kaufman had the urge to entertain even as a child (he's just sure there are cameras in his bedroom walls broadcasting to some huge unseen audience). It then skips years into the future, and we find Kaufman (now played by Jim Carrey) is making a meager living doing stand up in nightclubs (of course, his idea of stand up involves reciting nursery rhymes to an increasingly hostile audience). His boss lets him go, explaining that Kaufman needs to learn to perform in a more conventional fashion in order to engage the audience (he suggests impressions or dirty jokes). Kaufman returns to wow the audience with a hilarious Elvis impression, and soon finds himself cornered by agent George Shapiro (Danny De Vito), who soon convinces him to star on the prime time sitcom Taxi against his better judgment (Sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment, he says). Taxi thrusts Kaufman into the public eye, a place in which he seems increasingly uncomfortable. He finally comes up with a funny scheme to get off of the program, involving his riotous alter ego sleazy lounge singer Tony Clifton (for whom Kaufman has secured a recurring role on the sitcom). It's about here that the movie seems to lose its' way. Kaufman meets Lynne (Courtney Love), and I suppose that we are to assume that the two develop a close relationship, even though the film doesn't give us very many interesting dialogue scenes between them (compare this with the intriguing relationship developed between Larry and Althea in Forman's People vs. Larry Flynt). Kaufman and Lynne become involved in the pro wresting circuit, pioneering intergender wrestling and causing quite a stir with such wrestling pros as Jerry Lawler. Kaufman becomes known as the ultimate prankster -- willing to do anything for a laugh, and liking nothing better than when he can fool his audience. In fact, his family and friends don't even believe him when he develops cancer -- they think it's just another elaborate prank, making comments such as This is a showbiz hospital, Andy knows all these doctors, etc. But, it's not. One problem I had with Man on the Moon concerns personal preference. I just didn't find a lot of Kaufman's humor in this movie funny. Kaufman seems less a conventional comedian than he does a performance artist of sorts, and that's fine, but it makes for a long haul when you are watching a biography of a comedian you don't find particularly amusing. I laughed some during the movie (particularly at the scenes with Tony Clifton), but having seen the movie I can honestly say that I don't see why Kaufman is revered so. He seems less concerned with entertaining an audience than he does with entertaining himself, and indeed the second half of the movie deals in depth with his rejection by a mass audience, a development I understood completely (though the film treats it as baffling). If you are a big fan of Kaufman, you may find this movie hilarious and may want to add a star to my rating.... but I just didn't think a lot of it was funny. I can't lie. However, I think the main weakness with Man on the Moon is its failure to really probe the psyche of its protagonist. Going into the movie, I knew Andy Kaufman was on Taxi, I knew he was considered a comic genius, and I knew he was destined to tragically die quite young. The movie wasn't very illuminating in that it didn't really allow us to get to know Kaufman, and so when I left the theater I didn't know anything more about him than I did going in. Sure, Carrey is brilliant in the scenes in which he recreates Kaufman's skits, but when it comes time for him to really portray him as a character (in the second half of the movie), he seems lost. There just isn't much of a real character here for Carrey to sink his teeth into as an actor. Even though I personally find much of Kaufman's humor strange and unfunny, if the film had given me a really good idea of who Andy Kaufman was and what he did to deserve his status as a national icon, that would have been enough for a recommendation. It doesn't, and for that reason, the movie left me unfulfilled. It's quite good technically, with strong performances all around and the usual pro job from Forman, but the script seems pitched at the level of a tv-movie. A few less skit re-creations and less time spent on the wrestling coupled with more character development would've resulted in a higher grade from me. An honorable misfire. 6\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"5 January 2000","score":"","review":"  Man on the Moon is the eagerly awaited biography of Andy Kaufman directed by Milos Forman, an Academy Award winner whose last biographical feature was the outstanding The People vs. Larry Flynt.

Kubrick's images are undeniable and very, very startling. The eye must watch. There is a remarkable trademark of Kubrick's that lies in his spacing of dialogue. It is never as simple as He said - cut to Her - She said. That is the formula, but Kubrick always cuts away early. He leaves a discernible pause. This creates a note of discord (emphasized in the music score with its jarring one-note piano stabbings), in that everyone who speaks in his films appear to be studying one another. People speak in measured tones, but rarely communicate themselves well to one another. Many have spoken of Kubrick's coldness as a filmmaker, and it is true that he always keeps his characters at arm's length, distancing them from each other and us. But the reason behind this would appear to be that in doing so, the film's eye catches everything. Nothing gets overlooked in the heat of the moment, in the messiness of emotional embrace. We watch Kubrick's players watch.I have heard tell of a comparison with The Matrix, which I find especially perceptive. Here, the matrix is created by us, by our own psychological make-up. Which of course is more terrifying and pessimistic, as well as more truthful. While Kubrick unsettles with his world of penetrating observers, there are moments of participatory activity, but tellingly, it occurs in dream. Kidman's character is frightened by her dreams of actively humiliating and degrading her husband, more still because she secretly revels in it. Cruise, on the other hand, goes on a tripped-out 48 hour adventure in which he tries desperately to play the role of outsider his wife so desires, only to be discovered, revealed and publicly shamed. Kubrick's contrasts are obvious, but sooooo compelling Kidman is active and cruel in her dream-life, Cruise is passive and reflective in his waking existence. As the film ultimately asks at its conclusion, is one more innocent than the other?Eyes Wide Shut may not be the most optimistic portrayal of a marriage and its strengths, but Kubrick has again, and sadly for the last grand time, allowed us to see through his eyes a world where the notion of communication is not taken for granted. His people struggle to express, and seem all the more human for it. Let it be said that Kubrick's eyes were always wide open, and to the details most of us figured too mundane to truly appreciate. He will be greatly missed.

Although its kind of ironic that almost all of the movie takes place in a prison, the one place in the world where you'd think you'd be restricted from it. Just seeing it once lets you walk away from it with the biggest feeling of joy, no matter how upset you are about anything else, at that time, that one time, nothing in the world matters.

He deserved it because he is one of the supreme artists of the cinema.  His ability to draw superb performances from his actors, is coupled with an astonishing ability to depict these emotional states visually, through the use of camera angles, lighting and symbols.  East of Eden must be seen in the widescreen format to truly appreciate its visual style.  It is arresting, sometimes beautiful and always powerful.Then there are the performances.  James Dean's heartbreaking realization of Cal, consumed by jealousy; Jo Van Fleet's magnificent portrayal of his mother; Richard Davalos (why didn't we see more of him on the screen after this film?) innocent, virginal, doomed; Raymond Massey who has never been better in a multi-layered performance; Burl Ives' commanding police chief - and, as usual in a Kazan film, even the smallest part is played to perfection (who'll forget the girl in the brothel or the nurse at the end?).  After seeing the film a few times I really appreciate the performance of Julie Harris too.  I once thought her a little too mature for the role - but now I see how her reactions to the events really enhance the emotional impact of those events.  Kazan allows her to be in frame during some of the most crucial encounters between Cal and his father - and her face tells a million stories.  This is a true supporting performance - her performance helping Dean realize Cal.  Brava Julie!I'm a lot older now than when I first saw this film - but I still relate so strongly to the communication breakdown and the need for love between father and son.  The improvement of my own relationship with my father makes me see the film differently but with no less emotion.  Like all masterpieces this film does not date, we just see it differently as we age.  This is undoubtedly one of my top five films.  How about a theatrical revival?  I have never seen it in a cinema.  Remember see it in widescreen - not pan and scan.

Kazan allows her to be in frame during some of the most crucial encounters between Cal and his father - and her face tells a million stories.  This is a true supporting performance - her performance helping Dean realize Cal.  Brava Julie!I'm a lot older now than when I first saw this film - but I still relate so strongly to the communication breakdown and the need for love between father and son.  The improvement of my own relationship with my father makes me see the film differently but with no less emotion.  Like all masterpieces this film does not date, we just see it differently as we age.  This is undoubtedly one of my top five films.  How about a theatrical revival?

He deserved it because he is one of the supreme artists of the cinema.  His ability to draw superb performances from his actors, is coupled with an astonishing ability to depict these emotional states visually, through the use of camera angles, lighting and symbols.  East of Eden must be seen in the widescreen format to truly appreciate its visual style.  It is arresting, sometimes beautiful and always powerful.Then there are the performances.  James Dean's heartbreaking realization of Cal, consumed by jealousy; Jo Van Fleet's magnificent portrayal of his mother; Richard Davalos (why didn't we see more of him on the screen after this film?) innocent, virginal, doomed; Raymond Massey who has never been better in a multi-layered performance; Burl Ives' commanding police chief - and, as usual in a Kazan film, even the smallest part is played to perfection (who'll forget the girl in the brothel or the nurse at the end?).

Some aspects (like the thirteenth-and-a-halfth floor, and the puppetry) are well suited to cinema, but the central conceit would be better served by the written word.  How does one SHOW, visually, that Craig is receiving all the sensory information that John Malkovich is receiving?

While SOS isn't as great as some of Spike Lee's best films, I don't agree that it is symptomatic of some kind of career decline. I also liked last year's `He Got Game'.

But then I don't find sex without nudity particularly titillating &#150; especially with the lights off &#150; and there was virtually no nudity in the movie.  Which suggests that the sex was there only to make a character point. Like it or not, how we approach sex says a great deal about who we are as people.

Obviously people growing up in a particular cultural community &#150; e.g. Italian-Americans in New York &#150; have a unique insight into the community. Scorcese has made a career out of this fact. But people from other cultural communities which have contact with that community may have other equally valid insights to bring to the table. I for one would like to hear them as well. All this to say that Lee seems to have a particular fascination with and ambivalence towards Italian-Americans, and it's interesting to watch.3.

The question is did he succeed in his portrayal? All I know is I have never before in my life talked back to the screen as I did to his character in the climactic scene.4. I liked Lee as an Arthur Ashe-looking reporter, tsk-tsking his `own' people on the rampage. Getting back to sex (and why not?), it reminded me of Ashe's response to Magic Johnson's AIDS announcement and Wilt Chamberlain's famous boast\/confession.

Others have whined that, contrary to the impression left by the movie and its soundtrack, The Who had nothing to do with punk rock. This ignores the fact that a musician's influences usually transcend what's going on at a particular moment. For example, Mick Jones of the Clash and Patti Smith were huge Keith Richards fans (Mick was even nicknamed `Keef' within the band), but I doubt that their fans felt the same reverence towards the Stones guitarist. However, I must point out that Pete Townsend's principal axe was a Fender Telecaster, not some blues-wimp Strat, as implied in the movie.6. Sure, I would have liked more of the talking dog, but clearly Berkowitz himself was not supposed to be the focus.

He takes big swipes at General Motors, The Flint Tourism bureau, Bob Eubanks, and others with a film that is so funny that it is only after viewing it you realize that it is equally as angry.  Although this documentary is clearly biased, it is a wonderful film experience, and it takes a well earned swipe at corporate ignorance.  It confronts it by putting a face on its irresponsibility.

It is a great film to watch when you are young and to watch the whole series from 1-9 is almost a rites of passage for every teenager (or film buff). The story is simple. A group of young people set up a holiday camp only to all get killed by a deranged lunatic.

All of them seem to be only doing a job, they seem oblivious to the suffering yet they are in it as well. It's as if they are on holiday, in hotels getting drunk, chatting, wasting eggs for hangover cures.

However, of course, she was taken to a better place free of war and misery which is a good thing.Whilst of course the shelling of civilians in Sarajevo was deplorable and inhumane, the Serbs in this film are made out to be ghouls, targetting women and children when the truth is that the siege of Sarajevo was, unlike most other wars, very light. Sieges invariably cause civilian deaths but Sarajevo, compared to most other cities of its size, did not suffer tremendous damage. Whilst the world is happy to lay all blame on the Serbs, we conveniently forget that both Germany and the US supplied Arms and support to the nationalist Croat regime between 1991-95, which brutally murdered thousands of Muslims and Serbs and was responsible for the single largest expulsion of refugees since the Soviets displaced 180,000 Sudeten Germans in 1945However, we cannot forget how brutally the Bosnian Serb army did murder innocents, in the film the warlord Zivko (fict. or non-fict??)is pointed out when we see his name sprayed on walls where he commits his crimes. The image of the 'lost' young boy in red is another memorable one, as are David Owen's chilling words of warning to Bosnians, that they cannot expect western help amidst the slaughter.

Just as imperial European powers confronted their hearts of darkness deep in the African continent, the United States finally had to confront its own in the jungles of Vietnam. But if moral judgement was all Coppola had been trying to do, this would be remembered only as a pretty good film. What makes it a great one is that Coppola, following his character Kurtz's advise, does not judge, either the individuals in the film (including Kurtz) or the U.S. as a whole. I do not see this film as an overt condemnation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, just a brilliant look at the ramifications of that involvement. Nor is it an anti-war picture in any blatant way -- the attack on the Vietnamese village led by Kilgore and his choppers can be viewed several ways, depending upon what one's own feelings are. War is glorious, futile, exhilarating, chaotic, and savage all at the same time, and that sequence, the best shot sequence ever put on film, is all of it at once.Finally, the use of music and sound in the film was incredible! From Wagner and the superman-esque scene we gradually evolve into a haunting almost new age sound before ending up with, fittingly, The End by the Doors. Along the way, Coppola builds up the appearance of Kurtz to an almost unbearable level; then Brando's off-beat, off-rhythm performance fits the almost un-earthly landscape Sheen and crew find themselves in.I don't know if this is the best film ever made, but its damned close!
