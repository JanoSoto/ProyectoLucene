[{"date":"18 October 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Robert Altman is the king of all filmmakers in two regards 1 being his ability to cast anyone he wants in a picture, and 2, his keen eye and skill at putting together a carousel of characters, situations, and dialogue that uniquely captures a piece of the American way.  Just see NASHVILLE, his 1976 masterpiece about mayhem in the heartland and the overwhelming political element in this country (even in the country singing capital of the world). COOKIE'S FORTUNE is Altman at his simplistic best, light years from the ferocity of THE PLAYER and still as fresh and innovative as his first classic, M*A*S*H.Glenn Close delivers a Gloria Swanson-like portrayal of a demented southern belle whose bell seems to have rung one too many times.  Her performance is over-the-top but effective.  The fortune of the film's title is not exactly what you'd might expect if you know COOKIE'S FORTUNE's premise, however Close keeps the viewer thinking maybe she knows something we do not. The fact that she eats a certain note is stunningly hilarious.The rest of the cast is great.  Ned Beatty talks about fishing as if it was a form of breathing for him and he never strays away from this simple-mindedness.  Neither do any of the less-than-brilliant characters. Charles Dutton is the dramatic centerpiece and pillar who exists at the most important points of this charade Altman is depicting.  He and Liv Tyler have some nice moments together.  Racial harmony is even touched upon with Dutton's conflict and is integral at tying the film's sometimes loose ends together (at times you remain confused as to who is Cookie's daughter or daughters and whether or not Tyler is the granddaughter).Keep an eye out for Chris O'Donnel's best performance in years, however brief it is.  His simple police officer brought me to laughter many times, partly because O'Donnel is masterfully overplaying him.  That is the point.There are many motiffs surrounding the goofy citizens of this small town (police tape, open glass doors with guns behind them), but the film is indeed as simple as it appears which is good considering Altman has sometimes gone nuts in his films (THE WEDDING, GINGERBREAD MAN).  He still employs the overlapping dialogue and scenery he so expertly displayed in SHORT CUTS and THE PLAYER.  See the film for an entertaining romp with a glint of American commentary that is enough to make COOKIE'S FORTUNE both important and delightful.

This was to large measure the grist for his mill. \tWilde had a cutting wit and a profound appreciation of the value of secrecy, even if he didn't apply those principals sufficiently well to his own behaviour. Satire can be dangerous for the satirist.But it's also obvious that his personality, or was it his sexuality, precluded him being careful enough. He was doomed by his love of scandal, and of young boys.But was he fundamentally dishonest? How corrupt was Wilde? At least he worked for a living!There's no doubt that Wilde wasn't an ideal husband but it could be argued by the more liberal, by the lovers of his brilliance, that he was an ideal citizen.He was certainly one of the cleverest, one of the most entertaining. The Picture Of Dorian Grey and The Importance Of Being Earnest established that without a doubt.And he could well have been of better calibre, and possessed of nobler intentions, than The Ideal Husband he portrays in his play.By Wilde's thesis, An Ideal Husband was corrupt and rich, as is An Ideal Politician.In the film a politician called Sir Robert, (Jeremy Northern, fresh from The Winslow Boy) is a paragon of virtue.He's introduced to the film as a great orator and leader. He's Prime Ministerial material. He's a loving to his wife and utterly honest.His wife Gertrude (Australia's Cate Blanchett in another terrific performance) is sweetness and purity itself.  Unfortunately years before Robert had been a secretary for a government Minister and had sold secret  information for a huge sum of money. How else could he, a poor man, have got into a position of power? There were no seats in parliament for common men.Mrs Cheverley (American actress Julianne Moore) blackmails Robert with evidence of his sordid past. Will Sir Robert protect his career or give penance for his sins and confess all.All ends well when dear Gertrude in effect takes the money and runs, possibly to become a Prime Minister's wife. Everyone is delighted when even Gertrude joins the club and actually, giggling, confesses to telling a lie.And as for Sir Robert, well he's exposed to those who love him as corrupt and then exalted even higher. Everyone is relieved that he's been sullied. Now they know they can trust him.End of play.There's another subplot or two, cleverly written, as we would expect from Mr Wilde, (screenplay by the film's director Oliver Parker). These involve blossoming love between Robert's sister Mabel (Minnie Driver) and his best friend Goring (Rupert Everett?) but I find these Rule Britannia, London season films increasingly offensive.Australians are soon to vote on whether Australia should throw over England and become a Republic. Monarchists are likely to find An Ideal Husband to be ideal. Republicans I would hope  might find it a little disturbing.
