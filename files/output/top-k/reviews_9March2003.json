In the year 2003, it is the highest grossing and in my mind the best romantic comedy of all time.  The reasons are as follows (some spoilers contained within) (1) Nia Vardalos is a great actress and she had the best performance in the film.  She is really funny and really talented. (2) The film is deserving of the Original Screenplay Oscar it received.  The screenplay was tightly written and one can tell that much love and toil went into putting it together. (3) The introduction was one of the funniest I have ever seen.  Nia Vardalos pulled the right notes of sarcasm as she introduced each member of her family. (4) Michael Constantine was awesome as the stubborn patriarch. (5) The funniest gag had John Corbett saying something bad in Greek when he was trying to say Thank you. (6) Not only did this film skewer a few of the Greek stereotypes, it skewered a few of the stereotypes concerned with boring American families. (7) Every woman that has ever existed has manipulated some man in their lives and this film shows it exists in other ethnic groups. (8) The film didn't just deal with the marriage of the main character, it also dealt with the spreading of her wings and that was treated correctly. (9) The main message showed a normal-looking woman (who had some body fat on her) looking really good and being pursued by a guy who cared for her by more than just how she looked.  This is the closest that a romantic comedy has come to actually portraying a real romantic relationship in my mind and I don't think it will ever come this close again. (10) This is a rare romantic comedy were that had at least one gay male character and I found that to be a bit refreshing.  It seems that every romantic comedy that I have seen the last five years has that aspect.Overall, I found this to be my favorite romantic comedy of all time mostly because it shyed away from the typical romantic comedy formula.  It also shows that women don't fall into that image that Hollywood has created that has been infested throughout our entire planet.  There is nothing with a woman being herself and maintaining a nice appearance even though she looks far from being a Hollywood starlet.  That is a moral message that should be sent to all young women out there.  I consider My Big Fat Greek Wedding to be the new standard that all new romantic comedies should be judged against.  It is royally funny without being too disgusting and slanting into typical Hollywood trappings.  With the ten reasons stated above, this film receives a 10!  Here ends my rant!

I believe that you have to be in a certain state of mind to view a film like this. It isn't something that you just pop in and kick back for. One has to be willing to accept as fact what they are seeing and base it, not on themselves, but what they have come to terms with as being routine and normal. This film is much like the birth cycle. We open with two characters, which then divides into three and finally multiplies into eight. Once all of the characters are set and ready to escape their personal pod of existence a story pushes its way through that is sometimes disgusting to watch but uncharacteristically real. We learnt that maybe Darwin was a bit off when making his theory of evolution. We see that mankind definitely formed from apes, but how much we have evolved is put into serious questioning.  Eight human beings (four males and four females) off all different size, shape and occupation emerge from everyday life for a wild night of clubbing with sex on their minds and drinks on their tabs.  The film opens with a scene of Rick and Jane lying in a bed (clothed). The opening line may simply be the best line to come from a scene like this. Upon awakening Rick asks `do you have any Tylenol baby?' Then enters Sara in a drunken state of self-loathing, bloodied at the face, telling of how she was date raped by Mike. But in the interrogation room Mike's alibi implies that it was consensual sex and Sara was freely open to receive. The first half of the film takes place in the everyday lives of our eight individual minds. It shows us the before effect (labelled here as `foreplay'), the preparation and the journey to the club. The second takes place after the alleged rape. After following the looking into the actual criminal intent of the rape the climax is unlike you would expect from a film of this nature. IT is inconclusive, insignificant even, but this is not a problem for three reasons. First, two people are so drunk that neither of them can remember the full truth of the matter so why should we? Not only should we not know who did it for the simple fact of it would become nothing more than a battle of the sexes film, but would shouldn't even care if it happened or not. Second, the whole idea of the rape is not what this film is about. It is merely a device used by Hollywood writers to show that the film is moving in a forward fashion and does have some bit of story to provide. The final reason is because this film is about a deep yearning inside that some people posses to find a common medium between unconditional sex and unconditional love. . IT is also about alcohol and how it desensitizes us and robs us of our natural ability to decipher between wrong and right. Lastly it is about consumerism. I'm sure people reading this who have already seen the film will think that I am crazy but it really is. The film is not about consumerism in story or method but in the way it is set up. The film runs much like an infomercial. All of the characters talk openly into the camera, realising its presence yet never really feeling the need to acknowledge it, grabbing you attention just long enough to sell you a little slice of their reality and maybe even set you inline with your own. But the question is how can we put such an idealistic price value on sex? Buy me a drink and I will sell you a blowjob, buy me a room and I will sell you my soul. That famous Sprite commercial says `Image is nothing, thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.' That is a great consumer statement but this film wants to counter by asking, what if it is that image you thirst for? All of these men and women have an image and it is that that draws them to each other. They all have a thirst for living like animals, being treated like animals and dying like animals, until one day they can all realise that they have drank their life away. `He hasn't tried to kiss you because he respects you, can't you handle that?' If you haven't guessed it the answer was a big, fat no. That is why these people desire alcohol so much. It is a controlling factor n their lives that feeds their image while lightening up their brain mass. I am willing to bet that for every twenty people that see this film there will be at least one who will view this as a huge waste of time. Their reasoning? That they are nothing like these characters. That in itself would be statement enough for me. For one film to make use of an external source, in this case you, is quite simply a technique we haven't seen since the release of Kids. Because we belong to the `obey your thirst generation' we are to ignorant in ourselves to admit that these people, as trashy as they are, are just like everyone else living on this planet. The ideology is that movies are made to entertain us, but when one hits a little to close to home we are first to dismiss it as unrealistic and unbelievable. Personally I marvelled in truly human these characters are. Being as this is Hollywood and everything must be formulistic the second half throws a bold curveball that sets both the idea of the alcohol controlled universe and the search for more for redemption in love are place into subtext while the idea of date rape takes over. That does not make these two issues any less important though. Alcohol is a cancer that eats away at the mind until nothing is left but the body and all decisions are left up to chance. I think the running theme of the alcohol in this film is that it's funny how people think that they are living the high life when put under its endurance yet what do you really gain from it. Is being raped a contributing factor to your idealistic dream world? What is the point in sex when you aren't even going to remember it the next mourning? Rick on the other hand, in all his drunken splendour, seems to be reaching out for help in Jane. The first scene in the bedroom is truly a great piece of description towards the films entire theme. `Did we do anything last night?' Asks Rick. After hearing the answer no his reply is `good.' `Good, why good?' Asks Jane. `Because I would hope that if we did do something that I would have remembered it.' This film could have taken a turn in the downward direction were it to pit the two groups against each other in a battle of the sexes, which I was praying would not happen in the end. For the most part it wasn't. We are allowed to examine both sides of the sexual coin from the very beginning and the account is surprisingly unbiased. The acting in this film is nothing that will stir up any talk around the table come Oscar time. All of the actors do a good job of making the characters just slimy enough to be believable and just likeable enough to hold the audience. Other than that it is nothing really less than you would expect from an underground film such as this. I must hand it to director Michael Cristofer and writer and David McKenna for the way they did this film came out. Films like this are very hard to do because they often find themselves walking the line between compelling and voyeuristic. Yet this film seems out to challenge the voyeurs of the world. Instead of analyzing the lives of a specific group of characters we seem to be analyzing ourselves, we just don't realize it because it appears in the form of a film. Probably the best film of this nature would be Kids. It thrust us into a day in the life of a group of teens bent on sex, drugs and living a free life. This film is very much like Kids, the scene in which the females are discussing the art of oral sex while getting ready for their night out seems to be taken right out of Kids. Yet it is not copyright infringement rather I felt that we are allowed to see that some people just don't know when to grow up. These people, all on the paths to mature adulthood, are still not content that they are all grown up and that my friends is a scary thought.

This film could have taken a turn in the downward direction were it to pit the two groups against each other in a battle of the sexes, which I was praying would not happen in the end. For the most part it wasn't. We are allowed to examine both sides of the sexual coin from the very beginning and the account is surprisingly unbiased. The acting in this film is nothing that will stir up any talk around the table come Oscar time. All of the actors do a good job of making the characters just slimy enough to be believable and just likeable enough to hold the audience. Other than that it is nothing really less than you would expect from an underground film such as this. I must hand it to director Michael Cristofer and writer and David McKenna for the way they did this film came out. Films like this are very hard to do because they often find themselves walking the line between compelling and voyeuristic. Yet this film seems out to challenge the voyeurs of the world. Instead of analyzing the lives of a specific group of characters we seem to be analyzing ourselves, we just don't realize it because it appears in the form of a film. Probably the best film of this nature would be Kids. It thrust us into a day in the life of a group of teens bent on sex, drugs and living a free life. This film is very much like Kids, the scene in which the females are discussing the art of oral sex while getting ready for their night out seems to be taken right out of Kids. Yet it is not copyright infringement rather I felt that we are allowed to see that some people just don't know when to grow up. These people, all on the paths to mature adulthood, are still not content that they are all grown up and that my friends is a scary thought.

That's why the raunchy `Austin Powers International Man of Mystery' was so popular upon its release. It accomplished its mission of successfully spoofing the James Bond phenomenon in almost every way. The two sequels didn't do quite as well, but I was quite pleased with the second film, especially.`Saturday Night Live' veteran Mike Myers plays Austin Powers, a groovy British spy in the swingin' sixties. 1967, to be exact. His looks resemble the orangutan-meets-human look that British are stereotyped with, and his clothes are fresh outta' 60's London.Mike Myers also plays Dr. Evil, Powers' arch-nemesis. After tracing Dr. Evil to the Psychedelic Pussycat club in London, Evil gets away in a Big Boy rocket and blasts into outer space, where he circles the world for thirty years, frozen with his cat.Myers 1 - err, Austin Powers - is cryogenically frozen immediately, to be thawed out upon return of Dr. Evil.Well, the thirty years pass, and eventually Dr. Evil returns to earth, with Mr. Bigglesworth, his cat. Number 2 (Robert Wagner), his evil assistant, fills him in on what has happened over the years, and soon Evil is planning another `Highjack some nuclear warheads and hold the world ransom' bit.Austin is thawed out and sent to find and defeat Evil, along with the monkey-eared Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).`Austin Powers' has its hit and misses, but comes off with mostly hits. It is probably the best spy spoof to emerge out of Hollywood for years. One of the most interesting aspects is that it does not spoof James Bond film as openly as one might expect- there are tiny, minute details that you only pick up on after multiple viewing. I really expected every other gag to be a satire on Bond films, but alas! They were not! Yes, the film is a spoof on Bond, but not to a sick extreme. Just minute things that audiences may - or may not - pick up on, depending on how knowledgeable they are on the Bond movies.Powers is, of course, a spoof on James Bond. He's sex-obsessed like Bond, but does not come across with the same coolness and ease of James Bond. At least not in the nineties, anyway.Dr. Evil is a spoof on Blofield, Bond's arch-nemesis from the Bond films. He is shrouded in mystery and when revealed boasts a bald head, a big, crooked nose, and a cat like Blofield's which is unfortunately naked - without fur - because it didn't thaw out so well in the Big Boy rocket.Number 2 is a spoof on.well.Number 2 from `Thunderball' - from the name to the eye patch, which I only picked up on after viewing `Thunderball' recently.There are some very clever scenes in `Austin Powers.' Some of the gags spoof the spy genre very easily. Others fall flat, mainly because they try to get the audience to be sickened. Yes, the film needs to be raunchy to a certain degree - it is a Bond spoof - but they went a bit OTT on some of the jokes (the whole Jacuzzi scene got a bit prolonged.).Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is that it is not directly geared towards Bond geeks. We've seen satires that were targeted at a small audience range - like `Galaxy Quest.' I really disliked the film the first time I saw it because I do not watch `Star Trek' - but on second viewing I found it to be a clever satire on the Trekkies and equally so on the television show. I guess if I saw the film I would have enjoyed it more the first - and probably second - time. It was a good comedy, but if they had not geared it towards such a small range of audience, I feel they would have received more of a response to the film.But the exact opposite is the case with `Powers.' Bond geeks and regular moviegoers alike can enjoy this film. It brings two very different audiences together - they may laugh at different things, but they are still laughing together.Perhaps that is the film's biggest achievement. Sadly, it is its most overlooked, as well. I think that many people don't really understand WHY they like the film so much. I've heard people say, `Why do you like the film so much?' and the other person will say, `Well.umm.gee, I just do.' They themselves know the jokes are not always the greatest. Many of the gags DO fall short.But deep down they know that the cleverness of the film is what makes them like it so much - and they are either subconsciously afraid to admit that, or literally don't know how to.Be warned, `Powers' is not a film for everyone. If you don't like raunchy laughs, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you want to see a clever parody of the spy genre - well, I might as well say it a clever parody of the James Bond genre (let's face it - there's no such thing as a spy genre anymore - James Bond has its own genre) - then I would recommend `Powers.' `Austin Powers.'4\/5 stars -John Ulmer  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 March 2003","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":"  Austin Powers International Man of Mystery - Some Minor SpoilersSpy spoofs usually amount to zip.

His first time behind the camera shows that he is also a restrained director - and a very good one. He has an instinct of how to set up a scene, where to put the camera, how to light the location and coach the actors.

Here again Paxton proves he's a sensitive director - by not showing the atrocities in gruesome close-ups but rather the reactions of the kids, which is more horrifying than blood and gore all over the floor. The psychological side is also well taken care of. Though Fenton, the elder son, rejects his Dad's deeds more and more, he's reluctant to leaving his home or report Dad to the police.

These were the good news (about the quality of the film - not child abuse!) Sadly, what could have been a brilliant film about a deranged serial-killer and how he manipulated his children into becoming accomplices in the end turned into an extremely right-wing religious dream-come-true. Dad was right after all and Fenton indeed a demon who later became a serial-killer, only to be stopped by his younger brother Adam who carried on Dad's work. Why didn't he stop him earlier? His name was not on my list. Nice to know that one might be killed by a maniac simply because his name wasn't on God's list at the time. So, what else does this twist ending tell us?

I forced myself to watch again, this time to document the many obvious problems with this movie.  It is beyond belief to me that this movie is generally considered to be the best of the ten Trek films, and I want to take a moment to dispute that claim.  Some of these issues have been addressed before, in discussions raised here and elsewhere.  I apologize for the repetition, but I choose to include them because I want this to be a complete summary1) I never forget a face, says Khan to Chekov.  And, yet, in Space Seed Khan never saw Chekov.  The argument is sometimes advanced that we can assume it happened off-camera.  You may advance; I will not accept.  We either have canon, or we don't.  If we do, let the rules be applied equally to all Trek.  If it ain't on camera, it never happened.  Khan never saw Chekov2) When Chekov realizes the danger he and Terrell are in, he dons his helmet and leaves the cargo hold.  Uh, whatever happened to emergency beamout? He should have been reaching for a communicator.  If we are expected to believe these people are Starfleet personnel, they might act like it once in awhile.3) Other transporter issues  Kirk and Company board the Enterprise for the Admiral's inspection via a shuttlecraft instead of using a transporter? Obviously, so we can get the beautiful panorama of the Enterprise in space dock. I thought it was bad form for movies to so transparently speak to their audiences, even non-verbally, and this isn't the only such problem I saw.4) In the Mutaran nebula, shields and sensors are inoperative, and visibility is almost zero.  Yet, we, the audience, can see every movement of the two ships with crystal clarity?  Uh, hunh ..5) Other problems with the Mutaran nebula special effects  in one of the scenes there was a vortex, a rather poorly visualized one at that.  We are supposed to believe this is a black hole, apparently.  I doubt we know, at this point, what's inside a nebula, but in my view, a vortex is a pretty poor guess.6) In another Mutaran nebula visual, this gossamer filament kinda just hangs there.  Would have been nice to have that filament be between us and one of the ships.  It would have been more effective in persuading me the two ships were actually inside a nebula.  As is, the Mutaran nebula sequence here presents no better than the special effects in ST V.7) In the space dock departure sequence, Saavik engages the maneuvering thrusters, and then orders the ship to one quarter impulse?   I've heard of a lead foot, but this is ridiculous.  I noticed the movie had a science advisor, a Dr. Richard Green.  He must have been sleeping here.  No one else appears to have a clue here as well.8) Revenge is a dish best served cold, says Khan at one point.  How does Khan know Klingon proverbs?  He's been in suspended animation for 200 years, and then marooned on a lifeless planet for the last fifteen.9) Speaking of that planet, Khan says at one point that it has only one indigenous life form  What did that creature live on, love and air? What did the crew of the Botany Bay live on for fifteen years?   We can assume the BB grew food in hydroponic gardens, or recycled their own waste, or something ..but no animal life survives without food, and this creature didn't have any.10) Khan says also that Ceti Alpha *6* exploded.  There is no doubt here Ceti Alpha *Six*  Yet Chekov and Terrell beam down to Ceti Alpha 5 thinking it was 6. Shouldn't they have beamed down to Ceti Alpha *7*?11) Khan never forgets a face, but Chekov cannot seem to remember what happened to the Botany Bay in time to warn his captain about Khan?  Yes, he thinks Khan is on the next planet over, if he remembers him at all.  Yet, the reaction when he realizes his danger, suggests to me that he should have remembered before the beamdown, and said something12) Khan refers to my beloved wife at one point, which statement seems out of character.  The only thing beloved by Khan was Khan.13) The Enterprise is sent to investigate the Regula space station with a crew of trainees, because Kirk says it is the only ship in the quadrant. Oh, really?  Should have been the only ship in the sector, or the ship capable of reaching Regula the quickest, or something.  This is sloppy.14) There are technobabble labels throughout the Regula space station. Two I caught were synthostasis which is meaningless, and thermonics  They might have meant thermionics, which is unlikely.  Perhaps, they meant thermotics.  In any case, here is at least the third example where the Science Advisor or Production Staff had no clue.15) That brings to mind some of the other images of rheostats turning and buttons being pushed and switches being thrown.  TNG's tactile instrumentality makes this stuff look hopelessly crude.16) The relationship with Carol Marcus was never mentioned on TOS.  I vacillate on whether I believe the two were married, but that relationship is by far the most committed, fulfilling, and evolved of Kirk's life. It's inconceivable that it was never mentioned.  I'm aware, of course, that it never existed in TOS. Which knowledge makes it hard for me to accept seeing it here.  Although I will say that the emotional subcontext dramatized here between Kirk and Marcus is enough to put to rest forever any claims among slashers that he is gay..17) I had claimed elsewhere that the Genesis device was a big, overgrown ray gun, a contrived sci-fi element as old as the genre.  It is not.  It is a wave generating device, and if the visuals at the end of TWOK are to be believed, an omni-directional one of fixed range. Yet in its first use in the movie it appears to be a projectile.  Which is it?  If it's a wave, there are problems with the wave pattern generated, for that pattern appears to spread as range from the source increases. Meaning, it is impossible to use because any user winds up like Khan, or it spreads so quickly, it is inconceivable it could be still effective over any range as small as say the distance between earth and the moon.18) More discussion about transporters.  Saavik used the transporter on the Regula station.  How did she get to the cavern below-ground?  We can assume an auto-beamout or a timed beamout, but this should have been addressed.19) In one scene, someone aboard the Enterprise asks them to provide coordinates for beamout.  The Enterprise had the coordinates, or could get them by locking on to the communicators.   I would be interested in knowing, too, how it is even possible for a landing party to furnish beamout coordinates.  The Enterprise could use sensors to detect them and calibrate from sensor readings, placing them in a position relative to their surroundings.  The landing party could provide their position with respect to the Enterprise, or the Enterprise's position with respect to them, but this would be of no use for transport.  Yet another case of science advisor asleep at the switch.20) In the cat and mouse game at Regula, Scott says that auxiliary power is restored, but that they have barely enough for transporters. Transporters are rather low energy systems.  This does not compute.21) I've discussed the death of Spock at length, saying it was unbelievable because of story-external knowlege, namely, Nimoy posturing that he doesn't want to do Trek anymore.  It has other problems Kirk pushes a crewman out of the way to get to the ladder to go to the chamber where Spock is dying. I guess this was to show his haste, and that he considered it important. I thought it was cheap, gratuitous, and unnecessary.22) In Spock's dying soliloquy, he mentions that he never took the Kobiyashi Maru test.  However, he did graduate from Starfleet, and all Starfleet cadets are required to take the test.   Maybe, he was sick that day.  Or, skipped class.24) Minor quibbles.  I didn't like the music, the credits font was mediocre, to be kind, and Spock looked like my great-great gandmother in the dress he wore in the meditation sequence in his quarters.Final thoughts  if TWOK is the best of the Trek movies with all of these problems, then the others are sad, indeed, and we deserve the disdain of non-Trek folks for liking them.  Rather more likely, it is not the best of the Treks.  I do not see how given these manifest problems that anyone can say otherwise.However, this was Shatner's and Montalban's movie from the start, a sci-fi version of Moby Dick.  Montalban tries; he really does, but his lines are so lame, not even he can save them.  Shatner, OTOH, was brilliant.  I can't think of a single scene in this movie I liked without him in it. He deserved an Oscar for this performance, and the only contribution this movie made to the preservation of the franchise was that performance.

Would he have made this film if he had known that it would be his last? With the master's name not in the credits, Eyes Wide Shut might have been an interesting art house effort, perhaps by a young director with a definite eye, and a future. Quite possibly, Nicole and Tom would still have been in the cast, perhaps working for scale and some points, for the fun of being in such a production, as both actors possess discernible integrity. But Eyes Wide Shut was a Kubrick, and I came away with a clear sense that this great artist of the cinema had possibly been running on fumes while directing it. Despite the seductive beauty of many of its set pieces, the film overall seemed to be walking under water. But Kubrick out of breath is still Kubrick and he still managed to give us an often fascinating piece of work, one that dripped the dark juices of life that he may have sensed were, for him, finally drying up.Although the aforementioned integrity is a good thing in any artist, that quality alone may not always be enough. An actor must still be right for the role and when Tom Cruise is wrong, no one is wrong quite like him. But this seldom, if ever, has anything to do with his skill as an actor. Like Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, or Clint Eastwood, Tom Cruise is a Movie Star and movie stars have indelible personalities that percolate up through every role. In Mr. Cruise's case, it's the shrewd, early post-adolescent we first encountered in Risky Business. Regardless of how sophisticated his subsequent characters have been, this personality has always been there and is something that Mr. Cruise will simply have to outgrow. As he seems to be aging gracefully, it may take a while.While brilliant in Born on the Fourth of July, Rain Man, and Jerry McGuire, where his core adolescence was perfect, in Eyes Wide Shut, he's a college boy playing doctor in a tent-like white coat. In the first Mission Impossible, when Cruise's whizbang Ethan Hunt told Ving Rhames' Luther that `We're GOING to do it', referring to the planned burglary at CIA Langley, he simply came off like a frat boy planning to heist the Phi Delt bell. In that film, as in Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise never really acted badly. He was just wrong for the roles. In Eyes, during the orgy scene, when the spectacular courtesan under black feathers asks Dr. Bill (Cruise) what he thinks he is doing, the veracity of the question resonates on several levels. Nicole Kidman, a humanoid blend of fox and white-tailed deer, was almost equally unconvincing as his wife. I tried, but could not buy into this glittering and now-sundered couple. Lesser-known actors of the same age would have brought more authenticity, but both roles really called out for more mature actors with more cerebral styles. The Cruise-Kidman duet were never able to gain sufficient distance from their real selves because their character-set, a young fairy-tale couple, was too much like we perceive them in real life. The real Tom Cruise would never be seen ricocheting off a homophobic boy on a late-night city sidewalk, yet there he was, despite the Dr. Bill disguise. Given this, no matter how hard the pair tried, or over-acted, I could never escape the feeling that both were often faxing it in. Thomas Gibson, the briefly-visible, young college professor, would actually have made a more believable Dr. Bill. Eyes Wide Shut is a dark film and the sparkly Mr. And Mrs. Cruise simply shed too much of the wrong sort of light on it.But not all of this film's casting choices were mistakes. The supporting cast took very good care of business, some of whom seemed to be poking their heads into the film from a parallel universe, even if given just a few lines, like Carmela Marner's smart waitress. Sidney Pollack was a great save when Harvey Keitel, due to scheduling conflicts, was unable to finish out as Victor Ziegler. Todd Field's Nick Nightingale worked beautifully. But the real coup d'etat was Vinessa Shaw's hooker, and walking billboard for the legalization of prostitution, Domino, who stepped out of the film's urbane murk and owned everything. Her scene is my absolute favorite. You don't want to merely bang a lady of such sweet and intelligent self-possession. You want to get her off the street, buy her a drink, and just watch her talk. She has everyone's number. Resistance is futile.We will probably never know what Kubrick (David Lean's evil twin) really wanted to accomplish with Eyes Wide Shut (the title was probably borrowed from dialog in the superlative BBC production of John LeCarre's Smiley's People Connie Sachs to Smiley during their great scene; Kubrick certainly would have seen it); We do know that it was messed with (Gee, isn't that surprising). Director's Cut, please, asap. I'm just sorry he's gone. We won't get to see him bounce back and pull off something brilliant ever again. What must it have been like to be him and be so burdened by the relentless expectations of so many after the monumental 2001 A Space Odyssey? I think he handled it. If you doubt him, or me, just watch his The Shining then follow it up with the not-bad TV version. There you will have the explicit and implicit difference between art and artifice.

(6) The Brits and The Americans fighting amongst themselves showed that cultural differences will breed a bunch of dissent and angst in situations where survival is at stake. (7) Amongst the Brits, differing views of survival were seen. Seven reasons gives a score of seven.The downers in the film were (1) Matthew McConaughey as the tooth and nail American commander. He doesn't strike me as the tooth and nail type (watch The Wedding Planner and you'll understand). (2) The Americans are portrayed as if they are a bunch of marauders. Stereotyping anything sucks and it should be stopped. (3) The story had gaping plot holes and lots of tedious dialogue. The writing overall was lacking in many spots. Overall, this is a film that feels like cheesecloth. Watch it if you want to kill some brain cells but I suggest many other titles. Here ends my rant!

I recommend it only if you want to kill some time and brain cells in the process. Here are the reasons (spoilers herein) (1) The computer generated dragons are pretty neat. (2) Christian Bale did pretty good as the main scarred survivor. (3) The scene with the dragon attacking the castle was very poetic.

It's a mystery, alright, and there is a murder;  but, they're ancillary to the film.  If there is a puzzle, it's the question of how the British nobility managed to survive as long as they did on their cachet of social prestige, why their indolence, concupiscence, social isolation, and wanton self-destructiveness didn't drive them to extinction, like the Romanoffs, long ago.  Both the servants and the nobility hate each other.  A valet describes Lady McCordle as a `snobbish cow, completely `useless.'  Another valet ridicules his master as thinking that he's `God almighty,' to which a maid replies, `They all do.'  The upstairs nobility are all hopelessly incompetent;  for example, when the butler demands the whereabouts of a guest from his valet, the valet replies  `I washed him and I dressed him and if he can't find his way to the drawing room, it's not my fault.'  The upper classes are viewed as `pathetic.'  The nobility, on the other hand, though they use their servants as sex toys and as their personal conduits of gossip, treat their servants as if they were burdens to be borne.  Lady Trentham is typical  in the process of `breaking in' a new maid,' she acts as though she's bearing Christ's own crucifix.  She exclaims, `There's nothing more exhausting, Is there?'  So the real mystery of the movie is why the system moved along as smoothly as it did in the face of all the glaring inconsistencies and injustices.  Altman doesn't hit you over the head with an answer, but does suggest some clues;  for example, in many ways, servants and masters are very similar.  We see the social stratification amongst the servants themselves, and their love, like their masters, of humiliating others.  We see the upper classes feeding off the human warmth of the lower, the lower classes feeding off the social prestige of the upper.  The upper and the lower classes use each other.  It's a false empowerment, but an empowerment just the same. Just the same, the mystery goes unanswered when the movie is over, forcing you, the viewer, to puzzle it out for yourself.
