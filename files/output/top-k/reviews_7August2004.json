His name did not ring any bell to me. Later, I realized how far away I had stayed from cinema. Of course I recalled his movie A Reversal of Fortune. Then, it came to my memory, his name, when I related it to Cahier du Cinema and I went back to my cinema days. When I saw the titles, I though about the movie Frida. How could a guy with the such a name dares to go to Colombia to make a movie? What does he know about the Colombian reality? Does he really understand Spanish? Does he really understand the little things we convey in our conversation? Is this another movie made by foreigners about a reality far from Hollywood? Will the dialogue be a mixture between English and Spanish, with every sentence ending in panzon? I watched the movie five times. The first time, I did it three times in a row. Then one, and then another one to check some technicalities.Bravo Mr. Schroeder. Now I now who you are. Your name is real to me. The movie is a magnificent piece of art. It proves that success, craftsmanship and artful direction have nothing to do with Hollywood.Iwas very much impressed by Mr. Schoedrer's familiarity with Colombia, and particularly Medellin. His understanding of our culture, way of life, anguish and hope, are unrivalled. I think that the fact that he decided to cast completely unknown people and to work with a totally local crew was an utterly rebellious move, contrary to the established cannon (excellent director+a lot of money+ two beautiful faces=success). He proved many critics wrong. Moreover, I think, he initiated a new era for Colombian Cinema.The acting is stellar. Fernando (knowing how things are in Colombia) is superb (His diatribes against Bolivar, are just poignant; his discourse stating that it is God whom actually needs us was just from the bag of tricks; Fernando demeanor is just, purely Colombian. It is the reflexive posture of the ones who do not know how to handle their daily lives in Macondo.) The kids are genuine and real. (For them, life becomes a serious business when they are unable to apply themselves to read or to undertake other pursuits). The lady waitress reminded me that in Colombia any adult two years older than we are, is un viejo...(The same happened with the female beggar on the street.) The locations...reminded me of olor de guayava.. and the guaro in Calle Guayaquil. I think Mr. Schroeder was simply irreverent ( Hats off for him). Only a Colombian Director (as he is now referred at to by the international critics)could make a movie in such conditions, speed, techniques and again.. with a local crew.I wish Mr. Schroeder could decide to go once again to Colombia to make us look ourselves in the our very own contradictory warped mirror. He captured Colombia as it is noisy, conflictive, chaotic, lovely, hermosa y misteriosa. His take at the morgue was a compelling one for me for two reasons He goes through three different dimensions with Fernando until he finds Wilmar's body. What caught my attention was the fact that when the other people are looking at the pictures, statistically' there is a disproportionately number of black people death, yet, they are nowhere to be seen in the different locations in the movie. As an Afro-Colombian, I think, it is about time to portray us more positively and more widely in all aspects of the Colombian Art. After all, we are Colombians too!!.Excellent Movie. Excellent Crew.

High schools show too many, on subjects like the life cycle of the loggerhead turtle. I see people snoozing at the thought of yet another educational non-fiction film.Well, I guess there was a period when they carried a bit more chic than in recent years. Flaherty made some money. And Mondo Cane, of course, if that was a documentary.But the whole field seems to have been revolutionized lately by Ken Burns and Errol Morris, the former with The Civil War series on PBS and the latter with this film. Morris had made an earlier movie, mostly about an animal cemetery, but the subject seems to have had limited popular appeal.The Thin Blue Line however is about the shooting death of a police officer and the subsequent conviction, imprisonment, and death sentence of an innocent man.The movie really IS innovative. There is no narration, for one thing. For another, the talking heads we see aren't labeled at the bottom of the screen -- Chester Smith, Accountant at Robbin, Cheatham, and Frisk Law Firm. Instead, Morris shows us close ups of newspaper clippings and other printed materials which just happen to mention the name of the person we are about to be introduced to. It's a small thing, true, but I can't recall the device's ever having been used before. It's unobtrusive and effective. (That's the sort of thing I mean when I call this film innovative.) The events are restaged and presented again and again from different points of view, the whole being carefully constructed, like a jigsaw puzzle, but a jigsaw puzzle for children, easy to comprehend. And it's easy to see why Morris latched on to this topic. Not only is it interesting per se, an investigation into the justice system in Texas, in which almost all the authority figures seem intent on extinguishing forfeited lives, but the actual performers we see on screen are remarkably at ease in the presence of the camera. They smile conspiratorially, practically winking at the camera. They look dramatically towards heaven and say things like, It's crazy. But all in a pleasant Texas drawl. Nobody gets excited. Nobody breaks down and sobs. (There's innovation for you!) Nobody get angry and shouts at the camera. It's all very smooth.But although the performances are good, they are still performances. No one seems to admit having made a mistake. Everyone enters his house justified. Randall Adams, the innocent guy who was railroaded into the slams because he was 28 years old and could therefore be given the death penalty, has been in jail long enough to know what he's about when he presents his case. He has a practiced, wounded appearance and manner, although he describes his experiences as if they happened to somebody else. You pick up things in jail, along with the tattoos. David Harris, the actual perp, smiles and shrugs disarmingly, and he keeps saying I guess and whatever. As cool as an ice cube in Sweetwater. He is, in fact, a textbook-perfect example of what used to be called a psychopath. He's pleasant looking, charming, and utterly without any conscience.In some ways the most interesting character is the spaced-out blonde who claims to have eyewitnessed the killing and identifies Adams as the murderer in court. She's the most interesting because her motives are the most obscure. Everyone else's goals are clear. Adams wants to save his neck. The prosecutor wants another conviction. But this babe is really something.She's constructed an old TV detective program with herself as the central figure.Two additional points. One is that the psychiatrist known as Doctor Death spent only 15 minutes with Adams in prison before testifying that Adams was an incurable murderer. I'm laughing as I write this. Anyway, Dr. Death gave Adams two tests. The first, which Adams describes as a lot of circles and squiggly lines, is the Bender Gestalt Test which was originally designed to measure brain damage. In the second part of the examination, Adams is asked to explain the meaning of a couple of adages. A rolling stone gathers no moss, for example. It used to be thought that schizophrenics were given to concrete thinking and that they had trouble reasoning abstractly enough to interpret these old sayings. It's not used anymore. One thing always bothered me about it anyway. One of the items is A new broom sweeps clean, and I could never figure out EXACTLY what that was supposed to mean.The second point is that Adams was given a new trial and released after this film was shown. In other words, Errol Morris saved Randall Adam's life, which would otherwise have been spent in prison. So what does Adams do after he's out of prison? He sues Errol Morris for having taken advantage of him! In TV interviews explaining his suit, Adams uses exactly the same bewildered expressions and gestures of helplessness that he does in this film. At least those eleven years weren't a complete waste of time because he obviously learned something, or whatever.

This orphan has no knowledge of her royal heritage. The film chronicles her attempts to find her true family, hindered by an undead enemy of the family, Rasputin. Enter a couple of con men intent on collecting the reward for the finding of the Duchess, and you have a ray of hope for the princess. Needless to say, one of the men is Dimitri, a young man who inevitably falls in love with the princess.The animation is spectacular, creating a classical feel that has been absent for a long time, but has never left Don Bluth's films over twenty years. The introduction of 3D animation for props and effects is more of a curse than a blessing, since the technology isn't advanced enough to achieve believabilty. Add to that superimposition that looks pasted terrible when a character handles a CG object, and the result is a film that isn't so visually ravishing as the purely traditional ways of past Bluth films. The story is based on a true story, but is completely distorted to create a happy ending. The filmmakers may not have had much choice, since the amazingly successful Disney films never end in tears. Contradicting this is the outstanding quality of Bluth's older 'All Dogs Go to Heaven', which features an ending anything but happy.Despite this, most of the film is particularly anti-Disney. It's characteristically dark, dull and in places frightening. The contrasts are stark but fitting, as Anastasia dreams of a heavenly time with her family, whilst a cut to reality shows her in a precarious position on a ship in a storm. This is spectacularly successful, pulling off the same atompshere and feel as Chernabog from 'Fantasia', so incredibly long ago. Somehow, this 'Anastasia' sequence is even more frightening than the 'Fantasia' finale, since Anya's family's smiling faces have an eerie, menacing quality behind them, although the actul expressions are perfectly joyous and welcoming. Somehow, the atmosphere tells you *Don't believe them. Don't go any closer*. 'Anastasia' is another film undoubtedly destined to be a classic, a throwback to the glory days of Bluth animation, those first four films 'The Secret of NIMH', 'An American Tail', 'The Land Before Time' and 'All Dogs Go to Heaven'. The inbetweens may be high quality, but the Bluth cartoon reached its zenith in the eighties. Let's hope for more of the same.

Add to that superimposition that looks pasted terrible when a character handles a CG object, and the result is a film that isn't so visually ravishing as the purely traditional ways of past Bluth films. The story is based on a true story, but is completely distorted to create a happy ending. The filmmakers may not have had much choice, since the amazingly successful Disney films never end in tears. Contradicting this is the outstanding quality of Bluth's older 'All Dogs Go to Heaven', which features an ending anything but happy.Despite this, most of the film is particularly anti-Disney. It's characteristically dark, dull and in places frightening. The contrasts are stark but fitting, as Anastasia dreams of a heavenly time with her family, whilst a cut to reality shows her in a precarious position on a ship in a storm. This is spectacularly successful, pulling off the same atompshere and feel as Chernabog from 'Fantasia', so incredibly long ago. Somehow, this 'Anastasia' sequence is even more frightening than the 'Fantasia' finale, since Anya's family's smiling faces have an eerie, menacing quality behind them, although the actul expressions are perfectly joyous and welcoming. Somehow, the atmosphere tells you *Don't believe them. Don't go any closer*. 'Anastasia' is another film undoubtedly destined to be a classic, a throwback to the glory days of Bluth animation, those first four films 'The Secret of NIMH', 'An American Tail', 'The Land Before Time' and 'All Dogs Go to Heaven'. The inbetweens may be high quality, but the Bluth cartoon reached its zenith in the eighties. Let's hope for more of the same.

I'm unclear how the other reviewers found it to be a great horror film. Linda Blair's transformation from a sweet, little girl to a ridiculous demon isn't frightening because it's too inane.

I do like Dennis Hopper but when I think of his great performances, this is right at the bottom as I just found him very irritating and like he was trying to act stoned really badly.   I know  he was stoned during filming as was Fonda and Nicholson but I found this did nothing for Hopper at all.  When I think of Dennis Hopper I think of Blue Velvet, Apocalypse Now and True Romance.  The best part of the entire film was just them riding their bikes and conversations between Nicholson and Fonda.   This is the kind of movie that doesn't really go anywhere.  It's a road movie so just expect plenty of travelling and conversation after conversation but that is what makes Easy Rider.  Road movies are a lot of fun to watch as they are stories about finding yourself and coming up against obstacle after obstacle.   A lot has been taken from Easy Rider since it was made.  Taken that this film brought Hollywood to attention of the likes of Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson.It was an intriguing film but it just doesn't hit you in the places where you think it should.  I have had argument after argument with people who say this is a landmark film and I think it was only because it was wanna of the first road movies of it's time and it came out in the late 60' when all most 20 something Americans only wanted to watch it, but if this was made in the 80's where the 60's and 70's seemed like a long distance memory then it would not have had the impact that everyone believes it deserves.   Trust me if you want to see films about LSD or Road movies then stick to films like Badlands, Performance ( Great Film starring Mick Jagger about a gangster hiding out in a hippie commune) and Wild At Heart who people say isn't a road movie but it certainly feels like one when watching it.   I'm not saying to avoid Easy Rider, watch it and try and see if the impact which it apparently has makes it onto you, because it is an interesting film to watch, for me it was interesting because I was trying to spot what was so fantastic about it.  One thing that stands in my mind is about fitting in, as Billy, Wyatt and &#133;. are in the café and are being looked at by a group of men who don't believe in the hippie culture and just glare at them with killing eyes. This is a issue that still carries on about how people do not understand others people cultural differences so that was interesting.   Peter Fonda was great and was Nicholson, Hopper in my opinion was just there and that was it, but then again he was directing the movie so maybe that's why he didn't seem as concentrated on the film as he looked because of his behind the camera moments.Great Soundtrack, flawed in many places, an ending which is pointless and doesn't seem appropriate for this kind of film and basically an overrated film with one or two good points.

The Salkinds were out for total control which in the end resulted in campy pieces of crap like Superman III, Supergirl, Santa Clause the Movie and the Superboy TV series. Of course Supergirl had potential. The cast had a group of reasonably competent actors and Helen Slater was a promising choice. The problem was a trainwreck of a script. There were various details of the story that made absolutely no sense going beyond the suspension of disbelief. The cheaper budget showed especially with a lot of the visual effects like Argo City.The scenes with the model miniatures looked very fake. I remember laughing during the one scene where the flying spaceship looks like a tennis ball. There were scenes such as Supergirl in the alley with the two men that were OK. If only the entire movie had more scenes like that and a story of substance instead of so much camp it might have been more watchable.Faye Dunaway was mildly entertaining as Selena, the sorceress.She was at her campy best uttering plain awful nonsensical lines in a performance almost as over the top as her camp classic Mommie Dearest. Brenda Viccaro was somewhat amusing as well. The other characters were window dressings and in some cases forgettable. Jimmy Olsen and Lucy Lane were thrown in for good measure but were hardly relevant to the story, but of course there so many problems with the story to begin with.

Christopher Reeve made a smart move by not making a cameo in such insulting drivel but who can blame him after what the Salkinds did with Superman III.

I love Abbott and Costello and I love this film, but at the same time I can't help thinking how far once mighty characters like Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster had fallen. Back in 1931 they dominated the screen and scared the hell of out of people. By 1948, they were straight men to two of Hollywood's most popular film comics.Meet Frankenstein marked the triple swan song of Universal's big 3 monsters Dracula, Frankenstein's creature, and the Wolf Man. The producers scored a coup by casting the original and definitive Dracula, Bela Lugosi, in what was, incredibly only his second and final screen appearance as his most famous character. As The Wolf Man, Lon Chaney Jr. is wonderfully consistent as the tormented Lawrence Talbot, though perhaps in deference to the comedy trappings, his desire to die takes a back seat and he actually takes on the air of the hero, even as his monsterous alter ego. (The fact he was cured in the previous monster film, House of Dracula, is conveniently ignored; maybe he had a relapse). Glenn Strange meets Boris Karloff's record by making his third appearance as the Monster. Sadly, once again he never really gets a chance to do much with the role. The pattern of his previous two appearances continues he spends most of the film comatose, only to come to life in the last few minutes. He does, however, get a few lines of dialogue - the first time the creature has spoken since Ghost of Frankenstein.The supporting cast are basically just there. A pair of duelling femme fatales make nice eye candy, but otherwise don't make a big impact. Nor does the film's resident good guy scientist.Abbott and Costello are fun, as usual. Abbott gets a bit tiresome with his skepticism, but Costello is in top form. Some have said that A&C's decline began after this film, so it could be said this is in some respects their swan song, too. The same goes for Lugosi, who had already been written off for dead by movie producers by the time this film was made; only obscure b-movies and rock-bottom Ed Wood features lay ahead of him. Likewise Chaney's career never really prospered away from the Wolf Man.For fans of the monsters, this is a delight because it pokes fun at most of the conventions and the cliches the Universal series created. It's also worthwhile for film buffs who want to see Lugosi's second performance as the Count. But it's a shame that the beloved trio of monsters never got a chance for a serious, scary send off.

The Doom Generation is a lot like the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey; it makes no sense and comes out of nowhere. It's just suddenly, SPACE BABY! Only, the Doom Generation does not have the benefit of the good director, script, and acting that 2001 had. Nor does the Doom Generation have the benefit of having any part of it even resembling good. I think the best way to summarize the Doom Generation is to say that absolutely anything can happen. And I literally mean that. After the first half hour, if a dinosaur came on screen and ate someone, Rose McGowan would have made a nonsensical comment involving the F-word and the audience would have to think to themselves, Oh, right. Dinosaurs. They eat people. Films like this prey on the weak minded. Just because a movie is abrasive does not mean that it is worthy of being hip. I guess I'm trying to say that if you show this movie to someone else, you are a sociopath.

This movie used to make me really scared when i was a kid but I still loved it back then too. Jaws represents fear to all human beings and I believe deep down everyone is afraid of Great White Sharks. Steven Spielberg did a great job on this film considering it was like his first ever. The acting is great too even though I hate Hooper. Jaws 2 is pretty good too but nothing beats the original. Jaws was the first movie in history to make over 100 million at the box office and it shattered the record by getting 260 million! It was the original Summer blockbuster and it is still great to this day!

I first saw it 5 years ago when I rented it.  I loved it and immediately rented the two sequels the next day.  I watch this film every Halloween.Poltergeist tells the story of a family whose house is invaded by ghosts.  These ghosts called  poltergeist kidnap the family's younger daughter Carol Ann(Heather O'Rourke). There are many good scenes in this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when the closet in the younger children's room opens due to the poltergeist. Then the closet starts sucking in everything in the room, including the kids. This scene scared me the first time I saw it. Another really scary scene is when the clown starts strangling the son Robbie. Overall I love this movie and I give it 10\/10 stars.

It was reintroduced to me several times through out my life. Every time i watched the film it got more and more scary. Images from the film must of gotten embedded in my subconscious because i've had nightmares centering around the subject of possession. The film was one of the first films that were actually better than the book. The murder of the director is not seen yet creates a very strong image of what must have occurred in Regan's bed room. I am 31 years old now and i refuse to watch this film alone at night. I made the mistake of watching the movie with friends while house sitting and staying in the basement only to have my friends leave me to face my room alone, i was 24 then and it SUCKED. This subject is very real and very scary.  ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I saw this movie when i was very young.
