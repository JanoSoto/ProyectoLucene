I used to put this film on every time I was coming down from speed. Id think about how different heroin and Meth are, yet how similar the things it would cause to fall apart in your life. Heh. As A drug addict I related very much to Renton in the film. He knew it was bad, but he didn't care, and neither did I. 4 years clean now.. I've seen the film a few times sober, and its still an excellent film. I'm glad I wasn't just in a drug-haze and thought the film was good. If you've ever been an addict, you'll love this film. If you've never been an addict, well you might like it anyways if you enjoy a good film. Trust me, this film doesn't promote drug use at all. If anything it shows you what its like to be a drug addict. It is a movie, so there's always gonna be some stuff that is obviously strictly movie stuff. However the dirty grimy, straight up nature of this film and the way it portrays drug culture is pretty accurate. Hell I even love the big drug deal at the end, I always had friends (myself included) trying to get that big score that was gonna make you rich. People always think they are the shite too, but I love how Renton sums it up when he says the buyer knew they were just some dumb fools who got lucky. Because chances are if you ever meet one of these fools trying to get that big score thats the only way they are ever gonna get it. Dumb Luck.

This is a movie that is so funny, that it never loses it's ability to make you lose control of your motor functions, even after the 15th viewing.Bob Wiley (Bill Murray) is a lovable, but deeply troubled man who has probably the biggest multi-phobic personality you could imagine. He also has a habit of getting really attached to people within the first few minutes of meeting them, and it's heavily implied that he's driven multiple therapists out of business due to his annoying dependency. And the successful therapist\/best-selling author Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) is about to be the next victim. After his first interview with Dr. Marvin, Bob is immediately attached, and is worried when the doctor leaves for a month long family vacation, preparing for a promotional interview on Good Morning America. Bob cleverly tracks down Dr. Marvin at his lake house, and instantly becomes good friends with the rest of the family, while the doctor doesn't approve. Bob soon becomes a house guest who acts like a part of the family, and is 100% oblivious to Dr. Marvin's sinister hatred of him...Totally brilliant premise, that is very well executed. I still do think the ending, while still funny, could have used some work. Bill Murray is at his absolute best here. He's such an over-the-top, yet believable character, who you just wouldn't be able to resist how friendly he is. Richard Dreyfuss is in my opinion the funnier of the two. His facial expressions just scream repressed rage, and his loss of sanity, slowly occurring throughout the movie, is perfectly timed. You barely notice his personality change. It just happens. One minute, he seems like the ideal therapist, but before you even realize it, he's a sinister maniac, who now requires more therapy than Bob. Bob on the other hand, goes the opposite way. By driving him crazy, he unwittingly manages to become saner, and conquer many of his fears. And has absolutely no clue how much Dr. Marvin hates him, even when Dr. Marvin has extreme outbursts at him right. Dr. Marvin couldn't possibly express his annoyance more clearly, and the idea of his rage never crosses Bob's mind once.That is where the movie gets it's humor. Even as he unwittingly humiliates someone on national TV, Bob never loses his charm. The interview scene is in my opinion, one of the all time classic comedy moments, and director Frank Oz just nails it. In the hands of any other filmmaker, the scene could have deteriorated into mindless slapstick. Bob humiliates the subject of the interview just by being Bob. And believe me, he is not someone you would want to be guest interviewing with. It's amazing how funny it can be just by watching a family grow to love someone who the man of the house hates with a passion, and getting mad when the dad acknowledges his annoyance. I highly recommend this laugh-a-minute comedy, and give it 8\/10.It is rated PG for Language, and Thematic Elements. It would easily be rated PG-13 today, even without the language.

You don't need these visual gimmicks to tell a good story.' This struck me halfway through watching Run Lola Run as this eye fest of colour and energy has just about everything you could throw into a film, bar goofy transitions, and it actually works - in a strange way.Everything is thrust into our faces early on. The animated credits sequence, the rather weak attempt at creating some sort of philosophy using the football quote and the visual manipulation of colour as we fast cut from yellow phone boxes to Lola with her red hair and then back to black and white flash-forward's of what might happen to another character all occur within the opening minutes. To this, the animation feels unnecessary and the flash forwards that follow which show what will happen to various people Lola bumps into on her sprint journey are confusing and disorientating; they are not always clear either and some are far too quick. They felt like they were there for comic relief which wasn't good.Another bizarre thing is the principle of the hero; Lola. She's a freak, an out and out freak. She has unnatural red hair, she has lungs the size of God knows, and her scream is, quite literally, 'cracking'. This may detract from the experience, you'd think, but it actually adds to it. We realise this film is different; it's almost 'art-house' with its fast edits and audacious way of telling a story so why not have an abnormal hero in an abnormal film? If she was plain looking, and everything else, would we like her more or less? Probably less.With good scenes throughout, including a tense heist scene and a rather impressive, intimate, bed scene with a message put across through dialogue; Run Lola Run works on more levels than you'd think. The thing is, when the films good, it's great. When it's not good, it's a little sour. The bank scenes trail on when Lola begs for money and a lot of the tragedy is sapped away from the death scenes as they pile up given the multi P.O.V. thing this film has going on.The film isn't bad, in fact despite the things it has wrong with it, it makes up for in energy, pumping music and a wonderful atmosphere of chance throughout along with its ambiguity. These are good things and these principals add up into an entertaining, fun film.

Her first film astonished me, called I've Heard The Mermaids Singing.

Hmm, let's see the problems I have with it.Claire Forlani--It took me a while to figure out what it is about her that bothers me...it's as if she is trying to prevent her lower eyelids from coming up and closing her eyes.

I could care less if he wants to experience being human. I don't exactly feel compassion for him.

Everyone was waiting for him to say that. Also, as to show the screenwriters dearth of ideas, they don't give us anything interesting to chew on. If you were Hopkins, wouldn't you be asking Where do we go when you take me? What's it like? Where did you come from? What can you really see? His character doesn't ask these questions because the screenwriters aren't creative enough to come up with anything.Length--Lots have been said about the films length.

That this first time viewing actually comprises two viewings which are, though not back-to-back, only 3 days apart means yet a different experience. Finally, having gleaned a considerable amount of material before going into the cinema has perhaps changed significantly my perception from what it would have been had I first watched in back in 1991. Had I watched it back in 1991, without any foreknowledge of what the film is about, I would probably have made an immediate association to Hitchcock's classic Vertigo &#150; an abrupt death of the heroin leading to the mysterious resurrection of same. I would be looking for clues to explain the mystery and a satisfying twist at the end. And I could not have been more wrong.Armed with all the literature I've read, written from back in 1991 to quite recent times, by both professional critics and non-professional but almost equally erudite IMDb posters, I know what I would be looking for. There's only a thin line between the film being mysterious and poetic, and the words poetic and poetry appear in just about everything I read on this film. Poetic could mean technical thing like rhyme and rhythm, but here of course, it's senses and perceptions, as well as a frame of mind.The critics (back in 1991, mind you) talked about the frustration of trying to make some senses out of this film. But there are always two sides to a coin &#150; there is the joy and liberation of being able to see in the film anything you want. I do not see anything particular in Veronique's long red scarf dragged along the floor during her brisk walk along the corridor. But I am chilled right down my spine by the look and smile the alto gives to Weronika at the beginning of their duet. For some reason, I see death, but probably because of my foreknowledge. The images of the two old women seen moving slowly by Weronika and Veronique no one would fail to connect, but everyone would see different meanings from it. Each frame in this film contains details that are meticulously constructed by master Kieslowski, to provoke the audience's senses and intuitions, not to challenge their intellect. The entire film is shot in a sort of perpetual late afternoon glow which is close to sepia tone but a tad brighter. Images and motifs are so rich that it's hard to find another film that is comparable. Another poster has given a full discourse on the use of music. I would only mention the deepest impression I had, of a scene almost towards the end when Veronique wakes up from what looks like a short nap and moves through corridors and stairs to her lover the puppeteer's workroom. The loud, pulsating music invokes such a powerful sense of mystery that is almost oppressive. But when she finally gets into the workroom, looks at a puppet and asks with a most ordinary smile Is it me?, the music suddenly disappears, as if it was never there before. Cinematic magic! Enough praises have been heaped on Irene Jacob by everyone, or maybe never enough. She does particularly well in bringing out the subtle difference between the two women she portrays &#150; Weronika (cheerful, even playful, focused) and Veronique (more sensuous, melancholy, slightly bemused). This film is so rich that you can never say enough about it (and I have not even mentioned the puppet scene). I will certainly want to watch Double life again, on the big screen, maybe not so soon again as during the current screening but in some hopefully not-too-distant future re-screening.

To say that I am disappointed by Director Rick Rosenthal (who also directed the best of the sequels, Halloween 2) is putting it lightly. The casting is just ridiculous. Busta Rhymes?! WTF is he doing in a Halloween movie? No excuse for it, none. Bianca Kajlich has to be the most boring female lead I've seen in a long time. You never learn enough about her to care and she's never convincing. The rest of the cast has so little personality that they are hard to remember after you see the film. I know they are simply there for Michael to kill, but can they at least be slightly entertaining? Can I care about somebody? Even H5 had better characters and that's saying something. I never missed Loomis more than I did watching this trash. The only upsides to the film are Michael himself and Jamie Lee's cameo. Michael's mask looks better than it has since 2, and he keeps the more aggressive style he had in H20. But other than that this thing sucked up one side of the hill and down the other. I can't believe that H6 is widely considered the worst in the series when you have this and part 5. 6 has much better acting and characters in one frame than this garbage. And it's scarier. Where were the scares beyond the first ten minutes? It's way too dumb to be scary. Donald Pleasence must be turning in his grave.

Especially if you want to see more of Tom Felton, I would recommend the Harry Potter films. The funny thing is, he doesn't even think he wants acting for a career. He is more of a fisherman.

There was something that didn't really seem to snap up and draw me in with his usual biting satire. A second viewing, however, had me really focus though not for what wasn't there but what was. Like more than a few other Bunuel films, some of them in France and others in Mexico, the style Bunuel uses for Diary of a Chambermaid is very controlled, not static but rather formal and, in its paradoxical way to Bunuel's intentions, restrained. But it's this very restraint and formality- both in the camera and how the characters interact- that helped make it clearer for me, and more interesting. One does have to put it into context, not just from the time period the story is set in, decades before the film was made, but also how these kinds of bourgeoisie dramas were made in France and elsewhere in Europe. For a moment I'm even reminded of Rules of the Game by showing both the lower and upper classes in one such estate. There isn't really a specific story as much as a series of events leading Celestine (the always beautiful Jeanne Moreau) through her time as maid for the Monteils and up to finally breaking free of their own repressive ways.This isn't made really clear until later in the film, including what must have been a 'hot' scene in 1964 for French and other audiences as Moreau is in some kinky maid-wear (it's one of my favorite scenes from the film). However seeing it a second time I found it funnier once I could get more into what these perverse, strange, corrupted characters were all about, on both the servant and served sides. The Monsieur, for example, has a certain fetish for high-heeled footwear, which elicits a nice laugh, if not a big one. And then a farmer, who is practically drooling over Celestine, suddenly has to cope with the fact that she is, of course, from Paris of all places. But then the story does thicken with the murder part. The goods that come with Diary of a Chambermaid, as envisioned by Bunuel, is really in him seeing through the conventional- which he puts forward almost TOO well- and finding enough to criticize and have little bits of fun with. It's these circumstances that pop up for Celestine that all make their toll, even if its not very constant. It's not a surreal-style movie in the Bunuel mode, but he still makes some time to not let anyone off the hook; Celestine does do an about-face from how she previously acted, though so much has happened with the other characters that it's not too much of a surprise.In fact, it's on a very subtle level nearly reaches the gleeful vulgarity and near moral decay of Bunuel's masterwork Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. If it isn't as accessible it's because it's more riffing on another work than the surefire confidence and bravura of an original piece. And the same lucidity that is laid as the groundwork, when not marked over by Bunuel's obsessions and satire (if not surrealism), almost comes close to making a scene or two duller than need be- plus, as others have noted, the bad ending. Nevertheless it's a splendid take on what is really dark subject matter, put into (for the only time for the director) anamorphic widescreen to put these character even more into the fullness of the hypocrisies. It's subversion done with tact, and the star of it, as par for the great string of films she had, is near perfect. And at least the director leaves his most featured small-role actress, Muni, get out clean.

I loved the idea of a group of has-beens famous only for a cancelled SF show to suddenly be thrust into a real space adventure. But I didn't know at the time Galaxy Quest was also a commentary on the whole concept of fandom, and what these people are like, and I was thrilled to discover it gets everything right, as well as delivers a fantastic intergalactic odyssey.GQ is a real underrated gem. It should have been, and deserved to be more popular at the box office. There is a sly level of satire and intelligence at work here that reminded me of This Is Spinal Tap. But the subject here is SF fans, or to be more precise, Star Trek fans.Galaxy Quest is not Star Trek, but in every respect it might as well be. The targets it chooses to parody are spot on, and almost unnerving in its accuracy. It was a show that ran for four years, about the crew of the NSEA Protector. Commander Peter Quincy Taggart, aka Jason Nesmith (the underrated Tim Allen), the ship's science officer Dr Lazarus, aka Alexander Dane (a marvellously funny Alan Rickman), and Lt Tawny Madison, aka Gwen DeMarco (a blonde Sigourney Weaver).When the show was eventually cancelled, the cast found themselves typecast in their roles. And now they scrape a living making appearances at conventions for the adoring fans who still hold a candle for the show.It's details like this where the satire really works. Tim Allen does a marvellous send-up of William Shatner. Hogging the spotlight, making grandiose speeches that don't mean a damn thing, and tearing his uniform every chance he gets. Alan Rickman is obviously channelling Leonard Nimoy into his performance. He can't escape from the character of Dr Lazarus who has stalled his career, forced to parrot stock lines just to appease the fans. GQ also captures the animosity between Nesmith and Dane which so obviously mirrors the same thing between Shatner and Nimoy on-set.Sigourney Weaver is the unfortunate to be cast as the dumb blonde. Lt Madison hasn't got much of a job, rather than just repeat things that the ship's computer says. But it's her one job. And she's proud of it dammit! She is also poured into a very form-fitting uniform, that proudly shows off her ample cleavage. Seven of Nine by way of Marina Sirtis. Weaver does a complete about face from her most famous role as Ellen Ripley. She also looks great as a blonde by the way.The GQ conventions are also very accurate the way they portray the fans. These are people who take the show very seriously, some who even have trouble distinguishing the fiction from the fact. They dress up as the characters, they have episodes memorised, they have all the technical details at home, etc. But it also demonstrates some respect for the fans. When we see some of them, I was expecting them to be portrayed as nerds with thick glasses, but actually they're just normal people. A little socially inept perhaps and they take their adoration a little too far, but they are real people. Galaxy Quest is a film that's very well informed.The cast find themselves blasted right out of the stratosphere into an adventure when an alien race, the Thermians, mistake Galaxy Quest for reality. They have modelled their entire society on it, and in true fandom fashion, they are completely naive and unquestioning in the presence of their idols.The dictator Sarris (Robin Sachs) is exterminating the Thermians, and they have turned in desperation to the cast as the saviours of their race. The Thermians are hilarious. With funny walks, monotone voices and plastered on grins, they're the ultimate fanboy convention.One of the greatest surprises is how good the special effects are. The actual Protector, built by the Thermians, is a sleek spectacle. There are some astonishing sights such as a full on view of the galaxy as a blanket of stars, and Sarris's people has some impressive make-up work too. The point here of course is that since they're supposed to be real, and not cheap, fake sets and rubber aliens, they have to look real. Something GQ delivers in spades.There are also tons of in-jokes for hardened Trekkers. References from various episodes that cover all the Star Trek series. And there are many witty observations too. Such as the cast-member who was killed in one episode (what they call in Trek a Red-Shirt), whose only purpose is to die, making him the most expendable person. Or when Weaver wonders why there is a dangerous chopping device on the way to the engine core. No reason really. It just looks good. And it was a badly written episode!Galaxy Quest succeeds both as a knowing commentary on the Star Trek phenomenon, and as an engaging space adventure. There are some very touching moments too. It's a truly poignant scene when Nesmith has to explain to the Thermians they're only actors, and everything they've believed is a lie. Or the look of contentment on a Thermian's face when Dr Lazarus blesses him before he dies.I also like the final scenes when they crash land at a convention, appear one by one from their ship and dispatch Sarris. Which the fans interpret as part of the show. As well as the help they get in beating Sarris with the aid of GQ acolytes.

The point here of course is that since they're supposed to be real, and not cheap, fake sets and rubber aliens, they have to look real. Something GQ delivers in spades.There are also tons of in-jokes for hardened Trekkers. References from various episodes that cover all the Star Trek series. And there are many witty observations too. Such as the cast-member who was killed in one episode (what they call in Trek a Red-Shirt), whose only purpose is to die, making him the most expendable person. Or when Weaver wonders why there is a dangerous chopping device on the way to the engine core. No reason really. It just looks good. And it was a badly written episode!Galaxy Quest succeeds both as a knowing commentary on the Star Trek phenomenon, and as an engaging space adventure. There are some very touching moments too. It's a truly poignant scene when Nesmith has to explain to the Thermians they're only actors, and everything they've believed is a lie. Or the look of contentment on a Thermian's face when Dr Lazarus blesses him before he dies.I also like the final scenes when they crash land at a convention, appear one by one from their ship and dispatch Sarris. Which the fans interpret as part of the show. As well as the help they get in beating Sarris with the aid of GQ acolytes. Something that is interrupted when one fan's mother forces him to take the rubbish out.Galaxy Quest is a fine homage to Star Trek, amusingly played by the cast, as well as astutely observed.Take us out!

However, last week, passing this movie in the Blockbuster Mega-Discount bin, I decided to re-watch it and see if my opinion has changed.(I tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, without losing some of the movie's flair. I feel I have succeeded) I must say, spending that 2.50$ plus tax was the greatest decision of my pitiful and shameful life. In the 5 days I have had the VHS, I have watched this film at least 15 times, I unfortunately lost track after blacking out naked on my carpet on the 2nd day. This movie goes down in history as one of the 5 greatest drama sequels of all time, and If I had to put a rating on it's comedy factor, I would give it 4 thumbs way up. I found myself laughing throughout the entire film, calling my friends and family to repeat jokes I had heard. The casting in this film is absolutely excellent, with Shaq leading the performance like a Frenchman in a yogurt factory. The story revolves around a genie named Shaq, and a small Italian boy named Max. Upon finding a magic stereo player, Max discovers a small black genie living inside, and offers to give him a place to sleep and eat for a week. Ironically, this is where the theme of pedophilia comes into play, with multiple scenes of Max and Shaq showering together and close up shots of them smiling. I hate to repeat myself, but as a child, I understood nothing about this subject. However, as a fleshy man, I see it in a new and blinding light.There are several moments throughout the play where the development of the characters and storyline drag, but the rest of the film certainly make up for it. The end is griping, and keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it. At the same time, I cry when the credits roll and long to see Shaq's black face one more time (of course, I will rewind the movie at this point and watch it over again).On a final note, this movie is almost perfect in every aspect. This is the epitome of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. The casting is amazing, the special effects are mind-blowingly realistic and stunning, the fully orchestrated soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and amplifies the experience. If I were to put a grade on this, I would have to give it a 9\/10, losing a point because of the slight nudity (i'm not the biggest fan, but I won't say no!). But, this is not a movie to be rated, it is a movie to be bought, watched, and enjoyed. Do yourself a big favor and buy this movie, your taste buds will thank you.

When the woman gets her arm ripped off, it's slow and she screams as if she was pinched. The blood is the wrong colour and the blood isn't leaking but it's sticky! The Raptor looks very fake and when it kills the first dark-skin guy it slaps him twice then kills him. The acting is extremely poor and is very cheesy. The kid is annoying and is a crappy actor. The blood is sticky when a workman gets his head bit off and his legs are still moving. I can't believe how bad this movie is.

Watching it a second time, still holds our attention as the director, Penny Marshall, clearly takes us for a ride with Josh, as he becomes a man before hand.Josh, the New Jersey boy who is unhappy by being excluded of some fun things because of his age, asks Zoltar at the fair, for a wish which he is told has been granted.
