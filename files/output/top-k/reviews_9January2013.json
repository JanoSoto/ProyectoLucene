[{"date":"9 January 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Gossip, in my opinion is one of the best films ever, one for the ages. Now I realize that most people don't really like this film, for one reason or another, however this film has some of the most amazing qualities that filmmakers neglect to acknowledge in today's filmmaking. One of which is the anatomy-and assemble of the cast. The main and supporting cast alone is one of the reasons that I first wanted to watch the film. James Marsden gives an absolutely enthralling performance that should be more recognized in his career. I see no real holes in his acting and his character makes me wish that we could see more of those characters in films today. When James was in this film he was just getting his career going and, what some might say he was somewhat young in that stage of his career, we should hope to see such hard work, attention to character and determination in today's 'upcoming stars', as he did then. Derrick Webb is a character, I for one, hope to see more often in thrillers in the near future. Derrick's interesting appeal to women, and the fact that he is rich, makes it so much more enjoyable. Not to mention his character's thrilling change and turn of events; where at one stage we actually feel sorry for the guy for being a different type of 'freak'. Travis, played by Norman Reedus is one of those characters that I love, to delve into his artistic expressions and talent, and not to mention Norman's gripping performance as yet another type of 'artistic freak' in the film. So basically I love almost everything in this film from Joshua Jackson (and his performance) to the actual storyline as well. Furthermore, the camera lens and series of close ups at thrilling points of the film are absolutely brilliant, which again I wish filmmakers put into today's movies more often. Say what you will about Gossip but I completely love this film, and find myself watching it over and over again for multiple reasons. So it all comes down to great acting, and not only good looking actors (that we don't see as much today, as we should), great storyline, great camera shots and angles. One for the ages in my opinion (that should really get higher ratings than 5.6).
