All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (Antz, Shrek, Final Fantasy), and even the single unqualified success (Toy Story 2) provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  Toy Story 2 had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in Tarzan (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match Fantasia or The Nightmare Before Christmas.  And I thought that Toy Story 2 was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong.  This is far better.  And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow.  It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind.  Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful.  What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as Monsters, Inc. as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with Shrek - which emphatically IS a children's movie.  Monsters, inc. is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way.  The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls Boo) into the city.  But we never see things from her point of view.  We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species.  And they ARE.  To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship).  This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.Shrek, of course, is a children's movie through and through.  Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes.  Monsters, Inc. has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children.  This is not to say children won't like it.  Maybe they will.  (Who can say?)  Here's the bonus if they DO like it, it will (unlike Shrek) actually have a beneficial effect.  It will make them less frightened of the dark.

The same might be said for the movie itself, which delights on so many levels that it achieves that highest ambition of family movies--appealing to all ages at once.On its most basic level, Shrek is a flat-out comedy, taking shots at anything even remotely within range.  A good portion of the ammo is devoted to potshots at Jeffery Katzenberg's previous employer Disney the villian, reportedly modeled after Michael Eisner, is a diminutive megalomaniac aptly named Lord Farquaad, and his kingdom of Duloc can best be described as the Magic Kingdom if it had been designed by George Orwell.  There is the standard dose of pop-culture and film references, balanced with a helping of meaner gross-out humor (the fact that Shrek makes candles from his own earwax is stomach-turning enough, but the question of what he uses for the wick doesn't bear examining).The jokes provide laughs enough, but the true secret to the film's humor is more subtle.  Much like The Princess Bride before it, Shrek is a cunning satire on the conventions in fairy-tales--and, by extention, the films inspired by them.  Much has been said of the formula employed by Disney and its imitators, and Shrek uses every opportunity to overturn the elements of the tried-and-occasionaly-true design.  Shrek, like many recent animated heros, is an outcast; unlike them, he doesn't pine for acceptance by society but has concluded he's much better off outside of it.  Indeed, his motivation for going on his quest is to rid his home of the fairytale creatures Farquaad has unceremoniously deported to the area.  The object of said quest, a comely red-haired princess named Fiona, has the spunk characteristic of the post-modern Disney heroines but balances it with the someday my prince will come mentality of earlier protagonists.  Her philosophy of the way things are supposed to be blinds her, signifying the danger of taking fairytale conventions too seriously.  Best of all is Shrek's sidekick, a locquacious jackass known only as Donkey.  Voiced by Eddie Murphy, Donkey is a stand-in for every anthropomorphized supporting player shoehorned into these films for the sake of comic relief.  Such characters often attempt to be cute but come off as obnoxious; here, Murphy acheives the opposite result as a deliberately obnoxious character who manages to become endearing.And here is the core of Shrek's appeal, for despite the caustic views toward fairy-tale archetypes the film (again in the manner of Princess Bride) somehow manages to find the charm and spirit which makes those archetypes so appealing to begin with.  By making Shrek's and Fiona's obstacles internal instead of external, their characters become more fleshed out and their journey all the more touching.  And when the inevitible Beauty and the Beast romance arrives, it is presented with a twist that adds new resonance to the concept.  And in the end, the movie leaves us with the cheerful warmth that can only be provided by a happy ending--even an unconventional one.
