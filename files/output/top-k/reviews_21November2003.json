So the meaning of true horror is walking around the woods with a camera? sheesh, its ok guys, none of us have anything to worry about ever if that's as bad as it gets.People seem to think that no gore, no special effects and no big shocks are a good thing. And they can be, if done correctly. Take Rosemary's Baby for example, there is a film that has no gore, no effects and no big jumpy moments, and it worked, know why? It has an idea behind it. The idea that a woman could be carrying the child of the devil is a genuinely frightening idea, it probes into the unknown, and that is a terrifying thing to do. Getting lost in the woods, not only doesn't probe into the unknown (people have been lost in the woods before); it's just genuinely not scary. Maybe getting lost in the woods with a man eating bear might be a scary thought, but just getting lost in the woods isn't. Ok, if you really did get lost in the woods it might be frightening, but for a film, I think we need a bit more plot than that.For a film to be good, we're not talking Oscar winner here, just merely good, it needs to have several things, includinga plot a decent script Direction Acting WatchabilityBlair Witch doesn't have any of these.

Lame. a decent script - I realise that they were trying to make things look real, which gives the effect that there isn't a script but whereas in most other films the script is used to move the story along, in this film all the script is a bunch of shouting and moaning. I mean, ok, fine you're lost in the woods but surely you wouldn't just sit there shouting at each other all day. Direction - I think it's hard to judge whether or not this was directed. It just looked to me like a bunch of bad camera angles loosely strewn together.Acting - Wasn't any. Watchability - I can't see any reason to watch this film. I mean watch the film again. It just isn't watchable, the way the camera(s) move is annoying, and it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Well, really nothing goes on.

I didn't go to see it as soon as it came out, but some of my friends and family did, and every single one of them came back saying that it sucked. However, I thought 'uneducated fools, what do they know?' and then guess what? I went to see it and they were right. It's a good job the film wasn't much longer, I reckon I'd have left if it were.Then we've got this mind game thing. About it being real footage. When I first went to see it this rumour was still ripe and I thought it was really real. Well, actually I was under the impression that this was a film based on actual footage, not the actual footage itself, but anyway, same difference. So how come I still wasn't in the least frightened? And how come even now, now that everyone knows that the rumours aren't true, why do people like the writers of my TV guides say it's scary? why why why? It's too boring to be scary.I suppose they do deserve some credit for pulling that off though, even I was fooled. But that's credit for the producers, not for the film itself. It's a shame actually that this rumour was done with this film, if it were done for a good film, movie history could have been made. What a waste.Then we come to the 'utterly horrifying' ending. Well actually, last time I checked, a man stood in the corner while a girl drops a camera isn't scary, but it looks like I'm wrong again. It's horrifying. I realise that at the start someone said that's what happened to a kid or something, but so what? It's still not scary.One of the (many) main reasons why this film isn't scary is that non of the characters are engaging, or even likable, the audience has no reason at all to like them, so why would we care if one of them has to stand in the corner? Even if it was frightening, who cares? For a good example of something horrifying happening to someone, see The Wicker Man. The Wicker Man did a good job of making itself scary because the character of Sgt Howie was portrayed as being likable so the audience could identify with him, and so when his time came, we felt empathy towards the guy, but what did we feel here?

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"21 November 2003","score":"15 out of 29 people found the following review useful","review":"  Directed by Sam RaimiWritten by David KoeppStarring Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst and James FrancoAfter years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights ,  a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student ,  not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman \/ scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were 1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is  you will have to see for yourselves .2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise . You wait for more action in the next film , more exploitation of the potential of the story and you have a curiosity to find out where the relationships between the protagonists will lead . Spider-Man however manages to rise above the aforementioned films . Why ? Because it is a GOOD introduction . Where X-Men made the mistake of under using  10 characters without any success , Spider-Man has ONE main character . This is what I like most about Raimi's film . We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play ! There is not a single superhero film that bothered to show us the beginning of the character . Obviously they thought it would be dull for the already initiated comic book fans but they were wrong . Yes there are other films with scenes were the motives were explained like Batman and some opening establishing scenes like the first Superman . But Raimi's Spider-Man is unique  we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers , trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comic-book adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now Spider-Man is the best introducing film you will find . The metaphor about the responsibility of a teenager turned into a mature adult is also explored . The realistic approach is successful here . First of all the first thing Peter does with his powers is to try earning money . Only later he decides to use them for the city 's good and safety . Secondly despite some nitpicking from fans it is quite logical that Spider-man's web-shooting is an organic power . Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place .Spider-Man (2002) for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voice-overs by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn (not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known) Dick Tracy , The Mask or the Shadow (good idea but mediocre script \/ execution) or over hyped blockbusters like the X-Men . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the `comic-book' genre .

First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) .I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student ,  not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman \/ scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were 1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is  you will have to see for yourselves .2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise .

I thought it was cool for sure, but also slow-moving and almost eccentric. Then I saw it again a couple of years later and I suddenly realized the pacing was part of what made it great and the eccentricity was beautiful story-lines, brilliant acting and last but not least in-your-face first rate, high class, a cut above the rest, cool and classy dialogue.Then I didn't get a chance to see the movie for a couple of years, and all that time it lingered in the back of my mind. The scenes, the composition of the cinematography and the music haunted me, the hair on my arms stood up just thinking about the evocative beauty of the film, and finally when I got the chance to see it for the third time POW! It finally emerged, dawned on me that this wasn't just Sergio Leone's greatest film ever, it was the best western movie ever made!John Ford, Anthony Mann and Howard Hawks will have to forgive me, but Sergio Leone really plays like a Best of Western, a Greatest Hits collection of everything that makes a good western great. And since this is what Leone originally intended with his movie it is quite amazing to realize that he managed to full-fill this dream to such an impossible degree. His second greatest western, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is wonderful, and truly one of the coolest additions to the genre, but as you grow up Once Upon a Time in the West is the mother of them all, a mature tribute told with a beauty and grace that would have most masterpieces pale in comparison.And since I'm not alone telling people that ONE MISERABLE VIEWING IS NOT ENOUGH, it is apparent that the movie is like fine wine that only gets better with age. See it again. And then see it again. When you've seen it again, you go and see it again. And see it in all it's wide-screen glory, the way it was intended. Then let the movie play in the back of your mind for a couple of years, then see it again and look back on your first reaction with shame. I feel this so strongly that I won't even bother getting into a discussion on the film unless they have seen it at least three times (and I do not mean back-to-back on the same night, don't force yourself, let the movie come to you)!The way this revenge-story develops into a moving showdown between the old and the new west, and how it leads to the most gripping show-down in the history of movies gives me goose bumps just thinking about it. And the music... oh the music... With the movie Leone turns a standard western-plot into an original masterpiece almost singlehandedly through stunning visuals - the wide-screen shots are enough to take your breath away - and the film-maker's talent for resting just long enough with each of his captivating frame before moving on to the next will blow your mind. The way he mixes the art of moving pictures with entertainment is so impressive it will leave you in dumb-struck. Unlike in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly here EVERY character - not just the ones in the title - have become legends.Anyone who has seen the film can never forget it's brilliant, long opening sequence with the three gunmen waiting for the train to arrive, a wind-mill moving slowly in the background. Jack Elam trying not to pay notice of the fly bugging him, Woody Strode in all his beautiful glory just standing there - collecting water in his hat - looking mean. All the time Ennio Morricone's legendary music luring patiently in the background, and then suddenly... the train is heard approaching... the scene is every bit amusing as it is terrifying.Originally Leone wanted Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly to play the gunmen in this scene. Leone wanted to show the world that he had matured as a film-maker, and wanted to get rid of the past in a wonderful way that sadly never was to be (Eastwood was away working on another project). That sums it up doesn't it? When even Leone himself felt the other three movies was just a mere warm-up to this one. But sadly Once Upon a Time in the West would flop at the box office, and only slowly getting the recognition it so highly deserved, whether it be through filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino acknowledging how much the movie influenced them, or just through normal movie-buffs discovering all it's glory and splendor over time. Remember, even movies like Vertigo and Singin' in the Rain weren't considered box-office hits in it's days, it took time, and now it's about high time some so-called movie-lovers get their head out of the sand and realize what they have missed, now that it is finally out on DVD in exhilarating, crisp picture quality.I could keep on using words like mesmerizing, breathtaking, spellbinding, enchanting, but when push comes to shove this is one of those few movies where words don't do it justice, just EXPERIENCE it.

But sadly Once Upon a Time in the West would flop at the box office, and only slowly getting the recognition it so highly deserved, whether it be through filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino acknowledging how much the movie influenced them, or just through normal movie-buffs discovering all it's glory and splendor over time. Remember, even movies like Vertigo and Singin' in the Rain weren't considered box-office hits in it's days, it took time, and now it's about high time some so-called movie-lovers get their head out of the sand and realize what they have missed, now that it is finally out on DVD in exhilarating, crisp picture quality.I could keep on using words like mesmerizing, breathtaking, spellbinding, enchanting, but when push comes to shove this is one of those few movies where words don't do it justice, just EXPERIENCE it.

I'll watch the movies in theaters, but not with the massive expectations so many people have. Truth be told, the only film in the series to truly impress me on virtually every level was The Empire Strikes Back (Star Wars was great fun as well, though with weaker dialogue and acting than ESB). But movies like these are rare, these big-budget slices of escapism that harken back to the old days of Saturday matinee serials, only with (much) higher production values and (in this case, marginally) better acting. Damn, I seriously can't wait for Indiana Jones 4.I actually looked forward to Attack of the Clones. The premise offered more opportunities, the special effects would be slicker than ever, and surely, even George Lucas could have improved his writing skills after the results we saw in Phantom Menace. But in the end, it's not much of an improvement over Menace, in fact, I'm not even sure it's an improvement at all. Despite the occasional energetic effort behind the camera, Attack of the Clones is mostly lifeless, pedestrian, and boring.It starts off quite well, with a failed assassination attempt on Senator Amidala's (Natalie Portman) life. For protection, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned as her bodyguards. If you'll recall, Anakin had a bit of a crush  on Amidala in Phantom Menace and nothing has changed the ten years since. Anyway, another assassination attempt on Amidala fails yet again, with Kenobi and Anakin hot on the heels of the would-be assassin. This leads to a spectacular speeder chase that puts the similar sequence in The Fifth Element to complete shame. So far, so good.But whatever hopes I had for the movie were shattered soon afterward, when the film's core plot, the love story, became the central focus. I'm actually a sucker for a good forbidden love romance; I loved Titanic, enjoyed Sabrina, and even found myself mildly won over by Fools Rush In. But the love story here is so dull, it bears nothing in the way of vitality or genuine chemistry. It's like watching a brother and sister kiss (disturbing memories of Leia and Luke's kiss are all flooding back in).Though Christensen and Portman fail to strike any sparks, it's not entirely their faults. George Lucas and Jonathan Hales' dialogue is horribly silly, there's actually a scene where Anakin compares and contrasts Amidala with sand, of all things. The culmination of Amidala's declaration of love for Anakin doesn't feel right, especially since it comes so soon after his murderous actions, which she apparently forgets almost immediately after he confesses to her.Christensen is an actor with maybe a kernel of potential. I've never seen Life as a House, but I keep hearing a lot of good things about him. As Anakin, he displays many of the qualities we expect he's arrogant, hot-headed, rash, and temperamental. Christensen's delivery of the dialogue could easily lead one to assume that he's a no-talent pretty boy actor, but it's a bit more complex than that. Lucas' dialogue almost never does him any favors, even if the script does give him the opportunity to expand his ever-growing hostile personality. That the Jedi council doesn't pay more attention to him is a bit of a mystery, they know the kid's got potential (that's an understatement if I ever heard one), but even when he slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken raiders, he's not even berated for such actions (to be fair, it's not like he told anyone, though Yoda clearly sensed his feelings during the massacre).Natalie Portman is a proven talent, but much like Christensen, you could never guess it from her performance. She gives it her best try, but to no avail, coming off as one-dimensional, basically a perfectly safe role model for young girls everywhere without the slightest hint of flaw in her noble personality. It's a portrayal of cartoonish decency, written as only George Lucas could have.Like The Empire Strikes Back, the story splits into two narratives. Sharing screen time with the love story is Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation of the assassination attempts. Hercule Poirot (or Indiana Jones, for that matter, who proved quite the clever historian at putting together clues to find his sacred artifact), he is not. Piecing together clues is obviously not Kenobi's forte. The script goes out of its way to make him look like an idiot (and the people he's investigating even bigger idiots!); take for instance, the scene where he finds no trace of a star system in the planetary archives, and has to inquire Yoda and a class of padewan learners why it's not on the map (duh, it was removed).His investigation leads him to the water-logged planet of Kamino. This is by far the most visually stimulating of the film's newly introduced worlds (too bad it's all glanced over). The Kaminoans live on ports supported in the same way an oil rig would be, only presumably in a far more complex manner, given the size of these habitats.  Kenobi discovers a clone army that was apparently ordered by a Jedi master named Sifo-Diyas, except the guy's been dead for ten years. The army was cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), whose New Zealand accent leads me to believe there's a planet full of Australians somewhere in that galaxy.This converging storyline is only somewhat more interesting than the love story, but at least it sets up a couple of reasonably cool (albeit very short) action sequences, including Kenobi's hair-raising battle with Fett and an asteroid chase that'll remind many of The Empire Strikes Back. Ewan Mcgregor is a fine actor, easily the best of the film's leads, so you at least get the joy of watching this guy emulate Alec Guinness almost perfectly.Attack of the Clones is a much darker picture than Phantom Menace, but not necessarily any better as a result. The pacing here is almost as weak (in both films, we have fun bookending sequences and an elongated boring middle segment) and the climactic action sequences (six of them in the last thirty-five minutes!) are something of a mixed bag.My attention snapped back when the film suddenly came to life around the hour fifty-minute mark with a knockout battle sequence between several Jedi and hundreds of droids inside a massive coliseum. This setpiece boasts the film's most rousing scene, a scuffle between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, one of my faves, but clearly acting from a script beneath his talents), Jango Fett, and a giant rhino-like creature. The creature first charges at Windu, then charges at Fett, and finally there's a spectacularly rousing showdown between Windu and Fett that had my blood boiling. Damn, I wish this film had more moments like that.The succeeding action sequences don't fare as well, particularly the lightsaber duel between Anakin and evil Count Dooku (played well by Christopher Lee), which is quite a few steps backward from the climactic duel in Phantom Menace. Without the athletic moves of Ray Park, it's basically an eighty-year old man swinging a big stick of light at a twenty-year old, pretty boy actor.The film's silly title sparked a lot of arguments from defensive Star Wars fans (one friend of mine actually defended the title by saying it was good because it informed us what the plot would be covering) (that is, without a doubt, the lamest reasoning I've ever heard regarding the quality of a movie's title). But Lucas said he named the movie this way as an ode to the Saturday Matinee serials the film was inspired by. Contrasting this with Lucas' Indiana Jones trilogy, it's quite clear virtually all of that series' high quality was the result of Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, and John Williams. Lucas proves he can't craft a rousing adventure and not even Williams' rousing score can change that.

I'll watch the movies in theaters, but not with the massive expectations so many people have. Truth be told, the only film in the series to truly impress me on virtually every level was The Empire Strikes Back (Star Wars was great fun as well, though with weaker dialogue and acting than ESB). But movies like these are rare, these big-budget slices of escapism that harken back to the old days of Saturday matinee serials, only with (much) higher production values and (in this case, marginally) better acting. Damn, I seriously can't wait for Indiana Jones 4.I actually looked forward to Attack of the Clones. The premise offered more opportunities, the special effects would be slicker than ever, and surely, even George Lucas could have improved his writing skills after the results we saw in Phantom Menace. But in the end, it's not much of an improvement over Menace, in fact, I'm not even sure it's an improvement at all. Despite the occasional energetic effort behind the camera, Attack of the Clones is mostly lifeless, pedestrian, and boring.It starts off quite well, with a failed assassination attempt on Senator Amidala's (Natalie Portman) life. For protection, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned as her bodyguards. If you'll recall, Anakin had a bit of a crush  on Amidala in Phantom Menace and nothing has changed the ten years since. Anyway, another assassination attempt on Amidala fails yet again, with Kenobi and Anakin hot on the heels of the would-be assassin. This leads to a spectacular speeder chase that puts the similar sequence in The Fifth Element to complete shame. So far, so good.But whatever hopes I had for the movie were shattered soon afterward, when the film's core plot, the love story, became the central focus. I'm actually a sucker for a good forbidden love romance; I loved Titanic, enjoyed Sabrina, and even found myself mildly won over by Fools Rush In. But the love story here is so dull, it bears nothing in the way of vitality or genuine chemistry. It's like watching a brother and sister kiss (disturbing memories of Leia and Luke's kiss are all flooding back in).Though Christensen and Portman fail to strike any sparks, it's not entirely their faults. George Lucas and Jonathan Hales' dialogue is horribly silly, there's actually a scene where Anakin compares and contrasts Amidala with sand, of all things. The culmination of Amidala's declaration of love for Anakin doesn't feel right, especially since it comes so soon after his murderous actions, which she apparently forgets almost immediately after he confesses to her.Christensen is an actor with maybe a kernel of potential. I've never seen Life as a House, but I keep hearing a lot of good things about him. As Anakin, he displays many of the qualities we expect he's arrogant, hot-headed, rash, and temperamental. Christensen's delivery of the dialogue could easily lead one to assume that he's a no-talent pretty boy actor, but it's a bit more complex than that. Lucas' dialogue almost never does him any favors, even if the script does give him the opportunity to expand his ever-growing hostile personality. That the Jedi council doesn't pay more attention to him is a bit of a mystery, they know the kid's got potential (that's an understatement if I ever heard one), but even when he slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken raiders, he's not even berated for such actions (to be fair, it's not like he told anyone, though Yoda clearly sensed his feelings during the massacre).Natalie Portman is a proven talent, but much like Christensen, you could never guess it from her performance. She gives it her best try, but to no avail, coming off as one-dimensional, basically a perfectly safe role model for young girls everywhere without the slightest hint of flaw in her noble personality. It's a portrayal of cartoonish decency, written as only George Lucas could have.Like The Empire Strikes Back, the story splits into two narratives. Sharing screen time with the love story is Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation of the assassination attempts. Hercule Poirot (or Indiana Jones, for that matter, who proved quite the clever historian at putting together clues to find his sacred artifact), he is not. Piecing together clues is obviously not Kenobi's forte. The script goes out of its way to make him look like an idiot (and the people he's investigating even bigger idiots!); take for instance, the scene where he finds no trace of a star system in the planetary archives, and has to inquire Yoda and a class of padewan learners why it's not on the map (duh, it was removed).His investigation leads him to the water-logged planet of Kamino. This is by far the most visually stimulating of the film's newly introduced worlds (too bad it's all glanced over). The Kaminoans live on ports supported in the same way an oil rig would be, only presumably in a far more complex manner, given the size of these habitats.  Kenobi discovers a clone army that was apparently ordered by a Jedi master named Sifo-Diyas, except the guy's been dead for ten years. The army was cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), whose New Zealand accent leads me to believe there's a planet full of Australians somewhere in that galaxy.This converging storyline is only somewhat more interesting than the love story, but at least it sets up a couple of reasonably cool (albeit very short) action sequences, including Kenobi's hair-raising battle with Fett and an asteroid chase that'll remind many of The Empire Strikes Back. Ewan Mcgregor is a fine actor, easily the best of the film's leads, so you at least get the joy of watching this guy emulate Alec Guinness almost perfectly.Attack of the Clones is a much darker picture than Phantom Menace, but not necessarily any better as a result. The pacing here is almost as weak (in both films, we have fun bookending sequences and an elongated boring middle segment) and the climactic action sequences (six of them in the last thirty-five minutes!) are something of a mixed bag.My attention snapped back when the film suddenly came to life around the hour fifty-minute mark with a knockout battle sequence between several Jedi and hundreds of droids inside a massive coliseum. This setpiece boasts the film's most rousing scene, a scuffle between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, one of my faves, but clearly acting from a script beneath his talents), Jango Fett, and a giant rhino-like creature. The creature first charges at Windu, then charges at Fett, and finally there's a spectacularly rousing showdown between Windu and Fett that had my blood boiling. Damn, I wish this film had more moments like that.The succeeding action sequences don't fare as well, particularly the lightsaber duel between Anakin and evil Count Dooku (played well by Christopher Lee), which is quite a few steps backward from the climactic duel in Phantom Menace. Without the athletic moves of Ray Park, it's basically an eighty-year old man swinging a big stick of light at a twenty-year old, pretty boy actor.The film's silly title sparked a lot of arguments from defensive Star Wars fans (one friend of mine actually defended the title by saying it was good because it informed us what the plot would be covering) (that is, without a doubt, the lamest reasoning I've ever heard regarding the quality of a movie's title). But Lucas said he named the movie this way as an ode to the Saturday Matinee serials the film was inspired by. Contrasting this with Lucas' Indiana Jones trilogy, it's quite clear virtually all of that series' high quality was the result of Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, and John Williams. Lucas proves he can't craft a rousing adventure and not even Williams' rousing score can change that.

It seemed somewhat geared towards children, the plot was tired and recycled, the violence still packed a punch but lacked the seriousness and dramatic flair of the first film.

What's happened to him in between the first and third film that would cause him to cross over to the dark side? His evolution is as understandable as O'Herlihy's change from being a good guy in RoboCop to the villain in RoboCop 2.Peter Weller, who said making the first two films in this trilogy was the worst experience of his acting career (the suit was heavy and hot, shedding some number of pounds off his body on a daily basis), has left the series for more attractive projects, leaving John Robert Burke to fill in his shoes. Burke is okay in the suit, but his voice sounds too robotic when he speaks, lacking the monotone calmness that Weller possessed without any type of digital alteration.

Stone done  a great job with this incredibly realistic portrait of the rock band The Doors. Val Kilmer is a real mirror image of the rock and roll god Jim Morrison and in my opinion plays the part perfectly, with great sutilty and also with the unpredictable erratic behaviour as Jim was known for with his drug and alcohol abuse. When the film came out in an interview Val Kilmer said that he wasn't Jim Morrisons biggest fan and disagreed with his destructive ways. None of this is evident throughout the film as his performance is certainly for me a career best for Val but im sure he has the personality to be a regular leading man, but  he has not reached his potential as a serious big name actor like Tom Cruise,Edward Norton,Brad Pitt etc...I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the band and for me this film is right up there with Oliver Stones JFK ,Platoon and the highly underrated Salvador. I think Oliver Stone is still the greatest director around today but his films of the last few years any Given Sunday,U-Turn )are not nearly near his high standard.Lets just cross our fingers and hope with his latest film in the making Alexander the Great (played by none other than my fellow countryman Colin Farrell ) he can reach the same hights he has with his other work.Sit back with this enjoyable film with your feet up and many tins of beer and enjoy the ride....

None of this is evident throughout the film as his performance is certainly for me a career best for Val but im sure he has the personality to be a regular leading man, but  he has not reached his potential as a serious big name actor like Tom Cruise,Edward Norton,Brad Pitt etc...I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in the band and for me this film is right up there with Oliver Stones JFK ,Platoon and the highly underrated Salvador. I think Oliver Stone is still the greatest director around today but his films of the last few years any Given Sunday,U-Turn )are not nearly near his high standard.Lets just cross our fingers and hope with his latest film in the making Alexander the Great (played by none other than my fellow countryman Colin Farrell ) he can reach the same hights he has with his other work.Sit back with this enjoyable film with your feet up and many tins of beer and enjoy the ride....

I picked this one up after seeing a clip of it on a Top 100 Scarey Moments programme on Brittish TV.Now, I am a person who finds it extremely hard to be frightened by a movie. The only movie that ever frightened me before was The Blair Witch Project, a movie with very mixed opinions in the public. The Evil Dead didn't scare me as such, but it did really shock and thrill me. This is a brilliant, original movie, with some great filmmaking and tricks with camera work.This is such an inspirational movie, it deserves more recognition than it currently has. You name it, Evil Dead started it. So many films try to copy it's camera tricks, surreal effects and style.It isn't a film which makes you think at all. 5 college students go out to an old cabin in the woods to spend some time there. There they find a strange, disturbing looking book, and a tape recording. Upon playing back the tape recording, the words recited on the recording awaken something in the woods... The spell is said to give the dead license to posess the living.As has been copied by about a million films now, naturally, somebody gets possessed. When the possessed inflict wounds on the living, they will soon too be possessed. That sets the scene for the rest of the movie, with a 'survival horror' style. What follows are a series of shocking and gorey attacks and weird goings on.The best part though, is this movie's great sense of humour. You won't just scream and cringe, but you will laugh too. The absurd 'gore humour' really is absurd. You'll feel guilty for laughing as Ash's headless girlfriend is humping him, blood leaking all over his face, whilst her head lies on the floor a few yards away making childish noises. That's the sort of absurd, sick over the top gags you can expect. The interweaved comedy sequences mix with your fear and disgust and balance it all out to just leave this feeling of enjoyment.I think I have now made it clear what sort of people will enjoy this flick. If you take gore and things too seriously, or you don't like to be frightened out of your wits by sudden 'boo' sequences, then for gods sake stay away from this film.To a horror fan, any horror fan, who also has a sense of humour, and isn't always looking for movies which take Einstein's brain to understand the plot, this is perfect, and a classic. One to watch. As I made obvious in the 'one line summary' for this comment, this film is perfect for a night with some friends and some drink.The Evil Dead later spawned a kickass, although less over the top, sequel, Evil Dead II Dead By Dawn, and an odd comedy-adventure type movie (I suppose you could call it a spinoff?) called Army of Darkness.

Ten strangers who each, in his or her own way, have gotten away with murder gather by invitation at an isolated mansion.  Then their unknown host U.N. Owen systematically and mockingly murders them one by one.  The idea was adapted into a film in 1945, 1965, 1974, and 1989.  Each adaptation is worth seeing as an attempt to bring the idea to life.  Unfortunately, neither Christie nor the filmmakers succeed in turning this compelling but at the same time confining plot concept into a truly fulfilling story.The book's premise is clever and fascinating.  Careful attention is paid to plot detail.  Compared to the films, the book's assortment of past crimes and depictions of the characters' attitudes toward them are more varied, subtle, and interesting.  The book gives the highly contrived events a certain plausibility.  It is the least sentimental about the characters, treating them vaguely and suspiciously.  This helps, even if it does not entirely succeed, in making them convincing as people who have killed in the past and could do so again.  The book maintains more of a sense of fear, dread, menace, suspense, and purpose than the film versions.  It explains at some length why and how Owen carried out the scheme.However, once the imaginative premise is established, the story becomes thin and formulaic.  There is little plot or character development.  The storytelling seems flat, frigid, and, at times, slow-paced.  There is no lead character to care about.  The characters and their past crimes are sketched in summary fashion.  Those crimes vary widely in originality, depth, and genuineness.  The best are Claythorne's, the general's, Brent's, and Rogers'.  The past crimes of Blore, the doctor, the judge, and Lombard are trite, unexplored, and ineffective.  There are only two real plot twists.  The second creates a major logical problem, which the book acknowledges and tries to overcome by weakly suggesting that the ploy would trick or rattle the murderer.  The guests' murders are designed to follow the nursery rhyme and little more.  Some cosmetic frills aside, the killings show, in themselves, no special cunning, skill, strategic advantage, or plausibility.  Owen strikes crudely without detection too effortlessly.Worst of all, the book (and each film) has nothing serious to say about the powerful themes of survival, justice, and criminality that are at the heart of the story.  The story is inherently an observation of human nature in a desperate situation.  How do the characters behave?  How do they try to reason?  How do they try to survive?  Also by its very nature -- as the book's last pages acknowledge -- this is a morality play.  How is each character a criminal?  How is each beyond the law?  Does each get justice?  Is justice the point, or simply a lust to torture and kill?  Is the story about breaking the law or enforcing it, about mistakes or abuses in pursuing justice?  None of this is meaningfully explored.Overall, the films are worse in some respects and better in some respects than the book.  The 1945 version develops the plot better in some ways.  While as tightly written as the book, it is richer in deductive theories, in taking stock at each stage of the story, and in survival techniques.  The dialogue seems sharper than in the book and provides some memorable lines.  This adaptation pioneers the technique (repeated in 1965 and 1974 and omitted only from the 1989 version, to its detriment) of playing the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme on the piano.  This brings it to life and sets the stage for what is to come.  The cast is mostly outstanding.  Many characters -- Lombard, Claythorne, doctor, judge, Blore, Brent -- seem as smart, strong, or distinctive as in the book, or more so.  They are more entertaining.  Generally, the films do a better job of showing characters interact.  Except in 1989, the films make more of an effort than the book to explain the relationship that develops between two characters.However, the 1945 version handles the past crimes even less effectively than the book.  The movie presents the general and his past crime in an obscure, lifeless way; even the weak 1989 adaptation does better.  The 1945 version makes a ludicrous change to the judge's past crime.  It waters down Brent's.  In changing the story to allow characters to survive, it distorts their identities and\/or past crimes in fundamental ways.  In the process, it replaces the book's most complex, interesting past crime with one that is bland, superficial, and false.  This confuses the meaning of the host's actions, although it does suggest, but not develop, a new theme of false accusation not present in the book.Generally, the film's attempts to make the characters entertaining (a re-named Marston, Rogers, doctor, judge, Blore) come at the expense of their plausibility as villains and of the story's seriousness.  Characters confess their secrets and treat the horror unfolding around them as if it were a parlor game.  Mischa Auer's farcical, clownish performance is a disaster.  The character was poorly drawn to begin with, and the 1945 film does a particularly poor job of presenting his past crime.  This, and the changed ending, are only the most extreme examples of a general problem with taking such a lighthearted approach to a fundamentally serious story.Worst of all, the climactic scene, which reveals Owen's identity, means, and motives, is short, sedate, droll, unsatisfying, and leaves a lot unexplained.  In 1945, Owen has a weary, rational, amiable armchair chat with the final victim precisely when the character should come alive as someone triumphantly and credibly capable of inflicting such horror.  It is left to the otherwise flawed 1974 version to capture more of the tone and intensity of the book and to the generally inept 1989 film to provide an ending that is dramatic, reflects that a deadly serious killer has been at work, conveys a sense of Owen's menace and lunacy, and most fully explains Owen's behavior.

And awful Hollywood syrup music (heeewwww!). But I recognized a talent, as the story was great and some of the direction aspects were very interesting and refreshing.I was looking forward his next opus, hoping this guy would improve, but obviously Unbreakable was mainly an attempt to make another hit, and despite the -once again- great story, it was quite a boring movie.This time we have something really interesting.First, we have the first really frightening movie since a loooong time.I wouldn't watch it alone, and very few movies have this effect on me. And no, the 6th sense was not one of them.Secondly, we have a tuneful, tasty and intelligent direction, that does not insult my intelligence by loudly pinpointing everything that matters. No, one actually has to be patient, observe and think about what's happening. This is meditative direction. I like it so much. Outstanding pace, served by a brilliant visual composition and perfect editing. The narrative is not illustrated by the movie like in 99% of modern productions, the narrative IS the movie and vice-versa. Aaaaah.This is where Shyamalan's ambition is clear, as this kind of direction is not aimed at the brainless and shallow modern audience. No, he wants to please those who think, who observe, who actually take the time to get into the narration and fill the gaps. Those who read books, or look at decent movies. So he's trying to escape the commercial hype around his first opus. Great.Then there is the acting direction. This is very clever stuff. OK he's been borrowing a lot, mainly from Kubrick (Shining) and the Coens (Fargo). Nevertheless, this work is really impressive. And miracle (;-)), Gibson actually played the game! Thanks God, he did! Maybe he was not really aware of what Shyamalan was doing with him, who cares as the result is here for us to enjoy. Phoenix was a pretty clever choice as he's a natural for this kind of stuff. He does know what it's about, and fills exactly the right space. I'm curious to see what will be Phoenix's next works. I think he should meet Cronenberg sometime.So Shyamalan seems to have made his choice to be an artistic director, there with the Coens, Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch and others. Well he has good chances to succeed. But it seems he still has to gain more independance.Because I can't believe that he actually thinks that the way he uses music is near to adequate (from an artistic point of view). Please. The best parts are the ones without any music, and thankfully there are plenty of them. Good. But when there IS music, a much better one would be needed. We have lots of good movie composers nowadays, just pick one.And I can't believe that this incredible happy ending, with its pedestrian, dull moral subtext, is what he intended with this story that until then was packed with dense, clever, subversive subtext. I HOPE he did not. I HOPE he's going to gain more independance and become a real free artist. Then when he talks about faith, he'll do it HIS way until the very end of the story.I know there are a lot out there who'd love him to keep on making soapy, sweetened, viewer-friendly flicks like the Sixth Sense, but I'm among those who are expecting much more quality, challenging stuff from such a talented person. Would Signs be... a sign that it's going to happen? Have faith ;-)!

But I recognized a talent, as the story was great and some of the direction aspects were very interesting and refreshing.I was looking forward his next opus, hoping this guy would improve, but obviously Unbreakable was mainly an attempt to make another hit, and despite the -once again- great story, it was quite a boring movie.This time we have something really interesting.First, we have the first really frightening movie since a loooong time.I wouldn't watch it alone, and very few movies have this effect on me. And no, the 6th sense was not one of them.Secondly, we have a tuneful, tasty and intelligent direction, that does not insult my intelligence by loudly pinpointing everything that matters. No, one actually has to be patient, observe and think about what's happening. This is meditative direction. I like it so much. Outstanding pace, served by a brilliant visual composition and perfect editing. The narrative is not illustrated by the movie like in 99% of modern productions, the narrative IS the movie and vice-versa. Aaaaah.This is where Shyamalan's ambition is clear, as this kind of direction is not aimed at the brainless and shallow modern audience. No, he wants to please those who think, who observe, who actually take the time to get into the narration and fill the gaps. Those who read books, or look at decent movies. So he's trying to escape the commercial hype around his first opus. Great.Then there is the acting direction. This is very clever stuff. OK he's been borrowing a lot, mainly from Kubrick (Shining) and the Coens (Fargo). Nevertheless, this work is really impressive. And miracle (;-)), Gibson actually played the game! Thanks God, he did! Maybe he was not really aware of what Shyamalan was doing with him, who cares as the result is here for us to enjoy. Phoenix was a pretty clever choice as he's a natural for this kind of stuff. He does know what it's about, and fills exactly the right space. I'm curious to see what will be Phoenix's next works. I think he should meet Cronenberg sometime.So Shyamalan seems to have made his choice to be an artistic director, there with the Coens, Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch and others. Well he has good chances to succeed. But it seems he still has to gain more independance.Because I can't believe that he actually thinks that the way he uses music is near to adequate (from an artistic point of view). Please. The best parts are the ones without any music, and thankfully there are plenty of them. Good. But when there IS music, a much better one would be needed. We have lots of good movie composers nowadays, just pick one.And I can't believe that this incredible happy ending, with its pedestrian, dull moral subtext, is what he intended with this story that until then was packed with dense, clever, subversive subtext. I HOPE he did not. I HOPE he's going to gain more independance and become a real free artist. Then when he talks about faith, he'll do it HIS way until the very end of the story.I know there are a lot out there who'd love him to keep on making soapy, sweetened, viewer-friendly flicks like the Sixth Sense, but I'm among those who are expecting much more quality, challenging stuff from such a talented person. Would Signs be... a sign that it's going to happen? Have faith ;-)!

While it does have faults (the first third drags, a bit, Luthor's 'gang' is too cartoonish, the 'science' of the film is contradictory, and Christopher Reeve's 'Clark Kent' can be a bit grating, at times) there is a genuine love and respect of the character and the legend. For a film produced during the decade of Watergate, it's faith in the basic humanity of people, with a hero who truly believed in Truth, Justice, and the American Way, was remarkable, in itself, and the production's overwhelming success not only proved that people embraced the 'Man of Steel', but the basic values he represented. While our world is even more complex and jaded, today, SUPERMAN still touches what is best and brightest in us all, and the character holds his own VERY well against his cinema descendants, Batman, Blade, Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil, and the Hulk. Perhaps today's crop of superheroes are flashier, but certainly none are more noble than Krypton's Last Son.From the opening sequence, with a theater curtain opening, and scratchy images and music (a homage to Action Comics, where Superman first appeared, in 1938, and the famous Fleischer animated short films of the early forties), through the long 'Krypton' sequence, introducing a doomed, intellectually superior yet sterile society, and Superman's father, Jor-El, played with cool authority by Marlon Brando (who deserved his huge paycheck!), the groundwork is set for the arrival of the alien orphan in an intergalactic Star Crystal, with his civilization's knowledge, but requiring humanity and love to balance it. The child's Earthly foster parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (screen legends Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter) would provide loving guidance and an understanding of the fragility of life to 'Clark', in a Smallville sequence VERY similar in tone to the current 'Smallville' TV series, until his birth father's 'spirit' beckons him, at 18, and spends the next ten years completing the child's education, of both his powers, and his responsibilities. The remainder of the film creates the Superman Universe so familiar to three generations of fans; mild-mannered 'Clark Kent' gets a job at the 'Daily Planet', working with Lois Lane (feisty Margot Kidder), ebullient Jimmy Olsen (Marc McClure, in his most famous role), and Perry White (played with cigar-chomping élan by screen veteran Jackie Cooper). In a spectacular 'first night in Metropolis' sequence, Superman 'reveals' himself, flying up to catch Lois Lane and a falling helicopter (I've got you...YOU'VE got ME??? Who's got YOU???), capturing a second-story criminal, rescuing a cat from a tree, stopping a large-scale armed robbery, and, to top things off, saving the President and Air Force One. All this brings Superman to the attention of criminal genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman, who is wickedly funny, and nearly steals the film), who has an agenda that will make him rich, kill millions of innocents, and will require the elimination of the only man 'worthy' to be his opponent. Despite his reliance on a 'gang' of two near-idiots (voluptuous but shrill Valerie Perrine and rotund Ned Beatty), Luthor deduces what Kryptonite (a little souvenir from the old home town) will do to Superman, and the stage is set for a spectacular, Earth-shattering climax.With a beautiful love story (Kidder and Reeve have terrific chemistry as Lois and Clark\/Superman), Christopher Reeve's inspired casting as the Man of Steel (a virtual unknown when the film was released, he is PERFECT in the role, a wonderful successor to George Reeves' television counterpart), and the majestic score of John Williams, SUPERMAN is a triumph, and still sets the standard for 'Superhero' films.

It is exactly like it.It is hard to say what is my favourite scene but the sniper shooting the german in the church tower is brilliant and perfectly done.I've had enough of war films that show people getting shot and falling gracefully to the ground, in SPR they show it how it is, ugly and very cruel. If you want proof see the news clip of the Yanks executing the young vietnamese boys in the street. SPR brilliant. ","genre":"Action, Drama, War"}]
