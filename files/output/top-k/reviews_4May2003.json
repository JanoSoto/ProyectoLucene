We're living through another film renaissance, almost like the 1960s, with films such as Being John Malkovich, L.A. Confidential, American Beauty, and Chicago.  Everyone laments the largely pathetic output of today's corporate Hollywood production machine, but these films are among those who prove that high-profile culture isn't dead in America just yet.  Donnie Darko might belong among these thoughtful, painstakingly assembled films if only it had more substance.For some reason, this film is set in 1988, apparently only to include 80s music in the soundtrack like Echo and the Bunnymen (was this a coincidence?).  The only 1988 reference in the entire film is the presidential race.  So why 1988?  By the way, it's always amusing to see the number of ways that time travel, an old Hollywood standby, is incorporated into films.  This time it's some nonsense about worm holes.The film isn't all bad  Frank is one of the most fascinating, layered characters since Dr. Lecter, and watching the unraveling of who he really is is like a mystical journey.  Though the idea of Frank as spiritual guide is intriguing, it is an empty gesture.  What purpose does it serve to teach someone a life lesson if they're, ahem, ultimately unable to use it? As beautifully subtle as most of the film is, it is the jarring baseball-bat-to-the-head inferences that bother me the most.  Donnie's teacher could not be any more conveniently repressed; any teacher who doesn't know the difference between Lorne Greene and Grahame Greene should be fired.  Then later on, the same teacher tells Donnie's mother that she believes she `isn't committed to Sparkle Motion' (the high school dance troupe).  I think it's supposed to be a funny vignette, but it's not at home in this movie; John Waters would have more use for it.No purpose is served by exposing Cunningham.  It adds nothing to the story other than that it hints that Frank might be real, and even then it's a stretch; you would think that an omniscient time-traveling one-eyed man would be powerful enough to set the fire himself.  And even then, the pessimistic expectation that the entire house would burn down and leave Cunningham's porn collection untouched for the authorities to discover would be just the motivation not to do it and instead simply alert the police.  Whatever.It's easy to see why this film and the Matrix are so popular with young people  they fulfill the aching question about the supposed unseen, influential force that directs peoples' lives.  Predestination was always a popular notion in uncertain times, because it meant that everything really wasn't your fault.  Since times will be uncertain for years to come, expect to see more of these fanciful films that reduce humanity to cogs in a giant wheel, like Magnolia.  I guess it's easier to believe in that than the fact that you make your own decisions and have to live with them.  In other words, if you're unhappy, most of the time it's your fault. There are sites devoted to picking this film apart, endlessly searching for buried symbolism; someone needs to tell these people that if you look hard enough, you'll find what you're looking for.  You need to be over thirty to understand that.On the plus side, the acting is good all around.  Drew Barrymore is wonderful as a liberal english teacher, and it is great to see Katharine Ross again.  This film is worth watching if you want to see something that breaks out of the mold, even if the effort falls far short of the mark.  With more editing, this could have been a great film.

Anyways I rented this movie like a year after its release, and I totally blew me away!I have always been a fan of the series (the old ones, X-men, evolution is kinda stupid), so I know quite a bit about the story line and the characters; and this movie didn't disappoint me one bit.  It is very well written and the characters are portrayed excellent.  Especial mention to Sir Ian McKellen, whose performance of Magneto was the most convincing performance in the whole movie.  Patrick Stewart was excellent too, the director of casting did a great job, nobody could have done that role better than him. Hugh Jackman was pretty good as Wolverine too, just like in the comics, a bad-a$$ guy with a bad attitude, but with good intentions.  Anna Pakin was great as Rogue too, she was still insecure of her abilities and she shows her emotions (fear, insecurity) very well.  James Marsden was ok as Cyclops, he could have done way better though.  I was a little dissapointed not to see some of my favorite X-men in the movie, like Gambit, thus movie would have been even better if Gambit would have been in the story.  Well the plot is great, the dialogs are even better, some people say they were cheesy, I really don't think so, or maybe it was that the performance was so good that I don't even noticed.  The music was very good too, and also the direction.Well I definitely loved this movie, it's one of the greatest movies that come from a comic (especial mention to Superman I & II, Batman I & II, and Spider-man).  This is a must-see, whether you have seen or read the comics before, I highly recommend everybody to see it! ****1\/2 out of ***** ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 May 2003","score":"","review":"  A lame film, yes. But how did it ever get into the bottom 100??I can't believe there are people out there who actually manage to hate this film. Ok the plot is weak, characterisation non-existent, and most of the acting ranges from poor to mediocre, but it has a number of small things going for it and one very big thing (hey don't get excited girls)The plot may be lame, but c'mon, you have to give it points for focusing on it rather then bogging down the run time with masses of pointless subplots. Hell even the obliquity romantic subplot is pushed so far into the background so as to be almost unnoticeable. It's not a laugh a minute, but some of the lines did strike me as funny. Yeah yeah I have a lame sense of humour, but it's not like I get to choose what I find funny.Neither of these two points are any reason at all to watch the film. There is in fact only one reason to do that. Raul Julia. Wow. If you're playing an insane megalomaniacal villain you have to go all the way or the whole thing falls down. Raul Julia goes all the way, then a little bit further. The screen positively lights up when ever he's on it, frankly the film is worth watching once just to see him in action. I would go as far as to say that Bison is now one my favourite film villains ever, and the only thing that stops this film from becoming utterly forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it's still a bad film, but Raul Julia's performance prevents me from hating it.I am surprised to see it so widely panned. C'mon, it's a street fighter movie, what did you expect?? You didn't go into this looking for an emotionally moving experience with numerous fine understated performances, and if you did you're a moron. It's action fluff, that's all it aims to be, and on that level the film is a success.I have no idea what to rate this film. On one hand it's a piece of crap, on the other I can't slam a movie that had such a great villain. Watch it, but keep your expectations low and you won't be (to) disappointed.Character by character line up (in no particular order).Bison - well I just went into how great I thought Raul Julia was in this film. A+Guile - huh?? Who cast Jean Claude Van Damme as an American soldier? Once you get past his accent though, he turns in a fair performance. Make no mistake though, that accent is very distracting for the most part. Weren't there any American action guys (with smaller salaries) available? C+Cammy - again with the casting. Why is Kylie Minogue playing a British solider when she's Australian? Granted the American audience won't notice, but it was bothering me for the whole film. Anyway a small part, and again a fair (if dull) performance despite the accent. CKen + Ryu - well their both fairly interchangeable (hey just like the game). They both look fairly good in a fight (or at least their body doubles do), and when their required to actually say something they do a fine (albeit bland) job. C+Zangief - the main source of the comic relief. Hey I liked this guy, and the accent actually fits! Wow! B+Dee-Jay - apparently he's the computer guy. Huh? So why's he called Dee-Jay? The name made much more sense in the game. A lot of his part consisted of having to look at Zangief when the Russian makes a stupid comment. Not very demanding, but he it done well. BE.Honda - this guy sucks. Only the Godzilla reference while fighting Zangief was funny. Otherwise he was just another good guy. Ho-hum. DBalrog - like E.Honda. only without the funny Godzilla bit. D-Vega - well he's not in it very much, just around for the fight scenes which make assessing his character difficult. Still, from what little we got he was good. CSegat - suffered from being the second villain to Bison. Hell anyone would have paled next to that, but the fact that you actually noticed Segat in comparison says a lot. C+Dhalism - yep, he's in it. He's the nice doctor bloke in case you where wondering. Utterly different from what he was like in the game, they really only made him the doctor because there was no other place for him. D+Blanka - green guy with a dumb wig. Sounds interesting? It isn't. Still, the wig was funny. D+T.Hawk - who? His name was only mentioned once in passing, he was one of the generic solider guys. Seriously, they could have cut him out and noone would notice.

The fact that the events in the film are not true does not take away anything of the films quality. On the contrary, the story is quite intriguing and very thrilling and I must say I thought it was very well thought of. This intriguing and thrilling story I am talking about, of course is made up by the fictional part of the film, but there is more to this film than the fictional part. There is also the thought provoking and maybe even funny side of De Sade's writing that also leaves quite a mark on the film. And this is the part, which really makes this film. Where some films lose the essence of the main character this film succeeds in preserving it and presenting it in a charming and quite funny manner. During the film, the viewer is able to understand the people who read de Sade as well as those who burnt his books. I mean just think of the things he wrote and imagine yourself 200 years ago. Of course there were turmoils. But also imagine yourself when you were younger, when everything that was bad or forbidden was a thrill and you did it, even if it was just for kicks. These two reactions are both perfectly human, although I cannot say whether the treatment and imprisonment of de Sade was quite accurate. I mean the funny thing about the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was that people probably knew some of the 'perversions' (such as being homosexual) described in the books, but it was not common to speak of them let alone write them down.The good story and the great depiction of the time in which the film takes place would not have been so thrilling, exciting and interesting as they were had it not been for all the involved actors and of course the director. Any film can have good basics, but what really makes a good film in the end are good actors and a good guiding hand. I dare not say too much about the acting specifically, because I am afraid I won't praise an actor or actress enough on his or her great performance, but I dare say this if there were Oscars to be won for ensemble's of actors, this film would have gotten ones! As far as the directing goes, I want to say this Kaufman succeeded not only in bringing the spirit of the time but also the essence of the Marquis de Sade to the screen and he did that splendidly.

The story seems made for it. Experienced old real-life marshal Wyatt Earp teaches callus young phony cowboy Tom Mix how to solve a crime. Dragnet on a 1920s back lot. But it wasn't that way at all.It's true enough that Earp (Garner) hung around Hollywood at the time, or maybe a bit earlier. We don't really get to know much about his past. But although Mix (Willis) drove expensive cars and wore flashy suits and big hats, he wasn't a phony. He'd been a real cowboy too, was a great rider, fought in the Spanish-American war, and could take care of himself. Instead of the expected clash between the master and the tyro, we get two guys who pretty much hit it off with one another right away, and show mutual respect.It's an interesting friendship.But then the movie turns darker. A murder takes place. There are fist fights (mostly comic) and several shootouts (done seriously). Willis is kind of cocky. Garner displays the laconic off-hand dignity he showed in Murphy's Romance, or whatever it was. He's an icon here, with that black outfit and mustache. He's never been a flashy actor, but invariably a competent one. Off-screen he's come up with some dandy spontaneous comments about how the social world of Hollywood and the rest of the country is structured. He's got my vote. Willis isn't bad either.The rest of the cast does yeoman work but no one has roles that are as interesting as those of the two leads. And the murder story fails to grip the viewer, at least this viewer. I didn't really find myself caring who did it, although it was clear from the beginning who the villains were. There was an exception, though, the British actress playing Garner's former lover. She's simply outstanding in a supporting part, and provides a great example of how to be beautiful without being beautiful. I wish the film didn't seem kind of -- I suppose lost is the word. It meanders between comedy, drama, and warmth, without seeming to know just what it wants to do. This isn't a total failure on Edwards' part. It holds together as a story but the characters bounce off one another. Henry Mancini, who wrote many scores for Edwards' films, shows his versatility here.The score is quiet and unobtrusive (except for one or two brass bands that seem to follow Tom Mix around) and is punctuated by contemporary recordings, including one by Duke Ellington. The photography is first rate. It must be getting hard to find locations that look like Southern California looked in the 1920s before the irruption of humans and their artifacts. It's worth watching. But I don't know where that title came from. Sunset. What is the sun setting on? Not Earp. He's old but not doddering, and he can shoot and make love even at the risk of permanent damage. It's not setting on Hollywood, which would continue to book for another two generations or so. I suppose we'll settle for its being one of those generic titles that could mean anything. Another Dawn. Guns of Darkness. On the Edge. Sunset. The Muppets Conquer the Mustang Ranch.

He'd been a real cowboy too, was a great rider, fought in the Spanish-American war, and could take care of himself. Instead of the expected clash between the master and the tyro, we get two guys who pretty much hit it off with one another right away, and show mutual respect.It's an interesting friendship.But then the movie turns darker. A murder takes place. There are fist fights (mostly comic) and several shootouts (done seriously). Willis is kind of cocky. Garner displays the laconic off-hand dignity he showed in Murphy's Romance, or whatever it was. He's an icon here, with that black outfit and mustache. He's never been a flashy actor, but invariably a competent one. Off-screen he's come up with some dandy spontaneous comments about how the social world of Hollywood and the rest of the country is structured. He's got my vote. Willis isn't bad either.The rest of the cast does yeoman work but no one has roles that are as interesting as those of the two leads. And the murder story fails to grip the viewer, at least this viewer. I didn't really find myself caring who did it, although it was clear from the beginning who the villains were. There was an exception, though, the British actress playing Garner's former lover. She's simply outstanding in a supporting part, and provides a great example of how to be beautiful without being beautiful. I wish the film didn't seem kind of -- I suppose lost is the word. It meanders between comedy, drama, and warmth, without seeming to know just what it wants to do. This isn't a total failure on Edwards' part. It holds together as a story but the characters bounce off one another. Henry Mancini, who wrote many scores for Edwards' films, shows his versatility here.The score is quiet and unobtrusive (except for one or two brass bands that seem to follow Tom Mix around) and is punctuated by contemporary recordings, including one by Duke Ellington. The photography is first rate. It must be getting hard to find locations that look like Southern California looked in the 1920s before the irruption of humans and their artifacts.

It draws attention to the emptiness in my life, such as mundane conferences, playing instruments alone in an apartment, and paranoia.I have some random thoughts which occurred to me while watching this three times in the last two days.First if all, it's interesting to hear Coppola's sounds.  Besides the interesting sounds associated with the tape, the horrific sounds which occur at the time of the 'murder', banging on the piano with those odd synthesized horn sounds, are clearly tied to the sounds he used on Apocalypse Now.As for the piano soundtrack, it reminds me directly of the piano soundtrack in Bullitt.  Basically, it sounds like the same exact chord progressions and melancholy tempo.  In many respects, this film can be seen as a more introspective, less sexy version of Bullitt, both investigators getting personally caught up and estranged in their research, in San Francisco.The more times I've seen this, the more I see that ambiguities are a part of the picture.  I can't resolve certain crucial issues.  Here are some examples1. In order for that blonde chick to run off with his tapes, one must assume that his recently defected good buddy, and the guy he defected to, and possibly his other buddy as well, are in on the scheme and have collaborated with his client's assistant, which is, frankly, far-fetched to me.2. Hackman is upset when the landlord used a key to gain entrance to his apartment and leave a bottle of wine behind the door and a birthday card, since the landlord should not have had a key nor knowledge of his birthday.   There's an absurdity to this though.  After all, Gene doesn't have one key, but a whole slew of keys and an alarm system blocking his door.  For anyone to have penetrated that, I would imagine Gene should have been not just suspicious, but certain that someone has been invading his area, and, knowing Gene's character, he should have begun an immediate inspection of the premises for theft or tampering.3. If the assistant indeed procured the tapes from Hackman using the blonde as a thief, and if the assistant was a conspirator against the corporate directory, then why would the assistant play the tapes for the director?

It's as if he reconstructs scenes from his imagination.  When he's listening to the conversation in the adjoining hotel room, it's the couple talking, there's no hint of the director in the events leading up to the murder.  He imagines a bloody murder scene, but he never saw one.  He imagines blood bubbling up from the toilet, but clearly that never happened.  In short, it would appear that Hackman's character is crazy and that this film is shot through his eyes.  All this talk about how good Hackman is and how professional (his character is).  Well, is it so?  He gets completely caught up in the emotions of his work, misunderstands everything, and can't even figure out that the bug might be in his saxophone.Other notesI think I remember seeing a version of this film where he has a big safe in his apartment, and he puts the money in there.  I don't see that safe this time, in this version of the movie I'm watching.  Maybe that was another film?Lastly, this film is a real downer.  At moments it's terrifying, but more often it is just alienating.

Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character.  Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage.  Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud.  Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green Goblin&#133;well, let's just say that boy aint right.  They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog.  What is it with the squeaky voices?  About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book.  Couldn't they keep anything authentic?You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings?  Well, about ninety-seven percent of the film contains scenes that are not that.  Which is to say that three percent of the film doesn't contain scenes that are boring and stretched out endlessly until you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a rusty spike.  The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold.  There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene.  Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ.  What was the point of all this?  Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car.  This film is laced with continuity and character problems.  The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react?  By letting them throw trash at him.  Why didn't he just blow them away?  And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding.  If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing.  And the ending is a real problem  Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that?  Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him thata)  it was an accidentb)  his father was really the Green GoblinThis dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever.

The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold.  There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene.  Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ.  What was the point of all this?  Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car.  This film is laced with continuity and character problems.  The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react?  By letting them throw trash at him.  Why didn't he just blow them away?  And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding.  If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing.  And the ending is a real problem  Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that?  Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him thata)  it was an accidentb)  his father was really the Green GoblinThis dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever.    ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"4 May 2003","score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":"  There are spoilers in this review.First of all, the casting of Tobey Maguire for the lead role is the film's biggest mistake.  With his pointy lip, jumbo ears, big nose, and squeaky voice, he resembles Screech from Saved By The Bell (I take it Dustin Diamond wasn't available).  Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character.  Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage.  Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud.  Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green Goblin&#133;well, let's just say that boy aint right.  They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog.  What is it with the squeaky voices?  About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book.  Couldn't they keep anything authentic?You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings?

age crook, Saul is also first rate.He shows the younger guys that age doesn't nesecarrily mean you can't cut it among the young folk any more.The rest which include, Don Cheadle(Sporting a terrible cockney accent but is never the less good in his roll), Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck etc. are all great.Special mention must go to Andy Garcia, who the odd one out as the bad guy of the piece(Even though
