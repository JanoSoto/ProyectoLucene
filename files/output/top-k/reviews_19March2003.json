Mrs.Tingle(Helen Mirren) is the meanest teacher at school who is disliked by everybody. During an incident, Mrs. Tingle accuses Leigh Ann of cheating which of course threatens her future.

I think this was a very fun movie, i can't really put it in a category because it's not really a comedy, nothing about this movie is really funny and it's not a thriller because just too many things were ridiculous. If you are looking to relax and have some fun, then i suggest you should see this movie.

There's nothing `not great' about it.  This is one of those films that is so meticulously crafted and wonderfully acted that it's damn hard to find something wrong with it.  I eventually had to concede that the voice-overs that bookend the film were not necessary, though they didn't hurt the overall film experience.  This is by far the most lovingly photographed and beautifully scored period gangster film since the Coen Brother's `Miller's Crossing' (which was also about Depression-era Irish gangsters), but unlike that film, you never get the uneasy feeling here that you may have been duped into watching a slick parody of the beloved genre.  The cinematography in this film is mind-numbingly gorgeous.  Conrad Hall (who also teamed up with Mendes on `American Beauty') out-does himself here.  Words can't describe how beautiful this movie is to look at.  Almost every scene comes across as a postcard or painting.The acting is top-notch.  Tom Hanks, for the first time in years, reminded me of how great an actor he is.  He plays against type here as a cold hit-man and distant yet still loving father.  This is the first film of his in a long time where I didn't feel like punching his character in the face for being so damn goody-goody and morally upright.  The kid actors aren't great, but they take direction well and deliver their lines effectively.  Paul Newman is fantastic as the Irish `Godfather,' and Jude Law is wonderfully quirky as a for-hire killer who likes to take pictures of the dead for art's sake.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is the only one left with the thankless role of Hank's wife, and one wonders why they didn't cast some nice-looking nobody instead of someone of such talent who deserves a bigger role.The real star of this film, though, is Sam Mendes, the director.  Like all the greats, he shows a great attention to detail.  I loved watching the single bead of sweat form on Tom Hank's brow whilst realizing he just met the man hired to kill him in a quaint road-side diner.  He also shows great restraint.  All of the gory violence is either shown off-screen or from unique and interesting angles (i.e. the son watching his dad shoot a man from a hole in the wall).  Similarly, this could have easily been a three-hour epic, but Mendes keeps it lean and poignant at an expertly paced just under two-hour clip.  He also makes great use of sound in innovative ways (i.e. the rain-soaked machine-gun massacre near the film's end) and proves to be an expert at narrative montage (the bank robbing montage was nothing short of brilliant) to keep things moving in the middle.  He also knows how to get to the heart of the story without making things overly-sentimental.  Directors with similar artistic styles, like Spielberg of Frank Darabont, may have overstated the underlying themes of father\/son relationships and loyalty and betrayal amongst criminal families, but Mendes uses them to their full effect without ever allowing them to weigh down the story like sap.Had this film been released in December instead of last summer, I suspect it would have garnered a Best Picture and Best Director nomination instead of literary hogwash like `The Hours.'  The fact that it still garnered six nominations in mostly technical categories is a testament to the craft that went into it.  Alas, movies shouldn't be made to win Oscars, but to stand the test of time.  In due time, I wouldn't be surprised if this film rests comfortably under the likes of `The Godfather' Trilogy and `Goodfellas' as one of the best gangster films of the modern era, and if not one of the best, at least be renowned as the most artistic.  Meanwhile, if Sam Mendes keeps this up (I can't think of any other current director, except perhaps Anthony Minghella, who makes such heavy-handed and artistic direction seem restrained and effortless) he will undoubtedly be hailed as one of the all-time greats, and this will be viewed as one of his early `classics.'
