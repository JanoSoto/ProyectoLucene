The cop had no choice but upon showing up at the funeral the father voices his hate. Yun-Fat spares the cop's son and meets Mira Sorvino who concocts an I.D. card until her residence becomes plastered with bullet holes. Lame and predictable with director Antoine Fuqua handling the action, which may be the only ambitious element of the film. Yun-Fat rises above the material playing a guy who can express mercy to those unable to defend themselves such as the boy he is ordered to target. Sorvino is hardly involved and exists mainly as a possible love interest. Michael Rooker as the cop is placed in a difficult position but will realize that Yun-Fat is not against him. Kenneth Tsang plays the true villain whining over losses. The action is fast and furious but the screenplay is dull and full of familiarity. The third act is basically one huge violent blow out where the good guys triumph and the bad guys wish they had signed on to a better film.

Under the leadership of renegade Jedi Master Count Dooku, thousands of systems threaten to secede from the Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padme Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo. Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon the Jedi, Anakin, Padme and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the separatist movement, and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy the Clone Wars.The story is fast paced, lots of stuff goes on in this 2 hours and 22 minute long film that really makes this movie an improvement over the last film. The thrills in this film are much more awesome.The action is more incredible and I will say, there are more lightsaber duels and big battles. My favorite lightsaber duels are the Jedi and the Droids fighting on the planet Geonosis and the final fight between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Yoda and Count Dooku.I was surprised and this is my only main criticism and this is why this STAR WARS film, along with STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE, appeared on my list of Top 10 Underrated Movies on IMDb on my profile Despite this film being an improvement over the previous film, the ending was confusing for me. I'm not gonna give that away, but I will say that to have this movie end with Anakin and Padme getting married in secret, could have been done a lot more better.From an acting perspective, this film does wonders. Ewan McGregor returns as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and he does an incredible job this time around, but he has his good parts and bad parts in the film. Natalie Portman returns as Padme Amidala and she does really good in both the romantic and non-romantic scenes, but the only romantic scene I actually have a problem with is her character and Anakin kiss at her home in Naboo. Hayden Christensen may not be good as Anakin Skywalker in a few scenes, but some scenes he does struggle.Frank Oz returns as Yoda, but this time, Yoda is CGI and he does an incredible job with the voice. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Mace Windu and he does an incredible job in the movie, especially having a lot more screen time and is fantastic in the action sequences. Ian McDiarmid is good as Chancellor Palpatine \/ Darth Sidious. Jar Jar is the one who gives Palpatine emergency powers and this would play a huge part in the next film.The rest of the cast is amazing and Kenny Baker & Anthony Daniels does great once again as C3PO and R2-D2.The other criticism that I have is some of the dialogue. Lucas wanted to make the romantic scenes old-fashioned, but there is one problem This was in 2002 and no teen could understand this, but I can.His directing is once again top-notch, and this was the film that was the first film to have a turning point in special effects together.My next criticism is that there is just WAY TOO MUCH CGI used in this film. I don't mind CGI at all, but there is nothing practical in this film at all and this film had a $115 million dollar budget and you could not use anything practical.The music by John Williams, is as always fantastic to hear and he was composing Minority Report, Catch Me If You Can and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when he was doing music for this film and my favorite music cue is the romantic ballad, Across the Stars. The orchestra was just amazing for this musical score and the choir in the action sequences were really amazing.I think I have to bring up another criticism, which is gonna be my final one and that is some of the acting The acting in a few scenes is a little stupid, but it is some scenes in the film where I think the actors tried their best to read George Lucas' poor dialogue. This film is a great improvement over the last film and really intense and fun.Hayden Christensen's performance may have you say something bad about him, but he is a good actor overall.Overall, STAR WARS EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES is really good and my favorite along with EPISODE III REVENGE OF THE SITH and all three films in the original trilogy. The action is more better, the dialogue is still a problem, but works in this film, the visual effects and action sequences is really fantastic and amazing, the music and production values are incredible. It's very close to getting a 10 out of 10 stars, so overall, I give this an 8 out of 10 and definitely something I can re-watch again.I will wrap up my STAR WARS prequel trilogy with the third and final chapter of the prequel trilogy STAR WARS EPISODE III REVENGE OF THE SITH.

Richard Curtis, ever the feel good rom com maestro, launches another sugar covered love story at us with this irresistible premise. Sure, it's ludicrous, but for many this will be just escapist as many of today's blockbusters. A perfectly cast Hugh Grant plays the bookstore owner, and an even more perfectly cast Julia Roberts plays the actress superstar. Together, they're a dynamite romantic couple, although the film around them lacks a bit. In stark contrast to the giddy laughs of Love Actually, the loopiness of About Time and smart, razor sharp wit of Curtis' crowning achievement Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill is a bit dead. It's not particularly funny with Curtis' jokes falling flatter than usual and the film drags itself out over 2 hours, which really wasn't necessary. It's more dull than other Working Title films and populated with many offensive British caricatures. Normally Curtis' eccentric, bumbling British middle class citizens are entertaining but here it's just a bit offensive and also not very funny.NH has its many dips, but is made more enjoyable by its leads. Hugh Grant is very likable as the main character and while he's pretty much playing the same character he did in Four Weddings, he does it very well. In fact, possibly even better. Julia Roberts is the complete star of the show and she's aggressively likable as the Hollywood superstar actress, but more importantly she brings a vulnerable, insecure side of her character out too. Despite the lack of effective humour, the film is undeniably charming and the film is very uplifting and is also an original rom com. Emotionally, it more or less delivers for all of its characters and thankfully this time Curtis actually includes a bit of conflict in the story, something which is mostly absent from his other movies. It's not a great film and can be fairly dull at times, although to be fair it's possible Richard Curtis was aiming for a different tone. A decent rom com; not as fun as other Working Title films, lowered by a lack of laughs, irritating secondary characters and overlength, raised by a decent amount of emotion, good acting and decent direction.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 April 2015","score":"","review":" Hugh Grant, a man who has a fairly rubbish love life and owns one of the worst bookstores ever has a romance with a hugely famous film actress.

A decent rom com; not as fun as other Working Title films, lowered by a lack of laughs, irritating secondary characters and overlength, raised by a decent amount of emotion, good acting and decent direction.6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 April 2015","score":"","review":" One Hour Photo (2002) Dir Mark Romanef \/ Cast Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan.

The people who read all kinds of life affirmation into it watch only the ending ignoring the bulk of the film. Spoilers ahead; First let's be clear about our terms nihilism is the denial of life as a value. It is the view portrayed more bluntly in Basic Instinct that life is worthless or full of suffering and pain. My problem is yes the ending is beautiful; one of the most beautiful scenes ever put to film. Why my friends did Hauer save Ford? Only when Ford defiantly spits at Hauer before his death fall does Hauer grab him. Then we are treated to that moving soliloquy on the beauty hauer has seen and how all this will perish with him like tears in the rain. I ask the votaries of the film let's look at what proceeded this undeniably powerful epiphany? The rest of the film consists of replicants brutally killing anyone they meet; deckard does his fair share of keeping up with their violence. IS THIS LIFE AFFIRMING? How about the scene of deckard taking a half hour on the picture to find the snake woman's face BORING. The film moves like a glacier. The killing of the left behind garbage man who is considered genetic garbage by the elite is both overdone and extirpates all sympathy for Hauer. I challenge the film's worshipers to admit they would wish to live in the dark nihilistic toilet bowl that is Ridley Scott's vision of that time and place. I cannot help but think that the life affirming ending was the studio's last gasp at putting some light into this stygian dystopian nightmare. Yes i get that it is allegorical about racism, genderism etc. but this is even more depressing. Let us not make our hero Hauer gouge out some helpless pathetic lonely misfits' eyes or the poor eye worker. It does not exactly further the positive message he wishes to champion. Again, the ending is actually the opposite in tone and meaning then the other 98% of the film. Also why Hauer does this is so often misunderstood; he could have killed deckard many times before this moment. He toys with him because of his rage at Priss' murder. It is deckards' defiance his spitting up at Hauer that causes Hauer to grab him. In other words he is saved because of his rage and hatred which Hauer admires and uses to wipe everyone he meets out who is not a replicant. Ridley Scott's ALIEN is a masterpiece; this work is vastly overrated. About 10 years ago it was canonized and it is currently considered the height of gauche to dare comment how dreadfully boring nihilistic cruel and tragically held up as high art it has now become. It is so ugly visually and that ugliness is much deeper a cruel nihilistic spirit pervades and suffocates the film.

The vehicle driven by Erin, an unemployed, twice-divorced mother of three, is broadsided by a speeding car at an intersection. She takes her case to a rumpled, cowed lawyer Ed Masry, who agrees to represent her on a contingency basis. However, in court, Erin's surly manner and blasphemous vocabulary do not endear her to the jury, which finds itself in the defendant's favor, as Erin goes home empty-handed. Still without work and needing to pay her bills, Erin, who has no demonstrable skills, but a passion, an uncommon quantity of common sense, and a defiant way of talking, finagles her way into a position as a file clerk under her former attorney.It is in this capacity that she uncovers, entirely by accident, a paper trail leading to the town of Hinkley, CA, where an endless stream of residents have been diagnosed with various medical conditions including cancer, disintegrating spinal cords and brain damage. It turns out that the community of Hinkley has been poisoned by hexavalent chromium, leaching into the drinking water from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plant. The case is especially odious because PG&E knew exactly what it was doing but lied about what kind of chromium it was using. Erin gains the trust of the community to mount legal action and strong-arms Ed to put together a case that would win the largest direct claim settlement in American history, even as her personal life is threatened by her devotion to the case.Steven Soderbergh tests Erin's limits of likability numerous times throughout the movie. An early scene is designed to show what a short fuse Erin has when she explodes in a torrent of profanity in the courtroom. Erin, the film makes clear early on, is no sentimental crusader. Rather, she is a tough, hard-nosed cookie who dresses like a hoochie and who would use anything from here heavily coiffured hair to her cleavage or also her baby to get what she needs. In short, Erin is adrift in a hard world. But what makes this potentially despicable character so affable is Julia Roberts' vulnerable and fiercely dynamic performance. As the eponymous character, she is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. As a foil for Erin, Albert Finney draws out a complex, engaging performance that is as warm as it is funny. Their scenes together crackle with chemistry and it's a joy to see this kind of male\/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction. Soderbergh infuses the proceedings with a vibrant, almost peppy sense of style that would not have been half as compelling had a less edgy director helmed it. It would have been easy for him to have allowed Erin Brockovich to descend into manipulative melodrama, but he resists that path of least resistance, instead giving us a film that is smart, savvy, funny, and, at times, poignant.

It's a scary movie that influenced other scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Saw, Hostel and Paranormal Activity and it is the reason why we have Freddy Krueger, one of the most iconic horror villains on the screen.The original 1984 classic is written and directed by Wes Craven and was released on November 9, 1984 and it's distributor, New Line Cinema from going bankrupt and spawn a multi-media franchise, including eight sequels, a 2010 reboot of the same name, produced by Michael Bay and starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger, video games, comic books, a TV show and a crossover between the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and Friday the 13th franchise, which was titled Freddy vs. Jason, and released in 2003. The plot deals with a killer named Freddy Kreuger attacking Nancy Thompson and her friends in their dreams, successfully killing all but Nancy, in fictional Springwood, Ohio. Krueger's back-story is revealed by Nancy's mother, Marge, who explains that he was a child murderer. The parents of Springwood killed Kreuger after he was acquitted on a technically. Nancy defeats Freddy by pulling him out of the dream world and stripping him of his powers when she stops being afraid of him.The original Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic for me because at the time I was growing up, I really did not know what a scary movie was until I got my first taste in 2003 when I saw Freddy vs. Jason and that's when I started to like scary movies.Robert Englund plays the role of Freddy Krueger and he would remain in that part for all eight original Nightmare on Elm Steet films, but would soon be played by Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 version. Now, I can't say which actor is better as Freddy Krueger because I like both of them. I know my sister LeeAnn is going to curse me out for saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. I actually prefer both actors playing Freddy Krueger. Sure, Jackie Earle Haley may not have the comedic stuff like Robert Englund, but he does do one thing right play the part of Krueger in a scary way, much like Englund does in the original 1984 film and it's sequels. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy Thompson and she would play the part of Nancy again in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and she would also play herself and Nancy in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Johnny Depp plays Glen in the first film of his career and a lot of people said that this is his worst performance, but I actually like him in the first Freddy Krueger film. Jsu Garcia and Amanda Wyss plays Tina and Rod and they are good in the time they have on screen. John Saxon plays Lt. Don Thompson and he is just amazing. The music composed by Charles Bernstein is amazing and really amazing and I really liked the musical score. The movie's tension and suspense builds up to each nightmare in the film. My favorite nightmare is when Nancy is in the bathtub and Freddy's claw comes out of the water and tries to kill her, but she drowns and she eventually gets out.The visuals were impressive for 1984 and they are just as incredible now as they were back then. The editing and dialogue is memorable as heck and this movie is really cool and impressive.The style and tone of this movie is really dark and serious and it is very good for this kind of scary movie. The sequels were also cool and amazing, but the only one I had mixed feelings about is the fifth film, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child. But, I will get to that in a later review. Overall, the original 1984 version of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is really well directed, well-written, darn good acted and has a great musical theme that tells you that Freddy Kreuger is coming for you.

It's a scary movie that influenced other scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Saw, Hostel and Paranormal Activity and it is the reason why we have Freddy Krueger, one of the most iconic horror villains on the screen.The original 1984 classic is written and directed by Wes Craven and was released on November 9, 1984 and it's distributor, New Line Cinema from going bankrupt and spawn a multi-media franchise, including eight sequels, a 2010 reboot of the same name, produced by Michael Bay and starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger, video games, comic books, a TV show and a crossover between the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and Friday the 13th franchise, which was titled Freddy vs. Jason, and released in 2003. The plot deals with a killer named Freddy Kreuger attacking Nancy Thompson and her friends in their dreams, successfully killing all but Nancy, in fictional Springwood, Ohio. Krueger's back-story is revealed by Nancy's mother, Marge, who explains that he was a child murderer. The parents of Springwood killed Kreuger after he was acquitted on a technically. Nancy defeats Freddy by pulling him out of the dream world and stripping him of his powers when she stops being afraid of him.The original Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic for me because at the time I was growing up, I really did not know what a scary movie was until I got my first taste in 2003 when I saw Freddy vs. Jason and that's when I started to like scary movies.Robert Englund plays the role of Freddy Krueger and he would remain in that part for all eight original Nightmare on Elm Steet films, but would soon be played by Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 version. Now, I can't say which actor is better as Freddy Krueger because I like both of them. I know my sister LeeAnn is going to curse me out for saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. I actually prefer both actors playing Freddy Krueger. Sure, Jackie Earle Haley may not have the comedic stuff like Robert Englund, but he does do one thing right play the part of Krueger in a scary way, much like Englund does in the original 1984 film and it's sequels. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy Thompson and she would play the part of Nancy again in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and she would also play herself and Nancy in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Johnny Depp plays Glen in the first film of his career and a lot of people said that this is his worst performance, but I actually like him in the first Freddy Krueger film. Jsu Garcia and Amanda Wyss plays Tina and Rod and they are good in the time they have on screen. John Saxon plays Lt. Don Thompson and he is just amazing. The music composed by Charles Bernstein is amazing and really amazing and I really liked the musical score. The movie's tension and suspense builds up to each nightmare in the film. My favorite nightmare is when Nancy is in the bathtub and Freddy's claw comes out of the water and tries to kill her, but she drowns and she eventually gets out.The visuals were impressive for 1984 and they are just as incredible now as they were back then. The editing and dialogue is memorable as heck and this movie is really cool and impressive.The style and tone of this movie is really dark and serious and it is very good for this kind of scary movie. The sequels were also cool and amazing, but the only one I had mixed feelings about is the fifth film, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child. But, I will get to that in a later review. Overall, the original 1984 version of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is really well directed, well-written, darn good acted and has a great musical theme that tells you that Freddy Kreuger is coming for you. The movie is gory in some scenes, but it has a purpose for being in the movie, which I like and I have no problem re-watching the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise over and over again, especially the 1984 film, the 2010 remake and the 2003 crossover with Friday the 13th.

This film was very well written, and its 1990's film elements make it very enjoyable to watch. Sling Blade is about a special needs man named Karl Childers (played by Billy Bob Thornton) who once released from a mental hospital for murdering his mother and her boyfriend, befriends a young boy named Frank (played by Lucas Black) and his family. The acting done by Thornton was absolutely phenomenal, considering the fact that he had to play the role of a mentally insane human. One of my favorite aspects of this movie is that although Karl came from a mental institution for murder, he has such a big heart and emotional background. Frank and his mother, Linda (played by Natalie Canerday), live with a cruel alcoholic named Doyle that brings their life a lot of trouble. Karl and Franks relationship is heartwarming, because although they are years apart, they love, care, and protect each other. Linda enjoys Karl's friendship with her son because Frank loves his company, but Doyle doesn't approve because he is crazy and a stupid retard. Dwight Yoakam (the man that plays Doyle) did a successful job at doing what the director wanted him to do, which I believe is making viewers hate Doyle. This film brought me to tears, and I think in a way that's why I enjoyed it so much. It was so emotional and beautifully written, and the acting never failed to impress me.

Freddy's goal is to create new Elm Streets, and begin a new killing spree after having killed of all of the children in Springwood.Maggie, utilizing new dreams techniques, uncovers Krueger's past, which include being taunted by schoolmates for being the son of 100 maniacs, being cruel to animals, beaten by his stepfather, the murder of his own wife when she discovers he has been killing children and the moment when the Dream Demons arrive in his boiler room to make him the offer of eternal life. Eventually, Maggie pulls Freddy out of the dream world and uses a pipe bomb to blow him up.The story is a little scary, but also funny as heck. It is considered the worst idea for the movie, but it works for me and to say the least, it is the best of A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, for me, along with the 1984 and 2010 versions of the original film, the 2003 crossover film with Jason Voorhees, the fourth film, the third and second film and Wes Craven's New Nightmare.Like I said, the only Nightmare on Elm Street film I have mixed emotions over is A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child.There's not much to say about the visuals and design, but they are incredible as they were back in 1991, when this film came out.

Annette Bening is having reoccurring dreams about a young girl being led into an apple orchard by a stranger. Another dream involves a boy tied to a bed while a Church is flooding. The girl turns out to be her daughter whose body is found in the lake. The boy in the flood is an escape mental patient whom Bening connects within her own cell when her husband has her committed. She is driven mad since these dreams seem to be coming from someone else. Intriguing and daring thriller about tortured minds effectively realized by director Neil Jordan who previously made The Crying Game and Michael Collins. Bening does a fine job as a woman who is haunted by images that she doesn't fully comprehend. Aiden Quinn as her husband seems to be there only to lose faith in her and see her as crazy. Robert Downey Jr. has a crucial role that is unlike anything he has done before and it works. Katie Sagona plays Bening's daughter. Paul Guilfoyle plays a detective but the role is not as interesting as the case he is out to crack. While the ending is somewhat hogwash, it is still an entertaining thriller that is visually stunning and mind boggling at best.

Before Freddy can kill Kristen, she transfers her dream powers to Alice, a friend from school.Alice begins inadvertently providing victims for Freddy when she begins pulling people into her dreams while she sleeps. Alice, who begins taking on the friends who were murdered, confronts Freddy. She uses the power of the Dream Master to release all the souls Freddy has taken. They subsequently rip themselves from Freddy's body, killing him in the process.The story is really not bad and I really like the dialogue written for each character and the film is just wonderfully shot and edited. The visuals back then in 1988 were really tough to pull off, but it was really cool and amazing for today's world in this day and age.The music is really dark and sinister and the Freddy Krueger theme does play at some point. I love the dark and sinister tone of the film and also comedic at certain points. Freddy Krueger's make-up design is still good as it was in the previous films.The acting is back and fourth at some points. The credit is all given to Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and he is alright in his fourth portrayal as Freddy Krueger and I really got to see more humor and there is one scene and that is Kristen's nightmare at the beach and he really does kill it with his awesome humor.Since Patricia Arquette could not return due to her being involved in other projects, Tuesday Knight fills in for her as Kristen Parker and she definitely nails her performance and it could have been worse, but it is a damn good performance for this character.Lisa Wilcox plays our new primary protagonist, Alice Johnson and she does a damn good job in playing the role of Alice and it is not Oscar worthy, but it is really good and she was the perfect choice to a new enemy to our antagonist, Freddy Krueger.Danny Hassle plays Alice's boyfriend, Dan Jordan and he is top-notch and just like Lisa Wilcox, he could not have done any better. They have great chemistry on the screen and it definitely shows all the way throughout this entire fourth Nightmare on Elm Street film in the scary film franchise.The rest of the cast is just out there and they make either a huge or very little effort to put on a darn good performance and it is really intense and I really can't blame them because they try they're absolute best but does not deliver when they really need too.The nightmares in this film are just incredible You have Freddy Krueger sucking the life out of one girl, turning her into a cockroach and that was pretty cool. The other nightmare is Kristen's two nightmares at the beginning and middle of the film and those are way too scary, but I love them because they are like this. Another nightmare is Kincaid's nightmare. He is trapped in a salvage yard and he is brutally stabbed in the stomach and it is very dark and serious and really cool.The other nightmares I will keep short Joey's nightmare involves him on a waterbed and is tricked into thinking a supermodel is swimming before Freddy kills him and that was just too cool. Sheila is killed by an intense asthma attack. Rick is in a mixed-martial arts nightmare fight and that was really intense and violent. All of the nightmares are not bad, but they are just very dark and serious in a few areas, but Robert Englund's comedy is really amazing and spectacular.Overall, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master is just amazing and really scary.

It made me squirm and cringe. Not because it was bad, but because it's powerful stuff - a refreshing change from the usual saccharine attempts by Hollywood to address racism, giving us a brilliant tale told without restraint or bias.The movie begins on the day former leader of a neo-Nazi skinhead gang Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) gets out of prison after serving a 3- year sentence for the vicious manslaughter of black thieves who were trying to steal his truck. The incident in question was the culmination of Derek's indoctrination as a white supremacist, begun in the lessons of his father who was slain at the hands of black men, and picked up by Venice Beach's white-power kingpin Cameron. Derek's high-flying stardom within the latter's organization crashes in prison, where Derek slowly learns the error of his ways and builds a resolve to keep his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from following in his footsteps. He comes home to find that his brother has succumbed to the rancorous influence of the same hate- group who turned him into a skinhead thug.Meanwhile, at school, Danny must rewrite a paper for his history class because the glowing essay he wrote on Mein Kampf - at Cameron's urging - was rejected. He is ordered by his high school principal Dr. Sweeney to instead write a report on his brother and his own journey into the twisted skinhead world titled 'American History X'. Derek is the star of Danny's account, and Derek's transformation is revealed in black and white flashbacks when he recounts to Danny about his prison ordeal - his disillusionment with other skinhead inmates, their revenge on him and his unexpected friendship with a black convict. Danny slowly comes to realize the truth - the venom spewed by Cameron and his ilk creates nothing but misery. In the end, though, there is no escaping the price for Derek's sins. American History X is deceptively simple in its story telling, but first-time director Tony Kaye directs it like an auteur, giving us a harrowing morality tale that is both rich and gripping at all times. But it is Edward Norton's riveting performance as a smart kid seduced by horrible ideas that makes the story real. He plays the raging neo-Nazi with unsettling conviction, spitting hateful propaganda and brutally letting his feelings out. Edward Furlong's performance as Danny shows an impressive range for a young actor, making Danny a believable teenager.When Edward Norton's brilliant, fully rounded performance rubs up against the film's grainy toughness - complimented by an impressive, gut-wrenching screenplay - American History X becomes an exhilarating experience.

","genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller"},{"date":"27 April 2015","score":"","review":" -The Hitch-Hiker (1953) by John VizzusiMarking the 4th Major Motion Picture for Superstar Ida Lupino as a Director, she paved the way for Females in a Industry dominated by men! Lupino also pens this strange and true tale of a serial killer on the loose. With a entire Male Cast, Ida sets forth on-loan by Warners to RKO, she shot the entire Picture on-location. Beginning to finish a breathtaking 71 minutes, Lupino comes in under-budget and several days early. Hollywood forgetful of its hugely successful past of Female Directors and Screenwriters such as the incredible Francis Marion (The Big House), Lupino is scorned upon and RKO acts like they are hiding from this production. A Limited Release does not help box office totals although the Movie does make its money back. She had a very slim budget of $400,000 and had to invent rotoscope camera movements for the Camera Automobile shots because of lack of equipment available. Surely influenced by the drama she herself displayed on the screen as the Star opposite Humphrey Bogart in High Sierra she Directs with complete confidence and a totally believable natural reality driven style and turns the killer Emmet Myers (William Talman) into one of the most vicious murderous monsters the screen had ever seen. But there is something else happening as well; -Ida gives the film a sense of purpose and sensitivity even with all the madness going on throughout...In an interview Talman recalled an incident that happened shortly after the release of The Hitch-Hiker (1953), in which he gave a chilling portrayal of escaped murderer and serial killer Emmett Meyers. He was driving his convertible in Los Angeles with the top down, and he stopped at a red light. Another driver in a convertible who was stopped next to him stared at him for a few seconds, then said, You're the hitchhiker, right? Talman nodded, indicating that he was. The other driver got out of his car, went over to Talman's car and slapped him across the face, then got back in his car and drove off.
