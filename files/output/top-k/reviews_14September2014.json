Half-man, half-machine. The coolest cop in Old Detroit. More than 20 years later, he's still one of the most awesome action heroes to come out of the era, and the film still holds up today. I lament the fact that there is a new generation whose first exposure to the character might be the toothless 2014 reboot. The original is a far superior film with wit, brutality, and a myriad of memorable moments that stick with you long after the movie's over. From director Paul Verhoeven, ROBOCOP is the story of Alex Murphy (Peter Weller). Murphy is a recent transfer and his first time out in his new precinct ends with local kingpin Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies filling him with more shotgun slugs than one would think humanly possible. Meanwhile, the conglomerate OCP is in need of a volunteer for their new RoboCop program when their unmanned police robot, the ED-209, displays some hazardous glitches. Murphy is rebuilt as the now legendary RoboCop and immediately begins cleaning the streets of Old Detroit. As the population goes wild for their new law enforcement hero, sinister forces conspire to terminate his program. Boddicker learns that Murphy survived their encounter and wants to tie up his loose ends, and OCP senior president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) resents that RoboCop overshadowed his own ED-209 program and worries that RoboCop might pose a threat to his underworld ties.Where to begin&#x85;? I love this movie. The premise, when viewed subjectively, is pretty cheesy a half-man, half-machine superhuman police officer. But it's just handled so perfectly. It never takes itself too seriously, coming at the audience with a wink and a smile that helps soften the blow of the gratuitous violence. It opens with a news clip where overly-enthusiastic broadcasters deliver news of violence in South Africa with the same dopey smile that they'd deliver celebrity gossip, and the citizens are obsessed with a cheesy, breast-filled sitcom that gave us one of the most quotable lines in the movie (I'd buy that for a dollar!). Meanwhile, Old Detroit's in shambles with gang violence running rampant. Really, the movie was pretty accurate in it's predictions on what the future of America might look like. We may not be at the dystopian level of the movie yet, but we're close with our TV- obsessed culture and the privatization of the police force a possible reality in the not-too-distant future. ROBOCOP takes what could've been a lazy B-grade action schlock film and turns it into a social commentary. Who would've thought it with a name like ROBOCOP? The movie's got an undercurrent of humor running throughout and has its share of laughs from the sheer absurdity at times. As refreshing as the satire and humor are, it never overshadows the action and ROBOCOP is a shining example of how much Verhoeven loves some brutal violence in his movies.Just as was the case with Brett's death scene in ALIEN, one ROBOCOP scene in particular had haunted me since childhood and was the sole reason it took me a while to revisit the film. I was pretty young at the time and I can't even remember how I came to watch it. I remember the initial boardroom scene with the ED-209 blew my mind but it was until the end of the movie where it got to be a little much when Boddicker's henchman Emil (Paul McCrane) saw his end. That scene cemented itself in my young mind because of just how much it freaked me out. I won't spoil it here for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but it's probably one of the coolest parts. Despite the horror of the scene sending me running at the time, the image of RoboCop, the character, stuck with me and he was always one of my favorite characters, even though I hadn't the nerve to even finish the movie. Having gone back and revisited the movie in later years, it's no surprise why. RoboCop is just awesome. I love the character design (that new stealth black model of the 2014 is garbage in comparison&#x85;like some sort of an anthropomorphic iPhone) and his stone-cold robotic stoicism. He was like some sort of futuristic Western hero, stomping into town, twirling his gun, and confronting the baddies. As I grew older, I came to realize just how awesome all the performances in the film were (not just the Robo-variety). Kurtwood Smith, who for the longest time I'd only known as the dad from That 70's Show, is a perfect villain! I guess it shouldn't have surprised me but he's bizarrely charismatic for a psychopath. Nancy Allen, Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer&#x85; they're all rock solid in the film.The ROBOCOP franchise might not've seen as much success as I'd want after the mind-blowingly awesome original, but the first film is still a classic piece of action. I was hoping the reboot might pick up where the original left off and build on it but, instead, it's made it apparent that a movie like Verhoeven's ROBOCOP probably wouldn't get made in modern times and I doubt we'll ever see anything that'll stand up to its strength. It has aged amazingly well and it's just as good as it was more than 20 years ago and, if you've gone this long without watching the original 1987 ROBOCOP, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.

The usual murky dark-brown tones that David Fincher is so good at. And Michael Douglas plays well, although the part is so familiar to him it's a bit like Bambi playing Bambi. Still, he pulls it off. But then there is the story itself. So it's a game. Or is it? Or isn't it? Or is it? Or...oh well, you get the picture. The film starts off quite promising with millionaire banker Nicolas van Outen slowly being sucked into strange and gradually more and more dangerous situations. He is not sure who he can trust and whether the game is either real or if he's being screwed by some criminal organization. He gets more and more paranoid as he discovers that people he thought he could trust turn out to be in on it as well. All this is quite interesting when the viewer also believes that the game is not really a game but some kind of a con.But the ending is such a disappointment that i find it hard to believe anything that happened in the 2 hours leading up to the plot twist, that really isn't a plot twist at all. The game turns out not to be a game at all until we find out that it was just a game after all. When we find this out, everything we have seen turns out to be as unbelievable as a fairy tale. And i guess that is what this movie is a fairy tale. Filled with incredible plot holes and far-fetched situations that could have gone wrong at any given time. Nicolas could have died in the taxi, killed himself making that ridiculous jump in the end (what if he chose to jump off the other side or cut his neck open on the glass in those 2 ceilings?) or if he decided to buy a real gun because the creeping paranoia blurring his rational thinking? It's simply too nonsensical.So in the end the film looks good, sounds good and is well played but far too unbelievable to leave me satisfied.

It is authentic and honest and heartfelt. It is one of the best movies about the grief journey I have seen. It manages to give background and flavor to each of the characters who spend time on the screen, a feat which is unusual in film. Kathy Bates performance is skillful, helping the audience understand an unsympathetic character. Jessica Lange, Arliss Howard and the child actors are understated. A lovely, heartfelt package.

While definitely not as good as First Contact, a film that holds up as a great Trek film and a great sci- fi action film in it's own right, it's still a very entertaining sci-fi adventure and a nice farewell to the Enterprise from TNG. Seeing the bridge in ruin at the end with Picard and Riker beaming touched my nerd nodes somewhere sensitive. While I'd still rather watch the best episodes of the series over this any day, it's still very good, if flawed. The ideas are pretty sound and true to the series; interdimensional dilemmas, philosophy about time and space and what's important and whatnot. But there are some things I have gripes with, things that don't make sense in the context of the series, despite the affection for the series displayed throughout. For instance, Riker firing at and destroying the Klingon bird of prey while they're in a vulnerable position, and Data going yes! which seems totally uncharacteristic of them; We just killed an entire crew of Klingons whose defences were down, yes!!! And I notice that one of the klingons on the bird of prey was someone Riker befriended in the second season episode of TNG in which he becomes first officer of a Klingon vessel. That was the one instance in this film that made be go nooo! out loud. Not many other gripes other than that apart from Data being annoying at times (although thankfully his emotion chip schtick wasn't overdone), and Picard having a disturbingly vivid fantasy of a wife and kids in the nexus; apparently he likes redheads. One of the best parts of the film was the villain, Soren, played by Malcolm McDowell. He comes across not only as a cool villain making speeches about time being a predator and the fire in which we burn, but also as a somewhat sympathetic character, a man with nothing left to lose who wants paradise and is willing to do anything to get it. And really, can you blame a man who lost his wife and kids to the Borg for wanting it back in some kind of timeless fantasy where he won't be able to feel guilt over the sacrifices he made to get there?

Blade Runner is a film that dances the line between dream and reality, what we perceive and what is. Whether Deckard is a replicant or not is irrelevant. He may as well be. Not only one of the best science fiction films, but also one of the best noir films, this is a film of ideas that present themselves as a kind of dystopian dream where nothing is as it seems. A darkened futuristic city of shadows pierced occasionally by artificial light from neon signs or floating blimp adverts. Part of what makes Blade Runner great is the way suspends a sort of unreality, where anonymous silhouettes wearing strange clothes walk rain-drenched streets as if they were dolls in a playset. Artifice is key to this film in every way, Los Angeles looks like a giant computer chip in this future, and it's hard to tell where the ground is in relation to the sky, just lights and shapes that vaguely outline a city. It's a truly visual film, and it works on that level, the cityscape and it's alleys and labyrinths is breathtaking. The meticulous architecture of the city and the vague motivations of the characters suggest that they may just be pawns in a game of chess. The final showdown between Roy Batty and Deckard is one of the best moments in film. Batty, who seems to be high on feeling and passion, distraught at the death of Priss, toys with Deckard, who seems to be simply going through the motions of survival. Hauer and Ford are both fantastic in this film, Ford is like an old man dulled by existence and Hauer can't get enough of it, until a transition at the end, in which Deckard, whether he retired Batty or not, seems to be awakened to the preciousness of life, and decides to save Rachael, not because of the lonely, drunken lust that made him force Rachael to tell him she loved him, but out of some new found truth. Sean Young is excellent as the replicant coming to terms with the fact that a life as real to her as mine or yours was nothing more than programming. This is a great film, it doesn't really need any explanation at all, and I love that nothing is explained and no sides are taken, this is film as dream at it's best.

Although most critics panned it and it didn't do that great at the box office, I honestly think this one of Brooks's best movies. I remember as a kid being a huge Robin Hood Prince of Thieves fan, still am, but I loved the idea of a spoof on the legend of Robin Hood and saw this film for the first time as a kid. I didn't get all the jokes back then, but I thought it was hilarious nonetheless. I'll admit, this isn't the most intelligent comedy out there (still leagues ahead of American Pie and Superbad though), but it's witty in the sense that Mel Brooks knows how to spoof so good he basically invented it. This spoofs a ton of great movies and actors, and while it's cheesy at times (it's supposed to be) it's also funny. Cary Elwes is a great comedic Robin Hood, but he's got a great supporting cast in Aachoo, Blinkin, the Sheriff of Rottingham, and Prince John. Is it typical Mel Brooks? For sure! That's why I love it. It's got random bits of hilarity. My personal favorite is the spoof of The Godfather where a character very reminiscent of Don Corleone is planning the assassination of Robin Hood with the Sheriff. The actor sounds and acts just like Marlon Brando, it was hilarious. It was random, but hilarious. This is a silly comedy. That's what it was intended to be. The thing about Men in Tights is that while it's supposed to be a spoof of Robin Hood, it ends up being a great take on the lore while trying to spoof it. It's another story of the classic legend, just with a bit of a comedic twist on it. I recommend it to fans of Robin Hood, Mel Brooks, or fans of spoof movies in general. Some people might not like it because they want sex jokes 24\/7, but if you want hilarious stupidity, this is a great movie to watch. I wouldn't put it on par with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, but it's one of my favorite comedies. Check it out and remember A mime is a terrible thing to waste.

Set in New Orleans, it's the story of an ex-cop, Dave Robicheaux, who is now out of the force and runs a bait shop just outside the city.One day, while on a boat, they see a plane fall from the sky. Dave is able to save a child who was on board. They take her home with them, but when a DEA agent, Dautrieve, shows up, Dave becomes suspicious about who else was on the plane. He starts to investigate, which leads to trouble. He asks for help from a boyhood friend turned drug lord, Bubba Rocque (Roberts). Unfortunately, Dave doesn't foresee the hell that's coming.Alec Baldwin, young and handsome, does a terrific job as Dave; in his day, he was a fine leading man. Though he's now proved that he's adept at comedy, his dramatic work is excellent as well, as seen here. He portrays an angry, shattered alcoholic.The beginning of the film is especially good, showing the quiet beauty of Louisiana and showing Dave in profile at an AA meeting talking about being sober for three years and still wanting a drink. Mary Stuart Masterson is a wonderful actress; here, she's a blond stripper and creates a complete character. Someone on this board asked why she would take a nothing part. I suppose for her it was an opportunity to play something a little different (at least from what I've seen her do). During Lois & Clark, Teri Hatcher was given good parts in several films, but never developed a big film career. She's good here, though we really don't learn a lot about her character.Heaven's Prisoners is derivative and on the slow side, but it's atmospheric with good acting. At times, the plot is a little hard to follow; I also had a hard time understanding why Dave didn't take the danger seriously enough to either send his family away or keep a closer watch on his home.Good cast, nice production values.

It's one of those films I caught about ten minutes of back when I was a kid that stuck with me. So now I've seen it all, and I enjoyed it immensely. I really liked Matthew Broderick as Gaston, a likable thief who stumbles forward and accidentally gets away with things and out of situations, whether being saved by the ex guard captain Navarre (Rutger Hauer being awesome), or knocking his love to be off a cliff just as she's about to turn back into a Hawk. He played a similar character a year later, except that character was less likable. The story is a silly tale of cursed love, the villain, a jealous bishop with magic powers or something cursing the captain of his guards and the woman they both love but who loves Navarre to never be able to see each other as humans, Isabeaux turning into a hawk during the day and Navarre into a wolf at night. It's a silly but imaginative story that makes or a nice dynamic as Gaston has to protect Isabeaux when she's a human and Navarre when he's a wolf. There's also some mumbo jumbo about them having be seen by the bishop both as human to break the curse on a special occasion when day has no night, and night has no day. So essentially, an eclipse or something. One thing I found cool about the film was it's setting, it's very confused and loose; Navarre speaks of his father fighting in the crusades and yet there's magic and sorcery and an evil bishop who apparently rules a kingdom. It's all very silly, lighthearted fun. There are also some great lines from the god-fearing Gaston like like escaping from mother's womb...God what a memory. I enjoyed it a lot.

From the lacklustre plot to the boredom of terrible comedy (not even laughable as anti-jokes), this movie lacks in nearly every department. As a cult film, I hope some out there enjoy it, since it managed to bore me for nearly two hours (in real time) and I was excited to watch it. I would highly advise against watching this movie. Whether you want to catch up on sleep or are simply trying to kill time, this movie is not the way to go.

I'm a fan of horror, but please don't think this is designed to scare. It merely employs poor costumes and CGI to make disfigured vampires whom are a bigger nuisance than threat to kill.

The cast was picked with excellence and the characters were made so that the audience would care about them. Even though the middle of the story was a bit slow, it began to drag when it started building up the plot for the climax in the middle. Stephen King does not usually write novels as a drama and when he does do it, it is critically acclaimed. It is amazing how much though was put into making this story, with the back tracking to reveal major plot points and how this happened. Morgan Freeman's narration is excellent in this movie too, his character is one you won't forget because of how strong his performance is. Over all this is a fantastic movie. If you haven't see this yet I recommend you do, this movie is one you won't want to forget.
