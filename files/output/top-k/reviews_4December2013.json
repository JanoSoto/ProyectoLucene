When one attack in particular hits close to home for all, Martial Law is declared by Major General William Devereux(played by Bruce Willis) which greatly alarms Hubbard, as his fellow agent, an Arab American(played by Tony Shalhoub) is rounded up with other suspects in an internment camp, while the CIA agent knows more than she's willing to tell about the terrorist cells responsible... Well-intentioned but overly preachy film forgoes dramatic storytelling in favor of speechifying, and result isn't particularly believable either, despite inevitable comparisons to the real-life horror of 9\/11...

It was the Massachusetts 54th infantry unit(played by actors like Morgan Freeman, Andre Braugher, and Denzel Washington, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award) who eventually came together under his leadership to distinguish themselves, and become the hated targets of the confederacy, as well as the bigotry from their own side, though they persevere, until the fateful charge on Fort Wagner leads to disaster... Surprisingly powerful film has superb performances, direction, and score, and is deeply moving by film's end. A fine tribute to this historical regiment.
