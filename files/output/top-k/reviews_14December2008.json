[{"date":"14 December 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Election is an intelligence black comedy set in a high school in Omaha, Nebraska. It is a set during the election for the student presidency, with only one candidate Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon). Tracy is an over-achiever who is ruthless in approach, crush anyone who gets in her well. However, the history teacher running the election, Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) does not want to her to run away with it because of her tendency of destroying people, including McAllister's friend who was sacked. McAllister brings in a ringer, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a nice but dim jock who had recently broke his leg and one of the most popular students at the school. As well, a third party candidate, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), Paul's sister. She wanted revenge because her girlfriend broke Tammy's heart and started going out with Paul. Tammy becomes the popular candidates because of her anti-student government ticket. This upsets the school and throughout the campaign dirty tricks breakout. A sub-plot of the film is Mr. McAllister is unhappily married, resulting with him watching porn and fantasising being with other women. He becomes attracted to his wife's best film Judith. Slowly his life in Nebraska falls apart.The director Alexander Payne, musts have had fun making this film, and it oozed stylist tricks which added to the visual effect of the film. The film also uses a voice over for all the characters which gives you an incite to all the character's thoughts, similar to the comedy show Peep Show. They are also a number of subplots which gives all the characters a chance to develop. It is a sharply written film, with good dialogue and has a interesting look at American High School. It is dark, looking at some dodgy subject matters and doesn't pull any punches. It's humour is subtle, and has a good at relationships, suburbia, high school and the American education system and American politics.A worthy film.
