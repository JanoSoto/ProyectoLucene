Well in 1988 a film Scrooged with Bill Murray showed a new twist and different side to Christmas! Scrooged is a hilarious take-off of the Dickens classic as the story is told similar with the Christmas ghost of the past, present, and future, but with a modern day theme. Bill Murray is terrific as Frank Cross who is a nasty and cold TV network president who only cares about himself and no one else, he's simply a modern-day Scrooge. On Christmas Eve he's visited by a maniacal New York cab driver who takes him on the journey to the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future. Boy does his future sure look ghoulish, so Frank must change his ways! Overall this twisted and funny tale is just fine to watch every holiday season, not only is Murray's performance good, but the supporting cast from Karen Allen, John Forsythe, Carol Kane, and Alfre Woodard is super. It's nice to see a film that shows that Christmas can be funny and serious, and it's nice to put people first and love everyone. Scrooged is a fine film especially during the Christmas season, I even own it on DVD.

Excited Maia goes back to the mainland where he hopes to put together an expedition to try & unearth the rest of the creatures skeleton, he manages to convince scientist David Reed (Richard Carlson) & his money hungry, fame seeking boss Mark Williams (no, not the snooker player but Richard Denning) along with Kay Lawrence (Julie Adams) & Dr. Thompson (Whit Bissell). The find themselves Captain Lucas (Nestor Paiva) who agrees to take them deep into the Amazon in his boat, once there they spend days searching for more bones but find nothing so they decide to head further up river to a place known as 'the black lagoon' where they encounter a slimy half man half fish type creature who takes a fancy to the pretty Kay...Directed by Jack Arnold Creature from the Black Lagoon is one of the very best 'man-in-a-rubber-monster-suit' type films that seemed so popular during the 50's & 60's, although in my experience it doesn't have that much competition. The script by Harry Essex & Arthur A. Ross certainly moves along at a nice pace & at only just over 70 minutes in length it moves along briskly, however the script still manages to paint some decent if a bit clich√©d character's with everyone coming across like they should, for instance there's the misguided one who wants to take the monster back to civilisation at any cost & then there's the hero who saves the day & manages to do what's 'right'. Of course no-one is going to sit down & watch this for it's character's, dialogue or deep storyline are they? No, we want to see the creature from the black lagoon itself & in this respect the film doesn't disappoint. The monster itself is rather good & even somewhat credible, well as much as it can be, & to start off with we just get to see it's clawed webbed hand but when it does finally appear it's quite a neat monster. It does the usual monster things like fall in love with the pretty girl, kill whoever gets in it's way & generally causes problems for everyone. The script makes good use of the monster & at giving it a human quality that tries to make the audience feel some sympathy for it without overdoing it & overall I thought it was an enjoyable monster film the likes of which they don't make anymore.Director Arnold does OK, everything is kept within the realms of possibility & he resists going overboard to create a nice tight little tale of mismatched love. Originally shot & shown in 3-D the DVD I just watched was definitely presented flat so I don't know if there is any opportunity to watch this how it was intended but I think it would have been interesting to see how it used the effect as nothing stood out as being 3-D apart from a scene when he monster sticks it's hand through a port hole & tries to 'grab' the audience. The black and white photography is good especially some of the underwater scenes which are well shot. The special effects are good & the monster suit is surprisingly pretty impressive, I've seen a lot worse in much more recent films that's for sure.Technically Creature from the Black Lagoon is well made although don't expect the big budget production value's & special effect of more recent Hollywood productions, you have to remember this was made over 50 years ago. The acting is decent & better than the usual stiffness from casts of this period who appeared in this sort of horror\/monster film.Creature from the Black Lagoon is now considered a solid gold classic, while I won't say that I think it's the best film ever made it certainly still deserves to be seen & available & hopefully the recent DVD will keep it alive, I liked it & I think it's well worth a watch.

One must take into consideration on that point that this is a film and a story of an earlier time. A period piece and a script from quite a few years ago. Because of some of the tried for laughs, it seems that none of the Simon plays as they stand or the adaptations for screen will stand the test of time. A bit of re working on the script\/dialog would help immensely Even with that BIG flaw that sticks out like a sore thumb, this film is wonderful. One might refer to or call these imperfections in the dialog,New York City Corn. Being form New York City myself, perhaps it's just the way it plays to me, but I doubt it. Most of today's viewers would have the same problem with some of the lines.The characters could not be more interesting or endearing. The scenes are right on track as one follows the other in perfect harmony. The acting and casting is superb with standouts being just about all of the main characters. Christopher Walken continues to take command. But it's also the great by play and perfect casting of his buddies of all religious persuasions that are just as marvelous. Terrific performances by Matt Mulhern, Corey Parker, Park Overall, and of course Matthew Broderick are all great. A perfectly cast movie I would say. Everyone was terrific but what stands out so nicely about this work is that we don't want the relationship that Simon creates between our beloved characters to ever end. There is always a Bully right? Matt Mulhern is cast as the lovable, honest, Bologna sandwich slamming cretin. Yet he is wonderful in the part he plays, and becomes my favorite. Then their is the enigmatic, always unearthly Christopher Walk en who endears himself to both the audience and to his boys that he makes into pretty good soldiers.The interplay between the different characters is what makes this work so well. There really isn't a single one in the group that we don't end up liking, at least to some degree. I really think this is where Simon's genius lies, what makes his plays so popular, so likable. We like both Oscar and Felix (opposite personalities) in the Odd Couple, right? Well, despite mostly minor bickering some major which is predictable among a bunch of guys from mostly different backgrounds and religions, in Biloxi Blues, the guys end up liking each other. They even end up realizing that St Toomey is a good guy. They understand that he is raking them over the coals in order to save their lives if and when they are shipped over seas during WWII The adventure really doesn't leave much out. Matthew Broderick goes through all or most of the adventures that we would expect. I found myself easily fitting into the group as the same kinds of things happened to me as I was growing into manhood. Somehow they grow together, they move threw some of life's more difficult moments as young men. In the end, Simon's or should I say Sgt. Toomey's bunch makes it, and we love it. I kept thinking that they really didn't have a care in the world. It was of course, a time of great anxt and worry as the guys wondered what in the world would ever happen to them. However, I couldn't help but go along with Broderick at the end, when the war is over, when none of the guys is actually sent over seas to fight. He states to the affect that as he looks back (narrating in talk over), it was the best time of his life that he seemed to bond with every one of those guys.I was surprised to find that there is no Sound Track available of any kind.

Everyone was terrific but what stands out so nicely about this work is that we don't want the relationship that Simon creates between our beloved characters to ever end. There is always a Bully right? Matt Mulhern is cast as the lovable, honest, Bologna sandwich slamming cretin. Yet he is wonderful in the part he plays, and becomes my favorite. Then their is the enigmatic, always unearthly Christopher Walk en who endears himself to both the audience and to his boys that he makes into pretty good soldiers.The interplay between the different characters is what makes this work so well. There really isn't a single one in the group that we don't end up liking, at least to some degree. I really think this is where Simon's genius lies, what makes his plays so popular, so likable. We like both Oscar and Felix (opposite personalities) in the Odd Couple, right? Well, despite mostly minor bickering some major which is predictable among a bunch of guys from mostly different backgrounds and religions, in Biloxi Blues, the guys end up liking each other. They even end up realizing that St Toomey is a good guy. They understand that he is raking them over the coals in order to save their lives if and when they are shipped over seas during WWII The adventure really doesn't leave much out. Matthew Broderick goes through all or most of the adventures that we would expect. I found myself easily fitting into the group as the same kinds of things happened to me as I was growing into manhood. Somehow they grow together, they move threw some of life's more difficult moments as young men. In the end, Simon's or should I say Sgt. Toomey's bunch makes it, and we love it. I kept thinking that they really didn't have a care in the world. It was of course, a time of great anxt and worry as the guys wondered what in the world would ever happen to them. However, I couldn't help but go along with Broderick at the end, when the war is over, when none of the guys is actually sent over seas to fight. He states to the affect that as he looks back (narrating in talk over), it was the best time of his life that he seemed to bond with every one of those guys.I was surprised to find that there is no Sound Track available of any kind. Yet, the choice of songs, taken from the era, the WWII songs some refer to as a wonderful time for Romantic Tunes are perfectly placed throughout the film. I gave this movie a 10 despite the mentioned imperfections because it simply is one piece of great entertainment, and every time I decide to watch it again, it brings me home, home to the comfort of those great characters that I just love to watch and hear.

I wish I could say the same for the writers and some of the cast members in this film. But for me to call them that, a lot would have to have been done differently.Is Mr.Ripley talented or just plain lucky to be surrounded by morons? First of all, there is no real point to this movie. The first half, with Law, moves too slowly and gets dull, all the way to the point of Law's murder - which is a ridiculous scene, by the way - when the movie suddenly turns from drama into some kind of a thriller-drama study of a disturbed mind. Except that the study is dull, muddled, and uninteresting. Damon's character is never particularly interesting - certainly not interesting enough to carry a movie (or the second half, at least); this is due to weak writing, but perhaps even more to Damon's confused and unconvincing portrayal of Ripley. The viewer never gets a clear idea of what Ripley is about; he is not defined enough and his motives and thoughts are far too vague.The absurd second half goes on forever, without anything much happening Ripley assumes Law's identity, and then proceeds to hide his real identity in a series of pointless scenes and situations. My point is okay, so he has assumed Law's identity, and what's next? Him just hiding it all the way to the end of the film? That's just not good enough. It may be good enough for a B-movie, or an episode of some mediocre TV cop show, but certainly not enough for a movie which promises a lot (but ultimately delivers so little). Damon falling in love with Law is admittedly an unusual twist, but a rather silly one, or at least unconvincingly portrayed by a Damon who was completely lost as to how to play this person.Another problem is the far-fetchedness. Cops are investigating a murder, yet they never check Damon's papers! Damon keeps bumping into Blanchett as if all of the events in the film occur in a small suburb in Lichtenstein! Also, why doesn't Law's Dad come for a visit to Italy, finally? He comes only after Law has disappeared, i.e. was killed. Damon doing a quick study of jazz is ridiculous and has less to do with Ripley being talented than it has to do with absurdity in the script. After all this nonsense has occurred, we get yet more nonsense when Damon falls in love (again) with Paltrow's friend, who just happens to be gay, as well.Somehow little really adds up and practically nothing rings true in this mess. It's simply off the acting and the writing. Blanchett's American accent is very good, but she is so preoccupied with doing a credible accent that she ends up doing a caricature of an American woman rather than a portrayal of one. And once again I ask the question why hire a Brit to play an American (and vice versa)? Honestly, what's the point? Damon lacks credibility, is annoying in a couple of scenes, creates a character who makes absolutely no sense, plus he lacks charisma (but charisma he lacks always - this is hardly a revelation). Law is good, as usual, but after he gets killed Damon has to carry the movie, which he can't do. Paltrow is annoying, though not nearly as annoying as in her other films. (Nepotism rarely works.) Yet ANOTHER Oscar movie which got vastly overrated for reasons known only to the armies of dolts across the globe who vote for these awards or write film columns.If you're interested in reading fake biographies (i.e. parodies) of Paltrow and other Hollywood morons, contact me by e-mail.

Having just run away from the Horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him, two guys stop running, turn around, and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up. (Huh?) The constituents of the slasher movie are always there, lurking in the mist, ready to attack at any moment, like the Headless Horseman (and I DO mean headless). The very first murder, in the opening few minutes, has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a Jack o' Lantern. Almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there isn't that much blood, thanks. I suppose that kids, who ought to enjoy this movie, were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained.As for the Horseman himself -- well, I don't think I like him too much. He's presented as an immortal action figure. He's always in motion, galloping a horse at full speed, striding quickly around. He's dressed in a black cloak over black armor, which is alright, but I think he might have been spookier if he'd been less energetic and more of a plodding, implacable menace. The staging of his attacks are low-brow. There are sword fights out of any number of action movies, with two antagonists, flashing blades, twirling figures, swishing and clanking sounds -- all to no purpose since it's already known that the Horseman can't be beaten. At least they didn't throw in any flying kicks from the Chop Sockey movies.But the figure himself is really terrifying, especially when we don't have a clear view of him. The parts I enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows. The look and the feel of the late 18th-century Hudson Valley are admirably conveyed, though even that is a little too heavily laid on. Can't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight. It's as if the sun didn't exist in Sleepy Hollow.

We meet her first when she is forced to dismount from a carriage. Her husband Pierre ties her to a tree, whips her, then leaves her to be raped by the two carriage drivers.S√©verine is prone to fantasies. She is in a conventional marriage. Pierre is a handsome young surgeon. They sleep in separate beds. An older friend, Henri, keeps hitting on her, but she tells him to keep his compliments for himself. He is attracted by her blonde perfection, her virtue and her icy disdain.Taking fantasy a stage further, S√©verine gets a daytime job at a high class brothel. At first she is prudish and wants to pick her clients. Then she is shown 'a firm hand' - which the masochistic side of her nature relishes.Re-released almost forty years after its original cinema exhibition, Belle de Jour still has the power to shock. Not through explicit nudity (it is a highly erotic work without being titillating) but by the shocking images, and the superb performances that contrast the aloofness of the bourgeoisie to the practicality of sex, of elegance to depravity. Scenes of S√©verine having mud thrown at her stick in the mind no less than the tentativeness with which she approaches the brothel for the first time, dressed in black, and ready to take flight at any moment. Couture by Yves Saint Laurent and lush photography drown us in luxurious chic. The stylish settings arouse our aesthetic senses, and the languorous pacing and emotional complexity keep us trying to figure it all out long before we realise just how difficult that is going to be. Analysing it in Freudian or purely sexual terms is less than satisfying. The characters are convincing - the posh conservative elite, the matter-of-fact but certainly not coarse madame, the pervs who visit the brothel, and the psychologically conflicted S√©verine through them all. It is hardly a plea for sexual liberation - the men, even one that S√©verine takes a fancy to, are pretty lowlife. Their strange fantasy requirements mete out the most fascinating tableau of perversions but even more fascinating is what we don't see such as what is in the box brought by the Chinaman. We are forced to identify with S√©verine - she is the most normal character - and yet the most convincing way to approach the film is one suggested by Bu√±uel himself, as a parable attacking the decadence of the bourgeoisie. On a more elevated level, it is a forceful artistic statement that viewers addicted to linear storytelling may find hard to accept. It seems to anticipate Eyes Wide Shut in its treatment of hidden sexuality, but cinematically it is more linked to the surreal Mulholland Drive. Bu√±uel's friend from University and at one point collaborator, Salvador Dali, could be similarly perplexing when it came to alternate realities. He said, People love mystery, and that is why they love my paintings. The mind is drawn to interpret a piece of art in a specific concrete way, but the artist may wish to express a concept that transcends specific examples. In Belle de Jour, Bu√±uel claims that there are not two endings, just one ambiguous ending. When you have finished watching the film it is not hard to decide which scenes are reality and which are fantasy, but when you run it through your mind again it is equally possible to make alterations. Do we want to know what is in the box, or do we love the mystery?The name Belle de Jour can be read as a pun on 'lady of the night', since S√©verine only worked in the day; everything becomes plain. This is maybe why it becomes her as her name at the brothel. But enter S√©verine's feverish imagination and you might see something else.

Yet for all the power of that one scene, the rest of the film packs a punch in its own right.Graduate student Tom Babe Levy (Dustin Hoffman) lives under the shadow of his father, a suspected Communist who killed himself rather than face a Congressional panel in the red-scare 1950s. His father was innocent, but his brother Doc (Roy Scheider) may not be when it comes to cavorting with totalitarians of another stripe, namely infamous Nazi Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier), who stole diamonds off of doomed Jews and is now trying to recover them from a safe deposit box in New York City.Director John Schlesinger renews his love affair with the Big Apple and Hoffman's method acting style in a film that also gives the director of Midnight Cowboy a chance to showcase his chops in a straightforward suspense yarn.It's an appropriate companion piece to Family Plot, the final Alfred Hitchcock movie which came out the same year. Though the two films couldn't be farther apart in terms of tone, Schlesinger and writer William Goldman seem to channel the master with loving accuracy, the central story being of a man up against forces he doesn't understand with plenty of Maguffins and illogical-but-sinister ambiance thrown in.Both Family Plot and Marathon Man also feature the engaging William Devane as a suspicious character with a yen for diamonds, who appears with Hoffman in a scene that may pack more of a punch than the dentist scene. A later confrontation with Olivier is also a moment to remember, but the best scene in the movie for me is when Babe introduces Doc to his new squeeze Elsa, played by Marthe Keller (Hitchcock references are not the only nods made to the old school here, as her name seems inspired by Ingrid Bergman's role in Casablanca.)You know the great chablis of the world are almost always green-eyed, Doc observes, very oddly taking Elsa's hand. In fact, they're the ones that most resemble diamonds. This strange comment carries more weight than we initially realize, becoming one of many mines Goldman lays before us. It's a key point made again and again No one but Hoffman's character is exactly who they appear, which accounts for much of Marathon Man's clever charm and sinister undertow.Not everything works in this film, like a street gang that befriends Babe at a critical moment. The motivations of many of the characters at several junctures make little or no sense. It's also a surprisingly humorless film from the guy who wrote Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. But as Hitchcock demonstrated long before this, making sense is not the most important thing in making a thriller. It's pulling in the audience that matters, and this Marathon Man does in spades.Olivier makes the most of his screen time as a deceptively meek-looking fellow whose lack of conscience makes him highly dangerous to anyone who even thinks of crossing him. It's an eviler part for him than his celebrated turn as Richard III, who at least talked to the audience and let us into his plans. Szell trusts no one, a big part of what makes him tick.What makes Marathon Man tick is a storyline that takes a while to start but never slows down, going the distance much as Babe does training for that marathon he hopes someday to run. When you run 26 miles, you don't give into pain, he tells Elsa. It hurts, but you don't pay any attention.Marathon Man is a sometimes hard film to watch that way, especially when Szell teaches Babe the importance of oral hygiene, but it's even harder to stop watching, a stylish, savvy exercise in playing with audience expectations every bit worthy of Hitchcock's legacy.

The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried.

The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak's marriage to his wife, who had long since passed away, Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown, in one of Isak's dreams, that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell, who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was, some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son, who's also a doctor, Evald Marriane's husband.Seeing his 96 year-old mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children, who with the exception of Isak are now deceased, never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who's so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him, like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant, I guess by him, she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara, a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful, to the point of tears, Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr. & Mrs. Alman, who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a head-on car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant, Henrik, who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past , delivered their first child, that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak's gas-tank.By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others, if unintentional. With the little time that he has left, Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81, Isak is determined to make up for it.Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man's journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them. Now given a second chance Isak would try as best as he can to both re-live and at the same time correct his past mistakes.

Special mention, also, must be made of the quirky electronic music, the first of its kind in any feature film.The dialog, of course, is dated, as you might expect, especially regarding nuclear and electronic terminology; but, that's not a real hindrance. It just implicitly reminds you how much has changed technologically since 1956.The basic story is as follows a Federation crew arrives at Altair IV to find any survivors of an expedition sent there twenty years previously. Finding only the eccentric Dr Morbius (the venerable Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis), the captain of the starship, John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his officers set out to find out why the two have survived all this time while the rest of the expedition died violently from some malignant presence on the planet. So, when the crew of the starship begins to die in the same manner (being torn apart, limb from limb), the good captain naturally begins to suspect the erratic doctor.It's a simple story, but well acted and well produced, given the limitations of film technology at that time.A few scenes are truly noteworthy as the starship comes out of light speed on its approach to Altaira, all of the crew stand in individual shimmering light beams, much like Star Trek's beam me up shots, attesting to the influence upon that TV show; whenever there is an exterior shot of the starship in space, there is no sound (except for the quirky music) and no sign of rocket flames --- see, they do get some things technically correct, way back then; the blaster guns used by the crew perform in much the same way as those we all saw later in Star Trek; and, finally, remember Ripley in Alien (1979) when she primes the nuclear reactors to explode on the Nostromo? She pushes in the plungers to set the process in motion. Well, that's just what Morbius does also when he has to destroy the planet! There is comedic relief in the form of Earl Holliman's (playing the ship's cook, if you can accept that) rapport with Robby and his need for cooking liquor.

He manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & Caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, Caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory.

You know it's just after Christmas, I saw this a few hours ago on late night\/early morning cable TV & worst of all I feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop I've had over the past week so I'll keep this one brief. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit. It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. I thought the character's were OK, I thought some of the ideas in the film were good although I think it's generally known that Verhoeven doesn't deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible Caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has Caine rape a woman with the justification 'who's going to know' that Caine says to himself. Then of course there's the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that's just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. Having said that I love horror\/gore\/exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me, it's just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea.Director Verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. The special effects in Hollow Man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it's as simple & straight forward as that. There's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. I love the effect where Kevin Bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla. There's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.With a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 Hollow Man is technically faultless, I can imagine the interviews on the DVD where some special effects boffin says they mapped Bacon's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn't they? The acting was OK, Bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.Hollow Man is one of hose big budget Hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well I know I do. Good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual Hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.

Full credit to Jackson for tackling such a project, and, more importantly, in pulling it off in spectacular style. Having read the books a couple of times throughout my teenage years (i'm now 22) I was dubious as to how a big screen adaptation would fare. Tolkien's rich worlds, mythical visions and superbly 'environmentalised' characters created such a rewarding tale, it was akin to being retold a campfire story about your ancestors! (Being English, and since most of this is widely sourced from pan-European pagan mythology, its no surprise Tolkien touched a chord)So, with expectations that I thought would never be realised I was truly stunned by this film. Jackson, the production team, the actors, everyone involved in making the film nailed it perfectly. My only detraction is that it wasn't long enough. I could've happily sat through 6 hours of this movie such is its charm, scope and masterful storytelling. This film doesn't rely on 'big explosions', it doesn't need a 'pretty boy' hero to carry it, in fact it is devoid of all derogatory Hollywood influences. What remains (on a Hollywood budget however) is a pure vision realised without compromising its integrity.And that is perhaps where the film really excels, Jackson shamelessly allows the characters to indulge in sentimental wisdoms that were long ago discarded by mainstream thought as 'traditional', 'old fashioned' dare I say, no longer relevant to a modern, western society. Each persona in the film feels like they carry a history behind them because they haven't been forced to comply with politically correct standpoints. Which has left it open to being criticised by some nay sayers as racist and right wing. All I can say to these people is that if they are worried by the aspirations of creatures as noble and humble as Hobbits, then perhaps their ideas about those of us who aren't afraid to express our love of tradition, should re-evaluate THEIR ignorant and close minded viewpoint! Anyway, enough of this, back to the film!The plot progression and character development work and intertwine wonderfully, and makes me wonder why other films often lack such subtleties. Perhaps Tolkien's writing and Jackson's accomplished directing skills have made this possible, neither willing to take a shortcut if it means damaging the works overall consistency. The Fellowship Of The Ring is my personal favourite out of the trilogy, the transition from innocence to burdened responsibility is handled so deftly and seamlessly, things never feel they have raced forward too quickly without being explained properly or accounted for. Admittedly Jackson was forced to leave out some key areas of the book, Tom Bombadil notably being an absent character, but with the wealth of material that does makes it to the screen, I think you can say it balances out any omissions. The film really does encompass a vast array of themes. The action sequences, unlike so many films, actually have a sense of immediacy about them. You know these encounters aren't just here for our enjoyment to watch, they are but one of the many challenges faced throughout the film. The relationships that evolve between the characters makes you embrace them even more as identifiable entities, as opposed to just vehicles for the plot and action to progress. The story fully immerses you into its own world and nothing seems childish or fake. Since most fantasy films have derived themselves from Tolkien's original works, it is only fit that this movie, with Tolkien's vision intact, is perhaps the most believable example of the genre we will ever see. Sadly, I think this will be the last set of films to ever achieve 'epic' status in every sense of the word. I cannot see their being such a film like this ever again, its a small miracle it was commissioned at all with the risk involved. But more acutely, its doubtful that someone with Jacksons passion and vision will ever be married to such delightful, original, and enthralling source material.So, to those who haven't seen the film, or who have dismissed it, I would urge you to at least give it one try and appreciate this is not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a story, which takes you on an incredible journey the likes of which, may never be seen again.

You know these encounters aren't just here for our enjoyment to watch, they are but one of the many challenges faced throughout the film. The relationships that evolve between the characters makes you embrace them even more as identifiable entities, as opposed to just vehicles for the plot and action to progress. The story fully immerses you into its own world and nothing seems childish or fake. Since most fantasy films have derived themselves from Tolkien's original works, it is only fit that this movie, with Tolkien's vision intact, is perhaps the most believable example of the genre we will ever see. Sadly, I think this will be the last set of films to ever achieve 'epic' status in every sense of the word. I cannot see their being such a film like this ever again, its a small miracle it was commissioned at all with the risk involved. But more acutely, its doubtful that someone with Jacksons passion and vision will ever be married to such delightful, original, and enthralling source material.So, to those who haven't seen the film, or who have dismissed it, I would urge you to at least give it one try and appreciate this is not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a story, which takes you on an incredible journey the likes of which, may never be seen again.

I like some of Martin Scorsese's work, but I have never understood the near hysterical reactions elicited by critics and his die-hard fans over his contributions to cinema which, much like Steven Spielberg, range from wonderful to embarrassing. To them, every Scorsese film is brilliant. However, despite the reassurances of various critical associations and hero-worshipping fans all too willing to declare this the greatest film made in the last 30 years, most viewers may well wonder what all of the hoopla is about. The film is a biography of boxer Jake LaMotta and documents his volatile, tempestuous nature both in the boxing ring and in his personal life. There is no doubt that Robert DeNiro hurls himself heart and soul into this role, but much of the accolades heaped onto his work center on the arduous physical labors he endured to get himself into fighting shape for LaMotta at his prime and then make himself fat to depict LaMotta having gone to seed. One must admire his dedication, but it was hardly the first time an actor had gone to such efforts &#150; people quickly forget the weight gains of actresses such as Elizabeth Taylor for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf or Lynn Redgrave in Georgy Girl more than a decade prior to DeNiro in Raging Bull. Ironically, other than the physical, there is nothing to recommend LaMotta as a character around whom a movie should be centered. He greets every obstacle in his life, either person or event, by trying to batter it into bloody submission. There is no range to him and he is most certainly not a charismatic person. I certainly would not wish to spend more than a few moments in his presence much less the duration of this film, which ultimately depicts LaMotta as little more than a not especially intelligent, violent pugilist. The profane dialog is anything but memorable and the people who surround LaMotta are little more than ciphers. The film is brutal and often hard to watch, more so because of its pretense rather than brutality. Scorsese films the whole thing in stark black and white and choreographs some of the boxing footage with mournful classical music. All of these touches seem to indicate a serious subject of near biblical importance &#150; but that subject most definitely is not seen on screen in the guise of LaMotta. Joe Pesci pretty much contributes his stock Joe Pesci performance as Jake's brother. The film's biggest attempt at humor comes at the expense of Cathy Moriarty, a whiskey-voiced actress who resembles a 30-year-old vamp but who the film initially tries to pass off as a virginal 15-year-old(!). To her credit, she gets past that initial hurdle and makes Vickie LaMotta the only sympathetic character in the film. Raging Bull is by no stretch a bad film, but it is a criminally overrated one done in by ostentatious pretentiousness and an unsympathetic central character who (no matter how amazing the actor's physical transformation) is nothing more than a one-dimensional thug.

Holden plays David - and he's the man Sabrina has loved from childhood. When she returns from studying cooking in Paris, she's grown into a beautiful, chic young woman, and David notices her for the first time. Because David is engaged to a suitable woman and fearful of him causing yet another scandal with a woman, Linus tries to distract Sabrina by making a play for her himself.All the actors are superb, of course, if the casting is a tad odd. As usual, Hepburn is playing opposite men many years her senior - Holden by 11 years and Bogart by 30. People often ask the reason for this occurring again and again with Hepburn. The answer is easy. Though she is actually of the Tab Hunter-Robert Wagner era, which is the first group after the Golden Age of Hollywood, Hepburn was a much bigger star and much more sophisticated than anyone of her generation of actors - as big and sophisticated, in fact, as stars of the golden age. Therefore, she was always cast with equals. Can you see her costarring with Tab Hunter? No. Sabrina is a perfect role for her - gamine, sophisticated in her Givenchy gowns, wide-eyed with that amazing smile. Bogart wanted Bacall in this role - she was too worldly to play Sabrina.Originally the Bogart character was to be played by Cary Grant, which makes a little, if not a lot more sense. Holden's hair was dyed blond to give him a younger appearance. At 35, he is disarmingly handsome, very charming and quite funny. He and Bogart don't look much like brothers. A bigger problem, in my opinion, is that Hepburn and Bogart don't really click, as good as they both are in their roles, and they are great. When Wilder was asked about how difficult Bogart was, he shrugged it off. Didn't he make fun of your accent? the interviewer pressed. Oh, everyone did that, Wilder said. It doesn't matter.

A visually flashy film so far for the one positive thing I have to say about this film...As for the rest... This relentlessly pointless and quite boring film makes one wonder what has been going on in the life of Terry Gilliam recently for him to decide to waste his talent, his energy, his time - and other people's money - on making it. Is he going through a mid-life crises? Possibly. Is this movie a way for him to weep over the oh-so wonderful free-spirited and concerned 60s? Probably. Is he a bitter old left-winger who desperately wanted to make a hip drug film (perhaps also inspired by the success of Trainspotting) to impress the young viewers of today and inject into their brains some more of the old and tired counterculture nonsense? Definitely. Gilliam must have been terribly impressed by Natural Born Killers to the extent that he decided to make his own NBK, only his would be about drug use, Vietnam, and all that. He uses similar visual tricks as Stone, but they don't help. Sure, this film would have been even more boring without the visual gimmickry, but unlike NBK it's dull. Gilliam's hatred for authority (and capitalism) is obvious, but his criticism of it lacks intelligence. His simple-minded portrayal of cops as brain-dead morons shows that he indulges in stereotypes just as much as the people he despises, which makes him just as bad as they are (if they are bad). Las Vegas is supposed to represent all that is\/was foul in the American system etc etc etc, and this point is hammered onto our heads, on and on, with constant references to the American Dream and with American flags cynically displayed in every other scene. Gilliam has embarrassed himself and hurt his reputation with this big, indulgent yawn of a film, and it's really no wonder that the critics uniformly thrashed it. (Even Maltin, for once, managed to identify a bomb successfully.) Before the movie came out, Gilliam said that the 90s need this movie. No decade needs a movie like this.There is no good acting to speak of. This is by far the worst film I've seen Depp in, and his one-note line-delivery and unfunny performance get boring after just a few minutes. Depp and del Toro show us the full spectrum of grimaces they have learned to master over the years, and I only wish that the viewer could have as much fun in watching these two as they had in playing their manic roles. It is clear after just 2-3 minutes into this film that it'll be boring. The narration makes no sense 80% of the time, and the dialogues are even worse. The HMO is awful; there are maybe two or three moments in the film that might raise a feeble chuckle out of you. The so-called events and characters just pile up, without rhyme or reason. Well, it's a drug film, after all. Ha.

A visually flashy film so far for the one positive thing I have to say about this film...As for the rest... This relentlessly pointless and quite boring film makes one wonder what has been going on in the life of Terry Gilliam recently for him to decide to waste his talent, his energy, his time - and other people's money - on making it. Is he going through a mid-life crises? Possibly. Is this movie a way for him to weep over the oh-so wonderful free-spirited and concerned 60s? Probably. Is he a bitter old left-winger who desperately wanted to make a hip drug film (perhaps also inspired by the success of Trainspotting) to impress the young viewers of today and inject into their brains some more of the old and tired counterculture nonsense? Definitely. Gilliam must have been terribly impressed by Natural Born Killers to the extent that he decided to make his own NBK, only his would be about drug use, Vietnam, and all that. He uses similar visual tricks as Stone, but they don't help. Sure, this film would have been even more boring without the visual gimmickry, but unlike NBK it's dull.
