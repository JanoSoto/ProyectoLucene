As it turns out, God being all knowing and all seeing, saw to it that these codes could only be unraveled by computer.Before the opening credits have finished rolling, there's this guy named Rostenburg (Yehuda Efroni) sitting at his computer where he has just finished deciphering The Omega Code. Just before being eliminated by a bullet hole to the chest, he rips part of the code out of his book and hides it in his shirt pocket. The guy doing the killing turns out to be Dominic (Michael Ironside), who is prancing about in the most ridiculous Rabbi disguise straight out of the Halloween Costume Department of Wal-mart.After stealing the CD Rom which contains the computer program that unlocks the code, and not for one minute thinking to search the corpse, Dominic begins his escape where he is quickly confronted by two strange characters, who after showing Dominic that his pistol is no match for their angelic prowess, tell him to be on his way like a good little boy so he can kill a few more rabbis or priests or whoever crosses his path the wrong way.Later on we will find out that Dominic is employed by a guy named Stone Alexander (Michael York) whose goal it is to rule the world by making sure the biblical prophecies are fulfilled. The best part of this opening sequence is that it let's us know early on that nothing in this film is going to involve logic, but at least the opening credits were finally over.We quickly zoom back to the good old U.S.A. where we meet Tony Robbins wannabe Gillen Lane (Van Dien) just as he is about to appear on an Oprah TV like show hosted by Cassandra Barashe (Catherine Oxenberg). She doesn't seem too enamored of Lane as he comes bouncing out like Dr. Phil on steroids and immediately gets the audience applauding and laughing along with his antics as he preaches to them how they can release their own empowerment. The funniest thing about this whole sequence is that the audience looks as if they were paraded over from TBN's Praise the Lord show and their laughter sounded like it was stolen from an old I Love Lucy episode canned laugh track.Shortly thereafter we meet Gillen's wife, Jennifer (Devon Odessa) who is not at all amused by his globe trotting, book selling antics. Jennifer has two personalities, glum and glummer. There's also his daughter Maddie (Ayla Kell), who simply loves her papa regardless of what her dour mother thinks. Later, Gillen once again runs into the Oprah host Cassandra, who has mysteriously quit her television show to become a globe trotting reporter completely in awe of Stone. Stone, with Gillen's help starts shaping world events so that the prophecies of The Omega Code can fall into place, which in turn will make Stone more powerful than a locomotive, faster than a speeding bullet, and holier than Jesus Christ himself.All of the events in The Omega Code take place over a period of about seven years, but the way this film is edited it could easily have been two days or two hundred years. We are never given any logical sense of time and place. Often, when Gillen is running from Stone's men or the police, he escapes but we are never shown exactly how. And he does a lot of running. At least a fourth of this film's running time is taken up with shots of Gillen running up the street or down the street or onto another street, running out of an alley or into a tunnel.In another sequence he returns home and at first his wife Jennifer won't talk to him. Then she holds up a sign saying the house is bugged and immediately they begin talking about their escape plan. In another goofy moment, Gillen is at the home of a friend who is secretly working for Stone. Coincidentally and right on cue, when the friend has to pop into the bathroom, the phone rings, Gillen picks it up and it just happens to be Stone once again which enables Gillen to escape.As for the rest of the cast, I have to admit I didn't mind Michael York's over the top portrayal of Stone. He made me fondly remember the lineup of villains on the old Batman TV series. As for Dien and Ironside, both of who took a right turn out of the bug hunting of Starship Troopers to appear in this mess, my suggestion is that they both re-enlist in the marines. Oxenberg does nothing more than appear as needed when the plot calls for it. Just about anybody could have phoned the part in . Too bad they couldn't get the real Oprah at least that would have been interesting, but you won't find Oprah within a thousand miles of this fiasco.If Crouch and Company were trying to win over some converts with this film, they probably failed. I'm sure it pleased those who are already sending in their nickels and dimes to the TBN conglomerate, but it certainly won't convince too many others. The plot is convoluted and totally incoherent. The dialog is stilted and goofy. The directing and editing wouldn't even pass the mustard on a network hour long television show. Anyway, if you're a good Christian, I am sure you can find some good causes to send your money to instead of lining the pockets of the Crouches. It'll get you closer to heaven then this mess ever will.

The second act is interesting too and competently done. The 40-some captured Mende are introduced to New England culture, such as it was in 1839, and Spielberg does a nice job with language problems, misunderstandings, and the clash between the outraged and murderous big black guys on the one hand, and the psalm-singing shrunken white moralists on the other. The third act kind of loses steam and ultimately peters out in a series of trials -- three actually -- in which the blacks ultimately gain the freedom they'd lost in Sierra Leone.I'll give one example each of the movie's strong points and weaknesses.Djimon Hounsou is terrific as the lead would-be slave. He's an impressive physical presence, tall, muscular, brooding. When he's angry he booms and shouts and his eyes bulge slightly. He is every intimidated white person's nightmare come true. But that's his character. As an actor he's far more sly, and this is no one-note performance. He rarely smiles but when he is obviously pleased he looks out of the corners of his eyes, shyly, almost furtively, and it's touching. His Mende-ness, his other-ness, is suggested just enough. He stands a little too close to the people he's dealing with, the way Mediterranean people do. And if it makes US a little uncomfortable just watching it, we can only imagine how the descendants of the Mayflower felt about this whole business. Close enough to smell each other! The Africans are treated as ordinary folks, which is pretty much what they are, allowing for cultural differences, and we get to see enough of the inhuman way they were treated by slavers to know the suffering they've been through. And that's about where the movie drops the ball. Spielberg and his writers don't really trust the audience enough to allow them understanding to this extent. The Africans, if not exactly ennobled by their horrors, are given dramatic scenes which are too many in quantity and too bald in their intent.Hounsou -- in the middle of a trial in which his fate is being decided, carried on in a language he does not understand -- has to stand up in the docks raise his manacled fists and repeatedly shout, Give us FREE. Give us FREE! And in the denouement, when they are freed for the last time to return to Africa, Hounsou goes from white savior to white savior, eyes brimming with tears, while soupy music swells in the background, and clasps hands with each of them -- at length. (That last handclasp almost turns shockingly into a high-five.) It's not only unnecessary, it goes on way too long.Well, I'll throw in another observation. Anthony Hopkins is John Quincy Adama, former President, by this time in his life course a curmudgeonly old geezer with a lot still on the ball. He only has two scenes -- an early introduction in which we see him perfunctorily giving orders to people trying to help him walk. (Gimme a hand. Leggo my arm.) And a later summary given to the court that once and for all ends the legal baloney. The speech isn't really well written. It doesn't say much, and what it says is not particularly gripping. But Hopkins' performance could not be improved upon. He's got the role down pat, even to the suggestion of a Boston accent. Not MUCH of a Boston accent, but no more than is necessary because, after all, in 1839 Bostonians may have sounded as much like their Brit ancestors as like Barney Frank.The photography is great. The location shooting is good -- those dreary New England winters. Well worth seeing, despite the overdone moralizing.

Not MUCH of a Boston accent, but no more than is necessary because, after all, in 1839 Bostonians may have sounded as much like their Brit ancestors as like Barney Frank.The photography is great. The location shooting is good -- those dreary New England winters. Well worth seeing, despite the overdone moralizing.

I knew little about it before watching it and, from the initial scene, I thought is was going to be a murder mystery. But it turns out to be an excellent psychological drama. It involves the interactions of the lives of ten people (at least that is what I counted). I found that you had to stay attentive to follow this and, in fact, I got a lot more out of it on second viewing.For example, a couple things I did not catch on first viewing was the first scene with John sitting in his car in the alley and not answering his phone (why was that scene in there and what was he doing there?), and the brief glimpse of Patrick at Valerie's talk (underlined by threatening music). There are many scenes that you come to understand only later - this movie does not insult your intelligence. And there are some hooks planted to keep your interest, like when Valerie (a psychiatrist) asks her patient Sonja if she still loves her husband and the scene lingers and finally fades before we hear the answer. And Sonja's husband ultimately listens to a tape of that session, but stops listening before he hears the answer, since he is afraid to hear it. Then toward the end, he has the courage to find out what the answer is, an answer we have been waiting for too.The movie is tightly edited and every scene is important. I particularly liked the way many small scenes were interleaved to make a whole. This kind of complex plotting is very tricky, but it works wonderfully well here.The acting is first rate. Geoffrey Rush has the ideal face and affect to realize his character's remote disconnectedness. Barbara Hershey perfectly plays the part of a psychiatrist with her own problems. Kerry Armstrong's portrayal of a woman struggling with marital conflict is astonishing - her facial expressions are nuanced and often heartrending. Never have I seen such an on-screen collection of so many sexy middle-aged women. The smaller parts are well played too - I particularly liked Detective Vat's emotionally precocious younger son in his brief scenes.There are many themes here, but the most significant one I think is trust. Valerie is torn apart and eventually dies because of her inability to trust - her inability to trust her husband, her patients, a stranger, and, ultimately, herself. In her speech at the beginning of the story she tosses out a myriad of doubts, saying that we don't know what to feel anymore, or what is right or wrong, or what to believe in. And then she adds that trust is vital to human relationships, but it is very elusive. It is certainly elusive for her, to the point that she misguidedly suspects her husband of having a homosexual affair with one of her patients. And she ultimately meets her death because of her lack of trust of a stranger who has rescued her from an accident on a lonely back road. In an ironic touch, the acknowledgment in Valerie's book about the murder of her eleven year old daughter is To John for teaching me to trust again. So often in an act of self-delusion we announce that we have conquered our demons. Valerie's husband, in his confessing to an affair in the past, says that once that's happened you're never entirely believed again - something gets broken, permanently, trust I suppose. He is a guilt-ridden unhappy man, but he is not trying to fool himself. But he is fooling his wife by not being forthcoming about anything - even the fact that he frequently visits the site of his daughter's murder. He says that the only thing keeping him and Valerie together is grief. This is clearly a marriage in trouble. Why do people continue to live in such unhappy relationships? Why does Detective Vat have a rather meaningless brief affair that risks his marriage and family? He confesses to his inamorata that he still loves his wife and she asks him, Why do you want to see me if you are still in love with your wife? And the best Vat can respond is to say, I don't know. On the flip side we have Nik and Paula, who do seem to have trust. When the evidence is pointing to Nik's having killed Valerie, his wife Paula is distressed, but when she hears Nik's denial her anxiety vanishes and is replaced by sympathy. That scene plays out in front of Detective Vat who is having trust issues in his own marriage.This movie seems to be saying that Newton's first law of motion applies to human behavior most of us continue to lumber along doing what we have always done by inertia, and it takes a major event to cause us to change direction.And I must mention the music, which is essential to the enjoyment of this movie - it sets just the proper mood at all times. I only wish I spoke Spanish so I could have understood that final song.

Yet I hadn't, for some strange reason it had dropped off my list of what to watch, so I sat down with a glass of something nice and red and returned to the world of toys.There's nothing too different about this movie from the first apart from the storyline itself, the characters and their voices are all the same, and they've recaptured them perfectly for this movie. Probably the only negative point of the similarity is the animation, CGI has moved on since Toy Story and it shows a little here, however what is good is that the animation of Toy Story has a unique quality to it and even if you were to see a few seconds without any recognisable characters you would know it was a Toy Story movie. So although the animation appears slightly dated (especially seeing it years after release) it does help to pull you into that world again.Cleverly though the writers have looked at the world of toys and looked for other challenges that they would face if they really were alive, and they've come up with some superb ideas. They've created situations and scenes that are extremely imaginative and yet so obvious (if you were a toy), and what they've pulled out of these are some great performances for the characters and actors, and some genuinely funny moments. Often with a sequel you are treated to an inferior story and less laughs (with a comedy anyway, with other genres you often get more laughs!) but what they've done here is to raise the bar over the original Toy Story, and frankly it was something I just couldn't believe they could do.The characters are genuinely lovable and understandable, it's all too easy to get attached to them and be pulled into their world. Before long you find yourself caring for them and you'll be feeling their highs and lows, and even a small lump in the throat at times.There were a few nods to other movies in here, again I won't spoil it by listing them, but they added to the adult factor of the film, something which Pixar has really managed to comprehend. They manage time and time again to make a movie which appeals to both children and adults together without any clash of the two. It will certainly be interesting to see where the Disney only sequel will go.Overall it's a very satisfying movie giving you everything you want from a good family movie, whether you be a kid or an adult, or even somewhere in between, it's a great fun movie with some good laughs, and definitely on a par if not better than the original.

Truly dreadful, perhaps more so since I simply cannot understand where the director was trying to go.Second comment don't read the rest of this if you don't want to read plenty of spoilers! The set-up is impressive young Ruth (Winslet) travels to India on a lark, goes to see a live guru as a joke, and ends up in a cult-induced trance. Her parents and family, clutching at straws, hire high-priced cult exiter PJ Waters (Keitel) to unbrainwash her. For 10,000 Australian dollars, he promises to turn her back to reality in three days, once they've tricked her into returning home to pay her last respects to her father (who of course is not really dying). It is emphasized that Waters is a highly respected professional who is renowned for his impressive success rate with cult victims. They then entrust Waters to take the voluptuous Ruth out to a remote shack and leave her alone with him for three days. Waters arrives from the airport exuding confidence, professionalism, and charisma.So much for the set-up, which I repeat was quite good. It is therefore all the more disappointing, and yes, actually shocking, that the whole thing turns into a teenage high school movie almost immediately. Waters hardly waits 24 hours before he's humping Ruth. Given her sexuality and beauty, this is not shocking. However, rather than admitting he made an unprofessional mistake and moving on, Waters turns into a love-struck idiot who acts like a person who has taken leave of his wits. He continues to pursue Ruth, even when she tries to push him away by humiliating him (dressing him in a red dress and lipstick) and by insulting him. He is like a high school puppy who is pining after the pom-pom girl. It's embarrassing to watch.As Ruth tries to run away from the shack, Waters pursues her, still with the red dress on, and for some unfathomable reason, ONE cowboy boot. The sight of Harvey Keitel stumbling in the outback in a red dress, lipstick smeared all over his mouth, and walking unevenly on one lizard-skin cowboy boot, mumbling Ruth, I love you! is one I will make every effort to forget as soon as possible. I kept waiting for some semblance of what might really happen to occur, but the ending was just as stupid and nonsensical as the aforementioned events.I guess this is one for the cult audience (pun intended) and will be shown in alternative theaters for years, no doubt.

And I usually LOVE Keitel. Truly dreadful, perhaps more so since I simply cannot understand where the director was trying to go.Second comment don't read the rest of this if you don't want to read plenty of spoilers! The set-up is impressive young Ruth (Winslet) travels to India on a lark, goes to see a live guru as a joke, and ends up in a cult-induced trance. Her parents and family, clutching at straws, hire high-priced cult exiter PJ Waters (Keitel) to unbrainwash her. For 10,000 Australian dollars, he promises to turn her back to reality in three days, once they've tricked her into returning home to pay her last respects to her father (who of course is not really dying). It is emphasized that Waters is a highly respected professional who is renowned for his impressive success rate with cult victims. They then entrust Waters to take the voluptuous Ruth out to a remote shack and leave her alone with him for three days. Waters arrives from the airport exuding confidence, professionalism, and charisma.So much for the set-up, which I repeat was quite good. It is therefore all the more disappointing, and yes, actually shocking, that the whole thing turns into a teenage high school movie almost immediately. Waters hardly waits 24 hours before he's humping Ruth. Given her sexuality and beauty, this is not shocking. However, rather than admitting he made an unprofessional mistake and moving on, Waters turns into a love-struck idiot who acts like a person who has taken leave of his wits. He continues to pursue Ruth, even when she tries to push him away by humiliating him (dressing him in a red dress and lipstick) and by insulting him. He is like a high school puppy who is pining after the pom-pom girl.

I know that I'll probably get so much hate mail from every guy that reads this, but the truth is, I find action movies, dull and boring. There is nothing to them generally and it's just a bunch of fighting. I find it boring, more than anything. But, to each his own I suppose. Give me Steel Magnolias, any day. At any rate, this movie is set apart, far from any other action movie. In a way, it makes fun of all other aciton movies. Sort of like 'Scream' is to the horror genre.Danny (O'Brien), a thirteen year old boy from New York, lives alone with his mother in the 'not-so-nice' area of town. He skips school to go to the movies, and to hang out with his fifty-something friend, who runs the projectors. One night, after his apartment is robbed, he runs to the theater at midnight, to see a sneak preview of the new Jack Slater movie, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now, when I say that, I mean in the movie, there is a separate Schwarzenegger.With a magic ticket that his friend gives him, Danny enters the world of Jack Slater, and is now inside the movie. With (of course)action, girls, more action, and more than a few punches at the expense of Arnold (in real life and in the movies), the film is made up of good humor, and plenty of guy action, and is very entertaining. Quite enjoyable, and very laughable, and fun to watch.And, guys, don't think that just 'cause I'm a girl, and I don't normally like action movies, that this one sucks, or anything like that, 'cause it doesn't.

Well this was one of the few.The film begins with a very well done opening sequence in which a fornicating couple is attacked by a giant hairy beast. The beasts head us subsequently shot off. The man escapes with a few cuts but the woman was savagely mauled to death. Later on we re-join the man as he has his sister, nephew and their dog over for a visit. The dog is instantly suspicious of the man (whom of course is now a werewolf after surviving an attack by one) but the others don't suspect a thing. After some mangled corpses are found around the mans house (trailer) he decides to move to his sisters and thus begins the heart pounding tale of Dog VS Werewolf! This movie isn't anything special and really isn't that great as a movie in general but it's one of the better werewolf films around and one of the best werewolf films out of the 90's.The performances from Michael Pare and Mariel Hemingway as the werewolf and his sister are both about average but the standout performance in the movie comes from the Dog portraying Thor. Best canine performance in werewolf cinema history by far! And I love the fact that the lead character is a dog.The werewolf itself is totally badass. Its head it quite obviously robotic but it's still a great design. The eyes are downright frightening and it's a hulking, hairy, wolf snouted beast as a werewolf should be.The attack sequences are savage and violent. The opening scene is one of the most brutal werewolf attack put to film. There are also one or two very suspenseful scenes with great atmosphere. The woods are rarely as frightening as in this film.It moves along at a very quick, breezy pace at only 75 minutes which is a very good thing; this movie wouldn't have worked as well if it got bogged down with silly subplots.The film has its share of problems of course. When the dog and werewolf finally do go head to head it just comes off as silly. The kid playing the Michael Pares nephew (also known as Dennis the Menace) is just plain annoying.Overall this is a good light horror film; I highly recommend it to all werewolf fans.

The plot of course portrays a suburban household where some very ghostly things start happening, and how the Freelings - who live there - have to cope.Among other things, this may be the only horror movie that begins by playing The Star-Spangled Banner. You'll probably have a very different impression of the TV after watching Poltergeist, mainly because of the movie's most famous line. And I don't know whether or not it changes anything that Dominique Dunne (Dana) died while the movie was in the theaters, or that Heather O'Rourke (Carol Anne) died six years later.All in all, this is a top-notch movie. The special effects, more than just being cool, actually do give one a sense of fear. The cast does a great job. Craig T. Nelson as dad Steve is fatherly but can blow his top. JoBeth Williams as mom Diane puts a real spin on the image of the suburban housewife. Beatrice Straight as Dr. Lesh looks weird but keeps her cool. James Karen as developer Mr. Teague plays his usual mealy-mouthed character. And that one scene with JoBeth Williams (you know which one I mean)...well, let's just say that the teenage boys must have liked it the first time that they saw it. Oh, and this movie may make you wonder whether your house was built somewhere where it shouldn't have been. Perfect.

I just saw it as it is Comedy\/Action with bit of odd ball sci-fi mixed in, and it wasn't so bad. Was there crudity in this movie that I didn't detect ? I don't know, but things were pretty light hearted as I saw it and I kind of liked it. I did like the cinematography of this film. The color was nice, and CGI integration I thought was superb. The odd ball couple of Will Smith with Kevin Kline's chemistry worked, and Selma Hayek added feminine touch which wouldn't have existed if it were up to just Smith and Kline. If people didn't like this movie it's probably because it made jokes about everything without any regards to the original plot. I'm offended too when I see a movie that just took cursory ideas from say a good comic book series, and absolutely ruined its concept and artistry. But I have no frame of reference for this movie because I never got acquainted with the original series. Maybe they shouldn't have called it Wild Wild West, and called it an original movie.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 January 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't know much about the original TV series, so I don't have any references to compare this movie to.

From David Byrne's entrance across a tape-marked floor, you know that this will be a truly cinematographic movie. Johnathan Demme's direction is superb, utilising stage-wide pans and long takes. The sound quality is crisp, and vastly different from the soundtrack album, which is arguably Talking Heads' bestApparently, the film has a plot, akin to a concept album, a man trying to enter the human race, or some such, but even without the plot it is a worthy film. The film has no distinct turning point or act-series. Each of the 16 songs could be argued as the turning point.Even though this movie was released in 1984, while the band still had 3 albums yet to make, the movie is the pinnacle of Talking Heads' career.There are so many memorable moments, which i will not state here for that would just be selfish of me. Stop Making Sense is truly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time and i recommend it to all viewers, unless you don't like Talking Heads.In which case, go and watch something else.
