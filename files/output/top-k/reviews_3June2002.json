He was brilliant as Johnny and even though he was the bully you couldn't help but like him and I had the biggest crush on him growing up and I was only 7 when I saw this at the movies and watched all his movies until Shootfighter and of course when he was on the Equalizer and he was quiet for a while until High Voltage and Python were released in Australia as not all his movies are released here.He put so much heart and soul into his performance as Johnny and it was a shame that he was typecast as the bully in his other films but then again, he was the best actor in Back to School.Elisabeth Shue gave an honest and real performance as Ali but was relogated to the role of girlfriend in her other films until Leaving Las Vegas when again she showcased her wonderful acting ability  and Pat Morita was brilliant as Miyagi. It's a shame that the sequel didn't focus more on the Cobra Kais and Ali as after the opening of the 2nd one the movie fell apart from then on.When Karate Kid 3 was released all I knew then was that Kreese was after revenge and it would have been great if the original Cobra Kais made an appearance other than the arcive footage as the first Karate Kid worked so well when they were on screen that when they weren't the film got a little boring. Of course Ralph's character in the beginning wasn't a expert on karate and of course the underdog has to win the tournament and the girl but I didn't like his character as he lies to his potential new friends and his sometimes treatment of Ali made you want the Cobra Kais to win, but of course in movie land this isn't possible. It's hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. It hasn't dated funnily enough and is always showing on cable. Teen movies are sure a lot different today than what they were in the 80s. It seems every decade the new generation of teens latch onto those 80s movies and even though the fashion etc are questionable, some of the best movies were from the 1980s and this is certainly one of them.

Clancy wanted Affleck to play Ryan, so he re-wrote this to be a prequel of sorts. He used the underlying Premise of SOAF to go back in time, re-develop the character, and create more adventures. He was limited by the Ryan in the novel SOAF because it is unrealistic to have a director of the CIA to be running around everywhere. Imagine that Hunt, Patriot Games, and C&P danger haven't happened yet.I was one of the people who thought Affleck was a horrible choice - until I saw this performance. For once in his career, Affleck gets a meaty character and is multi-dimensional.  I felt the supporting cast was A+ and the confusion ensuing something like this is real. The Jack Clark character is top notch. I love him in this no-nonsense role.As far as the movie goes, it has every quality I look for.  Character development, plot development, good script, and things that make sense. Too many action movies let you see a 3-2-1 countdown and stop it at 1.2 seconds to build fake suspense.  In addition, it had drama, sadness, humor, action, violence, intelligence, special effects - all of which make this terrific.I find this movie to be the solid building blocks of a new franchise. USA today (2 stars out of 4) said that it took too long to develop and criticized that the director of the CIA was ignoring his cell phone during the football game.  I found that the time to develop the characters was WELL worth it.  Too many action films today are shoot-em-up and build fake suspense. This suspense was real and kept me on the edge of my seat. I hate action films (like Don't Say a Word for instance), where at the end the protagonist has the advantage and doesn't shoot the bad guy because of moral ambiguity. Then, somehow, the bad guy gets a gun and the good guy is justified to shoot him. In this film, I LOVED that they hunted the bad guys down like dogs and showed no mercy. This is believable. This gives great satisfaction to a viewer who has just seen literally millions of people killed.Another facet about the movie that gave this credibility was the fact it didn't try to get credibility.  It didn't try to convince the viewers that millions died to get an effect. It didn't rattle off all of Affleck's credentials like so many movies do in the first 10 minutes. He wasn't called Dr. Ryan until he met the Russian president 50 minutes into it. I loved that he was ambiguous towards commitment with his gf, it shows real fear. However, the blast made him suddenly realize what was important and was a driving factor in his commitment. More movies should try to downplay credentials - you end up giving the character more credit.  As a point of reference, I look at Seagal movies. In the first 15 minutes, he had to be some special forces guru who knew everything. Why couldn't he just be an average guy who overachieves like Bruce Willis in Die Hard?  Seagal's career is weary at best now because he has an ego with his scripts.  Viewers like to relate to over-achievers, and I feel Affleck did a GREAT job playing an average guy who worked hard and is over-achieving and growing in strength as the ante is raised in global war.  The fact his character evolves to a stronger Ryan in the movie is great cinema.

Then, somehow, the bad guy gets a gun and the good guy is justified to shoot him. In this film, I LOVED that they hunted the bad guys down like dogs and showed no mercy. This is believable. This gives great satisfaction to a viewer who has just seen literally millions of people killed.Another facet about the movie that gave this credibility was the fact it didn't try to get credibility.  It didn't try to convince the viewers that millions died to get an effect. It didn't rattle off all of Affleck's credentials like so many movies do in the first 10 minutes. He wasn't called Dr. Ryan until he met the Russian president 50 minutes into it. I loved that he was ambiguous towards commitment with his gf, it shows real fear. However, the blast made him suddenly realize what was important and was a driving factor in his commitment. More movies should try to downplay credentials - you end up giving the character more credit.  As a point of reference, I look at Seagal movies. In the first 15 minutes, he had to be some special forces guru who knew everything. Why couldn't he just be an average guy who overachieves like Bruce Willis in Die Hard?  Seagal's career is weary at best now because he has an ego with his scripts.  Viewers like to relate to over-achievers, and I feel Affleck did a GREAT job playing an average guy who worked hard and is over-achieving and growing in strength as the ante is raised in global war.  The fact his character evolves to a stronger Ryan in the movie is great cinema.

A must see for everyone. I guess this film obviously makes for a great date movie. This is an excellent romantic comedy about a man and a mermaid who fall in love for each other in a modern fairy tale. This film was one of Tom Hanks' earliest hits that made him the huge superstar that he is today. Co-star Daryl Hannah, who plays Madison the mermaid, became herself a huge star from this film, but now times have changed in her film career, which has faded during the 1990s, which is sad. She is a great actress.  John Candy plays Tom Hanks' older brother with Eugene Levy playing a crazy scientist who tries to prove that mermaids exist. These two provide some of the film's hilarious comedic moments.The romantic chemistry between Hanks' Allen Bauer and Hannah's Madison are just well done. Their characters' relationship just becomes true romance throughout the entire film. When Madison eventually gets caught as a mermaid, Allen realizes that Madison is the one true love that he can never lose. Allen, along with his brother and the crazy scientist, band together to rescue her. Later, Allen realizes that Madison was the little girl mermaid that rescued him when he was a young boy in the film's opening flashback sequence.Splash was directed by Ron Howard, who is, of course, one of Hollywood's great filmmakers. A movie about a mermaid has to be good, and Splash does this so well. Tips off to the crew of this movie who made it so real. The underwater sequences are well done, as well as Daryl Hannah herself as the mermaid. She is just utterly believable as a mermaid! I must say that she is just so sexy in the rubber mermaid tail suit. She swims in it so well! I really thought that she played Madison to perfection! I can really enjoy a movie about a mermaid nowadays.On one other note, most people probably don't know this, but Splash was followed up by a Disney TV movie sequel in 1988 that aired in two parts on the ABC network on what used to be a show called The Disney Sunday Movie. The sequel was called Splash, Too and starred Todd Waring as Allen Bauer and Amy Yasbeck (movies Problem Child 1 and 2, The Mask, Pretty Woman, Robin Hood Men In Tights, and TV's Wings) as Madison Bauer, now married from a Neptune ceremony. This sequel has Allen and Madsion come back to New York from their island hideaway to help Allen's brother Freddie (played by Donovan Scott) save Bauer Produce from going out of business. Madison has her own agenda later on as she finds a dolphin she knows from her past, named Salti, captured by another crazy scientist for study.  Not a great sequel of course (as sequels usually are) but it was sort of nice to know that Allen and Madison had another adventure together. There were some funny moments in the movie. It was particularly challenging to see Madison cope with suburban life and trying to understand how to be a housewife. I wasn't bothered that much with the recasting of new actors as these characters either. I did like Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison in this sequel. She too swims and looks nice in a mermaid fish tail as well! A worthy successor to Daryl Hannah in her own right. Some people who have seen Splash, Too think that its even better than the original film. And to others, its an awful sequel that doesn't compare to the original. Some folks even think that Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison is even better than Daryl Hannah's! Mixed reviews none the less. Unfortunately, this sequel is not available on home video to my knowledge. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2002","score":"","review":"  This movie really brought a fairy tale type story to life.

I wasn't really bored at all over the course of the movie; but I was quite disappointed when it ended because it doesn't tell us anything and take us anywhere; I can't believe some of the reviewers wrote that they liked the ending. Why do they like it? Is it because it makes you wonder what will happen next? The ending was quite incomplete, I thought this movie would last about 3 hours to give us a perfect ending, but I was actually surprised that it lasted only two and ended making fun of the viewers, that means us! The end makes you confused and doesn't keep us in suspense; nevertheless I loved the way Helen Mirren told the other maid the truth about her son, she gives an absolutely believable performance, she was magnificent in her supporting role, her academy award nomination was well deserved. Even though the end was somewhat disappointing I liked knowing that Mr. Williams's son was supposedly the murderer. It was very unexpected; this is the only thing I really liked about the ending. The whole cast is amazingly adequate; they all gave believable and challenging performances. Kristin Scott Thomas was great in portraying the leading character. She always shows us her talent. Even if her performance wasn't as remarkable as the one she gave in The English Patient I consider her very appropriate for the role. Ryan Phillips gives an interesting performance, it was much better than the one he gave in Cruel Intentions, it was outstanding. The academy award nominee Emily Watson keeps amazing me as always as well as Maggie Smith who delivers a riveting performance as the old upper-class woman. I'm glad all these performances were recognized with an Actor award for best ensemble cast, since they really offer a tremendous reading and understanding of their characters. Godsford Park showed exquisite care in preparing the scenes of 1932 England and an accurate eye for the costumes, as well as outstanding performances from the actors. The story unfolds slowly, but masterfully, however it builds to one of the most inappropriate and disappointing endings ever. 7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers Having seen Godsford Park at midnight, I can honestly say it's been one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen.

It separates itself from his standard formula, in one notable way.  Rather than the usually theme of an ordinary man trapped in an extraordinary situation, Hitchcock presents the main character as a villain, something he did in only one other film, one of his most well known ones at that.A man living in the city (Joseph Cotten) comes to a small town to live with his sister and her family.  His niece (Teresa Wright) feels she has an abnormally strong connection with him - in fact, there almost seems to be a sort of love interest between them, whether it be intentional or not.  She slowly grows to realize that he is a serial killer, and the story builds from that.Shadow of a Doubt shares the same technical and visual style that has made Hitchcock arguably the most important man ever to direct a movie.  As usual, he is able to bring excellent performances from his actors, most notably Cotten, who is perfect as the evil yet likeable uncle, and Wright, the naive young girl who slowly catches on.The performance of Cotten is important because Hitchcock's films usually feature a character that the viewer can relate to.  Cotten presents a character who, despite the fact that he is a serial killer, still makes the audience like him and sympathize with him.  This is similar to Psycho and Anthony Perkins.  Shadow of a Doubt succeeds in doing this because of three things - the excellent screenplay, Hitchcock's direction, and Cotten's performance.Despite the fact that this movie contains fewer great suspenseful action scenes than most Hitchcock movies, the storyline and the acting are as good as they have ever been.  It succeeds in all of its fundamentals, and most Hitchcock buffs will rate it as one of his best.**** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2002","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shadow of a Doubt is a one of a kind film by Hitchcock.

Moreover, films of that same school touted as being `scary,' as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  `The Others,' written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you can't swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you'll know you've arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go.  By the end of the film, it's clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.The Channel Islands, 1945  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children's nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there's more  Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.'  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne.  And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity.  If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds. Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film. The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.

Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there's more  Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.'  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne.  And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity.  If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds. Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film. The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, `The Others' is an inspired film that offers one of, if not `the' most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible  He's made the `Super' in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.  It's an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and it's the magic of the movies.  10\/10.                        ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller"}]
