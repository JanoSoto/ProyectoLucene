Based on the Marvel comic-book heroes created in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the X-Men movie is mostly just that--comic-book material. But it's done with such remarkable visual style, you might not notice its want of substance. In fact, X-Men resembles a lot of today's action movies; it involves a boatload of good actors in state-of-the-art technical wizardry and at its core lacks heart. As Gertrude Stein is supposed to have said of Oakland, There's no 'there' there. In typical comic-book fashion, both the premise and plot of X-Men are quite simple, but the filmmakers have done their best to muddle them up, making the first hour of patchwork developments a chore to piece together. Here's the idea Mankind, according to evolutionary theory, has taken millions of years to mutate into the species we are today; but what if those mutations could be effected in only a few years? Would not the result be a race of beings with possibly extraordinary powers compared to mere Homo sapiens? Without explaining how these instant mutations could occur, the story line assumes such things have already happened, resulting in a world of the not-too-distant future being inhabited by growing numbers of mutant people with unusual capabilities. Actually, it just gives the writers a flimsy excuse to let loose a bevy of superheroes and super-villains on the world without having to explain how they got that way. Even still Its the great series brought to life. Love it. Wolverine is the best.

Well, perhaps not. But it's hard to imagine The Terminator without Schwarzeneggar (I attempted to spell it without looking), and maybe that's only because the Terminator and Arnold have become synonymous since 1984. You can't think Terminator without thinking Ah'll be back. Of course, I wasn't even born in '84, so I don't really know how the movie was received before he became a cultural icon, but from the perspective of a 16-year-old here and now, I think it's a great movie.When you ignore the fact that now Ahnold is and always will be the Terminator, you can see that he really was good in the role. Sure, there isn't much for him to do- he talks in monotone, glares, and flexes- but his build, his accent, his face, everything about him was built for playing a robot- excuse me, cyborg. Kyle Reese would yell at me for being so glib.The hero of the movie, the aforementioned Kyle Reese, is played by Michael Biehn, who has a few shining moments, but doesn't really impress for the rest of the film. Linda Hamilton, on the other hand, shines throughout the entire movie as a young woman whose entire life turns upside down. She doesn't do the girlish freakout, a cliché that has grown really old, probably even by 1984; instead, she focuses on the fact that her life depends on every move she makes- while still showing fear. Hamilton pulls that off magnificently, despite a script that throws a few cheesy lines her way, thought she handles the cheese a lot better than Biehn does.I may sound pretty critical so far, what with the cheese and my disappointment with one of the main stars, but the truth is, despite those flaws, the rest of the movie delivers. Some people say this movie has an anti-nuclear-war message- I say, sure, for maybe five minutes. This isn't a message movie- it's a thriller, full of meaty action that really does thrill. The whole movie is basically a chase scene, but the chasing is gripping and creatively laid out. The only other James Cameron film I've seen is Titanic, and with these two movies I can tell that Cameron is very good at engaging the audience in intelligent action. The plot line is as creative as the action with its detailed mythology and harrowing climax. I don't want to ruin any of it though, because it's really a good story. Just see it, and you'll understand.It's a fun movie, and by now has been raised into the classic zone. And after seeing it a few times and not tiring of it in the least, I can see why.

Clearly listening to their fans who loved gigantic henchman Jaws from the previous movie, Gilbert and script writer Christopher Wood had to bring back the popular character. However, Wood basically ignored everything from Ian Fleming's third novel written in 1955. Moonraker is the story of how megalomaniac Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) plans to create a master race of superior human specimens in outer space on his space station while wiping out the entire world population using a toxic nerve gas. Drax then plans for future generations to return to Earth and re-populate it, as his toxin would not have armed any animal or plant. With Moonraker, James Bond became science fiction, to many people's chagrin. Fortunately, Bond would return to the spy thriller genre for the next film (For Your Eyes Only, 1981). Many fans feel that Moonraker went too far! Others feel that original story from the Fleming novel is far superior and more interesting than the unbelievable storyline in outer space. Does James Bond belong in a laser gun fight? Nevertheless, Roger Moore's fourth outing as James Bond is certainly one of his funniest, with a script packed with humour and play on words. The first half of the movie is very similar to any typical Bond adventure. Bond has to travel to Hugo Drax's residence to investigate the disappearance of a Moonraker shuttle. Bond seduces Drax assistant Corine DuFour (Corrine Clery), and goes through Drax's safe, finding blueprints for glassware made by Venini Glass. Escaping from two attempts on his life, Bond leaves Drax and henchman Chang (Toshiro Suga) for Venice, where he follows Drax employee Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) to Venini Glass. Bond later finds a secret laboratory where the glassware is being used to store a deadly chemical. Bond attempts to inform M, but Drax manages to move his laboratory before Bond can show any incriminating evidence to his superior. Bond is now left with two clues a packaging slip from C&W, and a phial containing the deadly chemical. Teaming up with Holly Goodhead who reveals herself as a CIA agent, Bond travels to Rio DE Janeiro where he finds an empty C&W warehouse. Q informs Bond that the chemical is a black orchid from the upper reaches of the Amazon. Bond makes his way to a hidden base in the Amazon, where Drax is launching various Moonraker shuttles in space. Up to this point, the storyline makes perfect sense, as Bond finds clues which leads him to different locations. He also uncovers that Holly Goodhead is a CIA agent, and finally ends in a typical situation having to save the world from a villain wanting its destruction. For the second time, Bond finds his way into an astronaut uniform, but this time, he does travel to space (as opposed to You Only Live Twice in 1965 where 007 is identified as an intruder and removed from the shuttle). If viewers can accept the unbelievable storyline in the last quarter of the movie, that their favourite spy finds his way in a Moonraker shuttle, having to team up with Jaws to battle Drax's army in a laser gun fight and having to destroy globes carrying the deadly chemical before they reach the Earth's atmosphere, the movie can be quite enjoyable. Learning from past mistakes, such as casting a dreadful actress for an important role (such as the awful Barbara Bach as secret agent Triple X in The Spy Who Loved Me), Gilbert and Broccoli chose an actress who could be believable as a CIA agent in Lois Chiles. Not being the most beautiful or talented actress, Chiles still delivered a convincing performance as Holly Goodhead. The returning Jaws and the fight between 007 and henchman Chang in the Venini Glass store were quite entertaining. Jaws was unfortunately not much of a threat to Bond, being used as comic relief throughout the movie and probably turned as a good guy due to his popularity with the younger audience. In The thirty silly minutes in space and having Frederick Gray & M go on the field to see the Drax laboratory (why would they ever do this?) isn't enough to tarnish a very good film. Moonraker is one of Roger Moore's best Bond, and easily better than The Spy Who Loved Me. We can look at the positives. The opening half hour is quite excellent, full of drama, brilliant dialogue, lots of real spying, and genuine suspense and action. Plus a beautiful, haunting theme song performed by Shirley Bassey.All as good as if not better than anything TSWLM had to offer. Even after that, we are treated to wonderful locations, more real spying (in Vienna), a terrific fight in a glass factory, and the eerie beauty of the Amazonian siren sequence. But all of this is offset by some of the series most ludicrous scenes. Dolly! Jaws becomes a wimp! Funny little spacemen shooting lasers! The cable car fight! That Bondola! And so on.
