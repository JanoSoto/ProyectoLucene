If movies were people this would be like finding out you were Hitler's nephew or worse, Charlton Heston's son. Menace achieved a lot, namely what many thought impossible; permanently sapping the lustre from what was an almost universally adored series. If the sparkle was to return to those stars this had to first class, grade A, top of the class stuff. Any reminder of its predecessor beyond the bare bones of plot continuity were therefore wise to avoid at all costs. Clones partially succeeds in restoring some pride to the series. Structually its better than its predecessor, the plot more straightforward and less marred by political spiel than before. However, this can't hide its wider failings. Just as before, none of the newer characters fail to make any impact. There's no Han Solo or Luke to offer us the simple pleasures of before. Padme no longer speaks with a lifeless monotone and could almost pass for a real human being. Binks, reviled by the entire universe has a greatly reduced role. Lucas puts two fingers up at those who maligned his 'comic' creation, i.e. everyone and ensures Jar Jar is central to a key plot point thus justifying his existence in the series. He'll claim it was planned that way all along of course but you don't need to be a Jedi to work out this is the cine-equivalent of the spoilt child who has to have the last word in an argument. It was still WRONG George, I don't care if the Gungan menace killed the Emperor himself. The central flaw in Clones is the relationship that should be its (and the series) emotional core, namely the relationship between Anakin and Padme. From the outset this is doomed on screen because of the casting of Hayden Christensen. His performance is so wooden and devoid of credibility that you might as well have hired the Gaffer's son and got him to read out the lines. We're asked to believe that this dull and stroppy teen will one day be the most feared man in the universe. So why does Padme fall in love with the little upstart? Lucas's script offers no clues. Anakin's diatribe on the failings of democracy should be enough to alarm any potential suteur but Padmes hardly bats an eyelid. She gets a another chance later after Anakin slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders but do any bulbs go off? Not a bit of it. Having proclaimed his murder of women and children the feckless former Monarch gives him a supportive hug! The problems of being attracted to a would-be fascist and murderer are offset, Lucas suggests, by the fact that Skywalker is good at rolling around in grass and making fruit float in the air, thus showcasing his playful qualities. We're left concluding that the most important couple in the galaxy came together because Padme is a sucker for a pretty face. Cynics may point to some evidence of misogyny here but in Lucas' defence this is the man who championed the role of women by putting Princess Leia in that slave girl two-piece. In any event Padme deserves everything she gets. Does the rest of the story fare any better? Sadly not. Obi Wan's journey to Kimino to visit a clone factory pushes story credibility to the limit. No one seems very alarmed by the prospect of entire army having being created in secret. Why should they you ask, the Jedi are in charge right? Wrong. Having being captured by Count Dooku the hapless Jedi is TOLD that Palpatine is the Emperor but dismisses it as dark side deception. Does no one think to check it out? Of course not and consequently only Yoda shows any common sense, only neglecting to mention his kidnap and replacement by a terrible puppet around the time of Menace. We're also treated to some moments of unintentional hilarity. Titter ye not at the Anakin blow job scene, and if you're watching toward the end try not to laugh when Yoda fights Dooku which looks like the Sith lord is trying to swat a giant fly. In contrast all the real jokes fail flat mostly, C3P0 the worst offender with some truly awful sub-Graham Norton punning that will make you wish you could disconnect your own head. Only Ewan McGregor in a more relaxed performance gets a good bit of deadpanning in with his caustic to get a drink response to Anakin's where are you going? question. So the romance is rushed and insubstantial - laced with some of the worst dialogue you'll hear in any language (A litter piece of me dies each day, yuk), and the Clone story fails to ignite due to lapses in plot logic and some flat delivery by the leads. On the plus side there are some nice set-pieces, though a little too cartoony is places, and a few crowd pleasing moments. All in all this is a better than before but not yet near the level set by the original trilogy. With only one film left to go there is a hell of a lot to be done (as well as a hell of lot of plot to get through) if this trilogy is to save face. Despite some attempts to improve, this is still the longest expositionary picture ever made. Skip it and watch the 2 minute scene in the original describing this period instead. Its over sooner and tells you all you need to know, namely very little.

The first being that it was an attempt to add action to Hugh Grant's CV. The second is the fact the film was a box-office flop, grossing only 17 million in the US. This is a shame, because it's actually quite a good film. `Extreme Measures' goes in the same genre as `All the President's Men', `Silkwood', `The Game' and `Arlington Road'. The classic `I'm-on-to-something-but-no-one-will-believe-me' scenario. OK, the film isn't perfect and probably not worth any special merit, but it definitely deserved a lot more attention than it received.While it's a welcome change from the romantic comedies that he's most famous for, it's still questionable whether Hugh Grant is a good lead for this type of film. While I thought he was convincing as the paranoid doctor, he excels better at lighter material. Gene Hackman always handles the bad guy role with the greatest ease. What separates it from the norm is the fact that the character isn't an average stereotype, and certainly doesn't fit the credentials of an average villain. Sarah Jessica Parker is OK in support as the assistant, but definitely not remarkable for any particular reason.In this genre of paranoiac thrillers, one thing that's always required is the ability to engage, and `Extreme Measures' has that in spades. If one aspect begins to get boring, a new revelation\/ plot twist is made and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. And when it looks as thought there is no hope that things will get better, the light is left in. In similar themed movies, they often aim for the bad ending that don't leave a satisfying taste. Luckily, `Extreme Measures' goes for an appropriately happy ending so as the paranoia is justified (just as well).Overall, `Extreme Measures' is an original and thoroughly compelling movie.

This movie actually made me feel ill for movies in general. It took some time to watch another movie after this experience.Whatever foreign-movie cliches this movie avoids, it substitutes stupidity in its place. The pouting, silent and pliable French lead is so seriously dull how can u watch her? The old man is supposed to be wise in the ways of the world and people, yet with that jaded disdain that gives him a sense of superiority. He really KNOWS people. The stuff this guy spits out is so outrageously phony and dull it's hard to keep a straight face. I suppose he is the sly fox who educates the innocent babe, never mind how false and boring it is. This is 'serious' filmmaking, remember.This movie is like a boring sculpture sitting in a vacuum-it's hard to breathe in here. Each scene seems as if carved from lead. It violates what i think is one of the rules of effective dramaturgy Not every single scene should be dramatic. These movies are supposed to move us and make us feel something, but they only put us in a trance with their emotional sameness.Witness Woody Allen's Interiors, another narcoleptic masterpiece of dreadful seriousness.

The plot is awful, acting is retched...and that damn 'Silver Shamrock' song...makes me want to drive rusty nails into my head to relieve myself from the pain.

The plot, while thoroughly contrived on the surface, takes on a rich depth by virtue of its narrator, who is in many ways untrustworthy. For example, every scene with Sue in it has something wrong with it. That pervasive song, the London fog and impossible cross streets in New York, and the general vagueness and lifelessness of the situations and people surrounding his memories all contribute to the question Does she even exist? His highly improbably stories about Haskell and Vera leave the viewer wondering whom to trust, particularly considering Vera's remarks about his appearance, which contradict everything we see in the man. Tom Neal pulls off the part beautifully, playing a character who is convincing and easy with whom to sympathize while still narrating an all but impossible story. Ann Savage as Vera is (in my book) one of the most chilling characters in film history, with her piercing glare and cruel retorts. If nothing else, the car scene in which she wakes during one of Al's voiceovers makes this film worth seeing. Overall, the acting is superb.The dialogue is downright funny in many places in addition to being clever throughout. The score, while more or less dominated by the song I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me, is effective because this song is so fitting to describe the relationship (fantasy?) between Sue and Al. The rest of the music is not particularly memorable but fits the film well. Watch for the use of utterly nonsensical slang that I can only attribute to satire of the genre.To summarize, this film takes what it has and goes far with it. The 68 minute running time is perfect, without dragging the thing out as many films (even good ones) do today. The fact that this film is almost sixty years old and still funny and engaging makes it a fairly timeless masterpiece in my opinion. 8\/10 in its own right, bumped up to 9\/10 by the incredible small budget, short shooting time (6 DAYS!), and otherwise undistinguished actors.

Nearly everyone has one movie or story that moves them deeply and really means something to them and holds tight onto their heartstrings throughout their life. For me, this movie is The Dark Crystal. I can't remember a time when I did not know about The Dark Crystal, as I was a toddler when I first saw it. I cannot remember the first time I saw the movie, but it has always resonated inside of me as one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen in a movie, book or otherwise. Even at the young ages of 3 and 4 I adored this movie, in spite of things which might be considered too frightening for a toddler this movie always held me completely entranced. Unlike the majority of fantasy films created which borrow substance from ancient mythology, or great writers like Tolkein, The Dark Crystal alone created an entirely new world of fantasy for the movie to take place in. This is a fantasy film with no dragons, elves, dwarves, goblins or unicorns. Instead we have unique creations like the gelflings, skeksis, mystics, garthim and podlings. Ridiculously underrated, and underappreciated, this movie was a result of the amazing partnership of artist Brian Froud and the late Jim Henson. Henson created the story, and Froud brought the world to life. The story is your classic fight between good-verses-evil, with a slight twist. However the thing about The Dark Crystal that makes the story so powerful, is the amazing artistry behind it all and the complete immersive quality of the world it takes place in. The Dark Crystal, is a powerful magical device that the wise Urskeks use to make their world beautiful and perfect. A thousand years ago the crystal was cracked, and the Urskeks were split, turned into two separate races. The Mystics who are wise and gentle, and the Skeksis who are cruel and ambitious. It was prophesized that the crystal would be healed by the hand of a Gelfling, a race of peaceful elfin-creatures. And so the Skeksis decided to rid the world of Gelflings and engage in a genocidal hunt to murder them all. However, two gelfling survive, the hero Jen who is raised by the Mystics, and the heroine Kyra who is saved by the Pod People. Jen is told by his dying master that he must find the missing shard of the Dark Crystal and unite it with the whole crystal so that the world can be peaceful once more. Along the way, Jen meets Kyra who accompanies him on his quest to heal the Dark Crystal. Without a drop of CGI, Henson and Froud managed to create a new world entirely out of puppets, paintings and animatronics. The amount of work that was put into this movie is staggering. From the smallest rodent seen scurrying quickly through a scene, to the gorgeous grotesqueness of the skeksis, every creation in this movie is beautiful. You are never distracted by thinking, Oh look at those puppets, simply because the environment is so complete and convincing. There is nothing puppety about this movie.

Nearly everyone has one movie or story that moves them deeply and really means something to them and holds tight onto their heartstrings throughout their life. For me, this movie is The Dark Crystal. I can't remember a time when I did not know about The Dark Crystal, as I was a toddler when I first saw it. I cannot remember the first time I saw the movie, but it has always resonated inside of me as one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen in a movie, book or otherwise. Even at the young ages of 3 and 4 I adored this movie, in spite of things which might be considered too frightening for a toddler this movie always held me completely entranced. Unlike the majority of fantasy films created which borrow substance from ancient mythology, or great writers like Tolkein, The Dark Crystal alone created an entirely new world of fantasy for the movie to take place in. This is a fantasy film with no dragons, elves, dwarves, goblins or unicorns. Instead we have unique creations like the gelflings, skeksis, mystics, garthim and podlings. Ridiculously underrated, and underappreciated, this movie was a result of the amazing partnership of artist Brian Froud and the late Jim Henson. Henson created the story, and Froud brought the world to life. The story is your classic fight between good-verses-evil, with a slight twist. However the thing about The Dark Crystal that makes the story so powerful, is the amazing artistry behind it all and the complete immersive quality of the world it takes place in. The Dark Crystal, is a powerful magical device that the wise Urskeks use to make their world beautiful and perfect. A thousand years ago the crystal was cracked, and the Urskeks were split, turned into two separate races. The Mystics who are wise and gentle, and the Skeksis who are cruel and ambitious. It was prophesized that the crystal would be healed by the hand of a Gelfling, a race of peaceful elfin-creatures. And so the Skeksis decided to rid the world of Gelflings and engage in a genocidal hunt to murder them all. However, two gelfling survive, the hero Jen who is raised by the Mystics, and the heroine Kyra who is saved by the Pod People. Jen is told by his dying master that he must find the missing shard of the Dark Crystal and unite it with the whole crystal so that the world can be peaceful once more. Along the way, Jen meets Kyra who accompanies him on his quest to heal the Dark Crystal. Without a drop of CGI, Henson and Froud managed to create a new world entirely out of puppets, paintings and animatronics. The amount of work that was put into this movie is staggering. From the smallest rodent seen scurrying quickly through a scene, to the gorgeous grotesqueness of the skeksis, every creation in this movie is beautiful. You are never distracted by thinking, Oh look at those puppets, simply because the environment is so complete and convincing. There is nothing puppety about this movie.

This film seems to have been one of those polarizing movies that are either loved or hated. What I truly find interesting is that the lovers and the haters of WE WERE SOLDIERS tend to aim their praise or criticisms not at the movie or its execution so much as its perceived message. The irony is that the perceived message depends almost solely on the preconceived ideas one has about war in general, violence and Vietnam. If the ability to convey myriad interpretations to different viewers and elicit discussion are qualities of a good movie, then this may be a good movie. Additionally, I find it amazing that 30 years after the US left Vietnam, it still causes rancorous debate. As for the movie itself, I readily acknowledge that this won't be everyone's cup of tea. The veterans are just too craggy and serious, while the young soldiers are entirely too handsome and fresh-faced. This does not prevent the actual battle scenes, once we get to them, from being powerful. They are well executed and do not lack carnage and chaos. Plus, WE WERE SOLDIERS adds some elements that most war movies tend to forget; namely, wives, enemies and reality. WE WERE SOLDIERS, for better or worse, includes the wives left behind, the enemy on the other side and a sense that these guys were real men. Though some will argue, and maybe rightly, that this attempt at presenting the real story is manipulative in its own way, I couldn't help but be manipulated. It's a true story (well, Hollywood true) about real people. You can see their names on the Vietnam memorial in DC. That little grain of truth is what makes it so difficult to look at WE WERE SOLDIERS as a regular war movie. It is also what sets it apart.

Well I didn't really expect Elfman to surpass his Batmen theme, but the music in Spidey is hardly ever noticeable and besides sounding very similar to much of his previous work, lacks in atmosphere and should have been much more powerful and striking. One of Elfman's worst.THE BIRTH OF A SUPER HERO They wanted to show how Spidey came to be and I have no real complaints except for not making the most of it. The most enjoyable part of this movie for me was the part where Peter Parker is discovering his super powers. This movie was intended as the first of many so why didn't they take some more time to explore his newly given strenghts as they sure won't be able to do so later.THE VILLAIN Oh please, anybody can wear a mask, if they decided to go for the cheap, move-free mask they could have at least made it cooler looking. Dafoe didn't do it for me, he seemed to weak and sympathetic-looking to be a worthy, let alone dangerous opponent. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS They sucked in the trailers, they sucked in the movie. Some unnecessary scenes like the one where Parker is jumping from rooftop to rooftop are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. There are some nice moments in the movie, no doubt, but even Superman(1978) , and notice the year of release made me want to fly. Spiderman made me want to kick the s..t from all those special effects artist because they did such a low standard job.THE ACTION To be honest I don't really remember any good action parts since they were all ruined by the special effects. Mediocre at best.THE FEMALES I don't find Kirsten Dunst to be very attractive, but she did an OK job. But I liked the kissing scene. Aunt May doesn't look like she's going to make it to the sequel.THE REST OF THE CAST J.K.

Oh well, we're stuck with him for some time.I guess I didn't really compare Spidey with Batman, but all those enthusiastic Spidey fans would probably be furious if I did because it would be tough to spot a positive quality.ANYWAYS, THE FINAL VERDICT Although possessing some nice moments(all in the first half of the movie, where Parker is exploring himself) the movie lacks a solid (PG-13 free) script(and none of those We'll met again, Spiderman or You're out Goblin, out of your mind. It's just not necessary!!!). I liked Raimi's Darkman much better, with all those cheesy effects and everything, because it had heart.

I don't think the director realized he was being serious.2)Damodar - slowest villian in history?  All together now!  I... will... KILL... you... ... ... slooowwwwlllyyyy...  By the time he says one line, everyone has time to flee.2a)and make sure to mock his blue lipstick mercilessly.3)Jeremy Irons delivering the best manically-over-the-top villian performance ever.  I don't think there's an adjective to adequately describe his style here. (Wagnerian is far too subtle and restrained)3a)And notice his eyebrows.  How did he do that?  It's like his forehead put on a completely separate, but equally rediculous, performance.4)Anything with Richard O'Brien is cool and funny.  He appears fully aware how rediculous the movie is and milks it for all he can.4a)Look at Marina's face when he gropes her.  That was NOT reheared. 5)And finally, observe a moment of silence for poor Tom (Dr Who) Baker, who actually attempts (and nearly succeeds) in bringing a moment of quiet dignity to a film that has, and indeed deserves, none.

But never in all my life have I seen something this disgusting. Forrest Gump actually made a better movie than book, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange was done very well, even the Harry Potter adaptations are entertaining.But this...this is the biggest insult to an author I have ever seen.  And this author happens to be Robert Penn Warren, who not only was a big-time Southern regionalist writer, and did not only win the Pulitzer prize for this novel and two others, and was not only our country's first poet laureate, but wrote a novel with such a great impact on American politics and literature that modern authors are still trying to repeat it (remeber Primary Colors?)Not only does this movie completely stray from more or less ALL of the novel's contents\/plot\/character developments, etc., but the movie, set in the South--a very important detail when considering what Warren was trying to achieve--does not contain a single actor even TRYING TO FAKE a southern accent, it's horribly miscast, and the dialogue is re-written to make the characters seem vapid and stupid.  The pacing is entirely wrong.  Key parts of the book are completely neglected in the movie, along with crucial characters.  Things are re-written so much that the movie seems to be either what its writer (Rossen) wished the novel was or him just taking the characters and manipulating them as he pleased.  Both the writing and the directing are incredibly sloppy.Folks, do yourselves a favor and read the book.  Because I can't see anyone enjoying both, and I'm having a harder time seeing how anyone could enjoy this movie.

Most of us will never understand Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle or the mathematics that quantifies it. Film, however, is a mass medium whose conventions are recognizable to almost everybody. Within that framework, we see a huge democratization of genius in Alien, Ridley Scott's blockrocker which is my favorite film.Why? Watching Alien is slightly unsettling because every element of the film is so strong and mutually reinforcing that an appreciative viewer can no longer isolate the individual strengths and determine why the film is so good. First mention, however, undoubtedly belongs to the alien that makes it aboard the ship, due to the astonishing depth of character that went into it. On a visceral level, mature audiences can appreciate the kinetic beauty and unflinching violence of the alien. It has enough anthropomorphic features, however, to suggest some relevance to humans. From the beginning, whereby the larvae attaches itself to Kane's face and incubates the fetal alien, a metaphor for pregnancy and human beings is established.I believe it can be taken one further. In the seventies, science advanced its understanding of evolutionary mutation, and a seminal book was published by Richard Dawkins, called The Selfish Gene. To my mind that book reversed our concept of life by determining genes to be the active player in our destinies. Genes dangle organisms by puppet strings and ensure species develop the attributes necessary for reproduction (survival). So what does the larvae do once attached to Kane's face? It breathes for him, ensuring his survival until such time as incubation is complete. The alien that results is hideous, unrelentingly brutal. Necessarily so, it must consume at a voracious rate to survive. Through the established metaphors, this is also a comment on the attributes humans must evolve in order to be candidates for reproduction.However, the alien is not the only staggering accomplishment in this film. The set design on the alien ship is outstanding, the blurred distinction between alien biomass and ship architecture is brilliant. The reactive mist that overlies the larva eggs, serving as a warning beacon send my jaw dropping to the floor.  Scott, with writers O'Bannon, Shusett and alien designer Giger made genuine advances into a foreign psychology. The human ship provides a comforting milieu of huge, utilitarian space for sci-fi aficionadoes, as well as a highly considered treatment of space.Finally I'd like to say something about the acting. I've read that it was improvised to a certain extent, which contributes greatly to the film's realism by providing convincing dialogue. In addition, Science Officer Ash's final monologue is so cold and dehumanizing as to remain completely peerless in cinema.This film is most of the reason cinema withholds great power as art and all of the reason I became a writer. Well, maybe not quite, but it dramatically changed my ideas about the nature of human existence and will always remain in my imagination for immediate playback.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers.There are two forms of genius the first kind is delivered in a medium that caters to an elite community, physics for example.
