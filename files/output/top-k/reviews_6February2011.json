This is a baseball game woven into a love story, but it is a baseball movie nonetheless . . . and by that measure it stands on its own as the best of all time -- without the supernatural elements of Field of Dreams and the aspects of The Natural that push the limits of credulity.The 8th inning scene -- from start to finish -- is one of the best you'll see in any movie. As the lights flicker on at Yankee Stadium, the camera shows the setting sun off in the distance over the left-field upper deck, then pans back to a wider angle that includes a view into Yankee Stadium from beyond right-centerfield. This is one of those elements of this movie that keeps the viewer focused on a real baseball game in a real place, being played in the midst of all the parallel story lines of the movie. This scene was probably filmed from the Bronx County Courthouse, a building whose upper floors peek into Yankee Stadium from a few blocks east on 161st Street (this building can be seen occasionally during the movie looming beyond the Diamond Vision screen and the giant Budweiser advertisement in right-centerfield).The scene is beautiful on its own, but the symbolism brings a whole other dimension to it. The skyline in the background in front of the setting sun is in northern Manhattan across the Harlem River. Even many die-hard baseball fans may not know that the group of similar-looking brick buildings closest to the stadium across the river are the tenements that were built on the former site of the old Polo Grounds where the New York Giants baseball team had played before moving to San Francisco in 1958. The metaphors in this short scene may have been unintended, but they're amazing to me . . . the sun setting on a glorious fall day, on the late innings of a historic baseball game, and on the career of a great pitcher whose personal life is facing a wrecking ball just like those old Polo Grounds. Time moves on and changes all, and among all of the characters in this movie only the sun and the great game of baseball will endure.By the third time I had seen the movie, I decided that the portion of the 8th inning from the 3-1 count on Davis Birch through the last out of the inning was one of the most remarkable segments of any movie I've ever seen. The climactic at-bat of Davis Birch, the majestic musical scores, the heroic efforts of hard-luck rightfielder Mickey Hart, and Jane Aubrey's decisive moment of truth in JFK International Airport are all woven together perfectly over several minutes. Vin Scully's play-by-play during this scene came across as background noise of sorts the first time I saw the movie, but after listening closely I realized that he would be a major character in this movie even if his face were never seen. The timing of his play-by-play and the content of his broadcast at the moment of Jane Aubrey's decision in the airport -- and their influence on her decision -- were subtle and brilliant.The work of director Sam Raimi and the rest of the crew may be overlooked by many viewers, but what should come across as the defining characteristic of the movie is that it is filmed as a REAL game, with so many elements that are easily taken for granted in an age of high-tech filmmaking. The interspersing of live baseball scenes with the more grainy TV and Diamond Vision views gave these scenes an aura of credibility that is missing from most sports-themed movies, and characters like Vin Scully, legendary Yankee Stadium announcer Bob Sheppard, the obnoxious but somehow likable Yankee fans, and even Yankee Stadium itself, all played key roles in this movie.

Many people said that the movie didn't have the same charming way of the life in a small and mysterious town, many people commented that the characters weren't as intense and believable as in the series and some people regretted that some of the series's characters like Audrey Horne or Harry Truman didn't appear in this movie and that some other main characters like Dale Cooper only had small roles.But I think that those people didn't understand the intention of this movie. It is sure that a movie of two hours and fifteen minutes can't develop the characters as much as a series with almost thirty episodes. It is also sure that this movie is about the last days of Laura Palmer and that's why characters like Audrey Horne have not much to do with this movie as they had no closer connection to the main character. This movie has a faster development than its series, it is straight forward and maybe less mysterious.But this movie is intense in every sense of the word. It is frightening, has a very dark and desperate atmosphere, it is horrifying and it is brilliantly played by Sheryl Lee and we get a true insight of the character of Laura Palmer and her everyday life along side her strange father, her weak mother, her many different friends and especially boyfriends. This movie shows in a very straight and hard way the wasted life of a beauty that has lost its youth and innocence. This movie is about sex, drugs, violence, crime, murder and fear and how to get drowned in a circle of desperation. The scene were Laura and Donna are in the discotheque is one if the most intense moments ever filmed in cinema's history with its strange music, weird light effects, ugly sex and violence scenes and the feelings that evolve from there. You feel hypnotized and desperate about the characters. The scene where Laura and her father are in their car and surprised by a strange one-armed man is strange, disturbing and extremely weird. The scene where Laura meets the strange Bob in her sleeping room is spooky, haunting and could create nightmares. The scene where Laura finally faces her destiny is brutal, uneasy and pervert. The conclusion and final scene of the movie is the only part where you feel a little bit of piece and hope in a very transcendent and spiritual way.David Lynch plays with your emotions and your wildest dreams and drowns you from one feeling to the other. While watching this movie I was frightened, I was almost crying, I was disturbed, I was delighted and I was absolutely impressed. I never thought that this movie would mess up with the best series in history but this flick is absolutely at the same level even if it is different because of its intensity.But even though this movie is straight and heavy, there are still many mysterious details and typical trademarks of the series from time to time like the weird introduction of the case by Gordon Cole and the dancing lady, things that only a genius could have invented. The weird scene with David Bowie is also one for the ages and extremely cool. There are also many little hints to discover that concern the fate of other characters of the series for example the scene where a bloody Annie sleeps next to Laura and transmits her a strange message.A sure thing is that this movie is no easy stuff and more scaring than any horror movie I have seen in my life. That's why this movie hasn't been a success for the masses and its very particular style is in fact very charismatic and different from anything you might expect. The point of desperation is that you know what will happen if you have seen the series and that you know that the characters are damned or even lost and the frightening about all of this is that you know that there is no escape and that you don't exactly know how or when it might happen. I really felt with the characters in this movie and this is something that has been developed in the series over several episodes but in this movie, I had the same feeling only after a couple of minutes. I have never seen or felt something as intense and strong concerning a movie in my whole life.I always thought that David Lynch's masterpiece concerning a movie is Lost highway but after watching this flick I am no longer sure about it. This is a masterpiece, a mysterious, weird, scaring horror movie with some dramatic elements. This movie doesn't need much blood or gore effects to frighten you, it's all about the atmosphere. This movie is so intense that you simply don't have the time to miss Audrey Horne and all the others that I have liked so much throughout the series. That is something brilliant and unexpected that only David Lynch could create and it's a shame but as well typical for the mainstream masses that they didn't accept this style at the time and that there haven't been any more movies about Twin Peaks. At least, the legacy found its end on an absolute climax.I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies and has a little sense of genius and is open-minded enough to accept the flick's very unique style. It is probably my favourite movie of all times or comes at least quite close to it.

Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for hidden meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see &#x96; Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife &#x96; are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that something is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the chronics in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene &#x96; for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent &#x96; a fact that should not be overlooked &#x96; but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.

The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that something is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the chronics in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene &#x96; for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent &#x96; a fact that should not be overlooked &#x96; but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.

Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for hidden meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid.

This is not a review as such but just some commentary. The first is that I haven't thought about the fact that there are reviews here from people who were not even born when this movie was made. Never thought about that. Hmmm, I was a grown up 21 when it came out. Since I was born and raised in Brooklyn and NYC and lived here my whole life, I had always felt that this was my movie. Woody was considered, in my era and age group, an alien being in the land of Hollywood. He WAS one of us. I felt threatened that he made a real movie when AH was released. I had always considered him an underground NY guy, so, no one was gonna take him away from us. This is the reason I felt threatened. My only consolation was that now the rest of the world would finally see what an amazingly gifted artist we had here. OK, enough. You get the point. Now on to other goodies. First and foremost, Tony Roberts. I love this guy. That they (Woody & Tony) called each other Max thruout the movie was to me, an inside joke because best friends usually did this. In my case, my best friend Frank and me (rob) called each other Dukey. Always! Still do 55 years later. TR is such a natural, gifted actor that it was not acting he did, it was living! His oneness with his characters were incredible. Never for one minute did I see any of the actors here acting! That is how great Woody Allen is. He brings it out of his actors. Their characters are living human beings! Diane Keaton nailed it. Not only her beauty, for which she is one of the prettiest, sexiest and most gorgeous creatures ever seen on screen, look at her today, hasn't lost a drop! This trio - WA, DK and TR, who worked together in Play It Again Sam, could have been a rock group they are so great!!

Charlie Chaplin manages to expose the contrast in our lives between rich and poor and between dreams and reality. The first point has been delivered in the first seen, when group of politicians were celebrating a monument that has been built by donated money. Charlie Chaplin (a homeless man) was sleeping under the cover of the statue. This seen highlighted the contrast between money spent for cosmetic projects that does not add any value to eliminate hanger and improve the life of the neediest parts of the community. The message is that we are spending money and willing to provide funding for project that at most just cosmetic, and ignore funding to fight hunger, homelessness and curable diseases in our own backyard in the US. We see the same today, almost seventy years after the movie. The willingness to spend many billions on wars, supporting dictators, stadiums, art, and music, on the other hand, the community organized huge resistance to provide health care service for every American. The movie continued to highlight the wide gap between the rich and the poor in our community. The movie showed how a $10 can buy whole day worth of work for the blind girl and send her home for the day. The rich mane has many of those bills in his pocket as pocket cash. The same point is emphasized when the drunk rich man wanted to help and offered a $1000 to help. This amount of money was part of the pocket cash again. The movie proceed to show that portion of the rich man pocket cash was able to keep the blind lady and her old grandmother at their rented home, and cure her vision in addition to opening her own flower shop. The idea of just a portion of a pocket cash of someone can make this huge impact on someone else life is sad reality. It applies to all of us today, the few dollars we spend every day on coffee, cigarettes, and other unessential expenses can make huge difference in someone else life, in this country and in other countries. The culture of spending money we don't have to buy things we will never use is a very well established culture, proved by a simple trip to the nearest Costco or mall. The rich man drives a Rolls Royce (that he was willing to give it as gift in exchange for few happy moments with his friend Charlie Chaplin) and he has several servants at his home. The movie succeeded in denying the association between money and happiness. The rich man was not happy and was trying to end his own life; however, unintentionally he was able to introduce major happiness to others. The fact that he was drunk when he offered the money is an indicator that people are good when they are at their simplest form, and turn to monsters when they are back to their complicated personality.At many points, the movie highlighted the harsh reality of the tough job market. The humiliation of cleaning after horses and elephants and the job as a boxer to make money were stretched to make the message louder. My personal believe is that money and wealth belong to god, wealthy people are just in control of the wealth in behalf of god and spending money is regulated on the basis of helping the bigger benefit of the community. Over spending is discouraged and greed is discouraged. The spending is to be balanced between the extremes. God like to see the signs of his gifts on his creations. The movie did not touch directly on the social justice and the lack of it; however, it highlighted the dark side of capitalism, homelessness, eviction, medical coverage, and low end jobs brutality. The movie triggered thoughts in many directions due the lack of the sound conversation. This may lead to stretch of what really the movie is trying to say and deliver to the viewers. It opened the door for multiple interpretations for the same seen based on one's background and believes. In conclusion, the movie is intellectual and it is everything but just a popcorn movie.The movie successfully delivered the message that capitalism comes with heavy price. The dark side of capitalism can be minimized by having social justice and implementing social services to benefit the least fortunate among us and the sick.Advance social services do not contradict with capitalism as far as I understood capitalism. Advanced social services may hurt certain business like insurance companies and other business that makes money from the misery of people. The contradiction is how such a religious country like the US denies social services and support for the poor and the sick. It seems to me that money rules, and money map our lives much more than out believes. I always support my claim with our consistent attempts to cash in our ethics like legalizing gambling and certain types of drugs. Some communities went further and legalized prostitution. As I am living in this free country, I am always amazed how major issues are not negotiable and taken granted forever as in the availability and abuse of alcohol and right to have sex without restrictions. We choose to deal with the end effect of alcohol but never question its availability and accessibility equally to under-aged and mature abusers. The same applies to our solution to the teen pregnancy where the best we did is making condoms available.This movie was one of the intellectual movies that managed to deliver a clear message by highlighting contradictions in our daily live.

At the beginning of the movie when they all arrive at school they just figure it was going to be a day of sitting there doing nothing; until principal Vernon told them that they need to write an essay about who they are. As the movie start you hear Brains voice giving a brief description of who they are. The theme of the movie is that no matter who you are and what kind of back ground you comes form we all have differences. Bender is always pushing the bottoms of the other to get things out of them on who there are. This brings them all together and they have became friends. The director made his point with different camera angle he would use close up in scene when a point was being made and how the music was tied in is the right point in the movie. The Breakfast Club is a movie that will always be watched. The pressure of being a teen ager will never change. They have become more then when the movie was filmed in 1985. Those pressures of using drugs having sex being forced by your parents to get all A's will never change. Just have to learn how to cope with them and not to judge people until you get to know them and you never know that you might have more then you know in common with that person.

No copy, including the (still unseen by me prequel) can touch it or move me like this movie does. And even the by-a-mile foreseen finale lifts me each time. Yeah, even with what some (not me) would consider the corny line to get Baby onto the stage and away from the judgmental father, Jake (Jerry Orbach.)Setting the movie back in the 1960s was clever. For one, it was a good way to make this movie timeless to avoid the typical 80s haircuts, outfits and attitudes.

Aside from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and the more recent Dancing with the Stars, you can only really enjoy Jennifer Grey here. Her acting was spot on. Her subtle glances have me rolling, but deeper, they're very true to her character. It's what a lot of us go through.And too bad for two of the leads who are no longer with us. The extremely kind-hearted Patrick Swayze was very good for his roll, not to mention danced awesome (with a little help from the equally impressive Cynthia Rhodes.) Also, Jerry Orbach was perfect for what he needed to be as Baby's daddy.While the rest of the cast was great for comic relief or additional (and superb) dancing, the cinematography was wonderful, the editing great and as already mentioned it had one of my favorite soundtracks. One song in particular &#x96; She's Like the Wind was sung (and (co-)written!) professionally and beautifully by none other than Mr. Swayze, himself.

In the film Jeffery Lebowski, or The Dude, as he is more commonly known (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy man who enjoys bowling, smoking weed, drinking white Russians, and listening to classic rock (especially Creedence Clearwater Revival). His life does not seem to extend beyond these simple pleasures, nor does The Dude seem interested in branching out. The Dude abides, as he says in self reference. This all changes when a couple of thugs try to shake him down for money owed by another man named Jeffery Lebowski, and one of them urinates on The Dude's rug. The Dude is convinced by his friend Walter, played by John Goodman, to go to the rich Jeffery Lebowski and ask him to replace the rug. Thus begins The Dude's story, which involves a ransom kidnapping, mystery, double-crosses, sex, and severed digits.The theme of The Big Lebowski is difficult to define at first, but perhaps it is best summed up by the Stranger, played by quintessential cowboy Sam Elliot, who says, Sometimes there's a man who, well, he's the man for his time and place... that's the Dude in Los Angeles. That being said, the entire film seems to be an elaboration on this statement. Although the Dude is a painfully ordinary man, he finds himself in an extraordinary situation, and the audience is given the opportunity to see how he handles himself. Every character in the film is ordinary, however. As the story progresses, the power players, the criminal masterminds, and the femme fatal are all exposed to be just ordinary people lashing out in various ways as they do what they think they have to in order to survive. Through their collective actions, however, and extraordinary situation is created. This statement on human nature and especially the social implications of Los Angeles culture during the early 90's is both fascinating and hilarious. This integration of normal people and strange circumstances are characteristic of Coen brother screenplays, and although not as dry as Fargo, there are definite similarities in theme. The main difference in The Big Lebowski is that each of the characters seem to see themselves as some romanticized Hollywood character, each is the hero in their story. The one exception to this being the Dude, who is just happy to be himself, but gets caught in everyone else's stories.The theme is enhanced by the natural lighting techniques employed throughout the film. The bowling alley scenes are all awash in harsh fluorescent lighting, every detail and flaw of the middle-aged and mostly out of shape characters is bared for the cameras. In fact, most of the locations in the film appear to use the natural lighting, with only minor enhancements if necessary. These are all ordinary places, full of ordinary people. Along these same lines, the music for the film is wonderful. T-Bone Burnett, the musical archivist for the film chose an eclectic mix of music from Bob Dillon to Captain Beefheart, Nina Simone to Piero Piccioni, with surprises such as the Gypsy Kings covering Hotel California, and even some breathy, erotic chanting. The soundtrack is where the egos of these ordinary people can flourish, and the song for every scene is perfect considering the character of the chief protagonist\/antagonist. The music allows the audience to see what each character hopes that they are projecting, despite their extremely human behavior. If this point was not obvious enough, the Nihilists (including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea) actually carry a boom-box blasting German techno when they attack the Dude and his friends. The are just ordinary people, in an extraordinary situation, acting in very human ways while projecting Hollywood egos.Kudos goes to the Coen brothers and a fantastic cast for this incredible film.

The main difference in The Big Lebowski is that each of the characters seem to see themselves as some romanticized Hollywood character, each is the hero in their story. The one exception to this being the Dude, who is just happy to be himself, but gets caught in everyone else's stories.The theme is enhanced by the natural lighting techniques employed throughout the film. The bowling alley scenes are all awash in harsh fluorescent lighting, every detail and flaw of the middle-aged and mostly out of shape characters is bared for the cameras. In fact, most of the locations in the film appear to use the natural lighting, with only minor enhancements if necessary. These are all ordinary places, full of ordinary people. Along these same lines, the music for the film is wonderful. T-Bone Burnett, the musical archivist for the film chose an eclectic mix of music from Bob Dillon to Captain Beefheart, Nina Simone to Piero Piccioni, with surprises such as the Gypsy Kings covering Hotel California, and even some breathy, erotic chanting. The soundtrack is where the egos of these ordinary people can flourish, and the song for every scene is perfect considering the character of the chief protagonist\/antagonist. The music allows the audience to see what each character hopes that they are projecting, despite their extremely human behavior.

In the film Jeffery Lebowski, or The Dude, as he is more commonly known (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy man who enjoys bowling, smoking weed, drinking white Russians, and listening to classic rock (especially Creedence Clearwater Revival). His life does not seem to extend beyond these simple pleasures, nor does The Dude seem interested in branching out. The Dude abides, as he says in self reference. This all changes when a couple of thugs try to shake him down for money owed by another man named Jeffery Lebowski, and one of them urinates on The Dude's rug. The Dude is convinced by his friend Walter, played by John Goodman, to go to the rich Jeffery Lebowski and ask him to replace the rug. Thus begins The Dude's story, which involves a ransom kidnapping, mystery, double-crosses, sex, and severed digits.The theme of The Big Lebowski is difficult to define at first, but perhaps it is best summed up by the Stranger, played by quintessential cowboy Sam Elliot, who says, Sometimes there's a man who, well, he's the man for his time and place... that's the Dude in Los Angeles. That being said, the entire film seems to be an elaboration on this statement. Although the Dude is a painfully ordinary man, he finds himself in an extraordinary situation, and the audience is given the opportunity to see how he handles himself. Every character in the film is ordinary, however. As the story progresses, the power players, the criminal masterminds, and the femme fatal are all exposed to be just ordinary people lashing out in various ways as they do what they think they have to in order to survive. Through their collective actions, however, and extraordinary situation is created.

John Travolta (Vincent Vega), Samuel Jackson (Jules), Bruce Willis (Butch), and Uma Thurman (Mrs. Mia Wallace) are the four main characters in this movie. All their lives are somehow entwined with one another and are affected by decisions they make, by themselves or one of the other characters. This movie is different from other movies because it contains mini-movies rather than one movie as a whole.Each mini-movie contains its' own plot that centers on the theme of the movie. It helps explain how the characters know each other and how the events that happen in their lives mix with the other characters lives. The first story revolves around a couple low-life robbers', the second is two hit men's lives, and finally a boxers life. All the stories are broken up and in random order, which was part of the movie's unique characteristic.Vincent and Jules are two hit men in search of their boss' briefcase. In the course of their travels they interact superbly with one another. Samuel Jackson, who plays Jules, does a wonderful job of getting into character. Bruce Willis plays a character named Butch who is an aging boxer wanting to make a comeback. Butch is the type of character that you root for in a movie. He is down to earth, funny, and the audience can relate to him. In a way, we watch him grow from childhood to adulthood.The writer\/director Quentin Tarantino, first made his debut with the film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. Reservoir Dogs showcased Quentin's movie making magic, which also is showcased in Pulp Fiction. According to www.IMDb.com he has written 18 scripts for television\/movies and directed 15 titles (retrieved from www.IMDb.com on February 5, 2010).There are two scenes that standout in my mind. First I must notify the reader that this might be a spoiler if you haven't seen the movie. The first scene is when Vincent is buying drugs from his dealer. The scene goes from two people having a conversation to a close-up shot of a needle being stuck into a vein in the arm. The background is completely black and we see the needle puncture the vein, draw up blood, and then watch the blood swim in the barrel of the needle. The second scene that sticks out in my mind is when Jules and Vincent are riding in the car talking with Marvin. This is another potential spoiler alert. The scene goes from all three characters discussing divine intervention when suddenly Vincent's gun goes off. The camera starts out in the car, moving from character to character. Right after the gun goes off, the camera angle is outside the car, from behind looking in. The rear window is covered in blood and then the camera moves back into the car showing the effects of what happened. Jules and Vincent are covered in blood, brain tissue, and pieces of skull.In conclusion, the movie Pulp Fiction shows how the choices that we make affect our lives. If one analyzes the movie, looks closely at each character, and what they go through in the movie we begin to understand about choices, actions, and consequences. Quentin Tarantino and the superb acting from the cast of the movie make it a must watch.

The reason why the couple goes off to sea on the boat, to forget the past and relax? What the hell, is a son's death the only reason why a married couple would go for a boat trip on the ocean, and without it would there be no way to develop such a story? Let's go on basically, everything goes unexplained. Who is the bad guy? What happened on his boat? What does he want from the couple? We don't know, we can only guess, no explanation is given. From the very moment he steps on the boat, the couple seems to throw their brains into the deep blue sea, and not one single logical action takes place from their side.Man goes off to sea with a small boat to climb into a sinking ship, wife gets kidnapped and their boat taken away. Of course. The guy struggles with death on the sinking ship with the expressiveness and the emotional communication of a grouper fish swimming in its sea spot in its everyday boring grouper fish life, the bad guy keeps stalking the woman, rapes her (and she doesn't even seem to dislike it that much), tries to kill her, with her knowing that there is a goddamn rifle lying in a drawer, which she never thinks about taking to defend herself. When she finally manages to, she just falls into the bad guy's arms handing the rifle to him. She throws the boat key into the sea and her stupid dog fetches it back. Finally she seems to prevail over the bad guy, leaves him off to sea on an inflatable boat, rejoins with her husband, and you can just see them nice and clean talking about what they would like to have for breakfast, like everything - both of them risking their lives, she being raped, their boat being ruined and so on - never happened. But of course, like even my 4-years-old nephew could predict, the bad guy just gets out of nowhere again and attacks her. And here we have the grand finale husband gets signal rocket, points it towards the bad guy's head while he is struggling with his wife behind a goddamn sail, you can only see their silhouettes projected on it, moving frantically, and guess what? He hits the target at first shot, darting the rocket through the sail exactly into the bad guy's mouth, about 30 cm from his wife's head.

They are archetypes what human thought basically is, and of the main human approaches and explanations of what life is. It is mostly an inner and initiation trip. In fact, if we were not given the initial captions about the Zone and the extraterrestrial landing, the movie could not be considered a science-fiction one but an experimental philosophical and spiritual one.Stalker and Solaris -also directed by Tarkovsky- share that magical approach to reality and to inexplicable events. In both cases what brings drama to the story is not what is factually happening, but how the characters see reality and the world, and how they project in them their inner fears, thoughts and feelings. In that regard, reality is just a personal projection, something that only exists when perceived in a certain way.The dialogs are brilliant, very philosophical and deep, and they reflect on the nature of science, literature, reality, beliefs and the unknown. They can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are worth the effort of paying attention to them. The silences are also mesmerizing and as relevant to the story as the dialogs, as well as the landscape and interiors where the action happens.Visually speaking, the movie is magnificent. It has that Tartovsky's almost metaphysical approach to Nature and to the woods, which are here presented both as beautifully welcoming and threatening evil. A Jeckil & Hyde of a landscape. The abandoned plant where the movie was shot, and the cinematography of it, provide the viewer with unforgettable surreal alien images. Some of the oniric scenes of the film are also extremely poetic and philosophical. The atmosphere, with changes between full color and sepia tones, the latter associated to a gritty reality deprived of hope and joy, are just masterpieces in themselves, with a masterful use of chiaroscuro, camera angling, and a great detail to decor and ambiance.The opening of the movie is unforgettable. Magnetic in away. The framing, the tones, the placement of the elements, the chiaroscuro, everything is artistic and almost pictorial. A little masterpiece in itself.The cinematography, lighting, use of the camera are superb in the whole movie, and the lush greens of the woods and the eeriness of the abandoned plant are turned into a magic powerful and disturbing world.The acting is terrific by all actors, but especially by Alexander Kaidanovsky as the Stalker, and Alisa Freindlich as his wife. However, the performances of Anatoli Solonitsyn (the Writer) and Nikolai Grinko (the Professor) must be praised, too.Stalker is a movie like no other. A slow-paced trip to the inner soul of their characters as much as an exploration of a forbidden and alien Eden without God. It is also a journey for the viewer, so be prepared and in the right mood before you seat in front of your TV.

They are archetypes what human thought basically is, and of the main human approaches and explanations of what life is. It is mostly an inner and initiation trip. In fact, if we were not given the initial captions about the Zone and the extraterrestrial landing, the movie could not be considered a science-fiction one but an experimental philosophical and spiritual one.Stalker and Solaris -also directed by Tarkovsky- share that magical approach to reality and to inexplicable events. In both cases what brings drama to the story is not what is factually happening, but how the characters see reality and the world, and how they project in them their inner fears, thoughts and feelings. In that regard, reality is just a personal projection, something that only exists when perceived in a certain way.The dialogs are brilliant, very philosophical and deep, and they reflect on the nature of science, literature, reality, beliefs and the unknown. They can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are worth the effort of paying attention to them. The silences are also mesmerizing and as relevant to the story as the dialogs, as well as the landscape and interiors where the action happens.Visually speaking, the movie is magnificent. It has that Tartovsky's almost metaphysical approach to Nature and to the woods, which are here presented both as beautifully welcoming and threatening evil. A Jeckil & Hyde of a landscape. The abandoned plant where the movie was shot, and the cinematography of it, provide the viewer with unforgettable surreal alien images. Some of the oniric scenes of the film are also extremely poetic and philosophical. The atmosphere, with changes between full color and sepia tones, the latter associated to a gritty reality deprived of hope and joy, are just masterpieces in themselves, with a masterful use of chiaroscuro, camera angling, and a great detail to decor and ambiance.The opening of the movie is unforgettable.

So it tries a little of both. And succeeds at neither. Its high-flying reputation derives almost entirely from the two lead actors suave William Powell as Nick, a middle-aged detective who gets dragged, reluctantly, into trying to solve a murder, and Myrna Loy, as Nick's wife, Nora, strictly ornamental to the story; but their good chemistry placates audiences.On my first viewing, I gave up trying to figure out how the multitudinous characters relate to each other. And all that nervous dialogue sapped away any suspense. On my second try, the story made more sense. But that talky script was still a drag. Many scenes are irrelevant to the whodunit puzzle. The film's final fifteen minutes do redeem the meandering plot, to a very limited extent, as Nick and Nora throw a dinner party to catch the killer.Attempts at humor transmit mostly through dialogue. Probably the best line comes from Nora. When someone asks her if Nick is working on a case, she responds Yes, a case of scotch. Other efforts at humor trend much weaker. About the only character I cared anything about, and the only one that exudes any genuine humor is Asta, Nick and Nora's little dog.Black & White cinematography contains lots of shadows but they seem more accidental than deliberate attempts to induce sinister visuals. The subtle score is like what you would hear in a Three Stooges movie. And although I don't question the acting abilities of Powell or Loy, the rest of the cast overacts for the most part, sometimes laughably so.If the viewer doesn't care anything about a film's story, but is interested only in the chemistry of two charming actors who interact in witty ways, then this is your film.

Edward Norton gives a phenomenal performance as Derek Vineyard, an influential white supremacist. This is not a role I would imagine for Norton, but he makes the character completely believable. Edward Furlong plays the perfect struggling teen, Danny Vineyard, who is trying to find himself and fit-in at the same time. Derek is sent to prison for murder, while Danny is left behind to follow in Derek's footsteps. Derek learns a great deal about people and stereotypes during his three year incarceration. He eventually wishes a different life for Danny. With the help of one of his former teachers, he realizes that nothing he has done as the leader of his skinhead crew has made his life better. Instead of finding solutions to problems, he had been perpetuating a cycle of violence.This movie gives viewers a detailed look at racism and prejudice in our country. There is great use of flashbacks, shown in black and white, to provide a glimpse of how things came to be the way they are. The opening flashback scene was very powerful, giving an understanding of Derek's pride and his importance to Danny. Narration by Danny is also instrumental in letting the audience have an inside look at the Vineyard family. He looks up to his older brother and has seen some truth in Derek's views.This movie shares some common characteristics with the film Gran Torino. Both movies are led by racists white men who seem to make no exceptions when it comes to their hatred of minority races. It takes the development of a personal relationship with someone of color to make the men reconsider their preconceived notions. Derek comes to befriend his black coworker in prison.

Indeed their roles seem limited to simply serve a purpose in the bigger scheme of things.Rather than specific characters as protagonist or antagonist, Eisenstein uses opposing forces. The opposing forces are the oppressed people versus the oppressive authority. They are groups identified by typage. That is they are simply identified by their appearance and their actions. Officers, soldiers and priests compose the oppressors. Sailors and townspeople compose the oppressed. The story is about the struggle between these two groups. It is a somewhat successful rebellion. One in which innocent lives must be sacrificed to overcome the oppressors.The initial rebellion begins when sailors refuse to eat rotten meat and the officers of the ship refuse to recognize that the meat is rotten. Action on the ship comes to a climax and the sailors overpower the officers with numbers and they successfully take over the ship. Their rebellious act spills over onto the mainland and inspires the people there to come to their aid by delivering food. In doing so the people on the mainland are targeted for execution.Next comes a great scene because it is so emotional.

The legacy of the Batman films BEFORE Nolan is forever tainted by the Neon-stained hopelessly juvenile fantasy world of Joel Schumacher's 'Batman & Robin'...which is very unfortunate indeed, considering that this franchise once had so much potential, having had a very promising start indeed way back in 1989......which brings us to this, Tim Burton's 'Batman', a film which is sadly often overlooked since it is neither considered to be quite as good as Nolan, and certainly not as bad as Schumacher, and given the predilection for audiences and critics to focus on extremes, it often goes unnoticed. Yet, when it first appeared on the silver screen, it was revolutionary in its impact, not as much insofar as it was the first big blockbuster Batman film but instead with regards to its invaluable contribution to the legacy of the character. From the 1950's onwards, the character of Batman was far too freely associated with juvenile camp and silliness (later to be evoked in the aforementioned Schumacher films) and the smash-hit TV show of the 60's didn't help matters in that regard. While it was true that by the 70's, comic book writers like Dennis O'Neil and Steve Englehart had taken steps to return the Caped Crusader to his dark and serious roots, the public perception of the character invariably remained that of a square-jawed crime-buster in a colorful costume punching out villains with suitable sound effects and spouting out corny one-liners...But all of that changed when Tim Burton came on board this film. From the moment Batman emerges from the shadows to terrorize two thugs into submission and Michael Keaton's low raspy voice declares I'm Batman- you realize that this isn't the campy Batman of Adam West fame, but the Batman created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger and later reinvented successfully by Frank Miller in his groundbreaking stories 'The Dark Knight Returns' and 'Batman Year One'. This is a Batman who is an enigma, a mysterious avenger of the night, who strikes terror into the very heart of criminality-a ruthless vigilante who shows no mercy to his enemies and does not hesitate to use lethal force if necessary (something which most modern fans find disquieting but is actually in line with the earliest Kane\/Finger 'Batman' stories). And what of the Joker, Batman's inimitable nemesis? Well, Jack Nicholson may not have been able to capture the sheer anarchic scope of the Joker as an agent of chaos, as presented by Heath Ledger nearly two decades later, but his Joker is certainly no harmless prankster, but a murderous brilliant and twisted psychopath. Grim humor surrounds the Joker like a plague in this movie so much so that a seemingly innocuous jack-in-the- box acquires sinister connotations.Kim Basinger does a pretty good job of Vicky Vale, intrepid photographer and Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne's love interest, while Michael Gough does okay as the 'Batman's batman' Alfred Pennyworth. Somewhat disappointing is Pat Hingle's rendition of Commissioner Gordon, who seems almost a non-entity in this film, a stereotypical respectable authority figure as opposed to being the sharp detective and invaluable ally of the Batman in his war on crime that he is in most other versions, including and especially Gary Oldman's portrayal in the Nolan films.Perhaps this film's most enduring legacy is Danny Elfman's theme, the like of which even the Nolan films have yet to achieve, and which was later immortalized in the award-winning 'Batman The Animated Series'.Regardless of how well this film may be judged when stacked up against the more contemporary Nolan films, it is an indisputable fact that this film is the reason why most people today, whether Batman fans or not, consider Batman a 'Dark Knight' rather than a humorous instance of pop culture!

I was in college in 1984 and I went to see this film with a good friend of mine. It grabbed my attention from the opening credits and would not let me go!I had seen Arnold in a few movies so he was familiar. His performance was perfect. The adorable Linda Hamilton is terrific as the scared mother of the future. The story is creepy because 26 years after it opened the concept of a machine man is believable. When this movie ended I walked out of the theater exhausted. Very few movies have had that effect on me. I have watched this film maybe 30 times and never gotten bored. Highly recommended for viewing.
