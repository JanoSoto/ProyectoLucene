The difference here comes in two important aspects- 1) the director himself, having created this kind of suspenseful, daring, but always with a certain degree of dark hilarity, has to go a little further with this kind of murder mystery, and as the second to last film of his career shows him reaching further into a bag of tricks not even to impress and entertain audiences but only himself. 2) this is the only true Hitchcock thriller to be made in the 1970s (Family Plot, his final film, is more of a direct comedy with light touches), and with the newly imposed R rating the Master finally utilizes well what his rating will allow for him. Indeed, next to Psycho and possibly one other this is one of Hithcock's more 'graphic' types of films. There's a rape, and of course multiple murders, some graphic nudity (tastefully) laced in, and yet never a full-on curse word. I once heard a director (can't remember the name) talk about how a film might seem in a quasi-period setting, and Frenzy recalls at times a more 'proper' London with its host of professional character-actors, but at the same time has to have the feelings and connections to the present time it was filmed. So Frenzy is, really, maybe the closest contemporary example to the Master's primary American-director descendant, Brian De Palma, in how it's very much 'of-the-time', satirical, and with an edge that is hard to match.That it might be short of greatness, or even less than how I saw the film as, will be up to the viewer and how one might see it in relation to other films in the director's catalog. But as a stand-alone work it's got a lot going for it on levels of a realistic grounding combined with lots of bracingly-subtle fun moments that bring out some really big laughs, along with the craftsmanship that heightens the suspenseful style. The whole idea of a neck-tie strangler is pretty amusing and the droll conversations about the killer made in the film add some fine touches to such a crazy, cool technique (that is, until its shown in rather brutal detail). Acting-wise, maybe early on I was a little wary of the character played by Jon Finch, who is down on his luck with money and with a minor temper-streak. I wasn't sure I could take a film entirely headed by Finch, who is good in the role, but is also partially grating as being somewhat out-of-place with his accent not looking his 'ruffian' self. Luckily there are two things that happen through the course of the film- Finch really gets further, and more believably as another 'Wrong Man' for Hitchcock, and there is the villain Robert Rusk played by Barry Foster. It's often commonplace in many of Hitchcock's films (Strangers on a Train being a good example) where the antagonist with his extra daring, danger, and half terrifying half suave demeanor make him more interesting for the audience than the protagonist. Rusk is really perfect for the role, and the first time we see him perform his act it does come as a great shock following a rape. What might be my favorite scene with him, if not in the whole movie, is when he's stuck between a potato sack and a hard place, so to speak, as he removes a piece of evidence from the literal grasp of one of his victims on a moving truck. This is a spectacular, apt take on the true absurdity that Hitchcock knows he's dealing with here, as it's the only way to deal with such horrific material in a good way. All this noted, it doesn't quite reach a mark of being an outright treasure of film like Vertigo of Psycho, as the aspirations are not really for anything very deep or amazing to ponder &\/or unforgettable sequences ala shower-scenes. And once or twice the line of the story, always as much of importance for Hitch as the movement of the camera, dips into little scenes that might not be needed (plus the ending all happens a little 'quick' in some ways). This being said, when Hitchcock does get the camera moving, or staying in one position, the notably standard scenes with the camera placed without much going on get into context with the bolder ones. I loved the backwards tracking shot out of the building during a murder scene, or the pause that is held in the alleyway (arrows included to where the next bystanders will come along) awaiting the reaction to another murder. Is it self-conscious of the audience, sure, but to hell if it doesn't all work. Frenzy is, with the other points I've mentioned, also a logical extension from the great, equally underrated work the Wrong Man, only this time there's more to take in with how far the director will take the similar material, like a risky stand-up comedian, and if it will stick. It does, particularly when focusing on a daffy wife of a detective serving food Bunuel might enjoy.

Sure, comic book characters had been featured in the Saturday serials that kids flocked to in the 1940's and 50's, and Batman had been brought to both the television and silver screen in the late 1960s, but in parody form. However, when producer Alexander Salkind and son Ilyia Salkind envisioned a grand film adaptation of the iconic DC Comics character Superman, they were braving new territory for modern film. What they delivered with Superman, under the capable direction of Richard Donner, was a film that not only birthed the comic film adaptation genre, but defined it as well, setting the bar high for everyone who followed. Superman still stands as the best example of comic book film-making to date.Superman opens on Krypton, a planet orbiting a red giant star. Jor-El (Marlon Brando) a Kryptonian scientist determines that the sun will explode in less than 30 days. Believing his world doomed, Jor-El decides to send his infant son, Kal-El, to the planet Earth, whose yellow sun, combined with Kal-El's dense molecular structure, will allow him to be incredibly strong, almost indestructible and able to defy Earth's gravity. He crash lands in a Kansas corn field as Jonathan and Martha Kent (Glenn Ford and Phyllis Thaxter) are driving along. They adopt him and name him Clark, who quickly demonstrates his special abilities, and they determine that they must keep his abilities secret to prevent Clark from being taken away from them.After Jonathan's death by a heart attack, Clark, drawn to the North, hurtles a crystal from his ship into the air into the distance in the frozen wastes of the North pole and it grows into a giant fortress of crystal. He discovers Jor-El has left recordings to teach him of his past and his heritage. Eventually, Clark (now played by Christopher Reeve) finds himself in the great city of Metropolis, as a reporter working for the great newspaper the Daily Planet. He quickly finds himself taken with his fellow reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) who has a insatiable desire to get a story. It is shortly thereafter that Clark dons his alter ego Superman, complete with an outfit of blue and red tights and a cape to identify himself. The public is taken with this spectacle, as he performs several deeds to help people in distress. Meanwhile, mastermind super villain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has set up shop beneath Grand Central Station and has hatched a devious plan to use two misdirected Nuclear missiles to create a new separate continent for himself.Supeman doesn't play fast and loose with it's characters or his origins. This is very much a traditional Superman story, but presented as to make you believe in the material. Superman is a unique film in wide variety of ways. It adapted the famous Superman character and all his trappings into a believable universe, but it did so without cheapening the character or playing anything silly. Superman is a film that has a tremendous respect for it's source material. And yet, at the same time, it is not afraid to kid with iconic elements of the legendary character. Long before cinema was self-aware Superman was able to wink at itself without bringing itself down to the level of self-parody (it would take two sequels to reach that sad depth). For example at a moment where Superman is trying to change into his outfit, he runs up to a phone both, used in previous media sources as Superman's changing room preference, but with modern phone booths the open, small alcove style, Clark merely stops, looks it up and down, and keeps on walking. It is a perfect example of poking fun at itself, but never losing the appropriate respect either.It also offsets some of the Superman traditions with a new take on the villains. Lex Luthor, as realized by Gene Hackman, is evil, for sure, but he also manages to come across as completely in love with himself to the point of providing comedy (A perfect line when he is addressing a henchman Do you know what the number 200 has in common between us? It's your weight and my IQ.). Lex is villainous as necessary, but not so that he isn't able to have some fun with the character. He might very well be the birthplace of the villain that is evil and amusing at the same time. Where the film really works is the romance between Superman and Lois Lane. She is smitten with him, and he with her, and as the two first meet and he takes her on a flight of Metropolis, you can feel the chemistry.Superman has stellar casting; almost everyone is near perfect in their roles. Reeve, an unknown at the time, was discovered after a long talent hunt, and he embodies both Clark Kent and Superman perfectly. He gives Kent just the right amount of ditzyness and uncertainty and then offsets that with Superman's confidence and charisma that he makes it easier to swallow that Lois is unable to tell them apart. Kidder is also great as firebrand Lane, always after her story, but obviously taken with the Man of Steel. Hackman, as previously mentioned, has just the right mix of charm and venom to sell narcissist Lex Luthor. The creators weren't worried exclusively about big names, they found the right people for the job.Everything else, from John Williams classic score, to it's quality visual effects (especially for the time) lead Superman to be a complete success.

He just never goes wrong every single piece of his film making proves so much skill, talent and dedication it's unbelievable. I love the way everything ties in together with such ease and precision. There are not many films that manage have such amazing entertainment value. When I watch a Kevin Smith film I just sit their in hysterics. You see this is Clever comedy, it has class, style, edge, wit and sting. That's what I love about it, the fact it's Comedy with a bite. I never get tired of the crazy antics of intelligent slackers. Everything so real, but yet so off the wall. You get the hilarious music playing in certain moments of the film which adds a cool goofy feel to the movie. The film sticks to same cheap feel that the masterpiece Clerks. has. This gives the true Indie spirit to the film I can watch Kevin Smith films again and again, they never lose their touch. The characters are always so cool and are exactly like people I hang around with in my day to day life. The timing as usual is something I love, they way everybody seems to know their lines but have developed them to suit their preferences.Behind all the laughs there is a very serious message and that's to make the best out of the girl your dating. You see it shows that you need to put more thought in to things and understand certain aspects of relationships. Because there will always be The girl that got away. I love the respect that Kevin Smith shows to the comic book tradition and the geek factor around his films. Getting Stan Lee to have a brief stint in the movie proves this dedication and respect to the people Kevin Smith looks up to. Another obvious one is the Silent Bob Batman Sequence. As usual the scripting is the best bit about the film, it truly shines with real wit and grace. Nothing gets better than consistent quotable dialogue and the dirty speeches. That's another thing the fact the Kevin Smith is never afraid to make crude jokes and manages to make movies that have a beautiful touch of realism to them. Everything around you is exaggerated in Mallrats, the set pieces, the music, the direction and sometimes the acting. You see it's all done purposely because this is Kevin Smith's world. At first glance you might think Mallrats (and other Kevin Smith films for that matter) are dumb teen comedies. They are far from it and I always find myself stressing that point. Every character times their lines perfectly and everybody has a relaxed aura about themselves. I think a lot of people only know Smith's newer films like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and think that's what every Kevin Smith film is like. I personally feel that Clerks., Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma are masterpieces and are some of the best films ever made. One of the most underrated and ignored films of the 90s, that luckily has had a great cult status. Jason Lee acts with great talent and proves himself to be an excellent comedian. I have managed to get many friends of mine into Kevin Smith's films and they have all been impressed with his work. One of the funniest satires ever made, no doubt about it.

First, the bad quality of its two sequels turned the horror of the first into campy silliness; and second and more important, the fact that David Cronenberg's 1986 remake is a perfect film in every sense sent the movie to oblivion almost instantly. A shame indeed, as The Fly is more than a simple creature feature, it is a powerful mix of Gothic horror and science-fiction with something very important that distinguish it from the rest of the movies of its era a good dose of class.On a dark night, François Delambre (Vincent Price), receives the most tragic news he could had received, his dear brother Andre (David Hedison) has been murdered and the killer is no one else than Andre's beloved wife, Helene (Patricia Owens). Everything points out to insanity as the cause of the murder, but as Helene tells the tragic story behind the murder, François and his good friend, the Insp. Charas (Herbert Marshall), discover a grotesque tale of science gone wrong, very wrong.Kurt Neumann, a veteran director who spent the 40s making the famous Tarzan series of movies with Johnny Weissmuller, brought the class of the old style of the 30s film-making to George Langelaan's tale of love and horror. Neumann finds the perfect equilibrium between Gothic atmospheres and the beautiful color technique, in a very good mix between old style and modern (for its time) technology. The suspense is superbly handled and while the slow pacing of the film may turn off modern viewers, it is vital for the shock and power of the two crucial final scenes.Like Cronenberg's remake, the movie's main theme is love, but unlike the modern version, here the focus is on Andre's wife Helene, who must face her fears in order to save her husband of the cruel fate his accident unleashed. Neumann carefully builds up the relationships between characters in a way that makes us care for them, making the fatal accident even more dreadful and frightening as the family's life will never be the same after it.Patricia Owens is terrific as the main character, and it is her character the one that carries the film. She is perfect as the woman who would do anything to save the man she loves, and her performance transmits the emotions of despair and angst in a very believable way. David Hedison is very good as Andre, and while at first he seems quite average, his performance as the mute monster is outstanding. Vincent Price may be only a supporting actor here, and in a very different role than we are used to see him. However, he delivers his lines with his usual charm and his presence fits perfectly the classy elegance Neumann crafted in the film.Of course, one has to talk about the special effects, as this is where the movie has dated the most. Nowadays, and thanks to the silly make-up used in the following sequels, the Fly's make-up is seen as clumsy instead of grotesque and its impact has been enormously diminished; however, it is safe to say that contrary to its sequels, here they still work, thanks to Neumann's choice of showing them only in the crucial moments. Depsite being clumsy and silly for today's standards, The Fly's special effects still manage to give the scares.The Fly has been definitely overshadowed by its superior remake, however, this film still has a lot of power and despite having two silly films as sequels, this one has a characteristic that makes it stand out among the rest, it has that class and elegance that old Gothic horrors of the 30s had. It is a shame that Neumann didn't live to see the success of The Fly, but at least he finally got the chance to show his talents in this powerful horror movie. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 2006","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The original version of The Fly has apparently been forgotten due to two powerful reasons.

Today, Event Horizon doesn't really freak me out anymore, but it's still an underrated freakout for anyone who hasn't seen it that can accept the weak script and lackluster third act.So basically it's about this spaceship that gets possessed by evil and terrorizes people by making them go crazy or showing them flashes of their friends screaming and being mutilated in some freaky dimension of chaos or something. The flash parts are really freaky, and along with the scene where the ship's log suddenly starts playing by itself without static over what happened after evil took over--it looks like the kind of porn the dark lord Sauron watches, but with tighter editing. By just flashing crazy gory stuff at you, it makes you think you've seen things that are worse than what you have, since most of it consists of people screaming and bloody or nude corpses impaled through the face hanging around covered in maggots. (on second thought, that is freaky) But it tricks you into thinking you're seeing people being graphically dissected and people eating themselves and gay people getting married.A lot of people upon release found it to be really derivative of Alien, among other things, but I don't think it's derivative, because it feels like it's taking place somewhere else in the same universe, which is also how it gets away with having everyone smoke 50 years into the future.The script is lame. I'm now walking. I'm now entering the medical bay. I'm now picking my nose. a lot of the dialogue can be like that. Or there's the other, non-Morpheus black guy, who seems to be attempting to be the best Funny, But Clumsy Negro stereotype in the history of the cinema, and unfortunately he fails because it takes you out of the movie whenever he appears. They might as well have had Paul WS Anderson play the part in blackface. Also, there's a lot of talk about hell and a dimension of pure chaos, and it all sounds a little silly no matter how freakishly disturbing the visions of it are.The last half hour houses the biggest shocks, for me, but the movie sort of falls apart into a series of action sequences before the big explosion. You know, the kind that happens in any sci-fi horror movie. It's also unfortunate that they turned the Jurassic Park 1 and 3 guy into the outright villain--it's less scary when you can see the bad guy, particularly if he looks like a more lame, naked version of Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies, but with no pins, so he's really just Head, and that's not a cool name for anybody. The whole last half hour reeks of studio impatience and interference. There was originally another half hour that was cut out, and probably contained a lot of stuff that should have been in the movie, but the studio was a jerk and made them cut a lot of the gore, or the character and story development, you know, things that aren't necessary to Hollywood studios. It's a shame, because with that footage, Event Horizon might have been an actually good movie, and a jewel amidst the chunks of corn in the turd of Paul WS Anderson's filmography.If Anderson made it today, it would be scored entirely with Marilyn Manson, the action scenes would be hyper-edited and incomprehensible, the characters wouldn't even have personalities, and it would end with Morpheus making friends with the evil force so that together they can battle the alien zombies that Anderson felt were necessary to add to make the movie cooler.

It is a film that is equally a classic, a work of art, and a musical. It is also brilliantly made in all its aspects, it is strongly emotional, a celebration of beauty, its soundtrack is nothing less than genius, the performances are truly memorable, and it is visually outstanding. This film is an extraordinary production that can only get better every time one sees it.In Moulin' Rouge the theme and sub-themes of the story are made clear by the characters themselves, Beauty, Freedom, Truth, and Love, of course with love as the main theme. Christian, played by Ewan McGregor, is obsessed with love even though he has never fallen in love himself, the main plot revolves around his ideals about love. Throughout the movie Satine and Christian fight for love only to prove that it conquers all, as they beautifully play it in the song Come What May. This is their secret song, and no matter what obstacles their love will be stronger than adversity. The whole film revolves around these ideals of the bohemian revolution, or better said the children of the revolution. So many films have been made in honor of love, yet this one stands out because it pays tribute to love with art, music, and consequently passion. It is impossible not to fall in love watching this film even if it is for the thousandth time.The story line of the movie gives allusion to several classics, such as La Bohème, La Traviata, and Orpheus in the Underworld (IMDB Trivia), yet it stands out for its originality. Another movie which it alludes to is, a stronger classic than the latter, is Romeo and Juliette. Even if the audience is as cynical as Satine, Christian and the rest of the bohemians will draw them into romantic bliss.Even though the movie is a Tragedy it is made into greatness by the very basic ideals of the Greek Tragedy it had to be made with such perfection and beauty that the spectator would walk away with a duality of emotion, both sadness for the heartbreaking outcome of the story and joy for the admiration of what they have just witnessed. What is more, whenever a movie starts with the ending the viewer can foresee that the film will be so great that is doesn't need a shocking ending, the movie's story line is enough.The acting in the movie was also worthy of awe, all five main actors, Ewan McGregor as Christian, Nicole Kidman as Satine, John Leguizamos as Toulouse, Jim Broadbent as Zidler, and Richard Roxburgh as The Duke made an incredible performance, and by performance I mean acting and singing. A couple of these actors had a previous positive reputation for their acting, however their singing will sure cause a shocking impression on the audience. The most memorable performances were those of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, they were so intensely in character that it is very hard to watch the movie objectively without getting absorbed into the sentiment of the film.Nevertheless, even though the singing of the actors was incredible it would have been nothing without the elaborate composition of the songs. All of the songs were covers for the most part yet it was seldom obvious. Most of the songs were individually composed of lyrics of many singers and bands and they were redone to fit the movie. These songs are so perfect for every situation that it would have been easier to compose new lyrics than to gather lines from other composers. Purchasing the soundtrack is almost as worthy of getting the movie itself.In addition, the costumes and the sets were so elaborate that they were as important to the film's success as the actors' performance, the music, and the plot. The movie takes place in Paris; yet it is a fantasy landscape of Paris that almost purposefully looks like a miniature replica, this setting adds to the fantastic world in which the film takes place. All of the inside settings are striking for their elaborateness and artistic quality, they add to the movie's creative, elegant, sexy, and dreamlike spirit.Moulin Rouge can also be described as very bizarre and this may be the reason why it does not appeal to all audiences. One of the main elements that make it so is the way the camera is used. It is not at all used in a conventional way; on the contrary, it goes to extremes so that it makes it unconventional. It is a combination of rapid tracking shots, spinning, coordination with the song (specifically in the song Spectacular Spectacular), and more. Even though the usage of the camera makes the movie very bizarre it is almost essential for its artistic structure.Many aspects such as the acting, singing, setting, costumes, use of color, camera movement, and theme, come together to make this movie into a brilliant work of art. However, as great as it is it does not appeal to everyone; because it is so unconventional it may not arise all of the emotions that it should, it may only cause confusion. Despite its unpopularity in certain groups, it is venerated by others. Moulin Rouge was the first acclaimed musical in this time and was the first of many more to come. It is also one of those movies that will be timeless and will only become better with time. Moulin Rouge can be concisely expressed as having heart.

I remember a lot of the mainstream critics weren't fond of it when it first came out and although it looks and feels B-Grade, it has some serious flaws but is fairly engaging overall.The acting in the film isn't bad. I don't think I've seen a bad performance from Gary Sinise yet, D'Onofrio plays the type of character he's mastered countless times before and Madeline Stowe is almost always reliable (let us not speak of the abomination known as 'Avenging Angelo.'). A decent supporting cast helps shore up things and there aren't really any weaknesses from an acting standpoint. The strength of the script is the premise and it will be familiar to Philip K Dick fans society is out to get a man who may or may not be wrongly accused. Obvious recent Dick film connections can be made to both 'Paycheck,' 'Minority Report,' and to a lesser extent 'Blade Runner.' In fairness, all of those films are better than this and if you've seen them you may not find the material very fresh. This was a primary obsession for Dick though and I've always enjoyed seeing how it would play out. In this case, Sinise plays a scientist who is accused of being an alien robot with a bomb inside. He is told by a security agent (D'Onofrio) that he is going to assassinate the president of the planet. What follows is a desperate 'Fugitive' like attempt by Sinise to escape and prove his innocence as he leads his captors on a chase throughout a post-apocalyptic city.The script never really gives away the fact that Sinise really IS a killer robot until the very end, but there are enough heavy-handed spoilers that I was fairly confident. A few examples 1. The commentary that Sinise and Stowe make as they watch the news in the morning. They've been at war with an alien species that killed his father and motivated him to become a scientist who would create weapons to annihilate his father's killers. And yet on the news he listens the president talk about war plans and dismisses her as a warmonger. This struck me as inconsistent. He'll commit genocide, but SHE'S a warmonger?? 2. D'Onofrio is shown to be ruthless, but also extremely efficient. In my recollection of the film, his error percentage seems to be very low and his hunches are well researched and almost always right. Nothing really seems to dissuade you from this during the film. Having the story told from the Sinise perspective is an old and dirty trick to make you naturally root for the 'hero.' Had the story been filmed the same way but from the D'Onofrio perspective, I'm having a hard time believing that there would have been any doubt about the true nature of the Sinise character. 3. The spinal core test that Sinise undergoes. Had the test been interrupted before it got near his heart, you might find yourself wondering if Sinise is a human or a man. The problem with the film is that it scans TO his heart and then the machine starts to scream about a malfunction and previously undetected tissue. We learn no more because the test can't be completed. Now if he's a killer robot with a bomb in his heart and his only way of proving that he isn't is to take a comparative test from six months earlier, does it seem like anything gets resolved other than ALL POSSIBLE REMAINING SUSPENSE by having the testing machine screaming 'Malfunction!' and 'Unknown Tissue detected!' at the crucial moment? It never shows you the bomb but I think that pretty much settles the last twenty minutes of the film.It may seem like I'm trashing the film but I did actually like it. The direction was a bit heavy and the script had its problems but I came into this well willing to watch a Philip K Dick IDEA made into film. I'm satisfied with it because of the ending and the twist ending. For me that actually raised the quality of the entire film although this is one of those time when I wish I could give a six and a half rather than a six or a seven. If you can get beyond what may kill any of the suspense in the film for you, take some comfort in the performance of Gary Sinise his character sincerely believes that he is human and that there has been some terrible mistake. The look of tragedy and pathos on his face when he realizes the truth is worth the price of admission. This is great acting by a wonderfully unsung actor. It is a fantastic character study of a man who wants to prove what he thinks the truth is. The tragic results of this shine far above the murky quagmire of the rest of the script. My only other real regret about the film is that they fell into the clumsy and aggravating trap of having the score play non-stop throughout the film. 99.99% of the time this KILLS a film but misguided producers, directors and film scorers insist on unwitting self sabotage. Music should be used to accentuate tension your screenplay and performances have created NOT try to develop tension that is never really there. It is like putting up a hideous pair of curtains.If you're interested in Dick's philosophical ideas or a film with a strong performance from Sinise, 'Impostor' is recommended. Otherwise it is average and potentially uninteresting to casual viewers who may not have the patience or inclination to sit through the weak opening act.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"21 June 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" First, there was Jaws &#150; a suspense masterpiece from a young whiz-kid named Steven Spileberg that altered forever the summer box office trade. Then there was Jaws 2 &#150; a pretty poor sequel geared mainly to make a little extra money on the back of its illustrious predecessor. Jaws 3 came later &#150; a really poor second sequel with gimmicky 3-D effects and an unrelated plot. But they saved the ultimate howler for last. Jaws The Revenge is the fourth and final film in the series&#133;. and it is absolutely terrible. I'm talking terrible in its most pure form here. Jaws The Revenge is an all-time clunker that will be looked back on one day by collectors of bad movies with the kind of fondness reserved for Plan 9 From Outer Space and Santa Claus Conquers The Martians.It has been several years since Police Chief Brody killed two Great White Sharks off Amity Island (that would be the story lines from Jaws 1 and 2, if you don't already know). Brody is now dead, having spent the last years of his life haunted by memories of his shark experiences. His widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), still lives on Amity Island and her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) is now the local policeman, following proudly in Dad's footsteps. Unfortunately, one Christmas Sean is called out to remove some debris from the harbour and, while going unsuspectingly about his work, he is attacked and killed by another Great White Shark. Distraught, Ellen leaves Amity and heads off for the Bahamas, where her eldest son Michael (Lance Guest) works as a marine scientist. Michael assures his mother that there's nothing to fear as Great White Sharks wouldn't survive in the Bahamian waters as they don't like warm seas. But by now, Ellen is convinced that the shark has a vendetta against her family and will not stop until it has killed them all. Stupid as it sounds, her fears prove correct&#133;. the Great White pursues her to the Bahamas and sets about finishing off her and her son.Let me just recap that if you think you've read a misprint The Great White pursues her to the Bahamas&#133;. Yes, a shark actually somehow figures out that its intended victim has travelled a thousand miles to a different part of the world. Yes, the shark then swims down to this different part of the world to find this victim. And yes, the shark goes there even though it means leaving its normal habitat. One must assume that the film is suggesting that the Brody family have had so many run-ins with Great White Sharks that some kind of telekinetic link has formed between the two. Such a plot device is so stupid - so utterly, utterly ludicrous &#150; that it is insulting to the viewers. However, we might still find the charity in our hearts to forgive the films its moronic plot if it were able to at least provide some decent shocks. But even here our hopes are struck down in tatters. There is no suspense whatsoever in Jaws The Revenge. The shark attacks are minimal and when they finally arrive they are predictable, dull and half-hearted.

Brody is now dead, having spent the last years of his life haunted by memories of his shark experiences. His widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), still lives on Amity Island and her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson) is now the local policeman, following proudly in Dad's footsteps. Unfortunately, one Christmas Sean is called out to remove some debris from the harbour and, while going unsuspectingly about his work, he is attacked and killed by another Great White Shark. Distraught, Ellen leaves Amity and heads off for the Bahamas, where her eldest son Michael (Lance Guest) works as a marine scientist.

However, we might still find the charity in our hearts to forgive the films its moronic plot if it were able to at least provide some decent shocks.

As he answers no it is clearly revealed that he is crossing his fingers behind his back. This wink to the audience pretty much sets the tone for this entertaining cinematic feast which is so rich that it's worth seeing again and again. As movie buffs know, Lang reunited the three lead cast members (Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett and Dan Duryea) from his previous effort, Woman in the Window (1944) and intensified their characters for Scarlet Street. Without going into intricate details which are well covered in other commentaries, both plots concern a married, middle-aged man (Robinson) who gets into ever-worsening trouble after suddenly crossing paths with a femme fatale (Bennett). Scarlet Street explores the power of illusion and the role of money and art in human relations, our striving for beauty and love, and not least how one wrong move (or by implication, one right move) can radically change the course of one's life. The three main characters are living a lie - presenting a picture, if you will - in order to get what they desperately want. Every frame is loaded; props, gestures, camera angles, and settings carry narrative weight, symbolize states of mind, warn of danger, reveal secrets, foreshadow plot developments, comment on individuals as well as the larger world. Lang also uses sound imaginatively the song My Melancholy Baby recurs in multiple forms; radio static adds to the impact of a tense moment; disembodied whispers haunt the protagonist. And many viewers who first discover Joan Bennett here in the juiciest role of her career will want to rush to see whatever else she did.Scarlet Street begs comparison with Jean Renoir's La Chienne (1931), adapted from the same source material (a French novel by Georges de la Fouchardiere, published in the US as Poor Sap); both are the work of gifted directors with radically different visions. Renoir's touch is gentle, detached (even the face slappings seem almost like love taps); his characters are more down-to-earth and often filmed in real Paris locations; the sexual angle is frank and even casual (American cinema wouldn't catch up until the 60s). Lang on the other hand is tightly focused, bold, even brutal, but not without humor. His street scenes are artificial studio constructs; his characters are closer to types than full-blooded people, but I believe that their dehumanized circumstances justify this approach artistically. Lang's screenwriter Dudley Nichols brilliantly delineates plot mechanics that Renoir elides, revealing to us the notch-by-notch turning of the wheels of fate. And we can't look away. We are just as trapped as as Chris Cross. The contrast between the movies is neatly expressed by the way they present the protagonist's paintings Renoir's are soft, naturalistic; Lang's hard-edged, stylized. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** Renoir's ending is bittersweet and ironic; Lang's grim and unutterably sad.Edward G. Robinson once said or wrote that Scarlet Street and his performance therein were monotonous. His misgivings are perhaps those of a seasoned actor who felt underused by a director known for treating actors like puppets. But from the audience's perspective the result is chillingly effective.A noticeable oversight although the story clearly takes place in 1934, the clothes and hairstyles are strictly mid-40's. No effort was made to correct this incongruity.

The only way to get there is by a small single-engined plane, and halfway through the trip the pilot is forced by bad weather to make an emergency landing on a small uninhabited island. The plane's landing gear is damaged, meaning that they are unable to take off again, and the radio equipment was put out of action by the storm, making their chances of rescue unlikely. Fortunately, however, Robin and the pilot, Quinn Harris, find themselves falling in love.This being a romantic comedy, there have to be some obstacles to their love. Robin and Quinn are complete opposites, he being a tough man of action and a lover of the great outdoors, whereas she is a suave, metropolitan New Yorker. Initially, they take a dislike to each other. Most importantly, Robin has a fiancé, Frank- indeed, they have come on holiday together to celebrate their engagement. Quinn also has a mistress, a local girl named Angelica, although this relationship does not seem to involve a great deal of emotional commitment, at least not on his part.In real life, matters like this might prove insuperable obstacles. In a rom-com, however, they are less obstacles than standard plot clichés. (See, for example, You've Got Mail, in which the same three obstacles were overcome equally easily). The three basic rules of love and marriage in rom-coms can be summarised as i) opposites attract, ii) lovers always start off by hating one another, iii) the big-name star always gets the girl, so you needn't worry about other boyfriends on the horizon.Harrison Ford is normally associated either with action adventures, like the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series, or political or legal thrillers such as Patriot Games or The Fugitive. He is not, therefore, perhaps the first actor one would think of when casting the hero of a romantic comedy. He was, however, surprisingly good in Working Girl (even if Sabrina was something of a disappointment) and here, as Quinn, he is able to draw upon his normal gruff and laconic but steady and dependable screen persona in order to emphasise the contrast with the more voluble and emotional Robin. It is clear that he is, underneath his tough exterior, a man of strong emotions, even if he has difficulty in expressing them- he left America to live in the islands after a painful divorce when his wife left him for his best friend. There are, in fact, brief attempts to turn this into an adventure film, when Quinn and Robin have to battle a gang of pirates, although even these turn into comedy when the pirates manage to sink their own ship, making them seem more like inept buffoons than ruthless cutthroats.Anne Heche presumably took this role to bolster her image as Hollywood's first born-again heterosexual, although her Robin struck me as being a bit too abrasive- not the girl I would choose to be marooned on a desert island with. Her treatment of the hapless Frank, whom David Schwimmer played as goofy but likable, also struck me as rather heartless. (I can foresee that Schwimmer is going to have a real problem with typecasting- every character he plays reminds me of his Ross from Friends). The scriptwriters seem to have shared my view about Robin's heartlessness, as they included a rather improbable scene where Frank beds Angelica while both are fretting over their missing partners. The idea was presumably to undermine the audience's sympathy for Frank by insisting that he is as guilty of infidelity as Robin is. We never actually find out how Frank's romance with Angelica progresses, but as she is a very underdeveloped character, we never really care.The film that I was most reminded of was that great eighties rom-com Crocodile Dundee, which also featured a young female New York journalist who falls to an exotic location where she falls for an older man of action. Crocodile Dundee, however, is a far better film, treating this theme with a great deal more style and humour. Harrison's Quinn is not in the same league as Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee, one of the great comic characters of all time.

Julia Ormond is so beautiful it's like sweet agony to watch her slink around in fabulous clothes, at least in the first few scenes. But then the plot begins to fall apart, and really, there is nothing going on.The story starts out fairly logical, a little boy fell off a roof -- was he pushed? But soon stunning Smilla is babbling about meteorites and worms from outer space and corporate bad guys who all look like Richard Harris, old and ugly and with one foot in the grave. You will laugh and laugh if you wait through the end to see what they really want you to believe happened to the little boy. (SPOILER AHEAD) Uh, gee, Richard Harris, 80 years old and drunk, chasing a six year old boy up six flights of stairs? How about no, Richard lurches out of his limo falls face down in the gutter and dies on the spot? What makes it even more laughable is the stupid reasons given for the great Meteor Hunt, which is a laughable premise to begin with. In actual, scientific fact, there is no reason a meteorite might not contain precious metals like platinum or gold. This has been known to occur. But no, THIS meteorite is filled with killer worms that eat people's brains! And so of course the Sinister Corporation must move heaven and earth to get the worms, and use them to . . . to . . . uh, they don't quite explain! The plot makes no sense, but Smilla looks lovely in her cute little couture outfits. You'd never know she was a rebel, the way she's such a fashion junkie. And what's the deal with the way she's always tormenting her father's luscious young trophy wife?

Now after, it's never quite as successful as it aspires to almost in spite of what the cast is up to deliver. But what makes the film fall apart even when it reaches for grounded, dark family drama, is that there is an inherent 'message' being pushed with the material, and there is more potential for the dynamics of these characters than is mined. In fact, this could have been a very good film, bordering on excellent, if all the expectations that could come with a 'movie' version of such a realistic story had been subverted. As it is, Liam Neeson, Meryl Streep, and Edward Furlong do what they can with characters that border between two and two and a half dimensional characters (if that makes sense). They're all extremely competent and put power where it's needed in scenes. But the whole lot of it almost seems to a kind of 'meh' point, like an episode of Law and Order that goes more for the upper-middle class decay than the interest in the case itself of the murder committed by the teenage Furlong. No one is necessarily a 'bad' character, which ironically places some of what ends up occurring on screen after the first hour being bland and predictable. There are maybe two or three really well-done scenes in the whole film (i.e. when Neeson and Streep first visit Furlong in jail, with an impeccable silence from the child to the emotional parents), floating amid what could just as well be a TV movie trumped for Hollywood. It's also sad to report that a supporting actor like Alfred Molina is almost misused, which rarely every happens with his character-actor parts; compared to his best roles in other indie and blockbuster films the quality of 'ah, Molina's in this' lasts for maybe three minutes. Worth watching maybe once, though if you don't stick through it to the end it's not the end of the world- probably one of Shroeder's lesser films.

Either he makes some of the best horror in the genre, or he makes ones that are pretty mind-numbingly bad. Sadly, this falls into the later category quite often, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything worthwhile. This is pretty much a special effects movie through-and-through, and it does look pretty nice. The cat creatures look really nice, with a sort of feline look with a sort of demonic twist that makes them truly benevolent. The transformations into them look quite believable, and are a far cry better than more recent transformations. The fact that these creatures are pretty violent and ruthless isn't a bad thing either. There is plenty of blood-loss in here with some violent set-ups and gags. In here are some really impressive moments, including having a hand ripped off, a corn-on-the-cob as a an impaling device, and a really brutal slamming onto a white-picket fence, which is the bloodiest kill in the film.

It has a rather interesting premise and that goes a long way, but it has an oddball approach to working through it. Instead of setting up a series of incidents and coincidences that set up a feeling of unease concerning the situation, it dives right in and makes the audience aware of what's going on, ruining what suspense it could've had. Then by introducing a radical shift in tone, the difference becomes to the point of distracting. By becoming a low-rate horror-comedy that isn't all that funny to begin with, it clashes with the hardcore horror the plot and the actions clearly want it to be.

Yet occasionally corpses happen to be the subject of humor. There was the amusing film (based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel) THE WRONG BOX, which was elegantly done, and was quite good. There was Alfred Hitchcock's attempt at a totally funny black comedy regarding hiding a dead body in New England, called THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. And best of all was this 1989 comedy about a body that takes on a life of it's own.Hitchcock's fans insist THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of his greatest films. It isn't. It demonstrates that Hitchcock's sense of humor was best used as a seasoning. A good example in FRENZY the trouble the Scotland Yard Inspector had with his wife's continental cooking attempts. Every now and then the action leaves the scenes involving the suspect and the real killer and the victims, and we watch the poor Inspector discussing the case with his wife (who makes some good suggestions) while they eat all sorts of concoctions that the poor man loathes. It is not a bad running joke - but it is not the main theme of the film. The main theme of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was that a number of people in a New England town all have had problems with Harry. The joke is how each of these people tries to hide the corpse, alone or with each other. They are helped by the stupidity of the local sheriff.The problem is that Hitch's originality and inventiveness began to fade in the film. After all, how many times can you show people hiding a body and make it funny? And this was the actual plot - not a sideline to the plot.In THE WRONG BOX there were other strands (the antics of Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Ralph Richardson, and John Mills in different directions - frequently at cross purposes). The fact the body gets mislaid, when it is at the center of the plot of Cook and Moore, concerning a tontine. The corresponding scheme of Mills trying to get rid of his rival Richardson for the tontine. In short the body is an element, but not the center of the joke.WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S changed this. The corpse is the center and movement of the plot, but screenplay writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotchoff realized what THE WRONG BOX showed, and what Hitch missed. The key of the use of a dead body as a matter of humor is not hiding the body, but producing it. In THE WRONG BOX it is hidden by various people, for different reasons, but several (Cook and Moore) plan to produce it at a given moment - and can't. In short the body has movement despite being a body. Hitch just kept having the body of Harry dug up and moved to another grave several times - movement it's true, but repetitive movement at best. One exception, but a meaningless one - when Harry's body is put into the bathtub in Shirley MacLaine's house. Why should it be in the tub? Hitch never really gave a reasonable reason for that.In WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S Klane and Kotchoff solved this by creating the necessity of making people believe the dead Bernie is not dead.Terry Kaiser is Bernie Lomax, the head of a large company that Andrew McCarthy (as Larry Waters) and Jonathan Silverman (as Richard Parker) work for as accountants. They discover a huge discrepancy in the books, and make the mistake of trusting this information to Bernie. They don't realize he and his partner have been looting the company. Bernie invites them to his home in the Hamptons for the weekend (where he secretly plans to bump them off). What he does not realize is that his partner has decided to bump him off, so Don Calfa (as Pacho, the hit-man) shoots Bernie, and leaves his corpse in the house. He thinks that the two visitors or someone else will report the finding of the dead body. When Waters and Parker show up, they discover the dead man, and they are aware of his plot against them. Should they call the police? They decide they would be suspected. So the best thing is to make it appear that Bernie is still alive, and that he is having an active, fun-filled weekend with the two fellows. With plenty of people seeing and speaking to Bernie during the weekend, they will make sure that when they leave, nobody will suspect them. Of course, as time passes, Pacho can't understand the failure of anyone to discover the murder. He keeps returning and killing the living Bernie again and again and again. But Bernie keeps surviving to be seen limboing, swimming, and even water-skiing (my favorite part of the film).From a comedy about a dead body it becomes a comedy about frustration for the gunman, and of inventiveness by the two young heroes. It also is a smörgåsbord of prat falls, blows to the head, and unnatural natural accidents for actor Terry Kaiser. His performance as the all too lively when dead Bernie is one of the funniest silent comic jobs in recent movies, as his semi-smile and sunglasses make him seem crocked more than dead to everyone dancing on the beach front at his house. It is certainly more interesting than that of the actor who was Harry in Hitch's film - who just had to lay on the ground or get carried somewhere. Again, a clever grasp of the possibilities of the situation in reverse, in a well written and directed film like BERNIE'S, beats out the unimaginative use of the corpse as a simple prop even if the director is (otherwise) a master of cinema elsewhere.

Yet occasionally corpses happen to be the subject of humor. There was the amusing film (based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel) THE WRONG BOX, which was elegantly done, and was quite good. There was Alfred Hitchcock's attempt at a totally funny black comedy regarding hiding a dead body in New England, called THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. And best of all was this 1989 comedy about a body that takes on a life of it's own.Hitchcock's fans insist THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of his greatest films. It isn't. It demonstrates that Hitchcock's sense of humor was best used as a seasoning. A good example in FRENZY the trouble the Scotland Yard Inspector had with his wife's continental cooking attempts. Every now and then the action leaves the scenes involving the suspect and the real killer and the victims, and we watch the poor Inspector discussing the case with his wife (who makes some good suggestions) while they eat all sorts of concoctions that the poor man loathes. It is not a bad running joke - but it is not the main theme of the film. The main theme of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was that a number of people in a New England town all have had problems with Harry. The joke is how each of these people tries to hide the corpse, alone or with each other. They are helped by the stupidity of the local sheriff.The problem is that Hitch's originality and inventiveness began to fade in the film. After all, how many times can you show people hiding a body and make it funny? And this was the actual plot - not a sideline to the plot.In THE WRONG BOX there were other strands (the antics of Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Ralph Richardson, and John Mills in different directions - frequently at cross purposes). The fact the body gets mislaid, when it is at the center of the plot of Cook and Moore, concerning a tontine. The corresponding scheme of Mills trying to get rid of his rival Richardson for the tontine. In short the body is an element, but not the center of the joke.WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S changed this. The corpse is the center and movement of the plot, but screenplay writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotchoff realized what THE WRONG BOX showed, and what Hitch missed. The key of the use of a dead body as a matter of humor is not hiding the body, but producing it. In THE WRONG BOX it is hidden by various people, for different reasons, but several (Cook and Moore) plan to produce it at a given moment - and can't. In short the body has movement despite being a body. Hitch just kept having the body of Harry dug up and moved to another grave several times - movement it's true, but repetitive movement at best. One exception, but a meaningless one - when Harry's body is put into the bathtub in Shirley MacLaine's house. Why should it be in the tub? Hitch never really gave a reasonable reason for that.In WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S Klane and Kotchoff solved this by creating the necessity of making people believe the dead Bernie is not dead.Terry Kaiser is Bernie Lomax, the head of a large company that Andrew McCarthy (as Larry Waters) and Jonathan Silverman (as Richard Parker) work for as accountants.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"21 June 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Nearly a full sweep at the Australian version of the Oscars, Lantana does boast a beautiful cast and an emotional subject, but it is the delivery of the core roots of this film that quickly take Lantana's kneecaps out. This is a film about trust. Lantana builds its premise and focus around characters that are untrustworthy, that have no reason to be trusted, and finally asks us to forget what we think we know or have heard to discover a killer among them. We are given strangers. Strangers, like in Anderson's Magnolia, are twisted together haphazardly in hopes that their random stories will bring the film closure as well as evoke a conversation about trust around the office water-cooler. What transforms Lantana from classic noir film to another chatty film with a disappointing conclusion is the misdirection of the characters. Lantana boasts amazing acting, and it did just that. Lantana boasted a mystery that needed to be solved, and it did just that. Lantana boasted flawed characters which would evoke emotion, and it did just that. The issues begin as the film nears the center that these elements, while good on their own, do not allow for a strong enough overall film. The confusing circumstances that reach sporadically at the weak threads of this film are painful to watch, and will eventually transform an avid viewer into a dulled participant.Where did Anthony LaPaglia come from? Sure, I had seen him in other films like Empire Records and The Salton Sea and the television series Without A Trace, but it wasn't until this film was I able to witness his true acting ability. After watching Lantana, I must admit, LaPaglia needs to get more work. While I didn't see him as the center of this film (that goes to Hershey's character), I did think that he out shined even the great Geoffrey Rush. He was intense and intimidating while powerfully giving us a very conflicted human character. Rush was my second favorite of the film, his toned performance gave me goosebumps as I questioned his motives and logic. Hershey was adequate. Her character provided very little (outside of the central plot) and required even less. Her chemistry was disjoined, while her delivery seemed unmotivated. The same could be said for most the other characters outside of Rush and LaPaglia. These two tremendous actors stapled the film, while the rest seemed to simply move the plot closer to the ending credits.With such powerful acting, why didn't this movie succeed in my mind? For me, it was the flawed story. Director Ray Lawrence needed to define this film better. What was the overall message? Was it sympathy for our characters or was it an entire film about the power of trust? I could see both, but they were blurry. It was obvious that trust was the underlying moment in Lantana, but it was so blazingly pushed in your face that it became tedious quickly. I see the value of building distrust around your central characters only to demonstrate the power of trust overall, but in this film it just didn't work. Lawrence's pacing destroyed any chances of this being a strong theme. From the beginning we are pushed with this idea of trust in so many main directions such as Leon's adultery, the flirtatious neighbor, the openly gay affair, and the death of a child, that when it is provided to us in short verse, aka the son smoking weed and the wife's confused moment in the car, it just seemed overwhelming. I needed, alas wanted, a stronger story. I did not want to have to wait for nearly an hour for the plot-point to happen. Lawrence painfully made us wait, under developing characters that we fully understood early in the film, and focusing lengthily on minute details, forgetting the overall picture that this film could have accomplished.Lantana had every element for success. The emotional characters, the Magnolia connection, a disturbing murder, a plant (actually a weed) that only waxed the surface of symbolism; these were all synonymous with success, but Lawrence could not put the puzzle pieces together with ease. It nearly drives you to the brink of madness when you realize that everything was in place, it was the mind behind the camera that could not control it. I wanted the story to work, the characters were engrossing enough, I just felt that overall the haphazard themes and overplayed obstacle of trust was just chaotic. There wasn't enough rhythm, there wasn't enough balance, and there wasn't enough honest connections to make Lantana worth a second viewing. One scene the immediately comes to mind was that when LaPaglia was running down his street and accidentally hits a random stranger. Later, we learn that person is not as random as we thought, but by that point our apathy towards the film is already in full swing. Director Ray Lawrence tried to mimic what Paul Thomas cornered in Magnolia, but the end result was like tasting boxed wine instead of vintage.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Nearly a full sweep at the Australian version of the Oscars, Lantana does boast a beautiful cast and an emotional subject, but it is the delivery of the core roots of this film that quickly take Lantana's kneecaps out.
