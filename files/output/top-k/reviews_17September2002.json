Usually it's the film itself, but on occasion-- and this is one of them-- a character will emerge who is not just a character in a movie, but IS the movie.  Here, it's the title character of `Crocodile Dundee,' directed by Peter Faiman, and starring Paul Hogan as the inimitable Mick Dundee, a rather unique individual hailing from the small hamlet of Walkabout Creek, Australia.  Mick hit the big screen in 1986, and from the first moment he appeared, right up through the end of the second sequel, it's been a `G'day' for audiences around the world.In Australia on assignment for her New York newspaper, journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) runs across a story she just has to pursue.  It's about a legendary `local' from one of the small towns on the cusp of the bush, a crocodile hunter who, the story goes, had his leg bitten off by a croc, then managed to survive by crawling, alone, for days on end across the outback.  So it's off to the town of Walkabout Creek in search of this larger-than-life character, who it turns out is quite a `character' to say the least.  He is, in fact, one of a kind.  After a memorable meeting in the town's only pub (one of about four buildings in the whole place), Michael J. `Mick' Dundee agrees to take her on a tour retracing his steps and reconstructing the famous event where it actually took place.  He promises a hard journey through some rugged terrain-- no place, in fact, for a `Sheila'-- but, like any good reporter, she's ready for anything; or so she thinks.  And it's the beginning of an adventure she, as well as the audience, will never forget.Hogan concocted the story and created the character, then wrote the screenplay along with John Cornell and Ken Shadie, after which he turned it over to director Faiman, who did a worthy, if not exceptional, job of translating Hogan's vision to the screen.  Faiman, however, is destined to be the forgotten man with regards to this project, inasmuch as he was not only necessarily overshadowed by writer\/star Hogan, but he presented the film in a fairly straightforward manner, without anything particularly noteworthy that `he' did that would put his `signature' on it.  Add to that the fact that this was the first of only two films Faiman ever directed (his second was the lackluster `Dutch' in 1991); simply not enough to reference him, nothing added to his resume afterwards to make you take notice and say, `Oh, yes, he directed &#145;Dundee,' too.'  Still, filmmaking is inherently a collaborative medium, and as they say, a film does not `direct' itself; so credit must be given where it is due, and considering how good this film is, and how well it did at the box office, it points up that whatever Faiman did, he did right.  And he deserves to be acknowledged for it.It's no secret, of course, what really makes this film work.  Aside from the engaging story with it's romantic notions of adventure, from beginning to end it has the four `Big Cs' going for it  Character, Charisma, Chemistry and Charm.  Let's face it, Paul Hogan is `The Man' as Mick Dundee; he's the guy other guys admire and want to be (whether or not they'll admit to it), and he has the kind of natural good looks, charisma and charm that is irresistible to the ladies (whether or not they'll admit to it).  And the chemistry between Hogan and Kozlowski is irrefutable; it's the kind that makes you want to put another shrimp on the barbie.  Besides all of which there is an innate honesty about Hogan's Mick that shines through like a 1st order Fresnel light in a London fog.  He's laid-back and grounded, with a refreshingly logical outlook on life-- this guy's never going to need a pill for hypertension-- and what adds even more to his appeal is that there's a touch of larceny in his make-up, hiding just beneath that twinkle in his eye and his obvious integrity.  You also know instinctively that this is the guy you want in your corner when the chips are down.  All of this and more is what Paul Hogan captures in his performance; this is the Mick `Crocodile' Dundee he brings to the screen.In her motion picture debut, the lovely Linda Kozlowski brings some sizzle to the screen and proves to be the perfect counterpoint to co-star Hogan.  Something of an `Ibsenesque' role model, she demonstrates that a woman can be strong and ultra feminine, capable yet vulnerable, and all at the same time.  It makes her portrayal of Sue Charlton convincing, well rounded and real; much more than just a cardboard cutout kind of a character that could have been used as nothing more than a vehicle to move the story along.  Instead, though this is without question Mick Dundee's story, she makes it her story, too, and it gives the film an added perspective and considerably more depth than what is usually found in light comedy, which is essentially what this film is.  And there's a look in her eye and something in the way she smiles at Mick that has an absolute ring of truth to it.  You could say, in fact, that Hogan and Kozlowski are the Bogie and Bacall of the outback.Another invaluable asset to the film is the performance of the likable John Meillon as Mick's friend, Walter Reilly.  The part is a true character actor's character, and Meillon does it beautifully.  The supporting cast includes Mark Blum (Richard), Michael Lombard (Sam), Steve Rackman (Donk) and Reginald VelJohnson (Gus).

No wonder Brighton Beach and Elizabeth, New Jersey, are now filled up with Russians; they left home because of the weather.The sounds come down to us from Saving Private Ryan. I don't think war movies will ever be the same. The German MG42s sputter and the bullets clunk and spatter. As in SPR or Band of Brothers the bullets hit iron with serial clanks.

The sound departments used to be so fond of that particular noise that I've heard it when bullets glance off, not only hard surfaces like rocks, but wooden planks, sod, everything but flesh. The musical score is appropriate to the setting, with occasional echoes of Prokoviev. The acting is adequate. The most interesting character -- and they are all kind of interesting -- is not Zaitsev, the nominal hero, but the Commisar, spurned by his beloved who has fallen for the pop idol sniper, and who turns spiteful and destructive before sacrificing himself. The direction too is adequate. Tania has a scene in which she relates the sad story of how her parents were bundled out of town with other prisoners and then executed by the Nazis. As she goes through this monologue, a plaintive sad tune wanders into the sound track (a hint to the audience that this is a sad story). Meanwhile the camera very slowly dollies up from a medium shot to a close up (an even broader hint to the audience that this story is not only sad but important). In a later scene, Zaitsev is told that his lover has been killed and the camera moves in to a close up of a gigantic eyeball in which a tear seems to be forming. I kept wondering how Ozu would have handled this in something like Tokyo Story, which was full of sad tales. His camera wouldn't have moved an inch. And I think I believed it the first time a reflection momentarily blinded the sniper in The African Queen but I sure can't swallow this instance, which takes place in a darkened factory. I wish more directors had enough faith in their audiences' ability to recognize tragedy when they see it. You know, when you think about it, there were very few movies made about the conflict between the USSR and Nazi Germany until fairly recently. The post-war political environment in the USA wasn't such as to encourage heroic portraits of the Commies, and yet we couldn't go with the Nazis either for obvious reasons. Nobody making American movies would have known which side they wanted the audience to root for. This one is pretty even handed as far as that goes. It's mostly seen from the Russian's point of view, and, with the exception of Ed Harris's character, they are the only ones we get to know. (There is a very nice scene of Zsaitsev and Tania making furtive frightened love amid a horde of snoring bodies in a shelter; we briefly see her ivory, smooth, generous butt and it's not at all erotic.) Harris is cool, professional, has lost a son on the Eastern front, and is prepared to die. And, man, does Harris have the body language of the European aristocrat down pat. He sits with crossed legs and polished boots, serenely puffing a cigarette, his face placid. But he definitely revolts the audience when he takes a young boy whom he has gotten to like out into the ruins and hangs him as bait. Zaitsev is positively embarrassed by his notoriety in the media. Khrushchev is bullying and brutal, and the Commisar mouths socialist clichés. (We had to give them a kick in the pants somehow, I guess.) As for the sniping, it's the best part of the picture. I mean, it's hard to make movies about people whose main job is to lie there without moving for long periods. But these guys are sharp. They never miss. Every kill is a head shot. And they can cut a telephone line at 155 meters with one bullet. If they were any better they'd be superhuman. And, again, the audio is not embellished during the few shots we see. POP, and that's it. No clichés. It's a rather nicely done movie, kind of an easy one to get into, and, tense if not gripping, it carries a viewer along.War is a funny thing though.

The musical score is appropriate to the setting, with occasional echoes of Prokoviev. The acting is adequate. The most interesting character -- and they are all kind of interesting -- is not Zaitsev, the nominal hero, but the Commisar, spurned by his beloved who has fallen for the pop idol sniper, and who turns spiteful and destructive before sacrificing himself. The direction too is adequate. Tania has a scene in which she relates the sad story of how her parents were bundled out of town with other prisoners and then executed by the Nazis. As she goes through this monologue, a plaintive sad tune wanders into the sound track (a hint to the audience that this is a sad story). Meanwhile the camera very slowly dollies up from a medium shot to a close up (an even broader hint to the audience that this story is not only sad but important). In a later scene, Zaitsev is told that his lover has been killed and the camera moves in to a close up of a gigantic eyeball in which a tear seems to be forming. I kept wondering how Ozu would have handled this in something like Tokyo Story, which was full of sad tales. His camera wouldn't have moved an inch. And I think I believed it the first time a reflection momentarily blinded the sniper in The African Queen but I sure can't swallow this instance, which takes place in a darkened factory. I wish more directors had enough faith in their audiences' ability to recognize tragedy when they see it. You know, when you think about it, there were very few movies made about the conflict between the USSR and Nazi Germany until fairly recently. The post-war political environment in the USA wasn't such as to encourage heroic portraits of the Commies, and yet we couldn't go with the Nazis either for obvious reasons. Nobody making American movies would have known which side they wanted the audience to root for. This one is pretty even handed as far as that goes. It's mostly seen from the Russian's point of view, and, with the exception of Ed Harris's character, they are the only ones we get to know. (There is a very nice scene of Zsaitsev and Tania making furtive frightened love amid a horde of snoring bodies in a shelter; we briefly see her ivory, smooth, generous butt and it's not at all erotic.) Harris is cool, professional, has lost a son on the Eastern front, and is prepared to die. And, man, does Harris have the body language of the European aristocrat down pat. He sits with crossed legs and polished boots, serenely puffing a cigarette, his face placid. But he definitely revolts the audience when he takes a young boy whom he has gotten to like out into the ruins and hangs him as bait. Zaitsev is positively embarrassed by his notoriety in the media. Khrushchev is bullying and brutal, and the Commisar mouths socialist clichés. (We had to give them a kick in the pants somehow, I guess.) As for the sniping, it's the best part of the picture. I mean, it's hard to make movies about people whose main job is to lie there without moving for long periods. But these guys are sharp. They never miss. Every kill is a head shot. And they can cut a telephone line at 155 meters with one bullet. If they were any better they'd be superhuman. And, again, the audio is not embellished during the few shots we see. POP, and that's it. No clichés. It's a rather nicely done movie, kind of an easy one to get into, and, tense if not gripping, it carries a viewer along.War is a funny thing though. I can't think of another business in which you become a hero by killing more human beings than anybody else. The film avoids the whole issue.

One doesn't expect John Wayne to do romantic comedy, let alone to shine in it; but the romance of the title - in which a Quaker family shelter and accept a wounded man living on the edge of the law - proves to be strangely convincing and very tender. The comedy is of the most gentle and affectionate nature, and many of the early scenes had me smiling from ear to ear in delight.As the simple, direct heroine Penelope Worth, Gail Russell confounds both the outlaw's and the audience's stereotyped expectations of a 'religious' girl, and as in all the best culture-clash romances, both sides end up learning from each other. It takes Quirt Evans' menacing reputation and not the prayers of the Worths to convince their miserly old neighbour initially to release the water the farm so desperately needs - but it is the genuine and uncritical welcome the old man subsequently receives from the Quakers that converts him from enemy into friend.As far as the moment when Quirt, unable to bear the Quakers' gratitude, breaks free and reverts to his old life, the film never puts a foot wrong. But in the more conventionally 'Western' scenes that follow, it proves less effective.The Laredo Stevens sub-plot never really catches fire, despite being part of the story from the beginning, and while the Marshal's role in the denouement, with hindsight, is clearly set up in a number of early scenes, it still somehow feels rather contrived. The total lack of bloodshed in the one criminal act we see Quirt commit on-screen, while it can be explained away as a sign of Penelope's continuing influence, seems rather forced for the convenience of the plot.In general I felt the whole structure of the finale felt rushed - and the 'miracle' very much a deus ex machina device which wasn't even really necessary to the plot. Penelope is suddenly in danger, then as suddenly out of it, all within the span of about five minutes, with neither situation really given a chance to sink in. And one would expect Quirt to demonstrate at least a subconscious sense of responsibility for the situation, since without his presence none of it would have happened.Instead, the whole thing gives the impression of having been engineered as an excuse to push us suddenly into a traditional-style showdown, without any real emotional weight. Admittedly, the result of the showdown is totally unexpected. Admittedly, it has been skilfully set up beforehand. But somehow, for me at least, the second half of the film failed to involve me as closely with its characters as the first. 'The Angel and the Badman' is half-romance, half-Western - but half a Western isn't really enough to sustain the climax, though the basic structure is all there.As the depiction of the development of an unlikely romance, this is exquisitely done. Unfortunately, it is the would-be-dramatic elements that let the tension down, and prevent me from giving it a whole-hearted recommendation.

Charlize Theron is not one of my favorite actresses but if I see a few more of her movies and she lives up to her performance in this, its likely she will be.Sappy its not-I was wrong there as well. Its not too cheesy but enough romance to make me get misty-eyed. The ending (*not really a spoiler*) does NOT leave you feeling empty. I wouldn't even call it tragic.

Just as impressive, but more understated, the sign of artists fully coming into their own and confident in the key ingredients of their product.

Disguised as 'ethnic art film,' it's just mainstream, cliche, unoriginal, uninsightful drivel with lousy acting and terrible script.  Plain woman puts on makeup one day and is suddenly gorgeous vixen; she exchanges three lines of inane dialogue with man and suddenly they are in love.  Her family is a clan of unelaborated stereotypes, and behave in largely implausible ways; his family is absurdly unbelievable.  This movie is stupid.  Avoid at all costs.

Arguably one of the best dramatic actors of his generation, De Niro continues to try to prove himself as a comic actor in a parade of mediocre scripts (The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Meet the Parents, Analyze This, Showtime).  De Niro isn't a terrible comedian; he is just such a great dramatic actor that his comic ambitions seem pointless.  It is like Michael Jordan trying to play baseball.This script is a weak satire of reality cop shows and buddy cop flicks.  It is no coincidence that the director of this film is Tom Dey, whose only other directorial effort was `Shanghai Noon', a Jackie Chan vehicle where Jackie does a comic duet with Owen Wilson in a lampoon of westerns.  The hope was that Dey would be able to weave the same kind of satirical magic here, but this film comes up way short.  To his credit, he did manage to give the film some good action footage.   De Niro tries to play the straight man in an absurd situation and it seems like his is the only character that realizes the lunacy of it.  Everyone else seems to take their absurdity seriously.  The tongue in cheek comedy is way over the top.  Rene Russo, William Shattner and Eddie Murphy overact so terribly that it is more sad than funny.  As a footnote, Drena De Niro (Robert De Niro's adopted daughter), appears for the fifth time in a film with her dad as Annie, the assistant producer and Rene Russo's sidekick.The star power in this film was costly with a hefty budget over $85 Million and a box office of half that amount.  I rated it a 4\/10.  This one needs to gather dust on the rental shelves and De Niro needs to get back to serious acting.
