The expression saving the best for last applies strongly to this film. We were fortunate to have a Q&A after the film with Roger Rueff, the screenwriter of this eloquently written piece, John Swanbeck, the director enjoying all that a first timer could hope for from his debut, and the gifted actor Kevin Spacey, who starred in and produced the film.\tThis marvellous examination of three men of different age groups at a convention in Wichita also features the talents of Danny DeVito who apparently came to the production in the proverbial last minute. This film was shot in a very short sixteen days which comes as a surprise, despite it's one central location, as the dialogue is so strong. The best way to describe it is as almost poetic. The script was adapted from the play Hospitality Suite, also written by Rueff, who revealed in the Q&A that the story was based upon his own experiences at a sales convention long ago. But he assured us that his character of the young, impressionable, bible thumping Bob was not based on himself. Rueff also noted that with this being his first screenplay, he had worried about the horror stories he heard where scripts are butchered and transformed into things the writer never intended in many Hollywood productions. But in this case, he trusted the director and cast implicitly and was not disappointed in any way.\tKevin Spacey shines in this sneak peak behind the scenes of a sales convention where the future of a company lies squarely on the shoulders of three men in the pursuit of a big client.

They exchange stories, accounts and personal philosophies and find how different they are from one another based on what they've been through.\tThe interaction between the three actors is mesmerizing.

I thought for some time about what to say about this film, and realized that very little else would express my views.  This movie does have good special effects, and it is only due to that that it gets the one star out of ten that I would give it.  I can deal with movies that are supposed to be fun lacking brilliant cinematography or fantastic acting.  All that I ask is that the film live up to what it is meant to be.  In the case of The Haunting, that is a horror movie.  I swear to you that I am not exagerating when I say that the closest I came to having a frightened response to this film was one slight flexing of my right calf muscle in one scene of the movie.  It really wasn't a frightening scene - just startling.  My biggest beef with the movie is that it has all of the sterotypes and stupid audience grabbing devices that tend to piss me off.  An example  Catherine Zeta-Jones has several incredibly heavy-handed lines that hint at her bisexuality.  Message, hey adolescent boys, this character might hook up with another woman.

I have always had the opinion that most acting from the 60's and earlier is one dimensional and flat.  But then I saw this film and I realized that I was watching two of the best, from any era.  Fonda and Hepburn are absolutely stunning in here and they so richly deserved to win their Oscars that year.  And not only am I mad to see that Chariots of Fire beat out Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it also beat this film out as best picture, and that is a shame, and a crime.On Golden Pond reminded me a little of my relationship with my grandfather.  It's not that we didn't get along because we did, but at times it was a little strained simply because of the age difference.  But Billy soon learns that Norman Thayer Jr. is not just an old man, but he is a guy that has a lot say and he can offer him so much and of course they become friends.  So we all know how the movie is going to end up, but it is the execution that is the strength of the film.  We watch as these two grow together.  We sense that they are becoming more at ease with each other and when we finally see our two guys catch that guarantuan fish named Walter, by this time we are pretty much sure what they are going to do.  And it's kind of funny to draw parallels between Walter the fish, and Norman the crusty old man.  But both have been around the pond for years.  Norman's life wouldn't be the same if his quest for the fish was never there.  Perhaps the same with Walter, perhaps he has enjoyed alluding Norman for all these years.

And what movie is more true to its genre than Star Trek Insurrection, a film that I highly recommend to people who like Star Trek, but also to individuals who like a smart script and interesting characters; this is not a movie in which you have to be a member of the trekkie club to enjoy-I know this because I'm not one. Watching it with an open mind should be enough.The story is little complicated to explain if you're not familiar with the baseline of events that have propelled the many years of productions. To make a long story short, it takes place in the future. Massive space vessels house the members of elite teams to promote world peace, sort of. There are good and bad guys. The ship in focus in Star Trek Insurrection is called the Enterprise, with a crew including Commander Geordi LaForge (LeVar Burton), Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Captain Jean-Luc Picard.The plot basically involves one individual planet located in the middle of space. It apparently holds the beloved galaxy mixture that produces eternal youth. The planets' inhabitants are humble and kind, but when the film's villain comes along lusting for revenge to solve past conflicts, it is up to the Enterprise and her crew to save the day for the 600 innocent pedestrians who have been living happily in this world for several hundred years.The film starts out with a pretty solid story, and a relatively interesting though-line of events that connect to each other--and continues its success throughout the production. Although there are few comic elements here and there, Star Trek Insurrection takes itself seriously. It doesn't go over the top with anything, including visual effects. The story has some depth to it, perhaps even enough to interest the anti-science fiction folks as well as the trekkies.The dialogue is smart and focused. The characters stay on task, without too many interruptions distracting them. It does, however, explain some of the plot to us, instead of showing the audience with actions and events. But even then, it keeps us informed on the many confusions accruing in the film.The performances are good, but not great. There isn't a strong supporting cast here, or at least one with major significance. Patrick Stewart comes off as a little overwrought, although I did like his performance. Jonathan Frakes, who also directs this film, is a little different in character here. I suppose you could call him the villain, but not really. See the film, then you'll understand what I mean.The special effects in Star Trek Insurrection aren't anything special, and to some extent, a bit disappointing. The space ships are pervasive and good looking, but not awe-inspiring. There are a few neat explosions and laser wars that are realistic--and the makeup effects are, as always, perplexing. But overall, although the plot is solid, Jonathan Franks focuses a little too much on story here, and not enough on one of the main traditional reasons that many people will see this film for special effects.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.

For a long time I couldn't figure out why I didn't like this movie as much as some of Chow Yun-Fat's earlier work. Unlike many, I enjoyed The Replacement Killers, and I was looking forward to this one, his second American effort. Upon seeing it for a second time, I think I have it figured out.The classic Chow\/Woo collaborations that came out of Hong Kong in the late '80s and early '90s worked so well because the storylines were fairly simple, and the emphasis was on mind-blowing action. Themes such as brotherhood, loyalty and redemption were strongly emphasized. In short, they were myths. And they worked exceptionally well.Then, when all the Asian stars came to Hollywood, starting with Jackie Chan and followed by Chow, Woo, Jet Li, etc. this classic formula was imitated, but American film makers just haven't got it right yet. The Replacement Killers tried, and I think succeeded in a limited sense. The action was good, but Chow's acting ability was not fully used. Still, it stayed successfully away from the American phenomenon. Too often, American film makers take successful film concepts, then throw a bunch of sex and profanity in, seemingly at random, to make it grittier, or more realistic. Unfortunately, this just makes a good concept confused and reduces its impact. The Replacement Killers remained focused on action at all times and thus succeeded to a point.Other times one genre is unsuccessfully grafted on to another. Thus we have The Corruptor. It takes the Hong Kong heroic bloodshed, format and for some reason tries to make it into L.A. Confidential. The excessive violence so popular in the HK films seems out of place and gratuitous here, because it is presented in the same context and the same world as where illegal immigrants are tortured and killed and corruption works its way throughout the NYPD. Somehow, both legitimate genres are denigrated as a result. The action seems anemic if you take the movie as heroic bloodshed, and if it's taken as film noir, the violence seems unrealistic and stupid. So it fails on both accounts.Still, its great to see Chow acting in an American movie, and he has an undeniable screen presence here, as always, while Wahlberg is competent enough and the supporting cast is pretty good.So, to summarize The story is a little too convoluted and remains somewhat unconvincing; the action, such as it is, is good, especially the chase scene, but doesn't work in context because it is presented in a framework of gritty realism. Finally, at the end of the movie, there seems to be no clear point to the film; unlike with the HK films, the viewer is left with no understanding of what the whole thing was really about. Add to that the rather unsympathetic main characters, who more often than not come across as pathetic losers than anti-heroes, and the movie really doesn't work.Rating 6.8\/10, but it would be less if it didn't have Chow Yun-Fat, my favourite actor, who does his best to try and save the film.

Finally, at the end of the movie, there seems to be no clear point to the film; unlike with the HK films, the viewer is left with no understanding of what the whole thing was really about. Add to that the rather unsympathetic main characters, who more often than not come across as pathetic losers than anti-heroes, and the movie really doesn't work.Rating 6.8\/10, but it would be less if it didn't have Chow Yun-Fat, my favourite actor, who does his best to try and save the film. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"21 September 1999","score":"","review":"  The Corruptor is a movie that can't quite decide what it wants to be. For a long time I couldn't figure out why I didn't like this movie as much as some of Chow Yun-Fat's earlier work. Unlike many, I enjoyed The Replacement Killers, and I was looking forward to this one, his second American effort. Upon seeing it for a second time, I think I have it figured out.The classic Chow\/Woo collaborations that came out of Hong Kong in the late '80s and early '90s worked so well because the storylines were fairly simple, and the emphasis was on mind-blowing action. Themes such as brotherhood, loyalty and redemption were strongly emphasized. In short, they were myths. And they worked exceptionally well.Then, when all the Asian stars came to Hollywood, starting with Jackie Chan and followed by Chow, Woo, Jet Li, etc. this classic formula was imitated, but American film makers just haven't got it right yet. The Replacement Killers tried, and I think succeeded in a limited sense. The action was good, but Chow's acting ability was not fully used. Still, it stayed successfully away from the American phenomenon. Too often, American film makers take successful film concepts, then throw a bunch of sex and profanity in, seemingly at random, to make it grittier, or more realistic. Unfortunately, this just makes a good concept confused and reduces its impact. The Replacement Killers remained focused on action at all times and thus succeeded to a point.Other times one genre is unsuccessfully grafted on to another. Thus we have The Corruptor. It takes the Hong Kong heroic bloodshed, format and for some reason tries to make it into L.A. Confidential. The excessive violence so popular in the HK films seems out of place and gratuitous here, because it is presented in the same context and the same world as where illegal immigrants are tortured and killed and corruption works its way throughout the NYPD. Somehow, both legitimate genres are denigrated as a result. The action seems anemic if you take the movie as heroic bloodshed, and if it's taken as film noir, the violence seems unrealistic and stupid. So it fails on both accounts.Still, its great to see Chow acting in an American movie, and he has an undeniable screen presence here, as always, while Wahlberg is competent enough and the supporting cast is pretty good.So, to summarize The story is a little too convoluted and remains somewhat unconvincing; the action, such as it is, is good, especially the chase scene, but doesn't work in context because it is presented in a framework of gritty realism.

It really was Pretty Woman again; not in the sense that the story was the same but that it was a romantic fairy tale. I've read the previous comments and they are nearly all correct (whether you like the film or not).No it certainly lacked some of the freshness and sparkle of P.W. but P.W. was just soooo good. You certainly can't help but love the chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, echoes of Hepburn\/Tracey. The film is full of cliches , not just the dialogue but the sets, the characters , the music but isn't that what good comedy is? You know what's coming and you laugh even before the punch line! My wife and I are both romantics so we are predisposed to like this kind of movie and like it we did ,a lot.Its not the greatest movie ever made but then not many movies are, in that context but well worth seeing.
