[{"date":"12 June 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Magnolia is one of those films that you simply adore or despise. There is no in between, and to answer the detractors that protest about the length of this film (3 hours, 6 minutes), the only reply I can give is that sometimes it takes a while to tell a good and solid story, which Magnolia is.The movie takes place over one day in California, telling the stories of nine individuals over the course of that day. The stories slowly interweave into one linear, understandable tale and the performances, particularly Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Cruise (in probably his best role to date, against type as a testosterone-pumped self help guru) are consummate and superlative. I won't reveal any plot details because it would truly spoil the joy of becoming drawn in to this tale.What makes this movie stand out from its contemporaries, in my humble opinion, is the soundtrack. Aimee Mann's songs not only punctuate the plot but they have a life of their own and in songs such as Wise Up and Save Me, the honesty of both the story and the music become apparent.The final nod must go to Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote and directed Magnolia. Where Boogie Nights was more of a modern American fable, Magnolia is realistic and deals with everyday emotions and situations that we all go through and Anderson handles the subject matter with sensitivity and care.All in all, if like me you are able to completely lose yourself in an engaging and enjoyable story, then this movie is highly recommended. 9 out of 10.
