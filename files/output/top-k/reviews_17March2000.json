It's been used as the yardstick to measure any movie attempting a critique of media or politics (Bulworth, Mad City, Wag the Dog - even The Truman Show). Well, I say - Enough already! I've seen this film and, while it's certainly not bad (and makes a decent enough rental), it's not the monumental satire everyone claims it to be. I was about to say that it has dated, but I don't think that's it; even if I'd seen this in 1976, I don't think it would have convinced me. Here's some of my reasons (NOTE - spoilers ahead)1) It's extremely wordy; characters speechify to an almost baroque degree. These speeches are well written (actually, EXTREMELY well-written - anyone who thrills to the sound of language will have a good time here) but they make for a static film, and they also call too much attention to the skill of the writer. I kept feeling throughout that the script would make for a better stage play than a movie. It just doesn't seem aware of or interested in the visual possibilities of film; with a subject like television, which is so inherently visual, that's kind of a problem. 2) Howard Beale is a totally unbelievable character - but what's far worse, he's charmless; watching the movie, I couldn't imagine anyone falling under his spell. He's not entertaining (the first thing you must be to make it on TV) he's just preachy and loud - his style might work well as a televangelist (where guilt is understood to be built in to the audience) but he'd never make it in a sphere where people expect to be entertained. And he'd certainly never achieve such fame on TV by DEBUNKING TV! That conceit is just a pipe dream by the author. Furthermore, the actor playing the role is totally wooden when he gets mad as hell it should be a triumphant scene (madness, rage, and absurdity coalescing) but instead it just looks stupid3) The best character in the movie is Faye Dunaway. In addition to being totally hot, her producer character is so monolithically focused it's frightening and hysterical at the same time (film's subtlest gag her on-going commentary concerning her network programming decisions during her date and sex scene with William Holden - it's like, even amidst intimate situations, she just cannot talk about anything else but TV). The center of the film should have been her dealings with the Black Panther-like group to get them airtime; that's a genuinely funny and biting concept (the revolution WILL BE televised) - but it's just presented as atmosphere, rather than as a follow-through plot point.4) The affair between Dunaway and Holden is completely unbelievable from start to finish. Ok, we can buy that he's sexually attracted to her, but her ideals and personality are so antithetical to everything he stands for that no way can we imagine him wanting anything more from her than one roll in the sack - and since (in a brilliant conceit) the film makes her such a lousy lay, we're left to wonder what he stays with her for. Because of this, his big kiss-off speech to her, though well-written (natch), has no impact and is in fact embarrassing because he should never have been with her in the first place (and he ends up inadvertently looking worse than she does; at least she knows what she wants and pursues her goals single-mindedly and forcefully, while he waffles and sells out his ideals in even being with her).Still, some might argue, for 1976 Network was a very bold and groundbreaking statement against television - nothing else like it was being done. In movies, I suppose that's true, but a year previous, the original Saturday Night Live went on air and I think *it* represents the first true assault of the form. The original seasons of SNL (as well as its Canadian cousin, SCTV) were far more successful at lampooning the conventions of television than Network was - precisely because they were doing it from the *inside*, as a group of writers and performers who had grown up watching it. This gave their satire two distinct advantages first, their knowledge allowed them greater authenticity in the look and feel of actual programming (something Network has no clue about). Also, and perhaps more importantly, they recognized the allure and power of television, as well as the falseness; Network just captures the falseness - as such, it runs with only half the equation it's like those anti-drug campaigns that tell you drugs are not fun. Well, come on don't lie - drugs (and television) may be dangerous, socially disruptive, etc. - but they ARE fun! Or at least they fill some need. Not to reckon with that is to remove all credibility from your presentation.  Like I said, though, it's a decent rental.

Even though this movie was filmed three years later than the first, great editing and acting (especially by Jamie Lee Curtis) made it look like it all took place on Halloween Night in 1978.  What you see at the beginning is the actual end of Halloween, then when Dr. Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) comes out of the house (don't want to ruin it for anyone) is when they started filming for Halloween II.Michael Myers, a psychopathic killer, has followed his target, Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis)to the hospital immediately after he tried to attack her.  This movie brings on a new cast considering it takes place in a hospital.  There is Nurse Karen (played by Pamela Susan Shoop) who, I think, has the most gruesome death of all,  Jimmy,(played by Lance Guest) who is a paramedic and likes Laurie, Budd who is a real jerk, along with people from the first Halloween.  Annie, Laurie's friend (played by Nancy Loomis) reprises her role, but only for a few seconds, Sherrif Brackett (played by Charles Cyphers) still helps Dr. Loomis track down Michael, Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens)is back and is the nurse that tried to transport Michael to a different ward in the first one and tells a horrifying secret to Dr. Loomis about Laurie and her connection to Michael, which explains why he's after her.This film has more gore than the first, or shall I say just has gore (the first one didn't) but it is ok, not too groes, and the score is very good, which is once again performed and written by John Carpenter.  He has re-recorded all the songs from the first movie and has put even more synthesized tones in them.  This includes Halloween-Main Theme, Laurie's Theme, and the rest.

The first 20-30 minutes are just plain boring and there are a lot more boring parts to this movie. But besides, quick pacing it does have other shining points.  Some of the cast delivers.  Vanessa Redgrave is great as Max, the crime boss that wants the NOC list.  Her first scene with Tom Cruise is very well done and humorous.  It's a shame she wasn't in more of the movie.  Tom Cruise is good as Ethan Hunt from when he meets Max to the end of the movie.  For the first half hour, he was just awful. And that crew cut just looks awful on him.  Very distracting.  Ving Rhames adds another good performance into the pile, though he hasn't much to do, he does well with what he has.  The rest of the cast is very mediocre.The 2 only action sequences are thankfully fantastic.  The first is in IMF HQ in Langley, VA where Hunt tries to obtain the NOC list is very suspenseful as he has to pass 3 security systems to obtain the NOC list.

Ethan Hawke proves centuries of theatre critics and historians wrong.  Before the SXSW screening, the director was quick to point out the most common question asked of him was Why another Hamlet?  His response was that hopefully the film would speak for itself and answer that very question.  Sadly it did not.This HAMLET tries a little too hard, is little too self conscious about being cool and looking slick.  Now I must confess many things about the film were original and inventive, for example The decision to present the Mousetrap as film\/video produced by HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK, was very inventive and led out of a Hamlet who was obsessed with the narcissistic pleasure of videotaping himself. Likewise, Hawke watching James Dean in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE before the O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I, speech was a nice touch.  This was fantastic - the original angry young man trying to communicate with the modern angry young man, but there wasn't enough of these moments.When producing Shakespeare there are some standard questions that inform and influence production. Hamlet most often is defined by the cutting of the script.  Conversely productions which do not cut the play and present Hamlet in its entirety (or Hamlet in its eternity, as Gielgud called it), also define the production.  Nothing defines this production, the text that is cut and rearranged, feels times arbitrary, capricious and random - something thrown together because this would be a cool idea, rather than this makes sense for the story or Hamlet.And that leads me to the biggest problem with the film Ethan Hawke. He comes off so unlikable and so un-charasmatic that ultimately NO ONE CARES. My God!  Hawke was more concerned with conveying grunge-cool while he opened a beer bottle for Ophelia in the nunnery scene than he was in really letting the audience know what is going on with an ambiguous line like I never gave you aught.To me, what makes Shakespeare the greatest writer in our western culture is his use of ambiguity and contractions along with irony.  Human Beings are by our nature ambiguous, difficult to define - just when you think you have someone pegged, they do something completely different and unexpected.  All of his characters are this way. Likewise the use of irony is rampant through out all of Shakespeare.  There is a reason that Falstaff is perhaps Shakespeare's saddest creation and Hamlet maybe his funniest.  Americans are not good with irony - we are very good and very effective with sarcasm, but not irony.  Think about it - ask yourself if you even know the difference between sarcasm and irony.  Shakespeare does and he uses it in all of his plays.  Hawke doesn't.  In fact Hawke comes off like the sort of poseur rich kid spoiled by fame that his Hamlet is trying to rail against.To an Elizabethan audience when they looked at Hamlet they would have seen a Prince who was cheated out of his crown, they would a have seen a man who should be king.  This is a difficult frame of mind for us in America to even contemplate - we have no context for monarchy.  So what most often happens in American productions of the play is that HAMLET becomes a domestic drama, a simple conflict between mother, son, step-father\/uncle.  But this is wrong and ignores a giant element of the play.  At no point in this film did I believe that Ethan Hawke was ready and willing to become CEO of the DENMARK CORPORATION.  He was just a sort of artsy-fartsy college student with some Euro-trash friends (Horatio and Marcellus), more concerned with his video equipment and looking good while he was riding a motorcycle or at a chic club with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, than a man who was concerned that his uncle had popped between the election and my hopes.When Mel Gibson played the part there was some criticism of such a large Hollywood star doing the role, but that is exactly what Hamlet needs - star quality - of which Hawke has none.

They took us to Falmouth on Cape Cod to a place called Highfield, the summer home of the Oberlin College Players. They specialized in G&S and other light operettas.I learned to appreciate G&S, but I never became a fanatical devotee, even with the historical context patiently explained to me by my friend's mom. (It was similar with Shakespeare. The language could be a barrier rather than a gateway.)The audience in the theater where I saw Topsy-Turvy was filled with devotees. You could hear their delight as they viewed the actual performances of Gilbert & Sullivan's work in the film. The director, Mike Leigh, through skillful editing and camera work, does an excellent job of photographing a stage presentation, certainly one of the best I've ever seen on film. He uses closeups, and though the actors are using an exaggerated, theatrical style, somehow the G&S material has never been clearer to me; and I've seen at least a dozen G&S performances, including two D'Oyle Carte productions (Pirates and The Mikado), the present-day descendant company of the Savoy Theater depicted in the film. People who have never seen G&S before will appreciate their work here.Most of all, the film is very much about the highly contrasting personalities of William S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, the former emotionally restrained, the latter a hedonist. Leigh allows us to get to know them quite well and a host of other characters too, though G&S are first among equals in this excellent, ensemble cast. Among the supporting players, I found Shirley Henderson to be increasingly interesting as the film progressed, and I felt rewarded when she was the central character in the last two scenes of the film.The period settings, manners, and speech are very accurate and detailed. As presented here, the Victorian era seems physically stifling, with people leading their lives in the close quarters of dressing rooms, offices, restaurants, living rooms, and bedrooms. Even more stifling is the emotional inhibition masked by correctly blustery forthrightness. Toward the end of the film, there's a revealing and poignant scene between Gilbert and his wife which makes this all very clear, and what also becomes clear is how important theatrical presentations were to people then as a means of expressing themselves in a culture which sanctioned few quarters to do so. It's one of the best examples of Mike Leigh's direction.The G&S operettas were, of course, a commentary on Victorian times. In the film, you can see why they were so wildly popular. In that period, I think so many people were so restrained and distant from their own feelings that even the, to us, mannered and wordy G&S operettas were a breath of fresh air in Victorian England. The few occasions when Leigh breaks out of consistently claustrophobic medium shots and closeups are when he gives us a wide view of the full, theatrical stage.Topsy-Turvy is about how Gilbert and Sullivan refracted Victorian England through a proscenium arch. Mike Leigh refracts it again through the camera lens in a way that allows us to see ourselves in our times by looking at G&S and their operettas in theirs. This is a long film (over two and one half hours), and given the subject matter, not to everyone's interest, though it's far more than the specifics of the period and the material. I found it to be my favorite film of the year thus far, and I highly recommend it.

He uses closeups, and though the actors are using an exaggerated, theatrical style, somehow the G&S material has never been clearer to me; and I've seen at least a dozen G&S performances, including two D'Oyle Carte productions (Pirates and The Mikado), the present-day descendant company of the Savoy Theater depicted in the film. People who have never seen G&S before will appreciate their work here.Most of all, the film is very much about the highly contrasting personalities of William S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, the former emotionally restrained, the latter a hedonist. Leigh allows us to get to know them quite well and a host of other characters too, though G&S are first among equals in this excellent, ensemble cast. Among the supporting players, I found Shirley Henderson to be increasingly interesting as the film progressed, and I felt rewarded when she was the central character in the last two scenes of the film.The period settings, manners, and speech are very accurate and detailed. As presented here, the Victorian era seems physically stifling, with people leading their lives in the close quarters of dressing rooms, offices, restaurants, living rooms, and bedrooms. Even more stifling is the emotional inhibition masked by correctly blustery forthrightness. Toward the end of the film, there's a revealing and poignant scene between Gilbert and his wife which makes this all very clear, and what also becomes clear is how important theatrical presentations were to people then as a means of expressing themselves in a culture which sanctioned few quarters to do so. It's one of the best examples of Mike Leigh's direction.The G&S operettas were, of course, a commentary on Victorian times. In the film, you can see why they were so wildly popular. In that period, I think so many people were so restrained and distant from their own feelings that even the, to us, mannered and wordy G&S operettas were a breath of fresh air in Victorian England. The few occasions when Leigh breaks out of consistently claustrophobic medium shots and closeups are when he gives us a wide view of the full, theatrical stage.Topsy-Turvy is about how Gilbert and Sullivan refracted Victorian England through a proscenium arch. Mike Leigh refracts it again through the camera lens in a way that allows us to see ourselves in our times by looking at G&S and their operettas in theirs. This is a long film (over two and one half hours), and given the subject matter, not to everyone's interest, though it's far more than the specifics of the period and the material.

They took us to Falmouth on Cape Cod to a place called Highfield, the summer home of the Oberlin College Players. They specialized in G&S and other light operettas.I learned to appreciate G&S, but I never became a fanatical devotee, even with the historical context patiently explained to me by my friend's mom.

The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure genius.  The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an entire orchestra.That being said, the script can only be described as grossly disappointing.  There were really two stories here.  The first is the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller.  The elements were there for a good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in `who cares'.  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which left the film pointless.Other than her ability to provide sexy set dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet, this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is not without talent and has given us some excellent performances (`Malice'; `Dead Calm').   Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines, one would have thought she was aphasic.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since `Born On The Fourth of July'.  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to the challenge of this character's complexity.I gave this film a 7\/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking about that right now.

Rated R (for contorted sexual situations, sexually explicit dialogue including language, and some drug content).\tCruel Intentions is as fiendishly sleazy as movies now days come. The film begins introducing us to a lurid sex plot and gradually becomes more earthly. The main character is Sebastian Valmont, played accurately by Ryan Phillippe. His character is as close to being a gigolo as people otherwise come--without pay but earning more self respect for each girl he beds. Sebastian, rich and wicked, lives in a mansion in modern day Manhattan with his stepsister Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Together they run a prep school in their house.The film's opening scene develops Sebastian in a relative and accurate manor. He has just seduced the daughter of his psychiatrist, Dr. Greenbaum (Swoosie Kurtz). As he calmly trots out of her office, he keenly picks up another bimbo who kindly greets him. As he returns to his house, the movie has even more fun developing Kathryn. She has a new student in her prep school named Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair). This sheltered girl, daughter of the rich and snobbish Mrs. Caldwell (Christine Baranski), is the affection of Kathryn's ex-love interest. Keep your friends close--but keep your enemies closer states Kathryn in an enticing scene. Jealousy is the motive why Kathryn is in the midst of a cruel scandal to destroy Cecile's reputation. The proposition to seduce her is Sebastian's duty.Sebastian agrees to Kathryn's scheme, but is tired of having sex with so many easy targets, and imagines bigger fish to fry. His ambition is Annette (Reese Witherspoon), the virginal daughter of the new headmaster at their school, who has a strong will and believes in abstinence before marriage. Sebastian reads about her in Seventeen magazine in which she wrote an article. He lusts for challenge and conquest, and is proposed an offer by his stepsister If he can persuade Annette to engage in sexual activity with him, he will get his hands on Kathryn, the girl he has been lusting for ever since their parents became married. If he fails, his stepsister will receive his valuable classic automobile. \tThe story is introduced through dialogue, although in this context the film does not run into problems with this conduct. The first act is a bit short and to the point. Whereas the segment still accomplishes its duties appropriately, it could have easily been more progressive.A lot of Cruel Intentions is short and to the point-and that is not always a positive variable. Some of the film's characters are a bit too obvious. Much of that is due to the movie's stunningly direct usage of explicit sex-related dialogue (even though I share considerable gratitude towards the smart and tempting colloquy). Take the scene in which Cecile frankly describes the feelings of sex, for instance. Her vulnerability and gullibility for relationships is as conspicuous as any poorly crafted, modern day teenage sex movie. Cruel Intentions is one of the most stylish and visually lush movies of 1999. Each scene contains either snobbish characters, splendid costume and set design, a glamorous atmosphere, or solid substance. Contributing to the film's mood is the embellished soundtrack that consists of many tone settings and rhythmic melodies. My recommendation is mostly in part by the movie's elegance.     Although convincing and applicable, there is a large amount of characters present here, as well as numerous occurrences and subplots, all of which are not precisely focused on the two main possible outcomes. Either Kathryn will win Sebastian's prized car or Sebastian will win Kathryn's physical willingness. Since these are cruel intentions, we really have no one moral enough to root for except Annette. The Caldwells do not contribute much to the real story here, acting as a subplot that drifts further and further from focus as the movie progresses into the third act.The production is effective in its storytelling with many shapely characters and a risqué theme. However, when the persuasive story follows the effects of cupid's arrow on Sebastian, it turns from a devilishly intriguing tale into a misguided love saga.  Cruel Intentions does a complete 180 degrees turn from appetizing seduction and cruelty to formulaic passion--losing most of its sense of style. Perhaps this is the only method director and writer Roger Kumble could conclude with this trashy of a plot. Even if that was the case, however, what is this film's climatic sequence trying to prove?  Without giving the ending away, I will state that it is unpredictable, but also unsuccessful. The film concludes with more positive areas than negative, but with a second half like this, Roger Kumble truly must have had Cruel Intentions for teasing us with so much unrestrained allure--then holding out on us for a modern morality tale.

Keep your friends close--but keep your enemies closer states Kathryn in an enticing scene. Jealousy is the motive why Kathryn is in the midst of a cruel scandal to destroy Cecile's reputation. The proposition to seduce her is Sebastian's duty.Sebastian agrees to Kathryn's scheme, but is tired of having sex with so many easy targets, and imagines bigger fish to fry. His ambition is Annette (Reese Witherspoon), the virginal daughter of the new headmaster at their school, who has a strong will and believes in abstinence before marriage. Sebastian reads about her in Seventeen magazine in which she wrote an article. He lusts for challenge and conquest, and is proposed an offer by his stepsister If he can persuade Annette to engage in sexual activity with him, he will get his hands on Kathryn, the girl he has been lusting for ever since their parents became married. If he fails, his stepsister will receive his valuable classic automobile. \tThe story is introduced through dialogue, although in this context the film does not run into problems with this conduct. The first act is a bit short and to the point. Whereas the segment still accomplishes its duties appropriately, it could have easily been more progressive.A lot of Cruel Intentions is short and to the point-and that is not always a positive variable. Some of the film's characters are a bit too obvious. Much of that is due to the movie's stunningly direct usage of explicit sex-related dialogue (even though I share considerable gratitude towards the smart and tempting colloquy). Take the scene in which Cecile frankly describes the feelings of sex, for instance. Her vulnerability and gullibility for relationships is as conspicuous as any poorly crafted, modern day teenage sex movie. Cruel Intentions is one of the most stylish and visually lush movies of 1999. Each scene contains either snobbish characters, splendid costume and set design, a glamorous atmosphere, or solid substance. Contributing to the film's mood is the embellished soundtrack that consists of many tone settings and rhythmic melodies. My recommendation is mostly in part by the movie's elegance.     Although convincing and applicable, there is a large amount of characters present here, as well as numerous occurrences and subplots, all of which are not precisely focused on the two main possible outcomes. Either Kathryn will win Sebastian's prized car or Sebastian will win Kathryn's physical willingness. Since these are cruel intentions, we really have no one moral enough to root for except Annette. The Caldwells do not contribute much to the real story here, acting as a subplot that drifts further and further from focus as the movie progresses into the third act.The production is effective in its storytelling with many shapely characters and a risqué theme. However, when the persuasive story follows the effects of cupid's arrow on Sebastian, it turns from a devilishly intriguing tale into a misguided love saga.  Cruel Intentions does a complete 180 degrees turn from appetizing seduction and cruelty to formulaic passion--losing most of its sense of style. Perhaps this is the only method director and writer Roger Kumble could conclude with this trashy of a plot. Even if that was the case, however, what is this film's climatic sequence trying to prove?  Without giving the ending away, I will state that it is unpredictable, but also unsuccessful. The film concludes with more positive areas than negative, but with a second half like this, Roger Kumble truly must have had Cruel Intentions for teasing us with so much unrestrained allure--then holding out on us for a modern morality tale.

Julia Roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in U.S. history. She would've stole every scene if it wasn't for her co-star Albert Finney who matches her for every point\/counterpoint. He plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight.  Although her box office says otherwise I've always thought Roberts was way overrated as a movie star. Now I'm a believer. She is smart, sassy, foul-mouthed, fiery, sensitive, funny and, of course, very sexy. It is one of best performances I've ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy from Bull Durham in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal. (Of course Annie Savoy is purely fictional whereas Erin Brockovich is not.) I sense that her character may appeal more to men than women (her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film).  The reviews I've read have been excellent, but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well. Finney's work is more nuanced than Roberts' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions. Aaron Eckhardt deserves mention too as Roberts' good guy biker boyfriend.  These performances are made possible by a superb script from Susannah Grant. Her fact-based tale of a small (hick) town poisoned by a giant utility has Rocky-like satisfactions in it and they feel all earned. The fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings.  Director Steven Soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated Out Of Sight. This is an adult movie in the very best sense of that term.  Erin Brockovich is definitely a big Hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it. It also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly.

While they were at one time the top comedy team in films, both had personal problems (Lou's infant son drowned in his backyard pool, Bud had continuing problems with epilepsy) and had also had a very public falling out; they had gotten to the point where their characters in their films seldom appeared together (The Time of Their Lives, Little Giant, for example), and they didn't speak to each other offstage.

That combination, along with a good script and a director (Charles Barton) that A&C had previously worked for and respected, resulted in not only the team's best film, but one of the few horror spoofs that actually works in both genres.In their first group of films in the early '40s, Bud & Lou's chemistry was undeniable; their timing was flawless, and they played off each other like a well-oiled machine, which is exactly what they were.

Standing above all the great performances was a Japanese actor portraying a shot-down, highly competent, captured Japanese Zero pilot. While racism understandably raises its ugly head during wartime, with epithets and insults hurled in both directions, in fact this Japanese actor portrayed a Japanese warrior at his finest--someone whom Japanese viewers would be proud of. Played equally well were American military personnel, including some Marines. One of the candid themes of the movie is the tragedy of such fine people going to war against each other, whatever their race.The film is undeniably top drawer, far more mature than than Top Gun, with even better flying scenes. So I've often wondered why it isn't widely known and not kept in stock in widescreen format. Perhaps the answer is today's wimpy trend towards politically correct dialog. In one scene, Kirk Douglas refers to the captured Japanese pilot as a yellow bastard. In the video version, this was sanitized. However, sanitized or not, the original racial comment, by itself, may have doomed the film from greater video distribution.I saw the film when it came out in wide-screen format and saw it several times before it left town.

A couple of years later, I talked with a Navy fighter pilot and brought this up. He was very familiar with that scene and personally knew the pilot who flew the F-14 in the movie. He told me that the F-14 almost crashed in that scene, stalling while trying to fly too slow, diving for the ocean to pick up speed, and barely recovering just above the wave tops. This near-accident was caught on film and added immensely to the exhibition of flying skill. An exception had been granted to the Navy's policy of not allowing dissimilar aircraft to fly together in movie scenes. The result of that granted exception was almost the loss of an F-14.This is an incredibly good drama.

It's not even worth renting. I give it a 3 all on Depp's performance. The Ninth Gate, not worth watching on cable.

After less than impressive movies like Absolute Power(1997), and Midnight In The Garden Of Good & Evil(1997), he has finally done a film that is excellently done and an interesting one about the issues of the death penalty.  True Crime(1999) also gets some nice performances from character actors like James Woods and Denis Leary.  It is about a journalist who has to clear a man's name in order to prevent his date with destiny.True Crime(1999) deals with similar themes shown in The Green Mile(1999) like the negative aspects of the death penalty and the American Judical System.  This is the first film in which Clint Eastwood behaves like a person his own age.  It is a shame that True Crime was not nominated for a few Oscars including Best Picture as it is better then most of the movies nominated. This is another gem in the filmography of Clint Eastwood the director.

Namely anyone who said these characters and how they act is not believable.  Well let me tell you something.  I have lived a mere 17 years on this Earth and I have seen a lot things.  Many of which put the shocking behavior many have commented about in this film to shame.  I've seen things, heard things, done things that would make many sick to their stomachs.  And the truth is I'm bound to see and hear and do a lot more in life.  I'm a normal, middle-class, Suburban teen.  Still just like the movie much of my life same as anyone elses that I've encountered is just a commercial.  The truth is stranger than fiction.  And.  Fiction has to make sense, the truth doesn't.  Are two little phrases that come much to mind when I watched this movie and read many reviews.Okay maybe that wasn't short.  Still, my point is this.  American Beauty is very real blurring the lines between fact and fiction like no movie, no anything ever has done before.  While still remaining an art form with many deep and true messages for those willing to open their minds and accept them.  Who the hell said that the movies or TV couldn't teach you anything? Noone.  I loved it.  Since I saw it, since it made me think, I've been been in the best mood of my life.  It was beauty and exactly what I want when I go to see I movie.  To me it beats anything ever before by a long margin. I've watched well over a 1,000 movies in my time.  Well over 200 of which are on IMDB's top 250.  I love The Godfather, but to me American Beauty should and I believe soon will be number one.

It is clever, exciting, and funny and is shot in the middle of the breathtaking scenery of the American Southwest.  However, the thing that makes it special is its illustration of pure friendship.  It may be difficult for some men to cross the gender boundary and connect with Thelma and Louise, yet doing so is critical to appreciating the film.  If you can make the connection then you can get its message -- we all need a friendship like the one Thelma and Louise had.  This movie will strike a deep emotional chord.....if you aren't afraid to let it.  And if you happen to be too emotionally closed off to appreciate what I think the movie says about friendship I think that you will still enjoy the characters, acting, action, and humor.

Toby Mcguire, a rugged simplicity ; and Skeet Ulrich a unpredictable forcefulness to his part of Jack Bull Chiles. (Thanks Matt Damon for turning Skeet's part down. You never would have been as convincing.) The most overlooked asset to this film is the soundtrack. Hats off to Mychael Danna.  It's one thing to produce the compelling scores in Gettysburg  and Glory, but its quite another to incorporate grandeur with the simplicity of the period. (Edleman and Horner, take note.) This movie will not get the recognition it deserves, because it's not P.C. enough.  But if anyone will seek to learn more of the period by recognizing the horror that was poured out on our land for these 4 years, then this project will be well worth the effort.
