I could take my pick, but really I was never made to sit down by my parents or in school or other to watch it, and... screw the excuses, I wasn't sure about a 193 minute movie about astronauts as a kid. But now having seen it it's quite clear I was missing something fairly excellent in the cannon of the Bio-pic. It's one of those true compelling 20th century stories, and the filmmaker Philip Kaufman cares about all of these real guys so much that it moves right over into the cinematic treatment of the characters. And more impressively considering its ensemble there's almost a key character to the mix with Chuck Yeagher, the first man to break the sound barrier who never got into NASA with all the other go-for-broke test pilots, but did taste that rush up to the sky just once - and what a rush.This is film-making of a superlative caliber. It is such a story that is told extraordinarily because of how it takes itself seriously as a historical document, but never so much so as to get in a great joke - the kind of natural joking that people do, such as the few quips done by Yeagher in the cockpit to whoever was listening after breaking the sound barrier, which actually happened - or some sliver of satire to the mix. It pleases both as an emotional experience, one of those rousing and inspiring tales, and also at times intellectual. We see the lives of these guys, of Yeagher, Shepard, Glenn, Cooper, Grissom, and their wives too. The Right Stuff is a very human story, told with an approximate awe for the subject matter and an attitude that says we can be epic, but we can also point out the flaws that come around in human nature. There were so many obstacles that could have come, and sometimes did, for the folks at NASA, the scientists as well as the handful that were picked to do missions up into space in direct competition with America's foe the Russians, that all the astronauts could sometimes do would be to joke or give a hard-lined measure. We see some expected things like a big press conference, but we also see things that ring so true that they feel so real as minor events, like when the scientists are showing the astronauts the pod without a window or proper escape hatch and they all band together to put pressure on them to do it right or else the press will hear all hell (the wording in this scene is very good). The veneer of pure heroism is shown for what it is, as something of not always a tricky thing; the film was criticized by some of the original astronauts for the depiction of Gus Grissom (if only because Grissom had passed on in tragedy and couldn't do it himself), but his story of going into space, and the aftermath with his wife, is important to show for the story the film's trying to tell.That's one of the remarkable things in the Right Stuff, which is giving as much equal time and depth as possible to these guys, and their wives at other times. We see Dennis Quaid's cocky pilot saying he's the best their is, and then another where he suddenly becomes like 12 years old in front of the female doctor as she speaks\/laughs with his wife behind doors. We see Ed Harris' John Glenn as the supposed spokesperson of the group, the Dudley Do-Right as it were, but then the slightest bit of uncertainty - not to mention a really well told drama with his wife, who was a stutterer, and stood up against being pressured by Vice President Johnson. Little details all add up in the film, and even the ones that don't entirely work (i.e. the cut-aways to the aborigines during Glenn's flight up in space) still carry some worth as far as being filmed wonderfully or with a strange quality that makes it fun to watch - any other director might take out the crucial detail of Alan Shepard urinating in his suit before the very first successful launch of a US man into space, but it's left in, and stronger for it. And as far as just details with the characters go, all you need to see is the kind of simple but very strong representation of death in the man in the black suit and hat who has to pay call to those who've lost their husbands or fathers up in the sky. And, thankfully for such a long running time, we're given several moments in terms of the power of cinematic technique, of showing us the subjective perspective of what those who orbit the Earth see and the views outside the windows at so many countless miles up in the atmosphere. Basically any scene with Chuck Yeagher is one of these, especially early on but then also towards the end with his absolutely stunning bittersweet moment of going up to the sky and, well, nearly dying in a last-minute jump from the plane into flames. Kaufman takes the audience into these moments, and even just quiet or interesting ones with the actors, and imbues it all with just enough importance to level off the occasional goofiness he allows his character or in the choice of edits (watch as the chimps, being spin around in that big circular thing are cut with Glenn spinning around). That it's also one of those outstanding ensembles helps a great deal too.It's exciting and refreshingly bittersweet Hollywood cinema, and at the least of the must-see pictures of 1983.

Its great effects, acting, and plot all lead to it being so awesome.Using dna and genetics, dinosaurs are brought back to life. They are put into a giant park called Jurassic Park. The creator of this place calls in several people whom he hopes to convince that this is a good idea for a tour of the Park. However soon problems start to take place and dinosaurs start to make the people on the tour go extinct.The story is awesome in this film. Using dna and old amber, I could really see this happening. I know that it really could not but it really does seem to make sense in a way. In the past dinosaurs in films always seemed to be hiding in a place far away from humans only to be discovered. But I like that this film has a new unique idea on how to bring dinosaurs back. Of all the ways to bring dinosaurs into a film I think this works good.The characters and acting in this film are great as well. Sam Neil is great as the paleontologist Grant, one of the best performances by an actor that I have seen and also one of the most under rated performances of all time. Laura Dern is really good as Dr. Sattler. Also I loved Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm, another great character and performance. Goldblum is hilarious in this film. I will say that I think the two little kids in this film are really annoying, but then again I do not think I have ever seen a film where I liked every character.As good as the people in this film are, the dinosaurs are just as good. They look great, as good as it gets. The Tyrannosaurus is great, has a loud echoing roar and walks without his tail dragging and rather using it for balance. The scene where it breaks out of the electric fence is legendary and really exciting. Easily the best dinosaur in movie history in my opinion.The star dinosaur in this film though is the Velociraptor. For a long time in films the predatory dinosaur was always either the Tyrannosaurus or the Allosaurus, large predatory dinosaurs with power. But Velociraptor in this film instead depends on speed and intelligence as well as sharp teeth, claws, and working in groups. SO this film does great at giving a new predatory dinosaur to the viewing audience. Kind of cool how the smaller Velociraptor can be just as scary as the larger Tyrannosaurus.Another thing I thought was cool was the Dilophosaurus. A really not well known dinosaur, but this film helps people to see it. Pretty interesting how it has a frill pop up from its neck and can spit venom.There are tons of great scenes in this film. You will have to see most of them to understand how great they are. I do not want to spoil it for anyone.The music is awesome as well.SO this film has it all, great acting, plot, action, and most importantly Dinosaurs.

I just didn't believe it could be worth the effort, I was tired of being burned by early-90's low-rent horror sludge.Castle Freak is a legit feature...sorta. It's shot on film, it has real actors and locations, but still suffers the trappings of a low budget...the sets are underwhelming and nothing much happens. And that's one of two major beefs I had with this movie.1) Nothing much happens, and what does transpire is old news...there's a Thing in the cellar and before we dispatch with it there's a modicum of bloodletting and screaming. Meanwhile we have to sit through a healthy heap of tedium concerning the domestic problems of a small family. Despite the presence of some good B-movie actors these scenes seem superfluous to the action...which we never quite get to, except...2) When it does happen, it's outrageously repulsive. Not the most offensive thing you've ever seen it's just...this movie is just really icky! Out of nowhere there are a couple of things that transpire that include naughty bits that are just...unpleasant, and not in the fun way. I wasn't so much offended or caught in that so-gross-it's-fun mode as just...well, sorry I had to bear witness to it--and the effects weren't even that well done. It's just...the sight of the Freak and what he does to his victim is just...blecchy! And it's so completely out of touch with the rest of the movie, which is very USA Up All Night, back when that show was on. It's really weird to see an average little quirky B-film with this kind of grue in it. I'm glad they went there, actually, I just wish the film would've either sustained\/accelerated it (as Gordon did so well in Re-Animator) or not even gone there to begin with.It's not bad, really it isn't...what's good about it is great--the castle, the final fight, the mysterious Italian village aura and the compelling idea of what exactly the Freak is all about.

It is no wonder, why it was obliterated by Empire Strikes Back that year. But this film never steers off course of its intention which is to hand you a tongue and cheek farce of science fiction films using the most popular and imaginative sci-fi icon from the past, Flash. And in all honesty to do a realistic Flash Gordon would probably come out boring or incredibly lame. So Flash Gordon, like Dick Tracy, a decade later, decided to have as much fun in the comic strip sense of visual gags, quirky characters, and a silly plot that let good and evil play around with a lot of effects and top it off with a rock show to bring it into the era of arena rock. You may not like this film as more serious minded people do, like the ones who mistakes the Dark Knight as riveting drama, and you may think this film is pure corn and dismiss it. But if you can't understand the purpose of the film simply to have a lot of fun with lasers and rock and roll then I suggest you go and find a good science fiction film that explores the role of politics in a galactic society...you know like...Attack of the Clones.

Put in a great story under an excellent premise, beautiful scenery, one tough guy anti-hero, memorable and colorful characters, and finally some of the most exhilarating and kinetic stunt-filled action sequences ever, and you get The Road Warrior, certainly an action masterpiece that should be deserving of its recognition.Following where the first Mad Max (another great film) picks up, the audience is immediately thrust into a post-apocalyptic world, where petrol is scarce and chaos literally runs the highway. Enter a colony whose desire is to escape this hell and start a new life anew, and a lone hero who reluctantly assists them in their journey.While the story may not sound like original material, it is superbly thought out and written. The less talk and more action approach gives lots of moments of suspense, tension, and, breathlessness. But the script was not just written in a simple manner, there are moments of intelligence that you may miss and may notice when you watch it more than once. This is a carefully thought out story, and I give props to Miller, and fellow writers Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant to creating this more-than-worthy follow up story to Mad Max.Mel Gibson reprises his role as Max. Inspired by the likes of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name character, Gibson gives a tough-guy performance that gives Max a like-able and root-able characterization that we support. Gibson mad Max into his own character, and not just some imitation, and that makes the film even better. Other characters worth mentioning are the Gyro Captain, Max's like-able sidekick, Pappagallo, the steadfast leader of the colony, the feral kid who never speaks (great acting from the then-youngster), and finally the truly cold-blooded, brutal, and ultimately insanely colorful villains Wez, played by Vernon Let-off-some-steam-Bennett Wells sporting a ridiculously outrageous outfit and hairdo, delivers a deliberately over-the-top performance to positive effects - we hate the bad guy; and Lord Humongous, the big sized, hockey-mask wearing leader of the baddies, who is brutal and ruthless in his quest to get the petrol (did he really inspire Jason Voorhees' inception?). And it's not just them, but all the bad guys, who were born to be wild, and they pull it off.Miller's lively and incredibly frenetic direction is what gives the action scenes the extra factor they need. Seriously, to describe the action sequences in full detail would not do it justice. See it for yourself, and judge. I've heard a lot of people praising the action; masterfully thrilling, startling, original, explosive, spectacular, breathtaking, painful (in a good way), brutal....the list goes on. But the word I would pick for the action...flawless. Absolutely flawless. Especially for the last 20 minutes.... If you want a seemingly straightforward action film this would be your new favorite. Best of all, there is not a single shred of that darned CGI in the whole movie. People the stunts you see on the screen are genuinely filmed FOR REAL. Two stunt-men nearly lost their lives during filming - keep that in mind while watching, because you'll eventually know why - and how. This is how Hollywood should do their action movies, raw and ruthless, not some CGI laden crap-fest. If there ever was a book on how to make great, solid action movies, this should be at best near, if not at the top of the examples list. Other factors contributing to the action on the screen; Dean Semler's beautiful shot of the Australian desert, giving the film a wide scope and an eerily isolated atmosphere; and Brian May's terrifically throbbing music score.Overall, this just may be one of THE very finest action movies I've laid my eyes on, and just might be one of my most personally favorite films of all time. Gorgeous scenery, colorful characters, great premise and ultra-violent killer action, that's how I like it.

Moreover the original release, the long version was recently shown on TCM exposing the film, in ail probability, to its largest audience ever. I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. Seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate why.First there is the dreaded phrase mise-en-scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. Basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. For example, a crowd extra will be given a piece of action, say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. If there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action. All of the extras do this. Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. This is mise-en-scene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene, even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop. An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. The metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, got into the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. This is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is the opening 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you of most films. However the whole preface adds up to only one line- Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later&#x85; All of that time, money and effort, not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. It's just so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, witless dialogue, which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. Overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. But don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. That's symbolic, he said, of he doesn't know which way to go. That is basically, at its kernel, the basis of every pro- Heaven's Gate critique.Watch it, if you must, but be forewarned, this is not a film whose time has come, this is a stinker which will smell for all time.

Sounds daft, I know, but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie, but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean, Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton, right, and an early masterpiece, right; and Michael Keaton in the title role, delivers a barnstorming performance, right; and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated off-the-wall, wacky humour right, with loads of imaginative special effects, right. And anyway, everyone, and I mean everyone thinks it's really, really good and really, really cool and just, you know, brilliant, I mean really, really brilliant, right. So if you disagree and, you know, you don't get it, it's your problem, man, because everyone else thinks it's really, really cool and really, really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really, really good and really, really brilliant. The real problem is that I don't think I even have a problem &#x97; I just don't think Beetlejuice is quite as good as everyone, and I mean, everyone, right, says. It's rather like Robert De Niro's performance in Mean Streets everyone says it's pure genius, then you see it, and you think aren't they exaggerating just a little, I mean, just a little? It's good, yes, but . . . Beetlejuice is this film I had heard so much about, which was truly original and with which Tim Burton first made his name (or something). But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out, and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV, I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for £4, which is my sort of price, in it went into the shopping basket. In the event, I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player (i.e. my iBook) until a few weeks later, but when I did, I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now, it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there, because, quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton re-wrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre, although I would be hard-pushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't. Then we are presented with the Deetz family and their camp interior designer and again the characterisation is so broadbrush that you wonder just at what level the whole thing is being pitched. Well, actually, it doesn't matter. This is cartoon stuff, except that it doesn't feature animation but acting. OK, fair enough. Then we get to Keaton giving an undoubted tour de force but in an odd sort of way it never really takes off. We are informed that at one point he was someone's assistant but his behaviour became so extreme that he had to be let go. Well, perhaps I'm being a little over-pernickety here, but I want some sort of back story which would help flesh out Beetlejuice. But all we are led to believe is that he should, on no account, be invoked. Naturally, he is invoked, but oddly the film finishes quite soon afterwards (in an ending which involved a deus ex machina of such obviousness that I would bet my shirt the writer simply did not know how to end his story. In fact, apart from the fact that one could dies and wants to scare another couple out of their home, what was the story. When the film came, I was even taken by surprise was that it? I thought, for although by now Beetlejuice had already been running for 90 minutes odd, in a sense it was only just getting going. But no, that was it, like it or lump it. Perhaps, I am expecting too much. Perhaps I am being too serious. Perhaps I should just relax and get into the spirit of the film (and no silly pun intended there). The trouble is that Beetlejuice could have been so much more. We often say that so-and-so was more than just the sum of its parts, and hope to indicate that it included an x factor which raised it above the rest. Well, for me Beetlejuice is, in a sense, less the sum of its parts. It seemingly has everything, but . . . Oh well, I'll just have to firm a sub-group of those who don't think this is the best thing since sliced bread.

But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out, and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV, I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for £4, which is my sort of price, in it went into the shopping basket. In the event, I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player (i.e. my iBook) until a few weeks later, but when I did, I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now, it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there, because, quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton re-wrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre, although I would be hard-pushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't. Then we are presented with the Deetz family and their camp interior designer and again the characterisation is so broadbrush that you wonder just at what level the whole thing is being pitched. Well, actually, it doesn't matter. This is cartoon stuff, except that it doesn't feature animation but acting. OK, fair enough. Then we get to Keaton giving an undoubted tour de force but in an odd sort of way it never really takes off. We are informed that at one point he was someone's assistant but his behaviour became so extreme that he had to be let go. Well, perhaps I'm being a little over-pernickety here, but I want some sort of back story which would help flesh out Beetlejuice. But all we are led to believe is that he should, on no account, be invoked. Naturally, he is invoked, but oddly the film finishes quite soon afterwards (in an ending which involved a deus ex machina of such obviousness that I would bet my shirt the writer simply did not know how to end his story.

Perhaps, I am expecting too much. Perhaps I am being too serious. Perhaps I should just relax and get into the spirit of the film (and no silly pun intended there). The trouble is that Beetlejuice could have been so much more. We often say that so-and-so was more than just the sum of its parts, and hope to indicate that it included an x factor which raised it above the rest. Well, for me Beetlejuice is, in a sense, less the sum of its parts. It seemingly has everything, but . . .

Sounds daft, I know, but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie, but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean, Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton, right, and an early masterpiece, right; and Michael Keaton in the title role, delivers a barnstorming performance, right; and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated off-the-wall, wacky humour right, with loads of imaginative special effects, right. And anyway, everyone, and I mean everyone thinks it's really, really good and really, really cool and just, you know, brilliant, I mean really, really brilliant, right. So if you disagree and, you know, you don't get it, it's your problem, man, because everyone else thinks it's really, really cool and really, really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really, really good and really, really brilliant.

Oddly enough for a movie called The Search for Spock, one of the film's biggest problems is a distinct lack of Spock. Without him the chemistry of the TOS crew is hurt quite a bit.Also, the film does lack its own identity a bit, feeling most often like the direct sequel to The Wrath of Khan which it is. This isn't really a problem, it just means that the film holds almost no appeal to those who haven't seen The Wrath of Khan, and to those of us who have seen The Wrath of Khan (and many times), the choice between the two if we only have time to sit down and watch one of them is painfully obvious. It really is mostly a sort of bridge between The Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home.The film's greatest flaw is the entire Klingon plot. I was never a big fan of the Klingons which I know I'm in a minority on but here they seemed especially annoying because they are thrown into the mix basically to add conflict and action to something which could have been just a straight character piece. Indeed, the only aspect of The Search for Spock aside from reliably good performances from the original cast which is more than merely competent (a description which applies to Nimoy's direction, most of the effects work considering when it was made and the budget, all the supporting cast, the overall story, and several other aspects of the film) is the screenwriter Harve Benett's excellent characterization and the several good character moments sprinkled throughout the film, my favorite being Bones telling a not-yet-fully-restored Spock that he misses him. The film could have been great if it had stuck to a simple character-based story. Instead the film aims to be, in its relatively short running time, a full-on space opera.

I will, however, elaborate as much as I can on all the things that Across 110th does represent &#x85; and that is quite a lot! This is a bona fide gritty, vile, uncompromising and unceasingly violent action-thriller from the glorious early 70's. It's a hardcore-to-the-bone tale of corruptness and survival with solid acting performances and a tight screenplay, yet without pushy morality lessons or unnecessary sentimental interludes. Across 110th Street is arguably the best Blacks Vs Italians thriller ever made, and this intervened with a strong story about two completely unmatchable cops that are forced to work together results in an unimaginably powerful and unforgettable movie; albeit one that only can be enjoyed by people with strong stomachs and nerves of steel as the bloodshed is relentless and the level of suspense is unremitting. Petty thief Jim Harris and his two accomplices decide to steal a large sum of money from the Italian Mafiosi that are running the show in Harlem. The heist goes terribly wrong, though, and Harris kills no less than five gangsters and two police officers. The Italians send their most lethal psychopath to Harlem and the black gangster community organizes their own manhunt as well. Meanwhile the police force deals with internal racial issues. The aging and corrupt but veteran Captain Mattelli is forced to hand over the investigation to Lieutenant Pope, who's fresh out of university and still full of ideals. This is one of the grittiest and frighteningly realistic depictions of the crime-infested New York City district during the early 70's. There are hardly any amiable characters in the entire film, the ambiance is constantly on the verge of depressing and the downbeat ending comes a massive slap in the face. The racial tension between the main police officer characters is always present and noticeable, yet moral values and speeches are never shoved down the viewers' throats. The performances are incredible, particularly Anthony Franciosa as the crazed mafia killer and Paul Benjamin as the small thief turned murderer. But the utmost respect is for Anthony Quinn, for courageously illustrating a dismal and raw cop-character with his status in Hollywood. The soul soundtrack is amazing and the actual Harlem filming locations make the film all the more authentic. Barry Shear's direction is surefooted and tight, and I can't believe I haven't checked out some of his other work yet.

His previous one with Cary Grant, Indiscreet, also starred Ingrid Bergman, and the two of them repeated their impeccable chemistry from Notorious ten years earlier in a very romantic and yet sophisticated comedy. The Grass Is Greener is, if anything, more sophisticated, almost stultifyingly so. It's obviously based on a stage play, fitted out with a handful of cinematic tricks that stick out like sore thumbs.This cast could do no wrong, as far as I'm concerned, and they just about manage to make it work. Robert Mitchum is probably miscast, but he doesn't let it show, and his scenes with Deborah Kerr (the two of them made many films together and enjoyed one another's company) work beautifully. Cary Grant is impeccable, as always, although I can't help thinking that this really is Rex Harrison territory. And Jean Simmons is delightful - she really is a fairly underrated actress.

If you like movies such as Remains of the Day, you will enjoy this one. Against the backdrop of a traditional boys school in the English countryside, a teacher who is being forced out examines his life. This movie is well-done across the board--the rich if spare script (perfect), the cinematography, a well-integrated score, all perfectly paced. This movie and the characters in it have layers. The acting by Albert Finney and Greta Sacchi is masterful (Michael Gabon is good, too). All that, and it has an honest ending. This movie had my rapt attention from the opening scene, and I am certain to watch it again.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 April 2009","score":"","review":" Well, I just caught the digital restoration of this first, classic Bond film, and it is like seeing it for the first time -which it most definitely is not! The first time was on a black and white television screen when I was a child -but it made an indelible impression even then, and images from the film have been part of my movie-memory ever since -as I am sure they have been for many other people. This is, of course, the alpha-movie of Bond stories, where just about everything that came afterwards has its roots the coolness, the impossibly grand sets, the villain, the pretty girl, the exotic locations, the high style, the chase, and the screen character of Bond himself, brilliantly portrayed by Connery. Though it is not the best Bond film, being the first gives it the right to be on any required viewing list. It has a relatively simple story, but it moves along with such an interesting and (for the time) fresh, dynamic style, that you really don't think much about plot or story. You just enjoy. And there is much to enjoy. Marvel at the fantastic, imaginative sets by Ken Adam, the truly weird and underrated Joseph Wiseman as Dr.No, the beauty of Ursula Andress rising from the sea and witness the birth of screen legend in countless iconic images. In the centre is Sean Connery - and what an entrance! He dominates the film with a raw coolness that is particularly striking in the interior scenes. In the scenes on location he is at times quite uneven in his performance -seemingly unsure of his characterization at times. But I am really splitting hairs here -it comes from having seen the film so many times; his contribution to screen iconography is enormous, and the Bond films would never have been as successful an adventure without him.
