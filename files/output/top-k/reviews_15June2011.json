This film shows that a film to be extremely funny and engaging does not have to resort to swearing, nudity or sex, something the modern day directors and actors could do with learning. The plot is very simple and does not really contribute much, but the acting and direction is so superb that one does not really care. It is a silly film and unpretentious, just the sort of film to watch when one needs cheering up or a good laugh for a good laugh's sake.

It instantly draws parallels with Gary Oldman's Nil By Mouth not least because it also stars Ray Winstone in the father role.The first thing I feel I should mention is just how good this film looked. The setting was perfect, a sleepy seaside village in Devon directly conflicting with the events unfolding on screen whilst at the same time complementing them with the dreary, bleak backgrounds. Indeed, many scenes just show Tom on the beach or very little happening, but they look great as it segues from one scene to another.I thought the cast was perfect for the film. Of course Ray Winstone in this sort of role is often reason to watch, but I also think that Freddie Cunliffe was marvellous in the main role and I was surprised he has not done anything else of note off the back of this.I honestly do not think the content of this film is as bad as it's Wikipedia page suggests, though that does not mean I recommend it to most people. If you like the sound of the description on Wikipedia you will most likely enjoy this film on some level, otherwise you should not bother because you will hate it.Then there is that scene. One of the most uncomfortable, uncompromising sex scenes you are likely to see in a full length picture.I am surprised Tim Roth has still not directed another film but I would definitely be up for watching them even if the story is not as bleak as this one because the direction and casting is spot on.Overall, I recommend this to people who like this sort of film. However I feel it is not quite on par with Nil By Mouth because that film made me shed a tear and this one did not.Recommended for fans of Nil By Mouth, Straw Dogs, Bad Lieutenant, Once Were Warriors and films by Ken Loach. A must for anybody who likes to see Ray Winstone in this sort of role.

Mostly horror films. Donnie Darko, Joy Ride, and Jeepers Creepers all surfaced and held a cult following years later. All three are incomplete trilogies with one sequel branching off of them. And all are full of life and scares the first time around. With repeated viewings the scare factor gradually decreases, but the enjoyment and the memories are still there.Jeepers Creepers was a film that I remember from my childhood very well. The first and the second films etched themselves inside my head and brought years of haunting memories. Watching them years later, they aren't as scary, but they still have a tiny nostalgic twinkle when I catch them on TV.Focusing on a brother and sister (Long and Phillips) returning home for spring break, Jeepers Creepers introduces an inhumane figure into the world of horror. He comes equipped with bat wings, a Freddy Krueger like face, razor sharp teeth, and a cloak and hat to top it all off. They call him The Creeper (Breck). The mysterious figure tries to run the two off the road on their journey home blaring its horn and swerving intensely.Later, they see him dump a body down a pipeline and, with the help of a dream haunted old woman, they begin to piece together the creature's habit and purpose on the planet. I won't spoil it because it's something that is uncovered towards the end of the film.The first half an hour is very intense, leaving so much to be accomplished. It comes off very uneasy and has a setting that can leave someone truly helpless. They are driving through the countryside. We all have. There isn't a damn thing for miles. Cell phones, in 2001, weren't as powerful as they were now leaving the characters in more of a quandary. So much happens in the eventful beginning. We get a big scare, and character development. Two things horror movies in present day lack.Compared to recent films like remakes and some mildly entertaining new pieces of modern day horror, all we get are pointless names of a character. What good is a name if nothing else is provided. Usually all we know is that the group of idiot, lame-brain teens who love to go out in the woods in the dead of night to smoke, drink, and have sex. Whatever. We don't care about them, and sometimes, in a wonderfully sadistic way, we'd like to see them die just because we are sick of them. Jeepers Creepers at least gives us a reason to be concerned for its leads.By the end of the film, it went a little downhill with the goofy backstory on The Creeper and it became more of somebody else's movie. It takes the cleverness and charm that made the two leads likable and makes them a little less heroic and daring. But because the beginning, the music, the characters and the villain are all so greatly constructed, it's a tad bit acceptable that the ending isn't on par with the beginning.

Having a vague knowledge of the stars of the film (Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine), for one reason or another I was expecting a light-hearted comedy filled with innuendo and witty banter, a tradition of filmmaking that was common around the period when this film was released. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed, as these elements are all in play in The Apartment, but what really thrilled and surprised me was the much more serious subject matter that the film deals with. To say this is simply a comedy is completely false, as it's a somewhat dark and daring study of the nature of love and infidelity, and the stunning performances and filmmaking on display had me enthralled from the first frame.The film certainly begins as a comedy. C.C. Baxter (Lemmon) is a young bachelor trying to ascend the corporate ladder by allowing a group of his superiors to use his apartment for their extra-marital liaisons. After he falls for charismatic elevator attendant Fran (MacLaine), who is engaged in an illicit relationship with Mr. Sheldrake, the married head of the company, Baxter tries to free himself from the demands of his bosses, with hilarious results. While this is certainly risqué subject matter (for 1960), the film takes an unexpectedly sombre turn when Fran makes a suicide attempt in the apartment after learning the truth behind Sheldrake's motives. What follows is a touching, and at times heart-wrenching flowering of Baxter and Fran's relationship, and if the ending is a little predictable, the journey getting there is really something wonderful.The Apartment features an excellent selection of fully-formed support characters, but the film really belongs to Lemmon and MacLaine. Lemmon's reputation as cinema's greatest everyman is really on show here, and it's impossible not to root for him and sympathise with his plight. Playing Baxter as a charming yet awkward underdog, his character is the embodiment of the 'nice guys finish last' maxim, and although some elements of his life may be a little shady to say the least, Lemmon is flawless. MacLaine is completely up to Lemmon's high standard as Fran, effortlessly making audiences fall in love with her just as Baxter has. She's just so damn cute that even when she's recovering from an overdose of sleeping pills, she exudes such a potent 'girl next door' allure that can't be avoided. Her chemistry with Lemmon is palpable, and when they inevitably end up together, it's one of those truly satisfying romantic moments seen all too rarely in modern cinema.I'm not usually one to get nostalgic when it comes to film periods, but while I do have great fondness for many more recent romantic comedies, Hollywood really doesn't make movies like The Apartment any more. Wilder's screenplay (co-written with I.A.L. Diamond) is clever, witty and engaging, particularly in the subtle motifs and unique idiosyncrasies of all the characters, and the film is just so expertly crafted. I'm determined now to seek out more Wilder films, along with catching up on my Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. I can't recommend The Apartment highly enough!

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 June 2011","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Billy Wilder's The Apartment was one of a huge list of movies that are considered classics which I haven't seen, and indeed knew very little about (other than the level of admiration which many people have for it). Having a vague knowledge of the stars of the film (Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine), for one reason or another I was expecting a light-hearted comedy filled with innuendo and witty banter, a tradition of filmmaking that was common around the period when this film was released. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed, as these elements are all in play in The Apartment, but what really thrilled and surprised me was the much more serious subject matter that the film deals with. To say this is simply a comedy is completely false, as it's a somewhat dark and daring study of the nature of love and infidelity, and the stunning performances and filmmaking on display had me enthralled from the first frame.The film certainly begins as a comedy. C.C. Baxter (Lemmon) is a young bachelor trying to ascend the corporate ladder by allowing a group of his superiors to use his apartment for their extra-marital liaisons. After he falls for charismatic elevator attendant Fran (MacLaine), who is engaged in an illicit relationship with Mr. Sheldrake, the married head of the company, Baxter tries to free himself from the demands of his bosses, with hilarious results. While this is certainly risqué subject matter (for 1960), the film takes an unexpectedly sombre turn when Fran makes a suicide attempt in the apartment after learning the truth behind Sheldrake's motives. What follows is a touching, and at times heart-wrenching flowering of Baxter and Fran's relationship, and if the ending is a little predictable, the journey getting there is really something wonderful.The Apartment features an excellent selection of fully-formed support characters, but the film really belongs to Lemmon and MacLaine. Lemmon's reputation as cinema's greatest everyman is really on show here, and it's impossible not to root for him and sympathise with his plight. Playing Baxter as a charming yet awkward underdog, his character is the embodiment of the 'nice guys finish last' maxim, and although some elements of his life may be a little shady to say the least, Lemmon is flawless. MacLaine is completely up to Lemmon's high standard as Fran, effortlessly making audiences fall in love with her just as Baxter has. She's just so damn cute that even when she's recovering from an overdose of sleeping pills, she exudes such a potent 'girl next door' allure that can't be avoided. Her chemistry with Lemmon is palpable, and when they inevitably end up together, it's one of those truly satisfying romantic moments seen all too rarely in modern cinema.I'm not usually one to get nostalgic when it comes to film periods, but while I do have great fondness for many more recent romantic comedies, Hollywood really doesn't make movies like The Apartment any more. Wilder's screenplay (co-written with I.A.L. Diamond) is clever, witty and engaging, particularly in the subtle motifs and unique idiosyncrasies of all the characters, and the film is just so expertly crafted. I'm determined now to seek out more Wilder films, along with catching up on my Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. I can't recommend The Apartment highly enough!

This was a Grindhouse movie shown in little theatres, not in huge complexes. I went to see it not expecting much&#x85;Not expecting, but got This film had the coolest robot I had ever seen in my life. Back then I was not familiar with Harvey Keitel, I did not know that Roy Dotrice had overdubbed his voice, all I knew is this creepy guy, opens an airlock on a space station and lets his Captain fall through, shattering him into a million pieces of gore, and that was disturbing, and it was shown within the first 5 minutes of this film - And Keitel, who at the time was hidden by a black space helmet, giggling about killing this guy in that horrible way, what kind of film is this with a beginning like that.Not the best Stanley Donen film, but Donen clearly had a talent for doing the best he could with very low budgets, it could have used a few more dollars in the effects budget. It is highly Likely that John Barry directed a lot of this, and his design handiwork is evident.After seeing Space done so beautifully and economically by Ridley Scott in Aliens, this film for me was a return to my roots of Low Budget Science Fiction, which I grew up on, so I enjoyed the cheesy view of Saturn's Rings, I even loved the 2-D effect of the space station, and Donen's directing of the initial scene where you think is this going to be a musical in space? But there were some good effects despite the Apparent lack of dollars to make them really good. And I first saw this in the theater, and things always look better on that huge screen, until you see it on TV and it looks Cheap.So now, 32 years after I sat in that theater and was creeped out by Harvey Keitel and his robot Hector - I found a fairly good transfer of that film online and got it - And I watched it last night, for the first time in 3 decades. And I still liked it, the interactions between Kirk Douglass, Farah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel were subtle and the dialog was understandable although a future slang was being used, we can get the gist of the conversations... No Taction Contact! IE, Do Not Touch! - Kirk Douglas was far from being a decrepit old man in this film, he plays the lead role in his usual way, although toned down from his gritting teeth roles like Spartacus. In fact, this was the first film I had seen Douglas in where he was very subdued in manner but held his authority, when usually he acts with a lot more force behind his words and actions. I think this was probably the biggest Movie role for Farah , not counting several made for TV movies like The Burning Bed.The Saturn 3 set is convincing as a space habitat, except of course the gravity would be less than earth's, there is no mention of artificial gravity, so we have to take all that for granted in the film.The Hector concept, was the first time I had seen in a movie, that a robot had to be programmed from a human brain, and if that brain has problems I'm not malfunctioning, You are as Hector tells Benson- So this film makes clear that a guy who giggles over murdering his captain in cold blood, if this guy is the template for Hector's Programming, then watch out - The film made this concept very clear. This was also the first time in a movie where we see a socket at the base of a man's skull, this has been used in Science Fiction movies up to The Matrix.The design of some of the space-ships came from earlier science fiction movies, and we can blame veteran effects man Wally Veevers for some of the opticals in this film... The three-winged craft that comes to check on Saturn 3 is very familiar- I like that this was done that way, it connected this film which was at the time, a modern science fiction film, to its predecessors from the late 50's and early 60's. Most of the spaceships look like they came from the covers of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction or Analog Science Fiction or Galaxy or any number of those pulps where these stories came from...And of course, the writer of this story was Martin Amis, the son of author Kingsley Amis, who wrote several science fiction stories with slants like used in this film.So basically, this was a B Movie that got some attention because of the then use of Kirk Douglas and Farah Fawcett, it could have been a great film, but as it is, it is not horrible, the science is believable, the effects typical but not great, the resolution not perfect but satisfying. The story could have been fleshed out a bit more, but as it is, the robot Hector, I remembered that Robot, when I saw Terminator I thought of Hector, when I saw Aliens I thought of Hector, there were a lot of possibilities for that character, this was not just an Evil Robot but a robot that became evil because of the way it was taught - Much like people in that respect. And that cylinder that held Hectors Brain - was creepy, any brain that is 4 times the size of a human brain, well you just have to say Why is that a BAD IDEA?

Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd.Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into.Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role.Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total cliché - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part.

And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the Let's suck face line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

Stephen King is one of my favourite authors, and I've now read a good bit of his extensive collection of work - but his debut novel, Carrie, being his smallest novel of all, is one that I can never finish, and I've tried on three occasions. And the reason why is because I find it impossible to get into and despite being just under 200 pages long, I find it boring. So naturally, I wasn't really going to appreciate the film adaptation as much.But I can say that this is a very faithful adaption, and Sissy Spacek is amazing in the lead role as Carrie. She captures the character's personality and characteristics very well, and comes across as very believable and allows us to gain tremendous sympathy and empathy for her. It's no wonder she received an Oscar nomination for her performance. So did Piper Laurie for her manic performance as Carrie's unstable, god-fearing mother. A very young John Travolta has a small role in this as a young thug, and his performance is very memorable despite his lack of screen time. This was John Travolta before he would be swept up by the Grease craze a few years later and turned into the actor that he is today.Years before he would forever imprint his name on the Gangster genre with films such as Scarface, The Untouchables and Carlito's Way, De Palma does a great job here in bringing King's work to the screen, and I'm sure King appreciated it. Alas, like the novel, Carrie is very short, but again, like the novel, it drags and feels much longer. It's more of a drama than a horror, a drama essentially about bullying and teenage alienation, and overall, I would never rate this as one of the great horror classics. It's a decent enough movie, just not the masterpiece it's often hailed to be.

So, if you saw this much later film and assumed A Hard Day's Night is also a boring, bloated and enormously long-winded music video, think twice! Despite having practically no plot and TONS of Beatles songs strung together instead of a story, there is something likable about A Hard Day's Night and it gives you the next best thing to a backstage pass to meet them--albeit heavily scripted and plasticized.The plot, for what it is, is a visit to the hectic life of the Beatles--making it not much of a stretch for the boys. And they essentially play the public roles each played--Paul was the sweet and nice one, John the clever smart-aleck, George the quiet one and Ringo the goofy one. Whether this is exactly as they really were is pretty doubtful, but they did play the parts the public expected and loved. The film includes them being chased by fans (A LOT), riding trains, making eyes at girls, cracking jokes and singing. Along for the ride is the somewhat irrelevant 'grandfather' of Paul--who was actually actor Wilfrid Brambell from Steptoe and Son (a precursor to Sanford and Son in America). He mostly just sits there and looks serious or chases young women. In the MANY times when the film breaks into seemingly spontaneous music videos, he mostly sits there and looks bewildered. I am sure back in 1964, anyone in the theater older than, say, 35, looked pretty much the same way!! As I said, the plot is VERY thin and mostly it's just a chance to pretend to see the Beatles as they are in real life (sure) and hear a lot of their songs...LOTS. In fact, it seems like the songs often take the place of plot. Now this would suck if it was, say, the Bay City Rollers,The Ohio Express or The Starland Vocal Band. But, considering almost every song is among the group's best, it's hard to hate the lack of plot--unless you are a crazy young whippersnapper who hates the Fab Four!

","genre":"Comedy, Musical"},{"date":"15 June 2011","score":"","review":" Carl Weathers displays his winning charm in yet another title role. Weathers IS Detroit cop Jericho Action Jackson - and you know with a nickname like that he doesn't mess around. Evil, megalomaniacal auto magnate Peter Dellaplane is killing off AWA (Auto Workers Alliance) members in order to keep a stranglehold on his already-impressive power. Dellaplane and Jackson have a past, as Jackson was demoted after roughing up his son before sending him to prison. Ignoring the fact that his wife is Sharon Stone in her prime years of hotness, Dellaplane also has a chick on the side, Sydney (Vanity), who he keeps drugged up with heroin. Sydney and Jackson now must team up to take down Dellaplane before he can frame Jackson for his many murders.Ah, the golden 80's. Just take a second to pause and reflect about that magical decade. Back to the review at hand, Action Jackson is classic 80's action, reminiscent of Arnold vehicles such as Raw Deal (1986). It's well-shot, and unusually well-written, with plenty of clever jokes and dialogue. But the film also has all the action the underground action movies have, but this came out in a time when things like this came to the theater and had a moderate-to-big budget behind them.Besides the aforementioned Sharon Stone and Vanity, Weathers has an impressive cast to back him up Bill Duke as the classic BYC (Black Yelling Chief), Thomas F. Wilson (Biff of Back to the Future, 1985 fame) as the joke-telling uniformed officer, Bob Minor as the evil assassin Gamble, Nicholas Worth as Dellaplane's butler, Al Leong as Dellaplane's chauffeur, James Lew as Dellaplane's martial arts instructor, Charles Meshack of Fear (1988) fame, Sonny Landham and the ubiquitous Branscombe Richmond. It even has fan favorite Robert Davi in a small but important role. Last but not least is the Coach himself, Craig T. Nelson, looking more diabolical than usual, probably because of the hair. We even get to see him do some Craig-Fu - but does he really think he can beat Action Jackson in a fight? The movie is funny, snappy and a great vehicle for Weathers' charisma.

Weathers IS Detroit cop Jericho Action Jackson - and you know with a nickname like that he doesn't mess around. Evil, megalomaniacal auto magnate Peter Dellaplane is killing off AWA (Auto Workers Alliance) members in order to keep a stranglehold on his already-impressive power. Dellaplane and Jackson have a past, as Jackson was demoted after roughing up his son before sending him to prison. Ignoring the fact that his wife is Sharon Stone in her prime years of hotness, Dellaplane also has a chick on the side, Sydney (Vanity), who he keeps drugged up with heroin. Sydney and Jackson now must team up to take down Dellaplane before he can frame Jackson for his many murders.Ah, the golden 80's. Just take a second to pause and reflect about that magical decade. Back to the review at hand, Action Jackson is classic 80's action, reminiscent of Arnold vehicles such as Raw Deal (1986). It's well-shot, and unusually well-written, with plenty of clever jokes and dialogue. But the film also has all the action the underground action movies have, but this came out in a time when things like this came to the theater and had a moderate-to-big budget behind them.Besides the aforementioned Sharon Stone and Vanity, Weathers has an impressive cast to back him up Bill Duke as the classic BYC (Black Yelling Chief), Thomas F. Wilson (Biff of Back to the Future, 1985 fame) as the joke-telling uniformed officer, Bob Minor as the evil assassin Gamble, Nicholas Worth as Dellaplane's butler, Al Leong as Dellaplane's chauffeur, James Lew as Dellaplane's martial arts instructor, Charles Meshack of Fear (1988) fame, Sonny Landham and the ubiquitous Branscombe Richmond. It even has fan favorite Robert Davi in a small but important role. Last but not least is the Coach himself, Craig T. Nelson, looking more diabolical than usual, probably because of the hair. We even get to see him do some Craig-Fu - but does he really think he can beat Action Jackson in a fight? The movie is funny, snappy and a great vehicle for Weathers' charisma.

If you watch carefully you can see their youth shine through. It's captivating. Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis do a nice turn of small town people with big problems. I wished they used someone different as Paul Newman's son but at the time I guess he was a good choice. He played his lines well and is a good supporting actor, but it just seems like something was missing with him. The character actors in this movie are the ones that keep it glued together and give it a foundation. Phillip Hoffman is terrific as the bungling but angry cop. One seems to know that he'll win an Oscar one day. Come to think of it I wish Mr. Hoffman played Newman's son and maybe even someone like Jason Alexander as the cop.Maybe I should be a casting agent.Anyhow, no matter my opinion this movie should make you feel good. There is good philosophy and realistic banter and outcomes in this movie. Good movie watching.

The movie made a mark on my childhood, I was deeply engrossed by the mystical capabilities on Streep. Her poignance and courage in the movie paved the way for much of the artsy feeling I enjoyed.

I think he could have had as good a career as his co-star Matt Dillon (who plays the bully). As it is, he makes his character easy to root for. When he enlists the bodyguard services of Adam Baldwin as the sullen school outcast (who is feared as a psychopath because of his size and because he was rumored to have killed his younger brother), the two forge a beautifully written friendship that you rarely see in movies anymore. Makepeace also finds out from a very kind teacher\/counselor that Baldwin's younger brother accidentally shot himself, and that trauma is why Baldwin is so withdrawn.Of course, Makepeace can only rely on Baldwin's protection for so long, because Baldwin isn't really a psychopath. Dillon shows up with a bigger, tougher guy as HIS bodyguard, and Makepeace watches helplessly as Baldwin allows himself to be beaten and humiliated. Afterward, he asks Baldwin, Why didn't you fight?, because he's honestly puzzled. Baldwin spits, I never wanted to be anybody's damn bodyguard anyway! Later he reveals the painful truth about his younger brother that he did actually shoot the boy. It was an accident, but he is racked with guilt over it. The scene has heartbreaking acting not just from Baldwin but from Makepeace.Eventually the two reconcile, and Baldwin decides to confront Dillon and his bodyguard. At first Baldwin pretends he's going to back down again, and then in a great moment that always makes me cheer, lets out a primal howl as he bodily flings himself on top of the larger guy and proceeds to pound on him. He wins that battle, but there's still another between Dillon and Makepeace. Baldwin urges Makepeace to fight for himself, and he does, breaking Dillon's nose and revealing what a coward Dillon truly is.The film's ending is great Baldwin trailing after Makepeace and jokingly asking him to be his bodyguard.Wonderful film. It deserves more recognition.
