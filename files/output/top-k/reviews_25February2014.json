This movie's a great hit, that pays off, thanks not only to the great Bill Murray, but the quirky, no hope, delinquent army trainees, who prove in the end, prove they're not as useless as we think. Warren Oates is a plus here, as a hardened take no s..t drill Sergeant (aren't they all) who laid back, overweight ex cabbie, Murray, gets off on the wrong foot with. The start, prefore to our two, joining up with the army, has insulted cabbie, Murray leaving an old crusty woman, stranded on a bridge. With the dejected Murray coming back into his apartment, if as a tease shot, we see a momentary shot of Murray's younger girlfriend's t..s, leading us to question if it was purposely intended, or just a last moment decision by Ramis. This movie is truly a magical hit and works wonderfully as a hoot and a half comedy that will have you in titters a few times over, while showing you the serious side of, what the army training is really like and dedicated you have to be. The characters the talented actors brought to the screen, really impressed me, especially the psycho who hates being called Francis, providing one of the highlighted comedy moments. Sean Young and P.J Soles as sexy female privates, love interests of Ramis and Murray, provide some nice scenes off the base. In fact, Soles has never been sexier. Stripes forever remains a successful timeless hit, and one I definitely recommend, if never giving it a view. But I can still feel my nuts, when that trainee, misjudges that log, before keeling over.

I can't help but notice that this film has come in for some vitriolic criticism from pretty much everybody, mainly due to the fact that it takes huge artistic licence with the Inspector Gadget cartoon on which this is based. But looking at it from a kid's perspective, it actually isn't as bad as all that - the trouble is that while the cartoon has been diluted and Disneyfied, it doesn't offer the same level of enjoyment for adult viewers that your average Pixar might.Dopey security guard John Brown (Matthew Broderick) works at a robotic lab and quickly finds himself attempting to stop a robbery by sophisticated villain Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett). He fails and is blown up for his troubles, although Scolex escapes minus a hand. But the beautiful Brenda (Joely Fisher) decides that Brown is the perfect subject for Project Gadget and he undergoes radical surgery to incorporate every crime-fighting device known to man into his body. Finally achieving his dream of becoming a police officer, Inspector Gadget (as he becomes known) needs to take time to readjust to his new way of life but he decides instead to bring Scolex to justice - who now has a few modifications of his own, becoming the sinister Claw...The original cartoon, of which I have nothing but fond memories, was a cross between Robocop and Inspector Clouseau but sadly, Disney have taken a liberty or two too many. Brown (and why give the hero the dullest name ever) is too smart to be Gadget, who was a complete idiot in the show. He solved crimes by accident and without knowing how but here, he is just a dull personality vacuum. The real crime fighters were his niece Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and her dog Brain (voiced by original Gadget actor Don Adams) but here, they're reduced to bit-part players. The Gadgetmobile has morphed from a sports car to an open-top Lincoln Continental and now has a voice in the irritating form of D.L. Hughley. Everett's Claw is obviously far too handsome to keep obscured in darkness and I don't ever recall Gadget having a love interest. The humour is excessively kiddie-friendly and I'm struggling to think of a crime-fighting situation that requires an industrial hose loaded with toothpaste.But of course, a family movie isn't concerned with things like logic because it's principal aim to make the younger viewers have fun and I reckon they would. It's goofy enough to get away with it and the cast gamely give the material their all, Everett especially. The effects are also fairly decent although there are moments that let it down such as Gadget's helicopter hat. It's just such a shame that the film offers little to older viewers except a tiny scene during the end credits involving Claw's reformed henchman Sykes (Mike Hagerty) at a meeting of fellow henchmen which is the movie's sole highlight. And on the subject of the end credits, they seem to arrive awfully quickly - the film runs out of puff after barely an hour and frankly, it still felt like it dragged its heels. If you look past the casting mistakes (Broderick, I'm looking at you here), the lack of anything worthwhile for adults, the gaps in logic and if you can block memories of the much-better TV show then Inspector Gadget might keep the kids entertained for a brief while. Fans of the show will hate it and anyone over the age of ten will be bored stiff. Better stick with Pixar for family fun that everyone can enjoy.

Starring Jet Li, Aaliyah, Russell Wong, & Delroy Lindo. Filmed in Vancouver, Canada. Warner Bros 120 minutesRMD should be worth the effort of popcorn and cherry-cola but I disliked this hip-hop meets Kung Fu creation. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and produced by the same people who brought us Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) and The Matrix (1999), RMD is a weak blend of these film concepts with an unreliable script. There are too many issues including being filmed in Canada and not sunny Oakland where the action takes place.RMD is a dreadful remake of Abel Ferrara's China Girl (1987) which is set in the back streets of Manhattan between Chinatown and Little Italy. The nineteen eighty-seven Shakespeare inspired Romeo and Juliet co-stars Russell Wong as the headstrong and mutinous Yung Gan to RMD's Kai. Ferrara's gangland re-imagining reflects Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) in its avant-garde telling of teenage love against impossible odds. The sex scene image draws the strongest comparison showing Romeo (Leonard Whiting) and Tony's (Richard Panebianco) bare bottoms. In China Girl Tony is a level headed lover, something Li tried to emulate in RMD in the guise of a sweet talking Chinese boy although he has a hard time keeping it together as he fights his way towards his brother's murderer. Comparisons of images from ROM and China Girl include the club scene in China Girl which offers a sexy Tony and Tye (Sari Chang) dancing versus RMD's cocaine-punk Po (Han's brother). Both club scenes cut to brawls between the various gangs. And the hanging image appears in both. The actions of the younger generation is something to watch here.Putting China Girl aside (unlike RMD), most adaptations of Romeo and Juliet have a hyper-romantic element. RMD has almost zero on-screen chemistry between Li and Aaliyah. Li is as sexy as a cement block compared to the tall and handsome Russell Wong. It would have been a very different story if Wong and Li swapped characters, like Schwarzenegger and Biehn swapped in The Terminator (1984). Schwarzenegger was originally asked to play the hero Kyle Reese. In RMD the closest we get to romance is when Han uses Trish as a weapon to beat a woman to death.Particularly disliked the Matrix like combat moves. In the initial club scene Kai spins after a kick to deliver another kick while suspended horizontally in mid-air. At another point Han is suspended mid-air and runs along his enemies chests, then bounces his foot off a wall and... impossible. Han is a cold blooded guy. When he is escaping prison he beats officers unconscious and breaks the arm of a guard. He goes onto steal cars, break into apartments, kill... Can somebody call 911? The football scene is an example of the inconsistencies in this film. Han uses Kung Fu on the football field to win. There is no punishment for kicking other players in the head although they are gang members with guns and fiery tempers.Disliked The flashback with the basket ball serves no purpose. Flashbacks should bring greater meaning but this diminishes the film overall. Who wants a flash back about a dirty burst-up old basketball? The in-combat X-ray special effect should be reserved for films that have more violence. Instead of Matrix spins and jumps Bartkowiak could have offered more than three X-ray punches to excite the action fans a little more.Things that are stupidly funny pimp stick with a secret compartment for cocaine.

With Midnight Run, he shows incredible leverage and energy as the main character, which is somewhat expected and equally unexpected given his age and his line of roles.De Niro is only assisted by the likes of people like Charles Grodin, writer George Gallo, and director Martin Brest, who stuff Midnight Run's screenplay with about as much action, comedy, and intensity you can ask for. This particular project is what I like to say is taking a simple concept and doing all that can be done with it.

It's followed by a hallucination of a male and female pair dancing in a dark soundstage, an old flame we have just seen walk out of his life and her new man. We have some obvious parallels of course his eye as the camera, his face superimposed on narrative walls. So the point is that when we return to the soundstage the space is already charged with dimensions of memory and mind, internal space where the urges first come to life.The space itself is marvelous and provides endless opportunities to create mind blank or colored walls, slides and movie clips, painted skies where figures of history emerge from, endless rows of mirrors. We have of course the filmmaker as the protagonist ruminating on lost friends, cruel politics, senseless war and duty to memory. It's his show after all, the broader film, his space of expression. What's so marvelous though is the conflation of inner life into dance. Desire as seeing and settling on her face among many. Couples dancing. Choreographed order. Piercing gazes locked together in tango. A tension that is both affected and yet real just then. Something inscrutable in the air that can only maybe danced out and never quite figured out more. Dance as looking for union.All through the film we see the show take shape, the slow process. In one particularly evocative scene he blows air into empty dresses and this comes alive as inspiration, and this is followed by her stepping out from behind canvas screens to meet him. Soon there's danger that is foreshadowed for the end, an old boyfriend with possibly mob ties who is also funding the show, his heartbreak and loss mirroring the narrator's.So the violence bubbling in the narrator has been merely postponed, what's the resolution?It ends with the lovers' duel sublimated on the stage between dancers, this was a pivotal scene in one of Saura's previous dance films (flamengo there). The whole scene is a masterstroke. The key players looking, immersed, affected. An implicit tension that may be just the show. The dance ending with a knife's flash. The scorned man gets up and yells as if having her stabbed was a thought or an urge that he regretted only too late.

","genre":"Drama, Musical"},{"date":"25 February 2014","score":"","review":" Say Anything&#x85; (1989) is one of those rare late-eighties, early-nineties romantic comedies that can appeal to both men and the fairer sex. You know the type When Harry Met Sally&#x85; (1989) Pretty Woman (1990) Sleepless in Seattle (1993) et al. Yet Say Anything&#x85; is one of the few exceptionally good and mature love stories that takes place in the torrid-love-affair-overload land of high school. Well maybe not, it more takes place in the insular time between high school and college but let's not split hairs for the sake of the kids.John Cusack plays an eccentric yet well-meaning goofball whose been pining for the school's valedictorian for a good long while. His friends played by Amy Brooks and a singularly jejune Lily Taylor think she's out of his league; brains stick with brains, she says while strumming her guitar. Yet Lloyd Dobler takes a chance anyway and to his great surprise gets a yes from Ione Skye's ethereal ingénue. They then are given the summer to bond before she goes to college in England.The start of the movie lulls you into a false sense of knowing. Of course Lloyd Dobler is going to end up going out with Diane Court. Everyone including her father (John Mahoney) doesn't think it's going to work out. Their names are even phonetically at odds. Diane? Lloyd? Might as well call them Joe and Princess Ann. Yet this movie isn't about falling in love, it's about being in love and believe me there is a big difference.Dobler and Diane grow to love one another by relating to each other and have a mutual interest in learning about each other. Lloyd looks out for her and accepts the goals she has made for herself and adapts accordingly. While we do see less adaptation from Diane it's hard for her to accommodate Lloyd when his life plans are so up in the air. Yet even with his tacit inkling towards a career in kickboxing you can tell Diane would be there to support him when push comes to shove. They have a good thing going and quickly shed the clique dynamics of high school in exchange for something more real.Real and less volatile as evidenced by the juxtaposition of Lily Taylor's obsession with a two timer named Joe (Loren Dean). That single relationship informs her worldview and is the impetuous for her songwriting yet at first glance he clearly isn't worth the heartache. It's a childish obsession at odds with Lloyd's commitment based interconnection with Diane. When Diane describes her first sexual experience with Lloyd to her father, it wasn't a decision wholly based on a whim. She put thought into her adult decision and Lloyd was right there, chomping at the bit like guys would, but still being an adult about it.Diane is given abundant support by her loving father who is displeased with her choice in boyfriend. Lloyd might be sincere but his ambitions are nebulous which would concern any protective father. Yet don't think for a moment John Mahoney's Mr. Court is the bad guy, even if the subplot involving money laundering feels skivvy. The very fact that Diane could confide in him when she loses her virginity should be evidence enough of their special bond. Even Lloyd picks up on the supportive relationship saying You two are amazing, you know? The way you talk&#x85;I'm not even like that with anybody. Say Anything&#x85; is a romantic comedy in the classical sense. In one exchange Diane says Nobody thinks it will work do they? to which Lloyd retorts, No, you just described every great success story. Yet director Cameron Crowe probes deeper than frivolity. It's a love story that examines love through sacrifice, commitment, compromise and growth. There are many films that express the elation of falling hear over heals, the serendipity of forming close bonds and the promise of romance. But few ever give you the true meaning and consequence of love. Ultimately it's not about a sentimental letter or sending flowers, mostly it's about holding someone's hands and telling them things are going to turn out alright.

Well maybe not, it more takes place in the insular time between high school and college but let's not split hairs for the sake of the kids.John Cusack plays an eccentric yet well-meaning goofball whose been pining for the school's valedictorian for a good long while. His friends played by Amy Brooks and a singularly jejune Lily Taylor think she's out of his league; brains stick with brains, she says while strumming her guitar. Yet Lloyd Dobler takes a chance anyway and to his great surprise gets a yes from Ione Skye's ethereal ingénue. They then are given the summer to bond before she goes to college in England.The start of the movie lulls you into a false sense of knowing. Of course Lloyd Dobler is going to end up going out with Diane Court. Everyone including her father (John Mahoney) doesn't think it's going to work out. Their names are even phonetically at odds. Diane? Lloyd? Might as well call them Joe and Princess Ann. Yet this movie isn't about falling in love, it's about being in love and believe me there is a big difference.Dobler and Diane grow to love one another by relating to each other and have a mutual interest in learning about each other. Lloyd looks out for her and accepts the goals she has made for herself and adapts accordingly. While we do see less adaptation from Diane it's hard for her to accommodate Lloyd when his life plans are so up in the air. Yet even with his tacit inkling towards a career in kickboxing you can tell Diane would be there to support him when push comes to shove. They have a good thing going and quickly shed the clique dynamics of high school in exchange for something more real.Real and less volatile as evidenced by the juxtaposition of Lily Taylor's obsession with a two timer named Joe (Loren Dean). That single relationship informs her worldview and is the impetuous for her songwriting yet at first glance he clearly isn't worth the heartache. It's a childish obsession at odds with Lloyd's commitment based interconnection with Diane. When Diane describes her first sexual experience with Lloyd to her father, it wasn't a decision wholly based on a whim. She put thought into her adult decision and Lloyd was right there, chomping at the bit like guys would, but still being an adult about it.Diane is given abundant support by her loving father who is displeased with her choice in boyfriend. Lloyd might be sincere but his ambitions are nebulous which would concern any protective father. Yet don't think for a moment John Mahoney's Mr. Court is the bad guy, even if the subplot involving money laundering feels skivvy. The very fact that Diane could confide in him when she loses her virginity should be evidence enough of their special bond. Even Lloyd picks up on the supportive relationship saying You two are amazing, you know? The way you talk&#x85;I'm not even like that with anybody. Say Anything&#x85; is a romantic comedy in the classical sense. In one exchange Diane says Nobody thinks it will work do they? to which Lloyd retorts, No, you just described every great success story. Yet director Cameron Crowe probes deeper than frivolity. It's a love story that examines love through sacrifice, commitment, compromise and growth. There are many films that express the elation of falling hear over heals, the serendipity of forming close bonds and the promise of romance. But few ever give you the true meaning and consequence of love. Ultimately it's not about a sentimental letter or sending flowers, mostly it's about holding someone's hands and telling them things are going to turn out alright.

Much like the imaginary friend out of Fight Club, but it was really him. And his niece too, fair enough. Believable delusions. An intelligent man could fall for that.

From what I have read, they usually use lost in love adverts to send messages. It was even shown on Mission Impossible. It is easy as pie to put advertising like that in, you can do it anonymously and nobody checks what you put in. You could also put in fake used car ads and other kinds of advertising. But not articles. Not only was he looking in the wrong area, but the level of what he was looking at was all wrong too.

Yet, while you follow his adventures you realize that you don't know that much about him. We have followed every step of his perilous journeys for The Lost Ark and into The Temple of Doom, but what of his personal life? We know that he is a professor and occasionally has rotating girlfriends but what of his past? Who is his family? One of the joys of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is that while we're following him on his latest adventure, some of his background comes to light and it helps us to understand some of the insecurities, the vulnerability and the self-preservation of a man that we've come to know like family.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade begins with a masterstroke. It takes us back to the turn of the century and introduces us to young Indy when he was just a good-natured boy scout (played in a wonderful performance by River Phoenix) with a nose for adventure and a nasty habit of getting himself into trouble. When he steals a golden cross from some fortune hunters, we are led on an adventure that helps us understand how he gained his trademarks such as his fear of snakes, his affinity for whips and even the scar on his chin. We also understand his isolation. He was the son of a celebrated archaeologist, Henry Jones (Sean Connery) who was happy to leave him to his own devices, and it's a wound that he carries into adulthood.The larger story, which takes place in 1938, greatly resembles Raiders of the Lost Ark with Indiana being tasked with finding a lost artifact before Hitler and his Nazi thugs claim it for their own. That artifact is The Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus supposedly drank from at the last supper and also caught his blood as he hung on the cross. Supposedly, whomever drinks from the cup can live forever. Indy's motivation isn't the cup itself, but in the fact that the Nazis have capture his father in order to get it. His father worked all his life to find the sacred relic and even sidelined his role as a father to keep the search going.The father-son subplot is wise because the narrative here is your standard Indiana Jones adventure. We have chases, shoot-outs, rescues, escapes, fights, double-crosses, questionable allegiances, mystic artifacts, booby traps, and the series' trademark vermin. For Raiders it was snakes. Temple of Doom had bugs. Here it is plague of rats, lots and lots of rats. And there's a gorgeous dam, this time a hard-nosed Austrian named Elsa (Alison Doody) whose accent makes us question her alliance.All of these elements come together in a film that is a great deal of fun.

Yet, while you follow his adventures you realize that you don't know that much about him. We have followed every step of his perilous journeys for The Lost Ark and into The Temple of Doom, but what of his personal life? We know that he is a professor and occasionally has rotating girlfriends but what of his past? Who is his family? One of the joys of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is that while we're following him on his latest adventure, some of his background comes to light and it helps us to understand some of the insecurities, the vulnerability and the self-preservation of a man that we've come to know like family.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade begins with a masterstroke. It takes us back to the turn of the century and introduces us to young Indy when he was just a good-natured boy scout (played in a wonderful performance by River Phoenix) with a nose for adventure and a nasty habit of getting himself into trouble. When he steals a golden cross from some fortune hunters, we are led on an adventure that helps us understand how he gained his trademarks such as his fear of snakes, his affinity for whips and even the scar on his chin. We also understand his isolation. He was the son of a celebrated archaeologist, Henry Jones (Sean Connery) who was happy to leave him to his own devices, and it's a wound that he carries into adulthood.The larger story, which takes place in 1938, greatly resembles Raiders of the Lost Ark with Indiana being tasked with finding a lost artifact before Hitler and his Nazi thugs claim it for their own. That artifact is The Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus supposedly drank from at the last supper and also caught his blood as he hung on the cross. Supposedly, whomever drinks from the cup can live forever. Indy's motivation isn't the cup itself, but in the fact that the Nazis have capture his father in order to get it. His father worked all his life to find the sacred relic and even sidelined his role as a father to keep the search going.The father-son subplot is wise because the narrative here is your standard Indiana Jones adventure. We have chases, shoot-outs, rescues, escapes, fights, double-crosses, questionable allegiances, mystic artifacts, booby traps, and the series' trademark vermin. For Raiders it was snakes. Temple of Doom had bugs. Here it is plague of rats, lots and lots of rats. And there's a gorgeous dam, this time a hard-nosed Austrian named Elsa (Alison Doody) whose accent makes us question her alliance.All of these elements come together in a film that is a great deal of fun.

In the 80s, his sci-fi\/ action thrillers were some of the most imaginative shows out there. Along with the original TOTAL RECALL, the original ROBOCOP is his best work! And when you went to see one, what would you expect to see? Usually good guys battling bad guys, winding up in some pretty bloody fights.

In some distant future, the city of Detroit has become a violent haven for criminals. Despite the best efforts of the police department, cops become casualties almost on a nightly basis. One morning, Alex Murphy (played expertly by Peter Weller) comes into work, having been transferred from a kinder, gentler precinct. He meets his new partner, Lewis (Nancy Allen) and before you know it, they are chasing after a van of criminals led by mad dog crime boss Clarence Boddicker (played icily by Kurtwood Smith). Following the criminals to their hideout, the cops get separated and Murphy dies in one of the most violent death scenes in movie history. Meanwhile, the head honchos at Omni Consumer Products (OCP, COP, get it?) are in the process of putting together a new law enforcement program. Murphy, now dead, gets enrolled and resurrected as Robocop. However, soon after, he recalls the men who killed him and goes on a rampage to find and apprehend them. There are many different layers of drama going on here, and I won't go into how it all ties together. With the remake out now in theaters, I don't know how it'll compare to the original.

The scenes that make you jump aren't cheap scare tactics, (ok SOME are) but most play into the storyline and enhance the overall darkness of the film. They managed to give the film a nice sci-fi or futuristic look without being cheesy, and while highly unlikely, the concept and technology behind the film I personally find to be plausible which also puts it higher up on my list. The plot was explained well and flowed nicely from beginning to end. The movie was able to wrap up the story while also leaving the classic scary movie close of could there be more?

Only a decade has passed since the end of WWII. The Cold War is in full swing and your country is separated by east and west. Infrastructure is back to normal but the scars inflicted by the war have only begun to heal. You were an SS officer who used to have a job that was unpleasant, yet in your mind necessary. Now you're a lowly night porter for a swanky hotel in West Berlin.Thus starts the story of Maximilian Aldorfer (Dirk Bogarde) a man who lurks in the shadows along with a small cabal of surviving Nazis. They quietly meet to conduct trials to conceal any inkling of their past before the authorities find out, going so far as to kill possible witnesses. Max's life is unassuming and guilt-ridden; I want to live like a church mouse he says. That is until the arrival of Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), a former concentration camp prisoner whom he had a sadomasochistic relationship with and was her pseudo-protector. They recognize each other right away and the question becomes what will they do about it? The movie devolves from its tension inducing premise to a sensationalistic exploitation film. Don't get me wrong its leaps and bounds above Ilsa She Wolf of the SS (1975) but the intention is artistically the same and the fact that director Liliana Cavani tries to claw for deeper meanings beyond its trashy premise makes the film more manipulative than engrossing. There are references to the book of Mark and John the Baptist, a near naked ballet sequence of Mozart's Die Zauberflote and comparisons between Pelleas and Melisande all of which amount to a bucket of filth. It a film that attempts cultural literacy but makes the fatal mistake of being alienating, unpleasant and ultimately wearisome to watch.The Night Porter (1974) is not so much a movie as it is a forceful invitation into the minds of two severely damaged people. As the relationship between Max and Lucia turn into a despairing echo of what it used to be we see the extent of Lucia's Stockholm syndrome and the depths of Max's depravity. Yet what is forced upon us is the notion that this sordid love story 1 matters and 2 is tragic in a saccharine Romeo and Juliet kind of way.There is an uncomfortable, long-running juxtaposition between sadomasochism and Nazis. Perhaps it's because even today we equate Nazism with death, destruction and absolute authority. In some circles it's hard not to get aroused by staring death in the face (especially when it's carrying a whip). But while I'm sure this sexual predilection pre-dates The Night Porter, Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975) and The Producers (1967) I can't help but feel this kind of treatment makes light of the Nazis and their resoundingly negative contribution to world history. Perhaps instead of dressing up in black leather and swastikas it would be wise to downgrade to a Vichy Greatcoat and Kepi, you know, just in case a friend goes rummaging through your closet.Ultimately while the premise is intriguing and there are touches of artistic merit, The Night Porter is an insipid, opportunistic treatment of history. It makes menial attempts at making its characters believable and relatable but sequentially removes them from a realm of reality within the films final, grueling half hour. What should have been a movie about history, human frailty or lacking that credible love, became a kinky provocation offering little other than cheap thrills.http\/\/www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"25 February 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Imagine you live in Germany.
