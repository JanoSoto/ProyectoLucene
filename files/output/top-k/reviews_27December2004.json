Although many people my age may find it boring and a little babyish, I can't help but think of all the wonderful jokes in it, that make it suitable for not just toddlers and little children. The action and heroism of Peter Pan instantly makes children love him. Mr Darling is very funny, as is Captain Hook. The Darling children's personalities fit perfectly, making it a film I could watch over and over again. I especially love the crocodile - when I was a child I never noticed how hilarious he was, but now I laugh every time I see him! The graphics are good, the scene when they are flying over London is particularly good, where you see all the recognisable landmarks, and it really captures the sense of excitement in the children.However, some things I disliked. Firstly, although Peter is great for enchanting younger children, the way he is always in charge and boasts around being superior annoys me every time. The Lost Boys, also, in my opinion were not as good as they could have been, if they had been given the other half of their brains. Tinkerbell looked great, but she could have had a bigger role, and a less vain appearance.Other than that, I highly recommend this film!!

Gigi is a coltish teen in 1900's Paris who lives with her grandmother Madame Alvarez (Hermione Gingold) and who loves to hang out with family friend Gaston Lachaille (Louis Jourdan), an international jet-setter and playboy whose every relationship is documented in the papers. The pseudo-narrator of the film is Henri Lachaille (Maurice Chevalier), Gaston's uncle and a notorious playboy in his own right, who loves to give his nephew relationship advice, solicited or not. Gigi is being bred by her grandmother and aunt to become a refined woman so she can become a mistress for rich and powerful men, so it comes as both a surprise and delight to the women to discover that Gaston may be a suitable candidate. However, Gigi's innocence may not allow this to happen, as she struggles with making the transition between carefree girl to a refined lady with social responsibilities.Musicals are a rare genre on my films I adore list, but Gigi has long been a favorite film of mine, despite its sappy moments and sometimes corny jokes. What makes Gigi such a good film is its unmitigated Charm with a capital C; one can't help but grin a little when Chevalier sings Thank Heaven for Little Girls because he doesn't stop flashing that high voltage smile himself. And I cannot get through the scene between Chevalier and Gingold when they sing I Remember it Well by the seaside without tearing up because it is just so damn cute. Sure, the revelations and epiphanies are pretty easy and kind of out of nowhere, but considering it is an MGM musical from the 1950's, I would be surprised if there weren't these kinds of things. Everyone in the film looks like they are having a good time (particularly Chevalier), and the great Lerner-Loewe music against the Parisian backdrop is enough to sell me.Gigi, while being a 10-time Oscar winner (including Best Picture) has unfortunately been marginalized by some as a typical MGM fluff piece, could be a hard sell, particularly to the jaded Generation Y - and - younger audience. However, since I myself am probably one of the most cynical film-viewers I personally know of, take my word for it &#150; Gigi is a lot of fun, and a good way to spend two hours. 8\/10 --Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2004","score":"35 out of 45 people found the following review useful","review":" Directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring Leslie Caron as the title character, Gigi (1958) is nothing short of sweet and delightful.

Dennis Hopper is playing former sheriff Lefty Einright. The maniac's killed his brother's children in 73. They were Sally and Frank Hardesty. Now he's to avenge. It'll be some special revenge. The movie begins with two criminal parodies are driving the Texas road, shooting the road signs and listening to DJ Stretch's(Caroline Williams) station. Then they give her a call and start making troubles... They even appear to be so stupid to trouble the respective Mr. Leatherface and his survived brother after falling under truck in first part. Very soon they get sewed and pretty Stretch's taping all that noise as the hoodlums don't hang the phone. The crime's investigated but Lefty wants to start his private one. He's not with cops.

And Left hopes this will make the maniac's get out of their hiding-place. As all this is being prepared to start we get known to Drayton (Jim Siedow).

Later she'll appear in the underground purgatory where three sick bros and grandpa live. Lefty has already figured out the place and gets there. All you see after and saw before is really impressing... Now how all that looks. The acting is good and beautiful, nice photography, decoration and special make-up by Savinee. The score co-written by Hooper gives more good atmosphere. The script is very unordinary but shot believably to amazement if you're told the movie first and then just watch it. I loved this movie. Oh these seducing 80's! At least 12 years later maniac's live in a better house, look modern and have more to lay on table.

All the three bad guys are good especially Chop Top and Leather face, and Drayton perhaps for his commercial success has become a really kind maniac. Bill Johnson (Bubba) really gives extra performance. In the end we won't know what really happened to the heroes for sure. Well, they could hardly survive. Wait, no. Chop Top survived in the first part and this slight falling is not much for him. He'll do good. As for me, I prefer to consider them alive but not to see in such a stupid project like LeatherfaceTexas massacre 3. The second was the last good leatherface effort.

It was made when he was still finding his feet and style as a filmmaker. It is nevertheless a cracking thriller and a hugely entertaining film. Quite different from a lot of Hitchcock's thriller, the film doesn't throw you in at the deep end at the beginning. Hitchcock takes a good twenty or so minutes setting up the characters before even boarding the train. It seems to me that the plot of the lady vanishing is the McGuffin of the film and the main plot is the relationship between the main characters. It is also in the first twenty minutes when we see the typical Englishness of the piece &#150; complaining about weather\/board and talking cricket. The Lady Vanishes was Hitchcock's penultimate British film before leaving for America and it is up there with The 39 Steps as one of that era's best.When the film does board the train it turns into thriller\/mystery mode and Hitchcock shows an expertise in mystery and tension building worthy of his later, more famous thrillers. The train (as Hitchcock knows all too well) makes a great setting for a thriller. The tight environment, multiple carriages and constant movement allow for mystery, suspense and excitement &#150; view Hitchcock mix then all up when Redgrave's characters nearly gets mashed by an oncoming train as he attempts to move to another room by the outside.Hitchcock had a great talent when it came to casting his films. He filled his main and supporting characters with likable, charismatic people who were right for the roles. The Lady Vanishes is no exception in this regard. Lockwood and Redgrave have fine chemistry between them and create a duo which anchors the film. For a plot like this it would be essential for the main duo to be likable so the audience can follow them through their detective work and they do a great job in creating a likable duo. The snappy repartee between the two is perhaps the film's highlight.The film's editing is excellent. I find that in a lot of film like this the last act tends to drag as I become increasingly restless in wanting to know what the big secret is. The Lady Vanishes doesn't fall into this trap and runs very smoothly and doesn't outstay its welcome. The cinematography is also excellent. Although the shots are apparently fairly simple, one should consider the complexity of trying to get these shots done in such a tight enclosure and keep up the appearance that it is happening on a moving train. I haven't read or heard anything from experts about this film so I don't know whether Hitchcock used a real train or a stage with rear projection or something similar. But in the film itself I couldn't see any goofs that would ruin the film's illusion.You won't see this film top many best Hitchcock list because it isn't as artistically sound as a lot of his later works, but the film was made in 1938 just as international relations were reaching boiling point and there is certainly some subtext in the film about it. One can look at the scene were a man refuses to fight despite the enemy steadily approaching the train as an attack on the appeasement of the Nazi. Or the cricket chaps concern about their own trivialities and their refusal to get involve in the bigger, more important issue.The Lady Vanishes is a gripping yarn that is sure to absorb one's attention and excite as much (or even more) as any film made today. It doesn't trade off characters for action. It has an intelligent script with witty dialogue and distinct, memorable characters. The film does have a fair few plot holes like a lot of Hitchcock's thriller, but they don't matter while watching the film as he never gives your breath to think about them.

One can look at the scene were a man refuses to fight despite the enemy steadily approaching the train as an attack on the appeasement of the Nazi. Or the cricket chaps concern about their own trivialities and their refusal to get involve in the bigger, more important issue.The Lady Vanishes is a gripping yarn that is sure to absorb one's attention and excite as much (or even more) as any film made today. It doesn't trade off characters for action. It has an intelligent script with witty dialogue and distinct, memorable characters. The film does have a fair few plot holes like a lot of Hitchcock's thriller, but they don't matter while watching the film as he never gives your breath to think about them. He forces you to move along with the engaging plot. Whether one looks at the film as mere entertainment or as a commentary on the times, it is sure not to disappoint.

So when Connery decided to leave the role after 1967's You Only Live Twice, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had to find a replacement. After searching long and hard, they came upon male model George Lazenby. Unfortunately, for numerous reasons, Lazenby's first film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service turned out to be his only one and the producers were back to square one. The duo scored a major coup getting Connery to return for Diamonds Are Forever, but after that, Connery said that he was definitely done. So where to from there? The solution came with the casting of Roger Moore, best known for his role on The Saint. Moore had first been approached to play Bond way back in the early 1960's; the actor had even been one of Ian Fleming's original choices for the role. Moore would go on to play Bond for a record 7 times, but with his debut, 1973's Live and Let Die, the actor sought to put an original stamp on the character. The stories became more light-hearted, the gags were multiplied, and the overall tone became more comical. While it's a matter of personal taste as to whether or not this was a positive change, I believe that a good, if inconsistent, balance was stuck with LaLD.The movie opens with a laid-back pre-credits sequence in which three British agents are murdered in New York, Louisiana, and the fictional Caribbean island of San Monique. Bond is assigned to investigate the deaths; he travels to New York and is immediately a marked man. He soon learns that the architect behind all of this is a mysterious gangster known as Mr. Big, who we find out is actually San Monique's diplomat, Dr. Kananga, both played by Yaphet Kotto. After teaming up with old CIA buddy Felix Leiter and converting Kananga's psychic, Solitaire (Jane Seymour), Bond learns that Kananga hopes to increase the heroin market and make himself a multi-millionaire.After the convoluted disaster of the last film, Diamonds Are Forever, the small-scale nature of the plot of Live and Let Die is a big relief. Unfortunately, the movie meanders around a little too much in the first two acts and doesn't really get anywhere. The threat of a nuclear holocaust or WWIII is absent and while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, Moore doesn't convey the sense that his life is danger, even when he has a gun pointed at him. Director Guy Hamilton attempts to make up the lack of tension with several action scenes, but, like in all the other Bond films he directed, these come out forced and flat. The exception is the boat chase in the Louisiana bayous--while it's far too long and not terribly exciting, the stunt work is top-notch and it contains the infamous sequence where Bond jumps over the backs of crocodiles to escape certain death.The worst offenders include a bizarre action scene on an airport runway and the downright terrible finale in some second-rate underground base. The faults with the ending are almost too numerous to list it feels tacked on, the dialogue is hokey, Kananga comes to possibly the dumbest end in the series, and any sense of adversity is erased as the villain treats Bond like an old chum. Remember, this is after Bond has just ruined Kananga's operation, not to mention the two of them had been at odds since the start. But it's not just the climax that's a disappointment.Barring the fact that the movie takes little from the excellent novel of the same name, the pace is at times sluggish, with subplots being developed that don't amount to much. The Rosie Carver affair is one such case; not only does it feature horrendous acting from Gloria Hendry, it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The fashions and expressions are almost permanently stuck in the 1970's and while every film becomes associated with the time period they were made in, LaLD's bell-bottoms and Afros are distracting. Finally, the character of J. W. Pepper (played by Clifton James) is superfluous, and it gets annoying when attention is placed on some redneck sheriff instead of our favourite spy. So in spite of all these complaints, why do I still rate the film so highly?Clearly, I'm not a fan of Guy Hamilton's directing; I personally would've campaigned for a change of direction after Diamonds Are Forever. That being said, Live and Let Die is Hamilton's best Bond movie for a number of reasons, chief among them being the low-key nature of the plot. The film doesn't contain any killer satellites or clones; there isn't even any Q. But this of lack of gadgets forces Bond to rely on his own skills, like when he improvises a flamethrower. That's not to say that there are no toys for Bond to play with; there's the usual inventive use of a watch.Probably the best and most memorable aspect of the film is the title song, performed by Paul McCartney and Wings. The tune is instantly recognizable and so good that Guns'N'Roses even recorded a cover version of it. The supernatural elements are interesting and give the film a distinct feel while the actors\/characters are perfect for the setting; Yaphet Kotto makes a menacing Kananga (before the character assassination at the end), David Hedison is one of the better Leiters' (he would later return for Licence To Kill), and Jane Seymour is stunning as Solitaire (and gives in a good performance as well).What we've got to remember is that Bond movies work best when they entertain, and Live and Let Die definitely does that. Aside from the inevitable faults, the film's style fits Moore's interpretation and while the actor was just finding his footing, the movie is still entertaining to watch. 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For most people, Sean Connery was James Bond, secret agent 007.

Hot on Leo's heels for control of the town is Johnny Caspar (John Polito), and to make matters worse, Leo is making bad decisions regarding crooked booker Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro), whom Caspar wants dead. We find out that Leo is keeping Bernie protected because he is involved with Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). However, when it is revealed that Tom and Verna are an item, Leo and Tom break ties, resulting in Tom trying to play both sides against each other in order to ensure his own survival.While Millers Crossing does not yet show the signature eccentricities of their later films, the Coen brothers' dark humor is definitely present, as is their unabashed use of violence. Their excellent use of music in their films is on prominent display here, particularly in the incredible Danny Boy sequence that I remember rewinding several times the first few times I rented the movie years ago. Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography is beautiful, whether it is a forest scene or simply a short scene in Tom's apartment.

I watched this film like I do every other film, piece by piece. I can never watch a film full through unless I am in a movie theater, so I just pick up where I leave off. Amelie takes place in Montmartre, France. Where Amelie (Audrey Tatou) lives in an interesting apartment with a odd artist neighbor (Serge Merlin) who as they say has Bones of Glass. Amelie works in a restaurant with hypochondriac co-worker Gorgette (Isabelle Nanty), owner Suzanne (Claire Maurier), and waitress Gina (Clotilde Mollet)She also visits her father (Rufus) often. One day, Amelie finds a tin box from a cut out place in her wall, and she dedicates herself to finding the owner. Finally, she finds the owner (Maurice Bénichou). After seeing the happiness she has caused him to have, she dedicates her life to helping people in the process, and oddly enough eventually falls in love with a young man called Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz).Now I know I really didn't give a huge summary of the film, but I didn't want to spoil all of it for everone. Audrey Tatou gives her arguably her greatest performance. I love this film, because it is a very sweet film. It loves the good things of live like for instance love. This movie has to be one of the top twenty love stories of all time in my opinion. It is definitely a feel good film. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great love story. Amelie is not necessarily a 10 film, but it is sure close to it. There are some things I didn't like (mostly the use of animation in the film though it was only for like thrity seconds.) However, Amelie is winning film with great performances, and it deserved that Foreign Language film Oscar.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2004","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Amelie, what a unique romance and one hell of a good film.

This movie begins with the effort to break the sound barrier, something the Soviets, the British, the French and other countries were attempting to do after WWII. From that basis, we get a glimpse into the psyche of men who flew to push the edge of the envelope. These men were the Christopher Columbuses of their age. They ventured into the unknown with absolutely NO guarantee of either success or their survival.Once Yeager broke the sound barrier, jets became faster and went higher but the ultimate was to go into space. The New Frontier as JFK thought of it. At its heart, this movie is about the Mercury space program and the race to put men into orbit and fulfill JFK's, and America's, dream of putting a man on the moon. While the men ARE definitely macho; having met Chuck Yeager and Alan Shepard in person, as well as other astronauts, and having been an aviator in the Navy, I can speak with first-hand knowledge that the portrayal of these men is dead on, but incomplete because it does not show the human side we all have, also. Is some of it posturing to cover up any fears and anxiety? Absolutely! But, it's also the mechanisms developed to allow them to boldly go where no man has gone before. Sputnik's launch was another anxiety moment for America because it was our Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union, that launched it. Additionally, it was also recognized that putting a satellite into space would lead to where we are today. Spy satellites orbiting alongside defense satellites orbiting alongside commercial satellites. Peaceful means with defense needs. Sputnik's launch made all this possible and refusing to recognize that the Soviet Union's intent was not peaceful is to attempt to rewrite history without acknowledging the facts in evidence both then and now.The Right Stuff shows some of the warts of Mercury program. America was feeling its way at that time. Were all the tests done on the astronauts necessary? No. But, did they glean the wheat from the chaff? Yes. Was it a perfect process? Absolutely not, but we did, overall, select some tremendous leaders to lead our way into space. They also became some great business and political leaders; that cannot be denied regardless of political stripe.Egos aside, this movie is a good look at the heroism exhibited daily by the Mercury astronauts. Who else could we get to ride on top of an unproven rocket like the Atlas for the first orbit of the earth by an American? Gus Grissom is seen as the hard luck person he ultimately ended up being; however, don't question the man's competency or his heroism. He died in service to his country and was one of the smartest men in the space program.Historically, this movie is fairly accurate. It shows LBJ's ego accurately. It shows the heroism and bravery of our astronauts. It shows the fears America was feeling at that time regarding the Cold War, the Soviet Union and our place in the post-WWII world. It shows the successes and the failures of the space program in its infancy. It definitely shows the brave men who led our country into space. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but if you want a good overview that will ignite your desire to learn more about our space program, this movie will definitely do it.

The bears are the stars of the show, with some excellent costume puppetry and some great characters (my favourite is Zeb, who plays a mean fiddle).

Joe Strummer from The Clash started wearing a Mohawk in about 1979 but his was inspired by Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver and Richie's style of Mohawk didn't come into fashion until the second wave of punk hit in around 1980 with bands like The Exploited, etc. Also, The Who were definitely one of the bands that inspired seventies punk but it was the visceral, anarchic, guitar-trashing pop mayhem of the early Who that we were listening to (yeah, I was one of those 13-year old punks in 1977) and not the bombastic, overblown stadium rock of 'Baba O'Riley' which Richie adopts as his mantra, and which effectively becomes the film's theme song.

The characters are imaginative, convincing, and well-explored; the presentation is appropriately emotive. The plot, however, has a bit of a slow start, but persist with it, and you'll be rewarded.Benny (Aidan Quinn) is a young man who is watching his life slowly pass him by. He is trapped in his hometown, constantly forced to worry about the safety and wellbeing of his sister, Joon (beatifully played by Mary Stuart Masterson), who is mentally ill. Torn between his thirst for life and his love and concern for his sister, Benny is finally persuaded to begin searching for an asylum for her. At this interval, however, he finds himself playing host to a friend's cousin (Johnny Depp), an eccentric and active young man who makes fast friends with Joon. The story unfolds in an emotive and colourful fashion, and makes for quite a memorable cinematic experience.It is acting, however, that makes this film a good one. Quinn and Masterson are both wonderfully deep and emotional as the leads, and put some heart into what would have otherwise been a rather bog-standard script. Depp inserts a pervasive element of zany, unpredictable humour, an aspect that he has come to play recurrently in recent times. Julianne Moore and William H. Macy are solid, convincing supporting characters, providing a good background to the theatrical virtuosity of the others.Stick with BENNY AND JOON. It may seem a little lethargic at first, but will grow into a touching, memorable and thoroughly enjoyable film. 8\/10.

The plot, however, has a bit of a slow start, but persist with it, and you'll be rewarded.Benny (Aidan Quinn) is a young man who is watching his life slowly pass him by. He is trapped in his hometown, constantly forced to worry about the safety and wellbeing of his sister, Joon (beatifully played by Mary Stuart Masterson), who is mentally ill. Torn between his thirst for life and his love and concern for his sister, Benny is finally persuaded to begin searching for an asylum for her. At this interval, however, he finds himself playing host to a friend's cousin (Johnny Depp), an eccentric and active young man who makes fast friends with Joon. The story unfolds in an emotive and colourful fashion, and makes for quite a memorable cinematic experience.It is acting, however, that makes this film a good one. Quinn and Masterson are both wonderfully deep and emotional as the leads, and put some heart into what would have otherwise been a rather bog-standard script. Depp inserts a pervasive element of zany, unpredictable humour, an aspect that he has come to play recurrently in recent times. Julianne Moore and William H. Macy are solid, convincing supporting characters, providing a good background to the theatrical virtuosity of the others.Stick with BENNY AND JOON. It may seem a little lethargic at first, but will grow into a touching, memorable and thoroughly enjoyable film. 8\/10.

The only way it is a continuation is when we pick up from the end of the first movie. I have watched several before and after Sister Act 2. The movie is still great, and love it. I have just watched it again as I am writing this. The story of her helping the school that she had went to school when she was young is well done. But there's a couple of things that I think should have be edited better. The first one is when Mary Clarence finds out about the school closing through Crisp and the Archdiocese members, discussing it between themselves over ice cream. Then when the kids learn of it later. Then nothing is done of it until the sisters learn that the school had won choir competitions and entered them in the All State in LA. How did we\/they make the connection of it?The second one is the story behind Rita and her mother. The story line is stupid. Growing up, my parents didn't try to stop me for going for my dreams. But when a mother tells her daughter that she can sing or be in a choir, that woman needs a major attitude adjustment. Not every 16 or 17 year old doesn't know what they want to do. And when confronted by the teacher, she should have a heart to listen. Course, the script was written that way and the full story was there. I understand that completely. And before the editing, the story was clean. But afterward, the story will have a different meaning as well and should have had the continuity checked.

Which is a shame, really, given that films such as Lightning Jack are far more interesting than the million retellings of the Wyatt Earp legend, simply because it didn't take itself so seriously. However, after the best part of a decade spent entertaining his countrymen on television, Paul Hogan was ready to hit the big time with a feature film. His feature film struck quite a chord with the local audience, in spite of being simplistic to the bone.Crocodile Dundee relates the simple story of a hunter living in the most remote part of Australia. The story received by one American journalist, prompting her to come and see the man herself, turns out to be slightly exaggerated, but everything else about the man seems more fairytale than real. We are treated to some brief sequences showing how Dundee copes with situations that, while seeming extraordinary to the American journalist, are mundane to him. The sequence with the Kangaroo and the poachers is a classic, and there's even a clever cameo from Ernie Dingo.About a third of the way into the film, we get an abrupt change of gears, and the action shifts to New York. The premise being to put the straightest shooter into a facade-riddled place, and seeing how he copes with the change. Unfortunately, there are times when it goes a little too far, and simple common sense regarding social interaction winds up going out the door. Sure, the joke is a little funny, but it cheapens the character quite badly.Thankfully, the film recovers when Dundee, the character, gets more in tune with his environment. In particular, the infamous that's not a knife scene shows a canniness about the way the world works that we would have to wait another couple of sequels to see again. The comedy here is very stereotypical, but it has a pure heart about it, so it works. Hogan himself was on Australian television recently, introducing a compilation of his old shows, a speech in which he stated how much better the world was before political correctness. When we see a comedy in which an aborigine makes comedy out of the old please don't take my photo bit, or the New Yorker likens a white Australian to Tarzan, we can only nod in agreement.If there is one problem with the film, and it is a small one, it is that the characters aren't really developed to any real degree. They seem more like puppets in a sketch, mainly made to recite a series of predetermined actions in the hope it will produce a laugh. Experiments in computing along these lines were begun around the time this film was being made, and the limitations became apparent in a hurry. Once the surface has been scratched, there is not a lot else to get out of Crocodile Dundee.In all, I gave Crocodile Dundee a six out of ten. When you cannot predict what will happen next, it is a lot of fun. When you can predict what will happen next, the laughs dry up. Still, Hogan isn't taking himself too seriously here, and that's what makes all the difference.
