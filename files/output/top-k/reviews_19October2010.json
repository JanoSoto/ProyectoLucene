The reason for this is clear those were times of upheaval. Times of change and revolution, in which old structures and ideas were being put to the test every day and in every possible way, something that doesn't appear evident now. For that reason many people ignore that 2001 included a few features, innovations, proper to that era and only to it. Some had their day in the sun and then disappeared, hardly leaving any trace, while others not only remained but thrived on--as computers and some present means of remote communication. Kubrick used both categories in the making of this film, especially two of the former, and which play an important role in the film.One of the things that didn't work out in the end was Cinerama, a projection system using 3 cameras and a giant concave screen. At the time that was the current fad, a spectacular innovation which everyone thought would be the future in the movie making industry. But what happened to it at the end was similar to what happened to that other unrealistic dream of the times, the Concorde supersonic plane. As it would be the case, Cinerama didn't come to stay. But nobody knew that at the time, neither Kubrick; and assuming this would be an unavoidable fixture of the trade for decades to come, he decided to exploit such innovation to its full potential, trying to make of his creation a visually unforgettable experience; He wanted 2001 to be unique, overwhelming to the senses to the point of being metaphysical. So, he created an art work that could only be enjoyed and appreciated in that system alone. Unfortunately, not only Cinerama died out but also the movies came to our homes, so most reviewers have seen 2001 only on TV and they judge it for what they see. As for me, I was lucky enough to watch it how it was meant to be watched. And I did it from the first rows of seats! I must say, the experience was truly overwhelming I could actually see myself floating in space. And when you have lived through that eerie feeling you forget the obvious flaws of the film, the wooden acting, the boring dialogue, as all along there will be another sensually rewarding experience, visual or sonic, waiting for you, in a few minutes time, during which you are ready to forgive anything coming your way from the screen. That's what Kubrick intended his viewers to see, hear, experience, and that's not what they are getting nowadays in their plasma screens.The other thing I was referring to was, obviously, space travel. Coming at a moment when the race to the moon had reached a critical stage, at a time when the travel to other planets seemed for the first time in History a realistic possibility, an end finally at hand's reach, Kubrick decided to include in the film a handful of now boring but instructive scenes describing regular routines in cruising spaceships--people walking on walls, like cockroaches in a motel room, etc.-which were meant for us to get used to ideas and experiences that&#x97;everybody thought&#x97;would be customary for mankind during the next decades. But of course that wasn't meant to be, and no wonder why so many of these scenes seem superfluous now, when ordinary people have a snowball's chance in hell of even orbiting the Earth. Some reviewers here try to get over all that unpleasantness--unfulfilled promises, frustrated dreams, etc--pretending to themselves that what they are watching is really art, pure art; even abstract art; that there must be some profound meaning here, somewhere, some philosophical quest or purpose. Sorry folks, but such scenes were tacked there only to instruct us about what we would likely find when leaving Earth. That's what 2001 was trying to tell us, what was trying to be to us Space Travel 101. Without the promise of travelling to space, the scenes become pedestrian, even useless. That's why the sumptuous visuals are the stars here, not the actors, the dialogue or the plot. And the computers too. And there it was, Hal. At a time when most of its kind--mainly IBM 360s-occupied an entire room and were barely capable of doing mathematical work, this rebellious wannabe of a machine was able to behave like a human, or better, and so he became an overnight sensation. He did steal the show; we may even say he was the hero, even if a mischievous one. I still recall the press articles prior to the opening and the conversations after, and (it seems incredible now) all the talk was about that smart robot turning the tables on the astronauts. People didn't care much about the rest, except for the cool wheel and the Blue Danube. Ah, and of course the monkeys.When rating 2001, maybe I should give it a 10, but I can't. Kubrick made a big bet, here, and he lost. And when you lose a bet you gotta pay. He bet on Cinerama, on the visuals; on the sensually metaphysical experience, on the mysteries he threw at us without making sure they were true mysteries, while neglecting plot, characters, dialogue. All those things that unfortunately became ever more important as Cinerama faded away, even more so when audiences left the theaters, went back home and turned on the DVD player.

His character wasn't funny to me, he was just randomly speaking in a stuttering tone and looked foolish. I didn't care for his character was he was rather annoying. The protagonist Peter wasn't all that great either. He complained far too much and was just boring. His friends Michael Bolton and Amir were also annoying and typical. I also didn't get Joanna and her significance to the story. It seemed very easy and odd how easy it was for Peter to get her.One thing about the movie is its humour, its very dull humour and the film was quite boring at times. It picked up on the parts when Peter told Michael and Amir that they were gonna get fired, so they try to commit crimes into the system by stealing the software and money. A few funny scenes were with the music, especially the scene with the friends smashing the printer outside while the song was slowly playing. That was pretty clever. But in general the film is basically just filled with stereotypes the annoying voices over the cube walls, other people's music, the guy with the name no one can pronounce, the guy with the same name as someone famous (I never thought about it before, that does seem to happen a lot), and the executive who has no idea how to run the division.I also didn't buy the ending.

Fantastic to look at virtually every frame. The Music by Ry Cooder is one of the best movie soundtracks in the history of cinema; it's simply brilliant.The plot (or story, if you like) of this film is essentially very simple. You get to the end and you say to yourself yes, of course. It's not about loss, separation, grieving, that would be too obvious. Remember - this film comes from a time before movies got clever with their audiences. In the end this film is what it seems; about a father who has to come to terms with, and do something about, the fact that he wasn't fitted for a relationship with the mother of his son. There aren't many other themes (although one would be the sub-story of Stantons brother and sister in law who have adopted the boy and see him pretty much as their son. The sister in law wonders what will become of their relationship if the boy goes away). The only possible outcome is the one arrived at in the final memorable and superb monologue.The thing for me about Paris, Texas is that; like Harry Dean Stantons' character - time changes a person. Since I first saw this movie in the cinema in 1985 my age has doubled and I now have a child of the same age as the boy in the film (also wonderfully acted). I see this film very differently now to the way I viewed it back then. Any father would see resonances from Stanton to their own life. I love this film for the way it makes me think about the way I relate to those who are close to me; Can I handle it? What would happen if I couldn't? Nevertheless - Paris, Texas is not for me one of the greatest films ever made, and it is not in my collection of DVD\/BluRay. Why? Yes - its set in a decaying landscape both emotionally and physically. Yes - Stanton is wonderful as the lost guy coming out of the wilderness, BUT. Near the beginning of the film the doctor extorts money from Stantons brother - who is a long way from home and finds that he has to pay the doctor in order to complete his mission. The whole film is like this; there is feeling of moral and emotional blackmail running right through and all the adult characters have been afflicted, damaged if you like, by emotional blackmail to a lesser or greater degree. The only one who hasn't is the little boy. These tensions are revealed but not resolved. Even though its obvious that the issues cannot be resolved you get to the end and you feel irritated when indeed they are not. The question which you feel ought to be the central one - why Stanton walks out on his former life - turns out not to be - it's only the spark that sets the flame. The viewer is thus caught up in the emotional blackmail too; we want to see resolution - but.... However, I guess it is clever for that....I liked the film and I would highly recommend it. I haven't read any other reviews here on this movie (and I will be interested to do so as soon as I post this...).

Fantastic to look at virtually every frame. The Music by Ry Cooder is one of the best movie soundtracks in the history of cinema; it's simply brilliant.The plot (or story, if you like) of this film is essentially very simple. You get to the end and you say to yourself yes, of course. It's not about loss, separation, grieving, that would be too obvious. Remember - this film comes from a time before movies got clever with their audiences. In the end this film is what it seems; about a father who has to come to terms with, and do something about, the fact that he wasn't fitted for a relationship with the mother of his son. There aren't many other themes (although one would be the sub-story of Stantons brother and sister in law who have adopted the boy and see him pretty much as their son. The sister in law wonders what will become of their relationship if the boy goes away). The only possible outcome is the one arrived at in the final memorable and superb monologue.The thing for me about Paris, Texas is that; like Harry Dean Stantons' character - time changes a person. Since I first saw this movie in the cinema in 1985 my age has doubled and I now have a child of the same age as the boy in the film (also wonderfully acted). I see this film very differently now to the way I viewed it back then. Any father would see resonances from Stanton to their own life. I love this film for the way it makes me think about the way I relate to those who are close to me; Can I handle it? What would happen if I couldn't? Nevertheless - Paris, Texas is not for me one of the greatest films ever made, and it is not in my collection of DVD\/BluRay. Why? Yes - its set in a decaying landscape both emotionally and physically. Yes - Stanton is wonderful as the lost guy coming out of the wilderness, BUT. Near the beginning of the film the doctor extorts money from Stantons brother - who is a long way from home and finds that he has to pay the doctor in order to complete his mission. The whole film is like this; there is feeling of moral and emotional blackmail running right through and all the adult characters have been afflicted, damaged if you like, by emotional blackmail to a lesser or greater degree. The only one who hasn't is the little boy. These tensions are revealed but not resolved. Even though its obvious that the issues cannot be resolved you get to the end and you feel irritated when indeed they are not. The question which you feel ought to be the central one - why Stanton walks out on his former life - turns out not to be - it's only the spark that sets the flame. The viewer is thus caught up in the emotional blackmail too; we want to see resolution - but.... However, I guess it is clever for that....I liked the film and I would highly recommend it.

One difference between the two films is that Dazed and Confused is a period-piece, filmed in 1993 it takes place in 1976, and directer Richard Linklater does a marvelous job capturing the habits, the styles and the attitudes of the era. In that regard maybe this movie is more inspired by American Graffiti than Fast Times at Ridgemont. But it doesn't matter because to me D&C is the best of them all.This movie seems to be as personal to Linklater as it is to me, and its not so much about plot or big scenes as it is about realism and the overall flow...and it flows beautifully. The movie follows a group of high school juniors and another group of 8th graders (next years seniors and freshmen)through the events surrounding the last day of school in Austin, Texas in 1976 (the whole film takes place in approximately 24 hours). We observe the hazing, the partying, some introspective banter and many familiar rituals as the characters prepare not just for the summer, but for the next school year and beyond. This was the same general time period I was in high school, so this movie had a special impact on me. At this point I need to mention Wooderson (McConaughey,in his film debut), a key character, he's that 20-something dude that still hangs with the high school crowd. Did every town in America have a guy like this or what? Wood, Dawson, Slater, Pickford; these guys all remind me of guys I grew up with in my hometown. The greatness of this film is that it rings so true...the way the jocks party with the freaks (or grits' as they were also called where I grew up), the way they just aimlessly cruise around in muscle cars until they find out where the party's at, or the mailbox bashing (here it was beer bottles thrown at signs), or even the bottle cap flipping...we did that all the time! The only thing i didn't see was a bong. (besides the one Slater was making in shop class..HEY, we did that too!) Yeah thats right -joints are better for cruising anyway.This is the kind of movie to rent on one of those Friday nights where you have to work early the next day. I first rented this movie on one of those very nights. Its a great Friday night movie and why not? No heavy handed plot, lots of partying and good music, and it makes you feel good. Speaking of the soundtrack...Linklater makes great use of period music; We get the gamut of 70s pop\/rock including Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, ZZ Top, War, Dylan and even Black oak Arkansas (remember them?)....Jim dandy to the rescue! This movie really took me back.Dazed and Confused is also a bit of a curio because of all the young actors (who were all unknown at the time) who went on to star in other movies. You will see Matthew McConaughey (his best performance ever), Ben Affleck, Parker Posey (she's a riot), Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams and Milla Jovavich (ok,i'm reaching now), among others. My only complaint involving the cast is that Wiley Wiggins' (as Mitch Kramer) mannerisms are a bit irritating, but other than that everyone does a tremendous job. This movie has become like a fascinating time capsule about that post-revolutionary decade of the 70s, a decade filled with great music, movies and television (seriously, what the heck has happened to entertainment in this country?)... so its worth viewing for historical and social aspects as well as its entertainment value.But anyway, I hope you enjoy one of my personal favorites...a really cool, funny and realistic look at what teenage life was like in so many towns in America in the mid-70s.It may be set in Texas, but it could just as easily be Ohio.

Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2010","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story.

It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't.

For those of you not familiar with the storyline, it revolves around the attempts of three rouges to find a missing fortune in Confederate gold in New Mexico during the Civil War. The 2003 DVD has an excellent audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel, who also collaborated with Eastwood on a definitive Eastwood biography. I gave this film a 10 out of 10 star ranking in IMDb. It scored 20 points in my ranking system, placing it in fourth place all time. Here's the Good - Eli Wallach and Leone created one of the great villains in the history of cinema. Tuco is equal parts amoral scourge, paisan sympatico and stand up comic. The only characters in the history of Westerns that compare are Little Bill in Unforgiven, Judge Roy Bean in The Westerner and Joe Erin in Vera Cruz. Gene Hackman and Walter Brennan both won Best Supporting Actor Oscars for those performances. If the Academy ever decides to start handing out retroactive awards, this would be a good place to start. - The movie is notable for launching Clint Eastwood to life long international superstardom. Eastwood went on to direct and star in two Westerns that occupy the second and third places in my all time list, Unforgiven and The Outlaw Josie Wales. If not for the success of TGTBTU, those films might not exist. - The best soundtrack in the history of Westerns.....the signature laughing hyena, the eerie whistling, the soaring mariachi trumpets, and most importantly, the twangy guitar solo and macho male chorus constantly driving the plot forward. Other than the theme from The Magnificent Seven, this is only Western soundtrack to become a part of the general popular culture. Hugo Montenegro's cover version reached number two on the Billboard charts in 1968. - I call Leone's counterpoint between the long, flowing episodes of deep sentimentality and short bursts of graphic violence John Ford on steroids. Coppola would copy this technique several years later in an even more gruesome scene in The Godfather. - Fantastic 10 minute opening sequence with no dialog, a homage to Rio Bravo and Comanche Station. This is bookended at the film's climax by another spellbinding five minutes with no dialog. - I admire Leone's bold decision not to sandwich in a gratuitous female romantic interest. Last all guy Western until Brokeback Mountain (just kidding). - This may be the first Vietnam Western. This is impressive, since in 1965 when the story was conceived and written, opposition to the war was not yet fashionable. - This was a watershed film for Westerns in terms of realism. It wasn't the first one to completely break with production code restraints, but it was the first popular and successful Western to do so. There would be no going back to the world where justice always prevails in the end, everyone's wardrobe is perfectly pressed, bullet wounds are bloodless and there are no gratuitous graphic rapes. - Brilliant casting of Lee Van Cleef, a minor actor in many Westerns from the golden age of the '50's, including High Noon, The Bravados, The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Ride Lonesome. His presence is one of many Leone homages in the movie to classic Westerns (including a number of references to 1948's Yellow Sky). The presentation of Van Cleef's facial features as sculpture reminds me of Boetticher's use of Randolph Scott in the Ranown cycle of films. - The best use of the Civil War ever in a Western. The only competitors I'm aware of are Dances With Wolves, Major Dundee and Escape From Fort Bravo. - It's impressive that the portrayal of the Civil War battle is realistically based on the Battle of Glorieta Pass, which took place in New Mexico in 1862. It is often falsely thought that this movie is set in Texas, where there were no major Civil War battles. This misinformation, spread by Leone himself apparently, has deceived some critics into thinking the basic setting of the movie is implausible. - Finally, of the five Leone Westerns, this is the perfect blend of Leone's distinctive style with a clever, fast moving and entertaining plot. The other four movies are all fine films, but the first two Dollar movies were very low budget and Leone's style was still evolving. Meanwhile, in Duck, You Sucker and Once Upon A Time in the West, Leone disconnected himself from the needs of his commercial audience. Leone was quoted by his biographer, Richard Frayling, as saying that he made OUTITW for cineastes only. TGTBTU is satisfying for both scholars and popular audiences. The Bad and the Ugly - I don't have much negative to say about this film. I've read critics who feel it is too long, that the story's not interesting enough, that the Tuco character is irritating. that Wallach's acting is hammy and that the premise of three criminals riding around loose during the Civil War is implausible. I don't think any of these arguments hold water. When it was released in the U.S. in 1968, it was roundly panned for its excessive violence. These complaints seem laughably quaint today in light of the orgy of graphic cinematic gore and sadism that has engulfed filmdom since the late '60's.

Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace Sandy Claws on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels.

This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain.

You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as Beetlejuice.

Halloween has just ended in his hometown of Halloween Town, and he has been receiving kudos from everyone in town for making this year's Halloween the scariest ever. But Jack is seeking purpose in his life, and scaring people to death once a year just isn't doing it for him anymore. He takes a walk in the woods and he discovers a group of trees each with doors and different symbols on each door. He opens the door with the tree symbol on it, and finds himself in Christmas Town. While there, he is fascinated by the contrast of Christmas Town with his own world. Jack returns home, along with a sampling of trinkets from Christmas Town, to contemplate the meaning of what he has found there. Ultimately he decides that this year, Halloween Town is going to take charge of Christmas. Jack has also decided that he will replace Sandy Claws on his yearly sleigh ride, delivering presents to all of the children of the world. All of the citizens of Halloween Town are enthused by the idea except Sally, a creation of Halloween Town's mad scientist, who coincidentally is also looking for something new in her life. She alone sees the danger of Halloween Town hijacking the Christmas holiday.While the Grinch tried to destroy Christmas and came away with a true understanding of the meaning of the holiday, Jack Skellington, with the best of intentions, is on the road to ruin Christmas. In preparation for the big event, he enlists the townspeople to help make toys, and they just can't get the hang of making or doing anything that is not designed to terrify. In fact, when Jack makes his Christmas ride and the town hears on the radio of the terror Jack is causing, they actually see this as a sign of success. To them, horror equals happiness.Like most good films designed for all age groups, the movie is actually weaving a tale on two levels. The story itself is very straightforward so that children can easily follow it. On a second level, there is deft humor and one-liners that are obviously aimed at adults, such as the mayor's plea to Jack -I'm only an elected official here! I can't make decisions! Or when the scientist who created Sally gets tired of her running away and builds a new creation to replace her. This one turns out to be just a female version of the mad scientist himself to which he has endowed half of his own brain. His conclusion is You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally. We'll have conversations worth having. You'll see quite a bit of similarity between the style of art design here and that done in some of Tim Burton's other films, such as Beetlejuice. You'll also probably recognize Danny Elfman's style of score that has come to decorate so many of Burton's other films. I highly recommend this film as great entertainment for the whole family.

One day she accidentally gets her hight heel shoe stuck in a manhole and a taxi man drops his ice cream in the car and hits a bin that nearly kills Mary. Suddenly a handsome doctor named Steve(Eddie)Edison comes to sweep her off her feet and to her rescue and she is smitten by him,but the problem is his engaged to be married to another woman who happens to be Mary's clients(Oh No).Anyway while his fiancé goes off for a week Mary spends some more time with Steve and she begins to fall in love with him. Mary of course is supposed to be engaged to Marcello(Justin Chambers who was in Greys Anatomy as Alex who is sporting a fake Italian accent that is so bad you couldn't help but laugh). Of course you know that she ends up with Steve in the end which is so cute yet kinda wrong as she stoled someone else's fiancée who was so stupid she decides to not marry him after and goes off on their honeymoon on their own.I think Hollywood is running out of ideas when it comes to making Romcoms as they are loosely based on the same thing again and again.Having said the above I thought it was a cute Rom com that will have you either loving it or hating it. Matthew McConnaghey was hot in this and J-Lo was a bit wooden in some parts but still she's just acting like the same character again and again.Nothing new here but still worth watching on a lazy afternoon.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2010","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" OK so I saw this a few years ago on TV and it was on last night so I decided to watch it because I liked Jennifer Lopez in Maid in Manhattan and I am a hopeless romantic.The wedding planner is about a young woman named Mary Flores(J-Lo) who is an ambitious and hardworking wedding planner who tries to create the perfect wedding for her clients.

Why is this funny? Well, because although I could suspend disbelieve and accept the romance (after all, he WAS Cary Grant!!), what I could not believe in the least was when the extremely British and erudite Grant posed as a guy from Oregon!!!! Come one....give me a break! That's like having Marjorie Main playing the Princess Anastasia! This is a film that is perhaps a bit less suspenseful than most of Hitchcock's other films. After all, the film is not about murder! Instead, it's about someone trying to implicate a retired thief (Grant) in a new string of copycat cat burglaries. No one seems to believe him (except, perhaps, John Williams' character) and so Grant decides to investigate himself. This plan of Grant's brings him to a wealthy American and her gorgeous daughter (Kelly)...and much of the film is dedicated to this romance. In this sense, this is also atypical of the usual Hitchcock film.Believe it or not, the film is really less of a mystery and more of a sexy and deliberately paced film featuring a beautiful couple in extremely beautiful locations along the French Riviera. The mystery itself is nice enough but the elegant journey to the conclusion is the reason to see the film. And I must say it was very enjoyable--and I wish Hitchcock had done more films like this (North By Northwest has elements of this but doesn't carry it far enough--though I prefer this film). What I also loved was the very sexy and double-entendre laced dialog--as well as the Freudian imagery for sex sprinkled throughout the film. Hitchcock was really trying to tweak the censors' noses with this one--and it's a great joke that not everyone might get (such as the scene with the exploding fireworks). As a result, it's a film that deserves to be held in a much higher esteem--while it lacks great suspense, it more than makes up for it in style and romance.By the way, get a load of Cary at the costume ball.

Remember, I am not saying that in a good way. I believe that the best films come out as teamwork, and I even count the audience as part of the team. (After all, it's audience expectation that drives the filmmakers.) But it is also possible for the director to stamp his authority on the production, and the result is usually vanity showcases rather than proper films. I'm afraid this is the fate of the Clint Eastwood film.But it's strange too, because the Eastwood vanity comes across as unique. He is not really a director. He is first and foremost a star persona, and this was cemented through the man with no name character of the spaghetti westerns, and later augmented through Dirty Harry. He creates a mystique of quiet strength through minimalist expression, squint-eyed stares, dialogue that comes across as scowls etc. With slight modifications here and there, Clint has played this same character throughout his career, be it sheriff, convict, boxing trainer, farmer, and in the case of the film in question, burglar. Not to complain, because he does it well enough, and with enough verisimilitude to keep us interested. But the problem is that he directs the same way as he acts. It's a minimalist kind of direction, with almost no flashy highlights. There may be emphasis here and there, but it's always understated, like the intermittent scowls of the actor. He does it film after film, and there seems to be nobody to tell him that he should direct and not just carry his star persona along with him in the director's chair. It really is a dictatorship here. For anyone else, this is a recipe for disaster. But the confidence of Clint is monumental, and this is what carries him through. Most of his films are duds, even though oddly engaging in places. Only once in a while a script comes along that suits his style, so we get gems like Play Misty For Me and Million Dollar Baby. But the film in question is probably his worst of all. It's called Absolute Power, but it's got nothing about politicians exercising full reign. It is better seen as the director exercising his own absolute power over his product, via his star persona, and ruining it in the process.It's a sensational premise \u2013 a burglar witnessing a high profile crime and cover-up. From this point on it needs fireworks to fly from the directorial chair. Instead we're treated to the same ponderous character studies of the Eastwoodian bent \u2013 dipping but not probing. If it's character that he's concerned with, he should have paid attention to the Luther Whitney character.

After a point we stop believing in the plot, and we stop caring for the characters too, because no effort is made in this direction.

This movie breaks all barriers that stands in the way as we embark on viewing two lovers able to overcome their betrayals no matter how big the consequences are. And unlike some other vampire movies that are not worth mentioning, this one delivers what it promises as it adapts to one of the greatest vampire novels of all time and one novel that you can absorb to while reading it.Set in Romania in 1462, nobleman Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) has come home from his victory over the Ottoman Turks to be the victim of bad news as word comes on that his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) has took her own life and her soul can't seek redemption because of her Catholic faith. Angrily, Vlad condemns God, and gains an obsession out of drinking blood that penetrates through the walls. A few centuries later we go back to 1897, London, a young British gentleman named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is set to marry his young lover Mina Murray (Ryder) until words come out that his accomplice Mr. Renfield (Tom Waits) has gone loony and has an appetite of eating insects. Harker leaves merry old England to Transylvania to take over Renfield's place as Vlad's client who has a profound interest in real-estate. Dracula has taken interest in the Carfax Abbey and asks Harker for help in the acquisition. Harker feels uncomfortable with the Count and the whole situation as his anxiety goes from bad to worst. But everything was taken care of smoothly and successfully and Harker couldn't have been more relieved. However, Dracula sees a portrait of Mina and believes that she is the incarnate of his lover and now his focus is on taking her back. In return, Vlad makes Jonathan pay by falling prey to the four lady vampires who almost drink out all his blood but keeps him alive due to food shortage. Vlad goes off to London and changes his appearance from a decaying old man to a young man like he was three centuries ago. In London, while passing the time away, Mina awaits for her lover to come back as she spends some quality time with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost).Lucy is quite popular with the men as three guys have proposed to her a Texan (Bill Campbell), a physician (Richard E.

Seeing her strange behavior, that Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called on to see what's ailing her. Vlad thinks now's the time to get his hands on Mina manipulating her into forgetting about Jonathan. I for one thought the Van Helsing character was the most interesting one because he cries out for some much needed humor in this pretty melancholy story which lack in charisma or passion that makes this movie kind of dry at times. The lines given to Vlad and Mina feel like a love scene from Dark Shadows and the relationship between them seem held back. And they never fully reconcile. Once she hears that Jonathan is still alive, they go off to Hungary to get married and coldly gives him a Dear John letter. Who's the bad guy here? The evil blood-sucking vampire or the deceitful ex-lover?I must admit some of the dramatic scenes helped improve Stoker's novel. Mina as Elisabeth's incarnate was very effective to the movie and was handled with care and her being romantically involved with Jonathan and it should have kept that story that way instead of killing them off in the realms of English propriety. Reeves and Ryder were really good in their roles, I'm saddened to say the Oldman fails to impress as the Impaler himself. Sure he looks good for the role, but the lines given to him were pedestrian and not very provocative. Ryder is also guilty in this conviction, but not as bad as Oldman. It's a shame the leads lacked the panache given to the characters, but the supporting players were beyond excellent and it was them who held my interest throughout, though they weren't given much to do.

This movie breaks all barriers that stands in the way as we embark on viewing two lovers able to overcome their betrayals no matter how big the consequences are. And unlike some other vampire movies that are not worth mentioning, this one delivers what it promises as it adapts to one of the greatest vampire novels of all time and one novel that you can absorb to while reading it.Set in Romania in 1462, nobleman Vlad Dracula (Gary Oldman) has come home from his victory over the Ottoman Turks to be the victim of bad news as word comes on that his wife Elisabeta (Winona Ryder) has took her own life and her soul can't seek redemption because of her Catholic faith. Angrily, Vlad condemns God, and gains an obsession out of drinking blood that penetrates through the walls. A few centuries later we go back to 1897, London, a young British gentleman named Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) is set to marry his young lover Mina Murray (Ryder) until words come out that his accomplice Mr. Renfield (Tom Waits) has gone loony and has an appetite of eating insects. Harker leaves merry old England to Transylvania to take over Renfield's place as Vlad's client who has a profound interest in real-estate. Dracula has taken interest in the Carfax Abbey and asks Harker for help in the acquisition. Harker feels uncomfortable with the Count and the whole situation as his anxiety goes from bad to worst. But everything was taken care of smoothly and successfully and Harker couldn't have been more relieved. However, Dracula sees a portrait of Mina and believes that she is the incarnate of his lover and now his focus is on taking her back. In return, Vlad makes Jonathan pay by falling prey to the four lady vampires who almost drink out all his blood but keeps him alive due to food shortage. Vlad goes off to London and changes his appearance from a decaying old man to a young man like he was three centuries ago. In London, while passing the time away, Mina awaits for her lover to come back as she spends some quality time with her friend Lucy Westerna (Sadie Frost).Lucy is quite popular with the men as three guys have proposed to her a Texan (Bill Campbell), a physician (Richard E. Grant) and a nobleman (Cary Elwes) whom she chose. When Dracula makes his way to London, he sexually lures Lucy into his trap and takes her off to the living dead. Seeing her strange behavior, that Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) is called on to see what's ailing her. Vlad thinks now's the time to get his hands on Mina manipulating her into forgetting about Jonathan. I for one thought the Van Helsing character was the most interesting one because he cries out for some much needed humor in this pretty melancholy story which lack in charisma or passion that makes this movie kind of dry at times. The lines given to Vlad and Mina feel like a love scene from Dark Shadows and the relationship between them seem held back. And they never fully reconcile. Once she hears that Jonathan is still alive, they go off to Hungary to get married and coldly gives him a Dear John letter. Who's the bad guy here? The evil blood-sucking vampire or the deceitful ex-lover?I must admit some of the dramatic scenes helped improve Stoker's novel. Mina as Elisabeth's incarnate was very effective to the movie and was handled with care and her being romantically involved with Jonathan and it should have kept that story that way instead of killing them off in the realms of English propriety. Reeves and Ryder were really good in their roles, I'm saddened to say the Oldman fails to impress as the Impaler himself. Sure he looks good for the role, but the lines given to him were pedestrian and not very provocative. Ryder is also guilty in this conviction, but not as bad as Oldman. It's a shame the leads lacked the panache given to the characters, but the supporting players were beyond excellent and it was them who held my interest throughout, though they weren't given much to do. Which is sad because to me this story was like a car that is nice to look at on the outside, but doesn't have that steam to carry on through.

Terminator 2 is the best of its sequels. Terminator 3 didn't have the originality which Terminator 2 has. Terminator 1 didn't have proper animation for robotic action. Terminator 4 has number of inconsistence as well as poor storyline. Hope to see these type of movie in the future. The ATM hacking scene was funny.

It combines a marvelously original script with romance and wonderful location shooting to make a truly fabulous film.I love how this film begins. Ordinary New Yorker Cary Grant (or at least as ordinary as any guy looking like that can be) goes out to mail a letter and, through a long string of mistakes, becomes entangled in an assassination plot! The problem is that at first the police don't believe him about some weird plot--then they assume HE is responsible for the killing! The film is chock full of crazy iconic scenes--such as Grant being pursued by an evil crop duster and Grant and Eva Marie Saint scaling down the faces on Mt. Rushmore to escape the killers. Along the way, Hitchcock goes crazy with very, very sexual Freudian imagery (the tunnel scene is a classic) and provides some wonderful moments using wonderful actors. Grant, as always, is great but I also liked Martin Landau's small role as a killer who REALLY likes his job and the rest of the cast is also stellar. This is a must-see film and one of the best films of the decade.By the way, this film, despite being so wonderful also has one of my favorite film mistakes--and I am sure to watch for it every time. In the scene at the UN, pay very, very close attention when Grant tries to talk to the man he is pursuing. Although the man is shot dead unexpectedly right next to Grant, apparently one of the extras (a kid in the foreground) is anticipating the shooting before the gun has even been drawn. Look carefully--the kid is plugging his ears well before the shot occurs!!!

","genre":"Adventure, Crime, Mystery"},{"date":"19 October 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Murder by Death represents what is probably the greatest concept for a parody film &#x85; ever! The story gathers the five most brilliant fictional sleuthhounds of the world (each of them plus one companion) to solve a murder that has yet to be committed. They are all invited to the estate of the mysterious and eccentric Lionel Twain, where a murder is due to happen at midnight on Saturday, and the culprit has to be unmasked before the end of the weekend. All detectives eagerly accept the challenge, especially because this is the ideal opportunity to discredit the others and to finally determine which one of them is the world's greatest crime solver. You simply have to admit that a movie formula such as this is pretty much a guaranteed success. Not only does it allow five of the most recognizable cinematic stereotypes to interact, but with a little bit of decent writing, this could also make a compelling whodunit murder mystery! Particularly the first full hour of Murder by Death is damn near genius. It's not only the sleuths that have hilarious one-liners and witty remarks, but also the supportive characters like their partners and &#x96; most of all &#x96; the blind butler Bensonmum. I thought I had already seen all the clichéd jokes linked to a blind character, but this film sets a new standard. Of course, it has to be said that the film wouldn't even be half as triumphant if it weren't for the impeccable acting performances of the entire ensemble cast. Each and every single individual in this film, male or female, delivers a stellar performance and I honestly can't single out a favorite one. Murder by Death is non-stop funny and simultaneously builds up curiosity and even suspense towards the sequence at midnight, when the infamous murder is bound to be committed. Admittedly the pace and integrity of the film decreases a little bit and the screenplay always remains focused on comedy whereas writer Neil Simon and director Robert Moore ought to have aimed for mystery after the murder. Or at least that's what I personally think. What follows next is a serious anti-climax but, given the parody concept of the film, it's actually the most fitting conclusion imaginable. Murder by Death is a must-see for all lovers of good detective stories, film-noir and thrillers. Along with Clue, this is the perfect film to relax a little bit.
