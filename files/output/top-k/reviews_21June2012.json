[{"date":"21 June 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" With films like Traffic and Requiem for a Dream, drugs seemed to be a pretty big deal in the year 2000. But only one of these two films was recognized by ole Oscar, and that was Traffic. Not to say that Traffic is better than Requiem for a Dream, but I'd say it's a pretty close race. Traffic is a vignette of three different story arcs with a cavalcade of characters who are almost all played by huge names like Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for his performance as Javier Rodriguez, a man from Tiujana working for the police gathering information about the drug cartels. The other story lines are Catherine Zeta-Jones' story as a wife whose husband gets arrested for drug trafficking, and she must clean up his own mess, and Michael Douglas as a conservative judge who is appointed by the President to helm the war on drugs, only to find out that his own daughter is an addict. It's an intense, dark, gritty, and harrowing film represents the brutality and futility of the drug war.Traffic is a film where everything pieces together just right. Soderbergh's poignant direction is stupendous and adds such a raw intensity to the entire film. The way he differentiates between the three stories is excellent and wildly creative. For the story centered around Douglas there is a blue wash over everything that represents the cold and bleak hopelessness of the story. For Zeta-Jones' story everything is much more vibrant to represent her esteemed bourgeois lifestyle. And for Del Toro's story in Tiujana everything is given a yellow tint to give it a much grittier, more raw, and much hotter feeling. What could have been a cheesy gimmick to make the film unique ends up being a stroke of genius by Soderbergh and his cinematographers that adds a whole new level of artistic value to this film.And while Traffic is visually striking it never lets up on the intellect and complexity of its stories. The film flows perfectly and the transitions from the three intertwined stories is seamless. There is not a moment in this film that takes you out of the experience. The script is perfect and the dialogue itself flows so realistically and so smartly that you would think this was a documentary. There is some obvious ad lib work going on here that adds to the intense realism the film touts all the way through. Traffic does not miss a beat in its story or characters. It is all played to perfection.One of the beautiful things about Traffic is that within its grandiose storyline it never loses its human connection. Drugs have affected all of our lives inadvertently, and anyone over the age of 16 can probably have an idea of where this war on drugs is leading. Traffic recognizes the futility of the drug war and this is one of its main focuses. Through the story surrounding Douglas and his daughter we find a very human element to the story as the drug war is brought home to the man trying to fight it. His daughter being an abuser was a genius move by the Gaghan, the screenwriter, and it changes the face of the film as Douglas realizes that the drug cartels cannot be stopped, the important matter is the one closest to home, helping those who have already been affected. It's a feat of exceptional storytelling that works wonders to the overall purpose of Traffic.Few films manage to be this intense and this visceral, while still succeeding in being a humane and emotionally powerful film. Traffic gets everything right, and it's possibly Soderbergh's best.

The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of 'justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line.The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode.

An undoubtedly entertaining thriller about revenge, it is a technically accomplished film noir that is over- reliant on its dominating gimmick its reverse storytelling structure. That gimmick cannot, however, conceal the impression that, while it is a good film, Memento is really no better than many other films of its kind. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, and based on a short story by Jonathan Nolan (any relation, I wonder?), Memento has all the accoutrements of classic film noir a seedy California setting; seemingly lonely and emotionally disturbed characters; motels that exploit their customers; and murder as a pivotal part of the plot. It tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), whose wife called him Lenny but who likes to be addressed by everyone else by his full first name. Leonard is an ex-insurance fraud investigator. He has short-term memory difficulties - he knows who he is and can recall everything about his life before the incident in which his wife was killed. However, he has been unable to make any new memories since that traumatic event. His failure to prevent the rape and murder of his wife, and a knock on the head that he sustained during that incident, have induced in him a sort of reverse amnesia and left him with a single-minded determination for revenge. Hampered by his inability to retain new information, Leonard resorts to having his body tattooed (by himself in some instances; by a professional tattooist in others) with vital pieces of information that will assist him in the search for his wife's killer. He also takes Polaroid photos and writes notes to himself as a means of recording other important details that will help him, e.g. the location of the motel at which he is staying. Leonard is aided (or perhaps thwarted?) in his efforts by Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), a barmaid with a dodgy boyfriend, and by the mysterious Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Natalie is the classic femme fatale beloved of all such films!So, the basic plot - the need to avenge a terrible crime - is not particularly original. But the memory issue is. That, however, pales into insignificance when set beside the highly unusual structure of the narrative of the film. Time appears to move backwards and forwards in chunks in almost equal measure in a complex presentation of the chronology of events that is sometimes difficult to follow. The viewer needs all his wits and attentive powers about him to work out exactly what is going on and when. There is the added complication of a seemingly unimportant sub-plot concerning someone whom Leonard was investigating for possible insurance fraud before his wife's demise and who was apparently suffering the same memory difficulties that now plague Leonard. Memento is an absorbing and entertaining film. It is beautifully acted by all concerned. Guy Pearce is superb as Leonard. He appears in virtually every scene in the film. His performance is such that the viewer cares about him and his crusade to avenge his wife's death. The film is well directed. And it is skilfully edited, something that is crucial to the plausibility of the plot, given the film's unusual structure. The problem is though that Memento is at times overrun by a sense of cleverness, knowingness and pretentiousness. I have no idea why, for instance, a number of crucial scenes (they usually involve Leonard on the telephone to an unidentified policeman who seems to be providing him with unreliable information) are filmed in monochrome. And while the reverse chronology of the film is unusual it does not really enhance what I think is one of the main messages of the film which is that memory is a tantalisingly fragile aspect of human life, and that what and whom we trust are governed by all sorts of things beyond our control. So what we have here is an entertaining and fascinating film noir that, for all its technical accomplishment and wizardry, is just that an enjoyable, but ultimately forgettable, movie. 6\/10.

Here's a slightly opinionated fact you may not like this as much as Spartacus, or Lawrence of Arabia, or even Gladiator if you've seen them first. That just how films age. And here's a slightly factual opinion your religious views will affect your liking of the film. As such, this review is subjective in places.The synopsis claims this film is about Prince Judah Ben-Hur and how he is betrayed by a friend and comes back for revenge. That's not true. That's the plot of Gladiator. Ben-Hur begins the same way, and revenge is sought out... then the film goes on for another hour. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little deceptive. I wasn't prepared for the complete family subplot, and being of a younger generation, I had no idea how prevalent Jesus and the beginnings of Christianity would be. I guess I'll get right to that. The scenes with Jesus are one of the two best scene types in the film. Seeing him give a pained Ben-Hur water is really something, but his final scene, won't spoil it here but you probably know how it ends, is elevating. I thought it was cool that they were showing Jesus to be realistic, simply a man teaching faith and how to live a better life... until the miracles came into play. It was too positive, considering the gut wrenching previous sequence.The other great scenes were the action scenes. The naval battle was remarkable, but most iconic is the chariot race that has held up remarkably. Its sheer scope and intensity is breathtaking, but its the cinematography that keeps the very long scene still relevant to today. Ben-Hur is a well-deserving recipient of its technical Oscars. The sets are grand and filled with period props, the costumes are innumerable and lavish, extras number in the thousands, the sound is remarkable and the music is bombastic. Despite running too long, Ben-Hur gives something good to look at for three and a half hours.The acting is tough to assess, because its of a different generation. Quick head turns to dramatic music happen frequently, as well as awkward less-than-5-second kisses. But Charlton Heston is great as the wrong Judah Ben-Hur, and nihilistic Quintius Aerius and the gambling horse racer are great characters as well. Messala certainly rises to meet Ben- Hur as the villain though. He's just a bad guy and right until the end he radiates lost love.Now I can't quite understand the moral of the story, so skip this paragraph over if you somehow haven't seen this film. Judah gets his revenge, and while 1) it's not intentional and 2) he doesn't enjoy it, he doesn't get the closure we thought he would get from it. Then he, because of timing, decides to follow Christianity, but only after his revenge was complete. Also, this is a quote from the synopsis on Wikipedia Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed. That's just bad plot for the sake of a happy ending. I don't really know what's accomplished by the end I feel like without the miracle the ending would've had a most believable pro- Christian message by being fairly objective from non-believer Judah's view.Ben-Hur is a landmark in film that hasn't aged as well as some other similar films. Visually it remains spellbinding, but with a long runtime, muddled plot and uncertain message, it just can't hold up in today's less religious society. 7.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 158Here's a fact Ben-Hur won 11 Oscars, the most in history, and you'll keep thinking about that throughout the film.

I thought it was cool that they were showing Jesus to be realistic, simply a man teaching faith and how to live a better life... until the miracles came into play. It was too positive, considering the gut wrenching previous sequence.The other great scenes were the action scenes. The naval battle was remarkable, but most iconic is the chariot race that has held up remarkably. Its sheer scope and intensity is breathtaking, but its the cinematography that keeps the very long scene still relevant to today. Ben-Hur is a well-deserving recipient of its technical Oscars. The sets are grand and filled with period props, the costumes are innumerable and lavish, extras number in the thousands, the sound is remarkable and the music is bombastic. Despite running too long, Ben-Hur gives something good to look at for three and a half hours.The acting is tough to assess, because its of a different generation. Quick head turns to dramatic music happen frequently, as well as awkward less-than-5-second kisses. But Charlton Heston is great as the wrong Judah Ben-Hur, and nihilistic Quintius Aerius and the gambling horse racer are great characters as well. Messala certainly rises to meet Ben- Hur as the villain though. He's just a bad guy and right until the end he radiates lost love.Now I can't quite understand the moral of the story, so skip this paragraph over if you somehow haven't seen this film. Judah gets his revenge, and while 1) it's not intentional and 2) he doesn't enjoy it, he doesn't get the closure we thought he would get from it. Then he, because of timing, decides to follow Christianity, but only after his revenge was complete. Also, this is a quote from the synopsis on Wikipedia Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed. That's just bad plot for the sake of a happy ending. I don't really know what's accomplished by the end I feel like without the miracle the ending would've had a most believable pro- Christian message by being fairly objective from non-believer Judah's view.Ben-Hur is a landmark in film that hasn't aged as well as some other similar films. Visually it remains spellbinding, but with a long runtime, muddled plot and uncertain message, it just can't hold up in today's less religious society. 7.7\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"21 June 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 158Here's a fact Ben-Hur won 11 Oscars, the most in history, and you'll keep thinking about that throughout the film. Here's a slightly opinionated fact you may not like this as much as Spartacus, or Lawrence of Arabia, or even Gladiator if you've seen them first. That just how films age. And here's a slightly factual opinion your religious views will affect your liking of the film. As such, this review is subjective in places.The synopsis claims this film is about Prince Judah Ben-Hur and how he is betrayed by a friend and comes back for revenge. That's not true. That's the plot of Gladiator. Ben-Hur begins the same way, and revenge is sought out... then the film goes on for another hour. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little deceptive. I wasn't prepared for the complete family subplot, and being of a younger generation, I had no idea how prevalent Jesus and the beginnings of Christianity would be. I guess I'll get right to that.

The film masterpiece Halloween! I am a big horror fan, and what horror fan would I be without seeing and owning the most classic chilling film out there. Halloween is a film about Michael Myers who killed his sister at a young age, several years later he escapes and returns to where he once lived. A the same time, Laurie Strode a high school student is going about her life, trying to find a date and babysitting. What she doesn't know is that the embodiment of evil Michael Myers is about to wreck her plans.That's about what the film is about, let me just say that I like this more than the newer horror films like SAW and the remakes. What Halloween offers is much more than what the newer films supposedly try to give, Halloween gives you chills with the daunting appearance of evil, suspense with the simple yet terrifying death scenes, and fear knowing at the end that the killer is still out there. I see myself as a person who judges characters, for example Michael Myers. I like the other classic horror icons Jason, Freddy, Chucky, and ghostface. Michael is the first Jason (if you will), silent, deadly, and unstoppable. But what I like about Michale more than Jason, is that John Carpenter tries to show Michael as pure evil, Jason however is shown as a victim. That reason could explain Jason's popularity with the modern people, but it should be said Michael Myers is perhaps a better 'VILLAIN' than Jason Voorhees.My final thoughts This film deserves to be recognized for its simple yet scary scenes, and I recommend this film to anyone, if your one who wants to get into Horror, start with this one.

Just a single clip of trashy reality TV shows Jerry Springer or The Maury Show on YouTube and what we witness is nonstop display of vulgarity, sleaze and uncontrollable behavior. On the other hand, we have a plethora of terrible films like The Room, the entire Friday the Thirteenth series, Caligula etc that are unintentionally hilarious but all in all unwatchable. Pink Flamingos is a sure shot delight for the voyeurs of violence, sex, deviance, coarseness and trash, albeit one that is made with uncanny expertise. John Walters is the small-scale Quentin Tarantino who can conjure unique, quirky characters and make them cult figures; we are not perturbed by the characters' wrongdoings and we usually end up rooting for them to commit another misdeed.The story here is narrated in an androgynous manner, probably by a flaming gay man or a transsexual, who takes us into the pink, tawdry and shabby trailer of Divine (who is living as Babs Johnson to evade police attention) and her family- her pretty, lusty blonde traveling companion Cotton who possesses the looks of a yesteryear's' star, her bucktoothed, long-maned chicken loving son Crackers and her egg obsessed cutie-pie mother Edie. Divine has long remained the undisputed 'filthiest person on the planet', unbeaten, unchallenged by anyone and is a small-time cult figure who makes it into shoddy newspapers. She is settled now, and does no harm to others other that warming beef between her legs to save on money. Her son seems more wayward at first, but only in sex (chickens are his favorite partners, it seems). Cotton exhibits only voyeuristic tendencies and likes to hang posters of beefy men next to her bed &#x96; but that seems acceptable. And sweet Edie only thinks and talks about eggs, their shape, size and color, Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme, what happens if all the chickens disappear?, when will the egg-man arrive etc. No one seems to transgress modesty to an unlawful extent except perhaps Crackers. But all this changes when the team is challenged by Raymond and Bonnie Marble, a husband-wife team who vie to steal Divine's esteemed (at least according to them) title. Raymond exposes himself to unsuspecting souls but that is just the tip of the iceberg- the couple discreetly orders their homosexual manservant Channing to impregnate kidnapped women, so that the new-born can be sold to happy lesbian couples. The pitiful kidnapped woman in tattered clothes and straggly hair castigates Channing whenever he enters the basement; she hasn't even seen the actual perpetrators of her misery. When this terrible couple takes on Divine and her flamingos, it is WAR!I believe that the degree of crime committed by Connie and Raymond automatically makes them antagonists; while most of Divine's victims are simply killed without much introduction, we are constantly updated about Connie's victims' sufferings. Even the effect from the disturbing chicken scene with Crackers and the spy Cookie is palliated by the previous scene where we are told of Cookie's deception. . Divine and her gang shoot, chop and eat their victims in one scene but it is too hilariously over-the-top to be offensive. The sexuality on the other hand is something that is bound to gross out or p-ss off certain audiences, with the idea of incest itself can be unnerving for many, but again who really finds Divine to be role model or even a woman, with her androgynous appearance and her ludicrous make up (actual name Harris Glenn; yes, a man!).The entire setup seems like shots from a sleazy reality show, the budget of the film being so tight the entire product was the master copy. We see choppy editing, shadows creeping up often in the background, cameras shaking furiously while closing in on a person and passersby gawking at Divine's appearance as if completely unaware of the film. However, it is this low-quality which make the action look more authentic, as if Divine is an actual C-grade celeb who has made her name through malefaction. The songs, a mix of rock and roll and country make the scenes more lively and enjoyable, and also mitigate the actual violent acts that occur when the music is played.Watch Pink Flamingos if you want to see a kick-ass trashy exploitation film.

John Walters is the small-scale Quentin Tarantino who can conjure unique, quirky characters and make them cult figures; we are not perturbed by the characters' wrongdoings and we usually end up rooting for them to commit another misdeed.The story here is narrated in an androgynous manner, probably by a flaming gay man or a transsexual, who takes us into the pink, tawdry and shabby trailer of Divine (who is living as Babs Johnson to evade police attention) and her family- her pretty, lusty blonde traveling companion Cotton who possesses the looks of a yesteryear's' star, her bucktoothed, long-maned chicken loving son Crackers and her egg obsessed cutie-pie mother Edie. Divine has long remained the undisputed 'filthiest person on the planet', unbeaten, unchallenged by anyone and is a small-time cult figure who makes it into shoddy newspapers. She is settled now, and does no harm to others other that warming beef between her legs to save on money. Her son seems more wayward at first, but only in sex (chickens are his favorite partners, it seems). Cotton exhibits only voyeuristic tendencies and likes to hang posters of beefy men next to her bed &#x96; but that seems acceptable. And sweet Edie only thinks and talks about eggs, their shape, size and color, Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme, what happens if all the chickens disappear?, when will the egg-man arrive etc. No one seems to transgress modesty to an unlawful extent except perhaps Crackers. But all this changes when the team is challenged by Raymond and Bonnie Marble, a husband-wife team who vie to steal Divine's esteemed (at least according to them) title. Raymond exposes himself to unsuspecting souls but that is just the tip of the iceberg- the couple discreetly orders their homosexual manservant Channing to impregnate kidnapped women, so that the new-born can be sold to happy lesbian couples. The pitiful kidnapped woman in tattered clothes and straggly hair castigates Channing whenever he enters the basement; she hasn't even seen the actual perpetrators of her misery. When this terrible couple takes on Divine and her flamingos, it is WAR!I believe that the degree of crime committed by Connie and Raymond automatically makes them antagonists; while most of Divine's victims are simply killed without much introduction, we are constantly updated about Connie's victims' sufferings. Even the effect from the disturbing chicken scene with Crackers and the spy Cookie is palliated by the previous scene where we are told of Cookie's deception. . Divine and her gang shoot, chop and eat their victims in one scene but it is too hilariously over-the-top to be offensive. The sexuality on the other hand is something that is bound to gross out or p-ss off certain audiences, with the idea of incest itself can be unnerving for many, but again who really finds Divine to be role model or even a woman, with her androgynous appearance and her ludicrous make up (actual name Harris Glenn; yes, a man!).The entire setup seems like shots from a sleazy reality show, the budget of the film being so tight the entire product was the master copy. We see choppy editing, shadows creeping up often in the background, cameras shaking furiously while closing in on a person and passersby gawking at Divine's appearance as if completely unaware of the film. However, it is this low-quality which make the action look more authentic, as if Divine is an actual C-grade celeb who has made her name through malefaction. The songs, a mix of rock and roll and country make the scenes more lively and enjoyable, and also mitigate the actual violent acts that occur when the music is played.Watch Pink Flamingos if you want to see a kick-ass trashy exploitation film. It is hilarious at moments (the 'trial' scene) and deliciously (in a slightly gross way), wickedly and divinely entertaining.

It's the classic monomyth, or Hero's Journey, which follows the young farmhand Taran on his quest to defeat the evil Horned King and destroy the Black Cauldron. Despite having a classic structure and reasonable premise, the story fails to click with the audience because it simply moves too fast. A key aspect of Taran's character, for example, is that he resents his life as a pig boy and dreams of becoming a gallant knight. However, too little time is given to this dream for the audience to really sympathize with this aspect of the character. As a result, when Taran is forced to give up his magic sword (representing his dream of knighthood) for the good of the land, the potentially poignant moment falls flat.Similarly, the progression of Gurgi's character comes across as unnatural. He is supposedly a cowardly character, who fails to help his only true friends in the earlier acts, but eventually finds the strength to make the ultimate sacrifice. All well and good, but the whole series of events unravels too quickly to feel organic. Taran meets Gurgi, five minutes later Taran is leaving and Gurgi is too afraid to help his friend. Five minutes is not enough time for that relationship to solidify, especially because Taran hates Gurgi initially. Moreover, Gurgi's internal conflict with his cowardice is not given enough screen time to progress naturally.Even the pacing of the dialog is too fast. Characters practically talk over each other, in a hurry to hit the myriad of plot points between the opening narration and the closing credits, 80 minutes later. Even pausing for a beat between lines to show characters reacting to each other would have done miracles.All in all, this movie just had too much inertia. From the onset, characters are swept along by the unrelenting pace of the story, and never have an opportunity to build real relationships with each other or grow through introspection.

It had to have been during the 1980s, possibly during a pledge drive. Given that I was not a Beatles fan growing up, I didn't think much of the film, however, perhaps this was my bias, the wan rift of memory, plus the fact that I have become a much more acute critic of all things, including cinema, clouding my memory. Then, a couple of years ago I watched the band's second film Help! It, too, was not a good film. In fact, it was quite a bad film. However, most critics state that the second film was not as good as the first, and this includes Roger Ebert and virtually every other online critic for, according to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 100% rating in terms of favorability.Yet, the truth is, if Help! is, as I describe it, a 'bad' film, its 87 minute long predecessor is a flat out terrible film. That anyone would find this appallingly poorly executed, unfunny, hodgepodge of ill acted swill remotely entertaining is a testament to the depths human enjoyment can plunge. Yes, the songs from the bands' early era are good, but there isn't a single joke told in this film that garners even a mild teehee. That some critics suggest this film is equal to the great classic comedies of the Marx Brothers shows how addled some minds truly are. While it's true that, as Ebert suggests, this film had a profound influence on the music video industry that arose in the 1980s, it's had a negligible impact on film, itself. Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, and Ingmar Bergman, among others, were already far more visually sophisticated and daring than anything director Richard Lester tossed into this film, along with cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. In fact, despite Ebert's claims that the film is 'strikingly original,' the very opposite is true- it is derivative to the core (think Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers, the Ritz Brothers, the Three Stooges, Abbott and Costello, the Bowery Boys- need I continue?); so, unless one wants to claim that being almost wholly and shamelessly derivative is perversely a 'strikingly original' thing to be, Ebert's statement is doomed to go down as one of the greatest examples of his tendency to cinematically brain fart. The screenplay, by Alun Owen, is simply abominable. The film consists solely of songs with a few poor comic tidbits in between. These tidbits consist of the boys running away from female fans, engaging in pseudo-blue banter with Paul McCartney's supposed 'other' grandfather, a man who seemingly undermines and embarrasses the boys at every opportunity, and arguing over petty matters with their band manager. The film ends with the boys titillating a television studio full of screaming young females.Several things are apparent in this film 1) it was designed merely as a moneymaking venture for, despite the brain dead criticism this film is utterly void of any real art, 2) the Beatles simply cannot act and their films, it seems, started their later slide into musical pretension, and 3) the Monkees'- television's Prefab 4 response to Beatlemania were almost infinitely better actors. In fact, their acting range was probably farther beyond the Beatles' than the Beatles' actual musical canon was above theirs, for the Monkees actually were good at improv; the Beatles weren't. And, the film is actually at its best during seeming improves. The clearly scripted moments, which seem less like even a first draft but a first premise, and which have the boys interacting with real actors is excruciatingly painful to watch and hear, as jokes that are decades old, even then, are told with a manic glee that somehow, if a teen heartthrob tells them they will magically regain their humor. One wonders why both of the band's first two films are so poorly made and the answer is rather obvious producers rushed them through production for fear that the Beatles' popularity would fade and that the Rolling Stones, or some yet discovered group would make them passé before the films were released.The real test of the film's cinematic worth, however, comes from a simple test if the film had been on a fictive band, made up of actors, singing Beatles songs, would the critics have trumpeted it so? Of course not. Furthermore, they would have used the films of many of the predecessor comedy teams I mentioned as proof of just how derivative this film is.

In both films, the leads win, but pay for victory with extreme loss. This is why Curtis Hanson's film is better than the two films it's most compared to by critics, and holds up well against the more realistic drama of Serpico. It's also why, compared to the violence, especially in Pulp Fiction, that in this film is never gratuitous. It always is at a minimum, within the bounds of character and circumstance, and advances the story, even if just in a small way.

In fact, even though it is based on a novel, whereas Serpico was based upon real life events across the continent, and two decades later, L.A. Confidential is really an extension of that Al Pacino film's exploration of evil. Both show that all the cops are criminals of one sort or another. Only degree of criminality is in question. In both films, the leads win, but pay for victory with extreme loss. This is why Curtis Hanson's film is better than the two films it's most compared to by critics, and holds up well against the more realistic drama of Serpico. It's also why, compared to the violence, especially in Pulp Fiction, that in this film is never gratuitous. It always is at a minimum, within the bounds of character and circumstance, and advances the story, even if just in a small way. Also, the fact that all the cops, even the 'good ones,' are criminals, is something just not seen in most films of the last few decades of Right Wing hagiography of all who wear uniforms.When this film came out, in 1997, it was one of the few films that I ever saw twice in a theater. After having seen it once with a female friend, I recommended it to other friends, and went to see it again with them. In watching it a couple of times over the years, and for review, it is one of those films that has many things in its backgrounds, many moments that become 'Aha' moments upon rewatch, and make the viewer re-evaluate just what the film is doing and why. This is the definition of depth. Yes, the film is not as existential as Ingmar Bergman's Shame, nor is it as innovative as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, nor does it present reality as closely and achingly as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, but its uniform excellence, and ability to do even its genre moments well (I recall pumping my fist and going, 'yeah! when Exley shoots Smith in the back at my first viewing), and recast clichés as something different (bright lights noir), are among the many reasons this film rises to greatness. I would not go so far as the hagiographizing Andrew Sarris, in casting all crime films as pre- and post-L.A. Confidential, because the film does as much to celebrate film noir as it does to recast it, but it certainly is one of the best Hollywood films of the last thirty years or so. It is also the high point of director Curtis Hanson's rather pedestrian career, and the only one of his films to ever come near and surpass greatness, another argument that auteurism is not the only way to get a great work of cinema made for, without the contributions of those mentioned, this film would likely still have been a good one, but great? I doubt it. Regardless, L.A. Confidential is a great film, one of the best crime drams ever filmed. See it. Or else.

It is so great to sit down with a movie that you know nothing about and have it turn into a real gem. This movie was beautifully filmed. A real master at work. The story starts with a brutal attack that had me wondering why? I wanted to know right away. However, Sergio was on his own schedule as slowly, but surely, the layers of the story are revealed. The pacing reminded me a bit of Kill Bill. I figured Tarantino was a fan, and it turns out he is. Henry Fonda usually plays the good guy, but I really didn't know if his Frank or Charles Bronson's character was the good guy. Of course, good and bad are especially relative in cases like this! Charles Bronson doesn't have a name and IMDb lists him as Harmonica. He was played as a real mystery. A man with his own agenda, who didn't have problems killing anyone. He also played the harmonica with a wild tone that was pretty sweet. Due to the deliberate pacing of the movie there were a few times where I was on the edge of my seat. Waiting for what I thought should happen to hurry up and happen! Ultimately, the whole thing worked. The reveal of Harmonica's back story was a surprise. It left me wondering, now that his goal in life was finished would he stick with the girl?Speaking of the girl, that whole thing was relative too! The more I learned about her, the more I wondered would living with her really be a happily ever after? Early on, I was a little perplexed by her behavior. Even wondering if she was just acting poorly. I suppose after learning all about her, it is possible that is how her character would behave. That was a great watching experience.

But, in truth, neither Cagney nor Bogart were actors in a modern film, and their 'anti-heroes' were really more cartoony fictions than realistic; whereas McDowell's Alex is realistic, however stylized. But more than just the appeal of the anti-hero, Alex is a bon vivant, with an incredible lust for life (pro and con), and it is that factor, added to his being an anti-hero, that makes him such a memorable character. Whether he is raping, killing, listening to music, fighting, daydreaming, he is in every moment, and then some. This is why, when he is soul cauterized by the Ludovico Treatment, there is such a strong reaction, even by people who loathe his character to that point. It is also why the ending to the film, wherein Alex is 'cured' back to his evil self is so much more satisfying than Burgess's novel's original ending, wherein Alex grows bored with his old violent life, to which he has returned, and decides to 'grow up,' settle down, and get a wife and child. Although Kubrick's decision to go with the ending of the more cynical American version of the novel (in his screenplay) caused much dismay to Burgess (it never ceases to amaze how many artists do not fundamentally even get the points of their own works), it was the correct choice for the film, and a better and more realistic artistic statement. The truth is that Burgess's novel is not nearly as potent nor powerful as some earlier dystopian works, like George Orwell's Animal Farm nor 1984, nor Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. In fact, it's not even as interesting as A.E. Van Vogt's Slan (save for the introduction of the Nadsat lingo). The reason for the film's excellence is almost entirely on Kubrick's shoulders. While people can 'reform,' with the passage of time and advent of maturity (I am a prime example), this ending would have done two things to damage the film- 1) it would have meant Alex had lost the very thing which made him 'special,' and a great character- his savage lust for life, and 2) it would have shifted the focus of the ending away from the society which soul cauterized Alex back to Alex, and this would have emasculated the film's satiric edge. A Clockwork Orange, the film, is simply not about Alex nor youth hooliganism, but fundamental and institutionalized state terror. And it's because of this change of target by Kubrick that the film still blisters its audience today; the same cannot be said of Burgess's book. Had it just been a tract on young violence, or gangsterism it would have dated as badly as many other pop cultural films from the 1960s and 1970s.But, no matter how you approach it, A Clockwork Orange is a great piece of filmmaking (whereas Burgess's book is not a great work of literature- a fact that even Burgess admitted to), and the final jewel in a filmic consecutive Triple Crown that may be without equal. It deals with the most fundamental thing that our most fundamental human quality- intelligence- endows us with free will; the ability to choose this or that, be it a minor distraction or an ethical choice of the highest order.

The star made a dozen movies during the 90s, and if he was guilty of some bad decisions in the 1980s, then it was nothing compared to what came in the following decade.First we had Rocky inexplicably growing back his Philly accent in a fourth sequel that even Stallone now rejects; two comedies which, like Rocky V, are probably better than their rep but still quite weak; and the usual line of unchallenging action movies that are below his level. Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability.It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him.As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

Out of them, from 1990-1996 only Demolition Man emerges with any credit; an action movie as mindless as the rest, but not one without a sense of fun or watchability.It's not that there's anything particularly wrong with mindless action movies, more that such roles only use one part of the acting spectrum. Fine for the likes of Van Damme and Swarzenegger, but when you're able to co-star with DeNiro and Harvey Kietel without disgracing yourself (as Stallone did just the following year in the underrated Cop Land) then it's something of a waste. Stallone saw out the decade with the rewarding animated feature Antz, delivering two of his best pictures back-to-back, just when it seemed all over for any qualitative worth. Immediately following this he fell back into dross, before resuscitating his career in the mid 2000s with decent Rocky and Rambo sequels. It seems the guy really doesn't know what's good for him.As for Daylight, then it does, to be fair to it, deliver on its promise. A disaster movie under a collapsed subway system, said disaster happens well within twenty minutes of the film's commencement, giving us another 90m to endure Stallone gurning around and lots of ciphers shouting at one another. Such a short pre-disaster time may suggest that the characters involved are severely underdeveloped and we never get to know or care about who they are. But just look at that title quote. Someone is called upon to actually say those words. You couldn't blame them if they were glad the dialogue was on the low side, could you?

This is a raw, gritty insight into the very real world of alcoholism, abusive relationships, and general dysfunction.In his directorial debut, Gary Oldman makes no attempt to sugarcoat his perception of life in South London. Utilizing rough dialogue, claustrophobic camera work, grim lighting, and a constant presence of violent tension, he has instead created a cathartic and uncomfortably honest atmosphere from start to finish.The entire cast is pitch-perfect for what this film is trying to achieve- that being to divert from the typical Hollywood 'art imitating life' and into the real, unglamorous, and painful lives that thousands of people world-wide have to face every day. They are not in this film for their looks or reputation, but rather for their ability to capture what it is to be human in broken circumstances. They don't make practiced faces into the camera. They don't spew out Oscar-ready monologues. They don't shed the single, pretty tear down the cheek. No. They forget about the camera's presence and do exactly what you and I would do in their given situations, making them better actors than most A-Listers that you'll see today.Nil By Mouth is a thoroughly unpleasant 2 hour watch, and it will certainly be difficult to sit through. Never-the-less, it is a film that needs to be watched. While film is a great medium for escaping our daily hardships, it can also be used as a means of opening our eyes to the crueler side of life - the life of our neighbours, our friends, or even ourselves. Oldman has achieved this without mercy or restraint, and as a result has created a masterful study of every-day horrors.

It is possible to go in expecting deliberately campy material and emerge pleasantly fulfilled. It's true; I have a thing for creature features, especially playful ones set in the present. Some I can develop a fondness for, some I can just smile or grin at.Recently, Piranha 3D and Piranha 3DD didn't do justice, I wasn't totally smitten with Eight Legged Freaks either, but I really found myself liking Anaconda for a number of reasons. While it's a lesser quality film, Lake Placid has some good things going for it. We are introduced to the dysfunctional police partners, Jack Wells (Bill Pullman) and Sheriff Hank Keough (Brendan Gleeson), who are convinced there is something in the muddy waters of their Aroostook County Lake in Maine. After it eats Keough's partner, the ditzy, overly-paranoid New York City Paleontologist Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) is called to investigate a mysterious tooth found in the man's corpse. It is identified as the tooth of a crocodile, and the gang later discovers the croc is over thirty feet in length, of Asian territory (how it manages to swim itself all the way to a modest lake in Maine is a mystery to me), and a frail old farmer (Betty White) claims she has fed the useless cattle to it for an upwards of six years. Another quibble I have; how have these bumbling sheriffs not heard this thing for six years? It roars, it creates rough currents, and I'm sure people fish in the lake from time to time. No man-eating croc encounters reported? Bringing logic to a creature feature is like bringing a TV dinner to a restaurant. It's unnecessary and embarrassing. You buy a ticket or rent the DVD to simply enjoy the experience, get a few laughs, and no harm is done. I can accept that, and the movie provides goofy fun, though, however, I will say the scenes featuring the croc are too few and far between. Its first appearance isn't until forty minutes in, and the film truly isn't working towards any suspense. It is just pacing around familiar territory.While the film is questionable on many levels, it does bring one thing to the table; a great cast of people who prove they can commit an act of lovable idiocy. Gleeson is definitely the star here, with his one-liners and presence so assisting as the comic relief, that my point is only furthered; we need a bit of Gleeson in every movie. Bill Pullman is welcomed here and so is Bridget Fonda. But, you can imagine, the scenes the croc is in, he is the show-stealer.Speaking of which, the effects on the croc itself are quite enjoyable too, while still presenting a nice elegance and respect for the creature feature sub-genre. It doesn't look too glossy or too arbitrarily unrealistic, either. I believe it is of an animatronic state, much like how the main anaconda was in Anaconda. The good thing about an animatronic effect is that manipulation to the creation can be done, while still occupying some realism. An example would be when Owen Wilson was swallowed whole by the snake in Anaconda. It looked a little faulty, but still, wasn't disgustingly CGI.Lake Placid's conclusion is the one factor that I was simply won over by. It's bombastic finale that truly cements what this type of movie was meant for. It, again, reminds me of the engaging final act in Anaconda, which I dare not spoil. The whole film, itself, is one location shot, one bickering shot, one creature shot, and one halfway tense shot after another. And oh how I love it.Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Brendan Gleeson, and Betty White. Directed by Steve Miner.
