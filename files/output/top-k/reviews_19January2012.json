By their very nature, movies about robberies are full of action and usually entertaining. Entrapment is neither. The script is terrible and revolves mainly around the very athletic body of Catherine Zeta-Jones.Her character, Virginia, is supposed to work for an insurance company, but she is also interested in putting a little something illegally aside. Enters Sean Connery, playing super-thief Mac (and a mere 40 years older than Zeta-Jones) and the two are struck by love at first sight and get involved in a series of criminal activities.Connery is only 40 years older than Zeta-Jones - albeit in good shape &#x96; so she is bound to find him irresistible... Putting aside the ludicrous matter of physical attraction, the whole fantasy about super-thieves and transferring billions from one bank account to another has been done - much better &#x96; many times before and since.The pace of the whole movie is sloppy and boring. For instance during the stay in Mac's castle, nothing happens apart from the camera lingering lasciviously on Zeta-Jones's body. Even the travel, from the US, to Scotland and to Kuala Lumpur seems to be in the plot for no other reason than adding the usual glamorous globe-trotting.Entrapment is also a very dated movie. It is hard to think it is only a little more than 10 years old, as one would think it belongs to the over the tops fantasies of the Eighties. Eventually, it boils down to a series of overlong sequences, leading to a fairly predictable end.

To be fair, the film is endearing, it's sometimes funny, and Vardalos has a Tina Fey-like quality about her&#x96;which I find attractive, although I'd much rather date Fey&#x85;especially if she's dressed up like Sarah Palin&#x85;and if she wasn't married&#x85;but I digress&#x85;. Also, Lainie Kazan is convincing as the eccentric, confident, loving, encouraging mother (although significantly more tame than in her You Don't Mess with the Zohan role). Plus, my good friend and Fraternity brother married a Greek woman (who he met while stationed in Greece; they had a Greek Orthodox wedding and everything!), and it was pretty cool seeing the movie reference the Greek cultural points that she taught me, like the toasts.On the other hand, this movie unfortunately follows that way-to-common formula of ethnic girl who is embarrassed of her wild-and-crazy stereotypical family is swept off her feet by polite white boy from also-stereotypically uptight, rich family, and fireworks fly as the two families drive each other crazy while the couple struggles to ensure that their love prevails. In that sense, the film is not very creative plug Greek stereotypes, language, sayings, and architecture into a Romeo-and-Juliet story, and you've got a movie that a bunch of Greeks (or people who are interested in Greek culture) will go see, because they're under-represented in movies, but then half of them will realize, too late, that the film is potentially reinforcing some dangerous stereotypes (granted, Vardalos wrote the screenplay, but stereotypes perpetuated by members of the same group aren't necessarily less dangerous).In any case, cynicism aside, this movie is a cutesy romantic comedy&#x85; definitely a chick flick. If you are a woman who likes that sort of movie, you may enjoy this one, and it may be worth your time to sit down and watch it (although I wouldn't call it a must-see&#x85;maybe unless you're Greek, too). If you're a dude, pass on this one if you have a choice, but it's not exactly torture if you're forced to watch it, either.
