Some of the first words we can hear from Marty indicate that all of his younger brothers and sisters are married, actually whenever place Marty is during his Saturday the main subject of the conversation is that he is still a single man his clients at the butcher's shop, old women, don't hesitate to say to Marty that he should be embarrassed for not being a married man, since it's Saturday Angie asks about the plans for the night and they both are like my mother drives me crazy, every word out of her mouth when you gonna get married? and well his mother asks about where his 34-year-old boy can find a nice girl (you know a nice girl he can marry?).

During this hunt the book also describes Rambo trying to survive as the National Guard, Police and Hunters try to capture him Dead or Alive.The Novel is much more darker and gorier than the film, the Character of Rambo in the book is more unstable and kills a lot of people while in the movie Rambo only kills one person while wounding others. The Novel explains more of Rambo's back-story before he went into Vietnam and also explains in detail the struggle Rambo had inside the POW camp and how he escaped. When you read the book you know Rambo isn't a Action Hero but instead a Troubled Young Veteran trying to survive as he's being forced back into violence.The Character of Teasle in the book does give Rambo a hard time and is persistent is getting Rambo, the book also goes into more detail with his past and with his personal life, the relationship between Teasle and Orval in more explained in the book showing that Orval was like a Father figure for Teasle since his real Dad was killed in a Hunting accident.The Character Sam Trautman doesn't have the same relationship with Rambo like he does in the film.The Ending in the Novel is another big difference from the film.My only real grip with the film is that they should have made it closer to the book, other than that the film is a entertaining Action\/Thriller that shows how one man must survive against a whole army using the skills he developed in Vietnam, the film also shows how frustrating it was for Vietnam Veterans when they came back from the War.The Soundtrack for First Blood is great and really sets the mood for the film.The acting is great, Sylvester Stallone does a excellent job as the mentally unstable Veteran Rambo. The speech he gives at the end although a little hard to understand especially when he starts crying is so true to what it was like. Richard Crenna is great as Sam Trautman, he has that caring and empowering Father like figure especially when he finally meets Rambo again. Brain Denhey does a great job as the Sheriff determined to get Rambo, it just would have been nice if they made him more like the Tease in the novel. The scenery in the movie is stunning to look at and the Action is thrilling and exciting.Plot When Young and Rugged veteran John Rambo goes to see his War buddy he sadly discovers that he's passed away, travelling along the the highway Rambo enters a small Town. Drifting through the town Sheriff Will Teasle stops Rambo and offers to take him out the Town, driving him out Rambo decides to go back. Teasle sees Rambo coming back so he arrests him, in the Police Station Rambo starts giving the Police a hard time by refusing to talk to them, have them file his Finger Prints and cooperate.After being cleaned up the Police go to shave him, having a Flashback of the Vietnam War Rambo fights his way out the Station, jumps on a Motorcycle and escapes to the Woods.Teasle and a few others go into the woods to try and apprehend him but soon find themselves being hunted by Rambo.Rambo lets Teasle go unharmed, after a while the National Guard is called in to stop Rambo. It's then that Teasle meets Sam Trautman, Rambo's mentor who offers to help them get him.It soon becomes a fight for survival as Rambo uses his Skills to try and get out the Area before the National Guards and various Hunters find him and stop him.Overview The First Blood Novel is definitely better but the film is a entertaining 80's Action\/Thriller that introduced the Legendary Action Hero John Rambo to the movie going public.

During this hunt the book also describes Rambo trying to survive as the National Guard, Police and Hunters try to capture him Dead or Alive.The Novel is much more darker and gorier than the film, the Character of Rambo in the book is more unstable and kills a lot of people while in the movie Rambo only kills one person while wounding others. The Novel explains more of Rambo's back-story before he went into Vietnam and also explains in detail the struggle Rambo had inside the POW camp and how he escaped. When you read the book you know Rambo isn't a Action Hero but instead a Troubled Young Veteran trying to survive as he's being forced back into violence.The Character of Teasle in the book does give Rambo a hard time and is persistent is getting Rambo, the book also goes into more detail with his past and with his personal life, the relationship between Teasle and Orval in more explained in the book showing that Orval was like a Father figure for Teasle since his real Dad was killed in a Hunting accident.The Character Sam Trautman doesn't have the same relationship with Rambo like he does in the film.The Ending in the Novel is another big difference from the film.My only real grip with the film is that they should have made it closer to the book, other than that the film is a entertaining Action\/Thriller that shows how one man must survive against a whole army using the skills he developed in Vietnam, the film also shows how frustrating it was for Vietnam Veterans when they came back from the War.The Soundtrack for First Blood is great and really sets the mood for the film.The acting is great, Sylvester Stallone does a excellent job as the mentally unstable Veteran Rambo. The speech he gives at the end although a little hard to understand especially when he starts crying is so true to what it was like. Richard Crenna is great as Sam Trautman, he has that caring and empowering Father like figure especially when he finally meets Rambo again. Brain Denhey does a great job as the Sheriff determined to get Rambo, it just would have been nice if they made him more like the Tease in the novel. The scenery in the movie is stunning to look at and the Action is thrilling and exciting.Plot When Young and Rugged veteran John Rambo goes to see his War buddy he sadly discovers that he's passed away, travelling along the the highway Rambo enters a small Town. Drifting through the town Sheriff Will Teasle stops Rambo and offers to take him out the Town, driving him out Rambo decides to go back. Teasle sees Rambo coming back so he arrests him, in the Police Station Rambo starts giving the Police a hard time by refusing to talk to them, have them file his Finger Prints and cooperate.After being cleaned up the Police go to shave him, having a Flashback of the Vietnam War Rambo fights his way out the Station, jumps on a Motorcycle and escapes to the Woods.Teasle and a few others go into the woods to try and apprehend him but soon find themselves being hunted by Rambo.Rambo lets Teasle go unharmed, after a while the National Guard is called in to stop Rambo. It's then that Teasle meets Sam Trautman, Rambo's mentor who offers to help them get him.It soon becomes a fight for survival as Rambo uses his Skills to try and get out the Area before the National Guards and various Hunters find him and stop him.Overview The First Blood Novel is definitely better but the film is a entertaining 80's Action\/Thriller that introduced the Legendary Action Hero John Rambo to the movie going public. Check both the Novel and the Film out to see how different they both are. ","genre":"Action, Adventure"}]
