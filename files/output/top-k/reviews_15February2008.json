It's not a bad road to take, and the script's premise is not a poor one, but its development is.

It's a ridiculous moment; they talk about black and white, about Christians and Presbyterians and other subjects the movie hadn't brought until that point? Why do it so late then? Both John Bennett Perry and Tomas Milian overact the scene completely and they should be embarrassed.Actually, there's a lot of overacting in Fools Rush In, and if it weren't for Hayek and Perry's chemistry it would be a bad film. They make it an enjoyable rush. Both look so young, Perry with all the success from Friends at the time, Hayek in her first romantic lead in Hollywood. Jon Tenney and Siobhan Fallon also help in their respective best friend character. But that's that, and sometimes it can be almost enough for a good film. I know I didn't explain the impossible situations, but it's something you should experience without me giving examples.

Almost everybody had filled their white styrofoam cups with black coffee and had taken their seats. When I finally got the nerve to stand I felt so self-conscious I wanted to crawl under my chair. My name is Charley DeRiemer, I finally said, and...I...uh...I'm a fan of...uh...The Frighteners. But I'm disappointed in a lot of it, too. This horror-comedy has too much humor and wit and not enough cheese to qualify as a cult flick. All the film's Computer Generated Flatulence, for me, eventually loses impact. The CGF so clutters up the story-line, which already is complicated, that I think Peter Jackson, the director, must have fallen in love with his computer toys and forgotten there was a story to tell. It doesn't help that while most of the movie is over-the-top funny, the last part sinks into to an old-fashioned scare-um gore-fest without cleverness, just Jake Busey grinning with a lot of teeth and people jumping out with big knives in their hands. So why is this movie so likable? First, most of the time the script is funny and clever. Second, several of the sequences manage to create a great blend of humor, raunchiness, special effects and drama (the funeral and cemetery, the museum party in the Egyptian wing) or a real jolt of dread and foreboding (Lucy in the mansion with Patricia Ann, the beginning of the psychiatric hospital scene). Third, the movie has some fine, grotesque acting that is weird and unsettling (Jeffrey Coombs, Dee Wallace, Jake Busey) or weird and funny (John Astin, Chi McBride, Peter Dobson). Fourth, you can't beat a love story that reaches beyond death into eternal devotion. For Patricia (Dee Wallace) and Johnny (Jake Busey), love is forever and means never having to say you're sorry. Fifth, and to my mind most importantly, it has Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister. Fox has the personality and star firepower to be able to turn a typical nice-guy character into a man we really like. Fox has been a master in portraying flawed, vulnerable nice guys we almost instantly sympathize with. It's a rare talent. For me, he manages most of the time to overcome the continual show-off intrusion of all that Computer Generated Overkill. The exception is when he's involved with a massive tube to heaven that looks like a Slinky on steroids. When he's on screen, even when he's enmeshed with silly blue-screen aerobics, he makes the film human and grounded. It's a shame Jackson had all that money and all those computers to play with. He didn't really need them. Just watch how he builds dread when Lucy arrives at the creepy old mansion to whisk Patricia away to safety. It's one of the best, most skillful scenes in the movie, and there's hardly a computer effect to be seen until the last of it...when the dread and suspense are swept out and the wow stuff is swept in. There's a lot of great stuff in this comedy about serial killers, demonic possession and a scamming psychic investigator who brings along his own ghosts. There's a lot to be frustrated by, too. For the most part, I just use my fast-forward button now and them. I do like the movie even with its faults. Now if only someone would make, Johnny and Patricia versus Mommy and Daddy, featuring the knife-wielding Mommy and leather-suited Daddy from The People Under the Stairs. That would make a tag-team match worth watching. ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The room was full.

Every killing is done in an Argentoesque manner where we never actually see who's perpetrating the crimes and are left to guess his identity. I enjoyed what they were going for, but ultimately, the reveal was more like Scooby Doo than Deep Red.

Last Orders is one of those films that covers a lot of ground in a two hour timeframe; it's sort of what Forrest Gump would have been like if Forrest Gump had had masses of friends and buddies to hang around with as his own life unfolded. But don't think I'm comparing films here because whilst Last Orders is great in its own retrospect, Forrest Gump remains the pinnacle of this sort of genre.I suppose Last Orders is to 'death' as Reservoir Dogs is to 'heist'. The idea that you get a load of male characters (although Helen Mirren's Amy plays a sort of important role); have them situated close to all but one place for the past tense scenes but now and again, showing the repercussions of said death\/heist event in the present tense. While Reservoir Dogs' flashback scenes covered a whole range of locations, Last Orders fixes on a public house for the scenes in which all the characters are together but in order to understand more and more about them the film delves deeper into the past; much like Reservoir Dogs did with the Mr. Orange character &#150; showing us how the development of friendship and trust became apparent. Added to this, Last Orders in the present tense beds down in one locale; a moving vehicle as they travel to a pier in order to carry out the dead man's final wish &#150; parallels to Reservoir Dogs and the warehouse can be made here where, arguably, the most intense moments of clashing egos and best examples of dialogue float to the surface.But Last Orders isn't trying to be Forrest Gump or Reservoir Dogs, in my opinion two of the 1990s greatest films. No, Last Orders is a different beast; a tale of friendship and life that is pushed to an apparent breaking point even when the man has gone. It seems funny how with a cast like Hoskins, Caine, Mirren, Hemmings and Winstone one can be so easily attracted to the actors and actresses who play the characters in decades gone by. JJ Field does a superb job as a young Jack (Caine) as does Kelly Reilly with Amy (Mirren); what's more, there is an added sense of nostalgia when Anatol Yusef portrays a young Ray (Hoskins) when really it seems like he is playing Hoskins himself from times gone by &#150; you cannot help but smirk in appreciation. Even though the film plays out with one of its main characters actually dead throughout the entire piece, what makes Last Orders so successful? Well, it gets across a feeling of nostalgia; a feeling of time gone by. Secondly, it gives us these characters who we have seen many times before in films of a different genre; maybe even on a television drama if you're from Britain but it injects heart and soul into any usual stereotypes you might have expected.In order to break away from tired clichés or familiar archetypes, Last Orders develops almost all of its characters through out their respective lives. There are instances when Ray is tempted to engage in an affair with Jack's wife Amy; there are other instances that seem almost irrelevant Ray's daughter marrying an Australian and moving away and Jack's son Vince wanting to follow a path in the mechanical trade rather than the butcher trade. Although these seem like mere formalities, they are actually extremely important plot points in these respective people's lives with the genius of it to follow they all deal with loss of some sort. If Ray and Amy have an affair, Jack looses out; if Vince wants to become a mechanic against his fathers wishes then the '& sons' tag to the business is rendered false; if Ray's daughter wants to marry and move to the other side of the world, Ray and his wife loose their daughter on a certain level. But one persons loss is another persons gain Ray's daughter has found love; Vince has found a career he loves and Ray has found love to a certain degree with Amy, even if it is at a friend's expense. This is where the film's main level of loss is challenged When it is made apparent after five minutes it is the character of Jack that is dead, nobody wins but everybody looses. Thus, the ensuing road trip is everybody banded together to deal with the event.With the film's theme and consensus loss, it is no surprise tiny references are made apparent all the way through the journey. The lads visit a war memorial in a park to celebrate the 'loss' of life in the war; when walking through the cathedral, Vince talks about how interesting it is to have all the 'dead' kings and queens 'buried' in amongst the walls; there is even mention of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs &#150; harking back to times of old and great people who are now dead, echoing Jack and his life. Even stranger, what do we learn ourselves about Jack during the film? He is a womaniser who seemed carefree and outlandish; a man who wanted his son to do what he did and got angry when he didn't but despite Jack seeming like the least likable person of the group of lads, it is his death that has brought everyone together in a celebration of life above all other things. Last Orders is clever and engaging with a narrative that will entertain and may well have even pulled at some emotional strings by the time the obligatory scene arrives &#150; that itself is an achievement.

While Reservoir Dogs' flashback scenes covered a whole range of locations, Last Orders fixes on a public house for the scenes in which all the characters are together but in order to understand more and more about them the film delves deeper into the past; much like Reservoir Dogs did with the Mr. Orange character &#150; showing us how the development of friendship and trust became apparent. Added to this, Last Orders in the present tense beds down in one locale; a moving vehicle as they travel to a pier in order to carry out the dead man's final wish &#150; parallels to Reservoir Dogs and the warehouse can be made here where, arguably, the most intense moments of clashing egos and best examples of dialogue float to the surface.But Last Orders isn't trying to be Forrest Gump or Reservoir Dogs, in my opinion two of the 1990s greatest films. No, Last Orders is a different beast; a tale of friendship and life that is pushed to an apparent breaking point even when the man has gone. It seems funny how with a cast like Hoskins, Caine, Mirren, Hemmings and Winstone one can be so easily attracted to the actors and actresses who play the characters in decades gone by. JJ Field does a superb job as a young Jack (Caine) as does Kelly Reilly with Amy (Mirren); what's more, there is an added sense of nostalgia when Anatol Yusef portrays a young Ray (Hoskins) when really it seems like he is playing Hoskins himself from times gone by &#150; you cannot help but smirk in appreciation. Even though the film plays out with one of its main characters actually dead throughout the entire piece, what makes Last Orders so successful? Well, it gets across a feeling of nostalgia; a feeling of time gone by. Secondly, it gives us these characters who we have seen many times before in films of a different genre; maybe even on a television drama if you're from Britain but it injects heart and soul into any usual stereotypes you might have expected.In order to break away from tired clichés or familiar archetypes, Last Orders develops almost all of its characters through out their respective lives. There are instances when Ray is tempted to engage in an affair with Jack's wife Amy; there are other instances that seem almost irrelevant Ray's daughter marrying an Australian and moving away and Jack's son Vince wanting to follow a path in the mechanical trade rather than the butcher trade. Although these seem like mere formalities, they are actually extremely important plot points in these respective people's lives with the genius of it to follow they all deal with loss of some sort. If Ray and Amy have an affair, Jack looses out; if Vince wants to become a mechanic against his fathers wishes then the '& sons' tag to the business is rendered false; if Ray's daughter wants to marry and move to the other side of the world, Ray and his wife loose their daughter on a certain level. But one persons loss is another persons gain Ray's daughter has found love; Vince has found a career he loves and Ray has found love to a certain degree with Amy, even if it is at a friend's expense. This is where the film's main level of loss is challenged When it is made apparent after five minutes it is the character of Jack that is dead, nobody wins but everybody looses. Thus, the ensuing road trip is everybody banded together to deal with the event.With the film's theme and consensus loss, it is no surprise tiny references are made apparent all the way through the journey. The lads visit a war memorial in a park to celebrate the 'loss' of life in the war; when walking through the cathedral, Vince talks about how interesting it is to have all the 'dead' kings and queens 'buried' in amongst the walls; there is even mention of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs &#150; harking back to times of old and great people who are now dead, echoing Jack and his life. Even stranger, what do we learn ourselves about Jack during the film? He is a womaniser who seemed carefree and outlandish; a man who wanted his son to do what he did and got angry when he didn't but despite Jack seeming like the least likable person of the group of lads, it is his death that has brought everyone together in a celebration of life above all other things. Last Orders is clever and engaging with a narrative that will entertain and may well have even pulled at some emotional strings by the time the obligatory scene arrives &#150; that itself is an achievement.

Nearly a decade later I watched it last night for the umpteenth time and was still enormously impressed.

For a horror movie from the Eighties there is a surprising absence of all that much grue and there is no nudity either. This led me to view it more as a kind of mythical western than as a horror film and it is in this capacity that the film is a comfortable 10\/10. The film is simply a majestic piece of cinema. The acting ranges from the merely good in the case of Adrian Pasdar, to the excellent, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen. Its interesting that the film contains several of the cast from Aliens, and this works nicely, as they have great chemistry and work off each other nicely. The script is damn fine with lots of memorable lines, some occasional dark chuckles and far more depth and feeling than most vampire pictures. The direction by the great Kathryn Bigelow (Blue Steel, Strange Days) is amazingly stylish and the typically Eighties Tangerine Dream score fine too.

They felt like fully realised comic books for the big screen. A difficult thing to achieve that Burton pulled off masterfully. Sadly, after Batman Returns, Burton was not asked to fill the directors chair for the third instalment. Warner Bros were allegedly unhappy with the very dark directions Burton had took the series (idiots!). So in an effort to lighten the load, they turned over the reins to...wait for it...Joel Schumacher!!!In reviewing Joel Schumacher's work, I've been quite vocal over how awful he is as a director. He seems incapable of investing his films with anything remotely in the way of substance. His films are often loud, splashy spectacles dripping in atmosphere but hollow as a jack-o-lantern. Batman Forever was the film that made me a hater of Joel Schumacher. After all, the very idea that he could fill Tim Burton's shoes was ludicrous. But its what he does to the world of Batman that is so unforgivable.From the first five minutes I was cringing. The film opens with Batman suiting up. Close-ups of gloves. Belt buckles. Capes. But the sight of nipples on the Bat-Suit threw me for six. As did the new Batmobile. With two ludicrous fins sticking in the air, its something nobody would be caught dead driving in. But the cap on the scene is Batman tells faithful Alfred (Michael Gough) he'll get Drive-Thru on the way home.Its a statement that in one fell swoop completely obliterates the mystery and dark intrigue we always admired about Batman. And it just gets worse from there. The next shock the film has in store for us is the new Gotham City. Gone are Tim Burton's dark, Gothic imaginings. Instead, the city is awash in flashy lights, blazing neon and psychedelics. Tim Burton may be credited as producer, but Batman Forever is not one of his films...period!Just about everything in Batman Forever is a shambles. Val Kilmer, picking up where Michael Keaton left off, is all wrong for the part. Keaton really did a superb job of encapsulating the feelings of barely disguised psychosis, balanced on a knife-edge between moral indecision and tightly wound urgency. But Kilmer is bland by comparison. He never possesses anything in the way of charisma, nor carries himself with the larger than life stature you'd expect of Batman.And then there's the villains. This is what really sinks Batman Forever (as well as having Schumacher in the director's chair). After exhausting most of the well known villains in the Batman universe, this film has one famous one, and one not so famous. The Riddler (Jim Carrey), and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones).One of the joys of the previous films was the way Tim Burton made the villains so fascinating to regard on a psychological level. The Joker was a manic psychopath on the one hand, but a surprisingly vulnerable creature on the other. And the same could be said of Catwoman and the Penguin.But Two-Face and the Riddler have none of the fascinating psychological complexities that made Tim Burton's Batman films so rich and accessible. The mistake of Schumacher is to let Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones run riot through the film with zero restraint. I suppose that's to be expected of Jim Carrey, but not of Tommy Lee Jones.I think Tommy Lee Jones is a superb actor. He can command a scene without having to do much of anything. But he's quite awful as Two-Face. In fact this must rank as the worst thing he's ever done. His performance is shrill, grating and utterly vacuous. I didn't think it was possible for Jones to give a bad performance until I saw Batman Forever.But as bad as Jones is, Jim Carrey is even worse. I know the Riddler is supposed to be zany, but Carrey boosts it to such an absurd degree the character loses all sense of credibility and menace. I mean how exactly do you take a villain seriously who dresses in a leotard covered in question marks, and wears a mask that looks like it was lifted from Dame Edna's wardrobe?This film sees the introduction of Robin too. Chris O'Donnell is OK, but as the orphaned acrobat turned crimefighter, he never quite convinces of his struggle between darkness and light. Nicole Kidman, although glamorous hardly convinces as criminal psychologist Dr Chase Meridian. She's only there because Batman needs a love interest. And to look good in sexy outfits. Even if she's not very important to the plot (assuming the film even has one!).The film attempts to delve into Batman's origins, which holds occasional moments of interest, but Batman Begins did it much better. The film is crammed with so many new characters, each subplot is shortchanged in some way or another. The film is an underdeveloped mess.Everyone seems out to get revenge on somebody. Two-Face blames Batman for his disfigurement. The Riddler hates Bruce Wayne for shunning one of his inventions. Two-Face killed Robin's family, so naturally the Boy-Wonder wants vengeance. Schumacher may have been striving for multilayered, but honestly the narrative is so crowded the film hardly achieves anything it sets out to do.Being a Joel Schumacher film, the sets are expectedly lavish. But they're only designed to dazzle. Schumacher never makes them literal representations of the psychology of the characters the way Tim Burton did. Aside from an excellent film score by Elliot Goldenthal, Batman Forever is a failure on every level. Joel Schumacher took Tim Burton's breathtaking, darkly beautiful vision and turned it into a camp extravaganza. And the same goes for Schumacher's equally dreadful Batman & Robin.Avoid at all costs!

I don't deny it  says Murphy Jones, well into his fifties and widowed, to Emma Moriarty, well into her thirties and divorced with a young son. If the fruit hangs on the tree long enough, it gets ripe. I'm durable, I'm steady and I'm faithful. And I'm in love for the last time in my life. I'm in love for the first time in my life, Emma says. So? So...stay for supper, Murphy? I won't do that, Murphy says, unless I'm still here for breakfast. Emma looks at him. How do you like your eggs, she asks. What better Valentine Day's card than Murphy's Romance, a mature, funny and wise valentine of a movie for people fortunate enough to have found long-lasting love the first time or have been given an opportunity for a second chance. Emma (Sally Field), divorced and wanting to start a new life for herself and her son, has rented a broken-down horse ranch in Arizona where she hopes to make a living boarding and training horses. She has little money, can't get a loan and knows no one in the small, nearby town. Murphy Jones (James Garner) is the town's pharmacist. He owns the drug store on Main Street. It still has an old-fashioned soda fountain. When Emma walks in and orders a lemon Coke, he makes it the old fashioned way...Coke syrup, seltzer water and juice from a squeezed lemon. He's a friendly enough sort, realistic about things, thinks he knows people and is a little stubborn...like his Twenties Studebaker he keeps polished to perfection and parked right in front of the store...and he'll pay the parking fines if he has to 'cause he's not moving the car. Little by little the two of them come across each other in the small town. When Emma asks what kind of place it is, Murphy says, Oh, small, friendly, nosy. You can carry a gun, but you can't get an abortion. I don't want to do either, says Emma. With time, Emma's horse boarding business begins to look better.

What keeps the movie interesting is that wary, developing interest the two of them find in each other. Watching it grow slowly over corned beef hash and bingo, over an ice cream cone and a birthday cake, over Emma's concern about her son and Murphy's refusal to own up to his age (he does, finally)...is amusing and satisfying. It helps that the depiction of this small town is just as low-key and friendly as the story-line. There's no small-town condescension. The movie house open only Thursdays through Sundays, the bingo parlor, the one cafe, the barbecue at Emma's ranch, Murphy's birthday party, all are presented straight up with affection, with nothing dramatic added.

In a way, it has the same sensibility as My Uncle...there's not a mean-spirited action or person in the movie, and we wind up liking the people we meet in the film. Like My Uncle, it doesn't have a Hollywood ending, but a conclusion which is both satisfying and poignant. Tampopo, however, is its own movie, not a derivation, and a fine movie it is, too. Goro (Tsutomu Yamaguchi) is a long-haul truck driver. With him is his young co-driver, Gun (Ken Watanabe). It's dark. It's raining and they're hungry so they pull over and stop at a small noodle shop. Inside are some rough characters, led by a drunk guy who is giving loud advice to the cook and owner. She, Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto), is behind the counter hustling steaming bowls of noodle soup. It's not long before Goro intervenes after telling Gun to go back to the truck. The next morning he's bruised, aching and wakes up in the noodle shop. And when Tampopo begs him and Gun over breakfast to honestly tell her what he thought of her soup, he does. It wasn't good, he says. Tampopo is determined to do better and begs Goro to stay and teach her. For the rest of the movie we're on a kind of surreal, metaphysical journey to learn how to make a masterful bowl of noodle soup. Along the way, we're going to encounter stories that have nothing to do with Tampopo and Goro, some stories that have a glancing relationship to them, and some that are very much part of their story...and the stories all are humorously odd, a bit off-center, and funny. We even have two death scenes, one so over the top as to be awe-inspiring (Note to self Decline any offer to eat grilled wild boar yam sausage). The thing they all have in common is food...an old woman lasciviously squeezing the fruit and cheese in a modern supermarket...an awkward salaryman at a private luncheon with the elderly bosses, none of whom can manage the French menu and play follow-the-leader by ordering sole, clear consume and beer. Last to order, it turns out he can handle the menu and goes for the quenelles, the escargot and a specific wine vintage. He may not have a long career but it's a funny and satisfying moment...or the young wife who each week drops off her aging husband at a fine noodle restaurant for lunch, but then must quickly leave for an hour to visit the bank, accompanied by the young chauffeur...or food as an aphrodisiac, with dancing shrimp on a naked tummy, new uses for whipped cream, and a raw egg passed back and forth by mouth between two lovers. (Note to self Take a pass on that one, too.) We learn all kinds of good things...how to cook a rice omelet for Tampopo's little boy that had my stomach grumbling with hunger...sharing grilled Korean kalbi, snipping the hot, marinated meat from the short ribs, wrapping it in lettuce and munching...filling a thin pancake with a smear of hoisin, shredded scallion, pieces of crisp duck skin with fat and some duck meat, then wrapping it up and chewing it down. Most of all, we learn about noodle soup, the different kinds and styles. It's not just the broth that must be outstanding, so must be the noodles. I see improvement, but we want customers to line up, says one friend and adviser discussing Tampopo's noodles. They're beginning to have depth but they still lack balance, says another. They're not alive enough. They lack vigor, says a third. And they still lack profundity, adds a fourth. Tampopo has some exacting teachers. All things sooner or later have their conclusions, and so does Tampopo. The side stories eventually are resolved, Tampopo's noodle soup is a great success.

There is no blatant predictability nor obvious contrivances, and this picture has considerable wit, being oft times hilarious.Turtletaub has turned the everyday, and the not so everyday, into a collection of very funny situations with apparent ease. While keeping the whole story very close to home, he has graced the movie with enough off beat moments and quirky characters to really guarantee the audience much enjoyment.Essentially though, this is romantic-comedy at its very best. While You Were Sleeping is most definitely romantic, and successfully deals with personal ideals and the awkward reality of love, and of course it's heartwarming in its humour. But what really makes the whole film work so successfully are the endlessly likable lead players.Sandra Bullock is totally charming and adorably lovable, and is just beginning to show some real versatility following her role in the action blockbuster Speed. The homely good looks she possesses mean that Miss Bullock has no trouble winning hearts with a mere smile. Equally agreeable is Bill Pullman, who plays second fiddle to the lovely Miss Bullock, an unsung actor who was well overdue a chance to play a lead role, after a string of impressive support roles including Ruthless People, The Accidental Tourist and Sommersby.Perhaps this picture does become a fraction contrived in the last ten minutes, though it still remains an absolute joy over all.Friday, June 23, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaAgain one of the most likable films of the year from director Jon Turtletaub.

But what really makes the whole film work so successfully are the endlessly likable lead players.Sandra Bullock is totally charming and adorably lovable, and is just beginning to show some real versatility following her role in the action blockbuster Speed. The homely good looks she possesses mean that Miss Bullock has no trouble winning hearts with a mere smile. Equally agreeable is Bill Pullman, who plays second fiddle to the lovely Miss Bullock, an unsung actor who was well overdue a chance to play a lead role, after a string of impressive support roles including Ruthless People, The Accidental Tourist and Sommersby.Perhaps this picture does become a fraction contrived in the last ten minutes, though it still remains an absolute joy over all.Friday, June 23, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaAgain one of the most likable films of the year from director Jon Turtletaub. The film's simplicity is a big help, with an amiable script telling an easy tale of love at second sight.The movie's best asset is the very enjoyable cast lead by every girl Sandra Bullock, whose 'girl next door' charms will win your heart with ease. With no outstanding performances, support cast back up Miss Bullock most admirably, with Bill Pullman especially enjoyable as the love lorn Jack, who has fallen head over heels for the slightly nutty Lucy.The comedy is marvellously handled by all concerned, making the very most of this humorous pic, peopled with eccentric characters as it is. But it's the romance that will win you over in the end.

And when it was released in the late summer of 1968, with not even a year yet past the release of the final film of the Leone period (THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY), more than one critic claimed that HANG 'EM HIGH was really nothing more than a cash-in on those spaghetti westerns. But anyone who really sees this movie all the way through will only notice peripheral references to Eastwood's past.Eastwood portrays an ex-lawman driving cattle across the Oklahoma territory who is set upon by a group of vicious rustlers (led by Ed Begley), who have pegged him as the murderer of the family from whom he got those cattle. This being a largely lawless territory, they decide to hang him. But they make two mistakes. One, they hang the wrong man; and two, they don't even bother to finish the job. A local marshal (the always-reliable Ben Johnson) cuts him loose from the noose, and takes him to Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle), who, after checking out his story and confirming its factuality, makes him a marshal and assigns him the task of bringing in the rustlers who tried to kill him, but bringing them in alive. This is so Hingle can try them, and then hang 'em--and hang 'em high!While this may seem like an Americanized version of a spaghetti western just because Eastwood is in it, HANG 'EM HIGH has a bit more in common with the 1948 film THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, and is nowhere near as violent as the Leone films were. There's no doubt that it's a revenge story, but Eastwood's thirst for vengeance is directed only specifically at Begley and his henchmen (including Alan Hale Jr., Bruce Dern, and L.Q. Jones, formidable opponents all); and he shows mercy to the old man (Bob Steele) of the lynching party because he warned Begley that they were hanging the wrong man. The real focus of HANG 'EM HIGH, made rather clear but not in an overtly explicit way, is how the line between good and evil, right and wrong, is a very fine line that often gets crossed for misguided reasons. Hingle's hanging judge seems to take pleasure out of seeing all lawbreakers hang in the Fort Grant town square; but as he sees it, until Oklahoma is made into a state and a court of appeals is put in place, he alone is the law. Eastwood, however, knows the limits of the law and justice.Ted Post, who had directed Eastwood in a couple of episodes of the actor's TV series Rawhide and who made his big-screen directing debut here, occasionally overuses the zoom lens and shock cuts during the hanging sequences, possibly in imitation of Leone. But this is a minor flaw, given the complex nature of the Mel Goldberg\/Leonard Freeman screenplay, and Eastwood's solid characterization. Eastwood, so often pegged as being every bit the political right-winger that John Wayne was, was even then a much more complex figure than Wayne ever was on the Duke's best day. With a cast that includes Inger Stevens, Charles McGraw, Arlene Golonka, and Michael O'Sullivan, a fine score by Dominic Frontiere, and total on-location shooting in southern New Mexico, HANG 'EM HIGH shows itself to be much more than an American rehash of Leone. In its own underrated fashion, it points to the kind of actor AND director Eastwood would become in the decades that followed.

Borrowing chapter headings from the book, Allen wrote seven brief vignettes, each dealing with prominent sexual questions using exceedingly absurd scenarios. The format of the film is most closely compared to the Monty Python film, 'The Meaning of Life (1983)' and, as was the case there, the different segments achieve varying degrees of comedic success. The director himself appears in four of the stories, allowing him to further develop the famous neurotic, ashamedly-Jewish persona that would bring him such success in later years.It goes without saying that, had a respected name like Woody Allen not been attached to the project, I would never have bothered watching 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex&#133; (1972).' Comedies concerning such a topic often have a tendency to be vulgar and disgusting, and, though it has its occasional moments, Allen's film generally exhibits a respectability that tastefully explores material that would ordinarily be deemed distasteful. Take, for example, the peculiarity of Gene Wilder's segment, where the hilarious comedy actor portrays a doctor who inexplicably falls in love with a sheep. In any other hands, I have no doubt that this scenario would have been almost cringe-worthy, but Allen delicately treads the line of cinematic decency, and what results is a comic farce that is genuinely more entertaining than it sounds and I imagine that the Allen must have searched extensively for the most adorably-feminine sheep that he could find.Another interesting vignette is a surprisingly mature tribute to Italian cinema, particularly the works of Fellini and Antonioni, as Allen portrays the husband of a woman (Louise Lasser) who can only perform sexually when doing it in a public place. The film's most brilliant segment comes at the very end, as the viewer is offered an inside view of the workings of the body in the lead-up towards a sexual climax. As a man works towards scoring with his dinner date, the organs of his body are buzzing with activity inside his brain, a NASA-like control room (featuring Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds) frantically attempts to prepare the other required body parts; the soldier-like sperm (one apprehensive individual portrayed by Allen) prepare to be dispatched paratrooper-style into the female body, though Allen's sperm fears that he'll end up somewhere unexpected.

Then there's the editing team of Freeman Davies, Mark Warner and Billy Weber who maintain the pic's fast tempo without a problem.Of course the obvious reason for this movie's success is the matching up of newcomer Eddie Murphy with rough, tough Nick Nolte. The pair exchange no beg pardons as they attempt to join forces (cop and con) in order to apprehend two desperate crims who have shot prison guards and police officers in trying to avoid capture. A sublime teaming indeed! Watching Nolte and Murphy engage in verbal and physical tete-a-tetes is a real pleasure and provides both much of 48 HRS entertainment and almost all of its comedy.Nick Nolte is always at his best in the 'tough guy who just might be a person underneath role', while Eddie Murphy's film debut is a delight, his trademark performance still being one of his very best. Nobody does man with an attitude like Eddie.James Horner provides the score.Sunday, June 11, 1995 - Video ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"15 February 2008","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Jessica Lange has delivered an outstanding tour-de-force in this horrifying true story about a somewhat unstable Hollywood actress who was continually pronounced insane by her mother for nothing more than open defiance. Miss Lange's performance is hardly short of incredible, and more than deserved the Oscar nomination it garnered.Graeme Clifford tells this shocking tale with the utmost assuredness, never hitting the audience overly hard (in fact perhaps not hard enough) nor attempting to sway their opinion. The screenplay from Eric Bergren, Nicholas Kazan and Christopher De Vore is even throughout, and always the writers are careful to avoid bias, allowing film goers to come to their own conclusions.Frances Farmer is never portrayed as a complete victim by Lange, and each facet of her personality is brought to life with equal passion in this unparalleled turn. In most worthy support is Kim Stanley (nominated for Best Supporting Actress) whose performance as Frances' self-serving, domineering mother is frighteningly efficient and convincing. Alongside her is Bart Burns as Mr. Farmer, and Sam Shepherd as a young admirer who takes the wayward girl under his wing for a time. John Barry has provided a typically melodic score.Frances is certainly a movie that will disturb those who believe that insanity is more an illness than something a person can be driven to. This is truly a very discomforting look at how the human spirit can be totally crushed by tragic, though changeable, circumstances. An original story like this carries enough weight on its own to impart much dramatic power. Coupled with Jessica Lange's triumphant performance (she literally owns this film), this is doubly so.Monday, June 12, 1995 - Video ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2008","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Jessica Lange has delivered an outstanding tour-de-force in this horrifying true story about a somewhat unstable Hollywood actress who was continually pronounced insane by her mother for nothing more than open defiance.
