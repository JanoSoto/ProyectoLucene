Joining IMDb, and seeing it at a 4.9, I was astonished. But having been over twelve years, I decided to go out and buy the Director's cut. Just to be blunt, it's nowhere near worthy of the rating it's at. But, there is quite a bit of wasted potentiality. I'll start off with the good, which really there is a lot of if you think about it. First off, if you're really into action, look no further because this film sports a nice amount of it. And the basic premise is pretty interesting, but even the director's cut clocks in at under an hour and forty minutes , so it fails to dive any deeper than it certainly could've. The cinematography is by Guillermo Navarro, who many of you probably know from his work with director Guillermo del Toro ( Blade 2, the Hellboy series, Pan's Labyrinth, etc.), and he does a bang up job. With the right direction this could have been a masterpiece by all means. Mark A.Z. Dippé knew and carried out the bare minimum of film making, and if you look into it is busy now-a-days with animated Garfield productions. What a down grade, huh? About 90% of the visuals are pretty damn good actually, and the acting as it is is all right. For these things alone, I enjoyed this movie, where as I despised X-Men Origins Wolverine for its predictable generic storyline and overly done flashy effects. Michael Jai White was far from terrible and John Leguizamo was pretty terrific if not a bit cartoony at times.The bad points really hit this film hard. The pacing, attuned to its short run time, zooms by way too quickly with annoying video game like transitions and a score that didn't fit the film too well. Every time I was expecting more to be developed, I was let down. Oh, this is a cool plot line-wait, what, we're moving on already? oh..okay... And lastly, amongst 90% of the great CGI and make-up, the battle in hell is painstakingly terrible. They should've gone with an elaborate set and CGI here and there, but it becomes hopeless so you have to sit threw what you would call a lackluster climax.But for what it is, I highly recommended this movie for its dark humor and awesome action.

Two little boys also live in the same trailer. The plot gives the impression of a dysfunctional family, but the situation is actually worse than it at first seems.This is one of those films that can be frustrating because so much remains hidden from the viewer. Explanations do come at the end, for the most part. So the viewer will need to be patient.The main problem here is a script that needed a re-write or two. After all is revealed, I still didn't understand the motivations of Kate. A major character, one that doesn't show up until well into the film, probably needed to be introduced a little earlier in the plot. And though the two little boys are cute, too much plot time is spent on them relative to the film's underlying message.Yet, the story premise is fairly unique, and quite stunning. Color cinematography is properly dark, consistent with the dark, menacing tone of the story. Lots of close-ups, even extreme close-ups, stress the importance of character over action. Attention to detail in production design and some good Tex-Mex music add authenticity to the contemporary setting.Casting is acceptable. Overall acting is above average.

The pace is often too rushed, the direction is awful and the story is incredibly predictable and made of a series of disconnected sequences.The characters are badly written and very clichéd and one-dimensional, and emotionally I couldn't engage with them on any conceivable level. The film looks cheap as well, and musically the movie is very forgettable.In conclusion, a real mess of a comedy and of a film that fails in every asset. While not the worst movie I've seen, it is certainly one of the most annoying. 1\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"27 January 2011","score":"","review":" Broken Arrow is directed by John Woo and written by Graham Yost.

As the master of ceremonies goes through his paces leading up to his introduction of Eve we scan the faces in the crowd. And the people we are told know Eve best do not look happy. At all. Interesting. So who is Eve Harrington, how did she claw her way to the top? And who was left behind in her wake? We're going to find out all about Eve.Flash back a year and Eve Harrington is no Broadway star. She's a nobody. Margo Channing, now that's a star. Margo is one of Broadway's brightest lights but as she turns 40 years old she now faces the anxieties any aging actress would. Is it only a matter of time until she's shoved aside? She's a great star and she knows it but she can't go on playing younger characters forever. Time catches up to everyone. But for the moment she's a big success, her current production is a smash hit. And apparently there is no bigger fan of said production than Eve Harrington. She's seen every performance. She's undoubtedly Margo's biggest fan. And then comes the critical moment when young Eve meets the great star Margo. Before you know it Margo has taken Eve under her wing, making the young star-struck girl her assistant. Things go swimmingly. For a time anyway. Eve does a fine job attending to Margo's every need and Margo seems to really like the young girl. The only hint of discord comes from Margo's maid Birdie. She sees Eve studying Margo. Closely. Too closely. What are Eve's true intentions? Could this seemingly sweet young girl really be up to no good? Fasten your seat belts...The movie may be all about Eve but the standout performance no doubt comes from Bette Davis playing Margo. The perfect meeting of actress and role, autobiographical in a way with Davis undoubtedly facing many of the same questions in her own life that Margo does. In retrospect the fact that Davis did not win an Oscar for her performance is rather laughable. It's the performance of a lifetime, a tour de force the likes of which is very, very rarely seen. Anne Baxter plays Eve, a challenging role no doubt as it is a character who undergoes a great transformation over the course of the film. Baxter does very well although there is the nagging sense that she is more believable in the first half of the film than she is later on. The other standout is George Sanders playing snobbish theater critic Addison DeWitt, a man who has a talent for getting right to the heart of the matter and cutting people down to size. His dry wit is one of the film's great charms. The other men in the story don't make much of an impression. Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter have their moments but aside from Davis and Baxter the woman who draws the most attention is one Marilyn Monroe. She was basically an unknown at the time and has only a bit part here but she plays that part perfectly and when she's on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. Is that because all these decades later we have the benefit of knowing she's Marilyn Monroe? Maybe that's part of it but there's no denying she did a great job here with what little she had to work with.All About Eve is smart, witty, brilliantly written. It's a movie which is entertaining and more than a little surprising. Some fascinating characters lead the story in some very interesting directions. High drama with room for some good laughs too. Davis turns in one of the most memorable performances of all time and is ably supported by a fine cast around her. There's very little not to like.

I normally do not watch low budget cooking films (not that there are many) and I was not expecting this to be a very enthralling film at all. What I found was that this movie was only mildly about cooking, and more about the struggle for the American Dream and the family dynamic between two very proud Italian immigrants. The story takes places in New York, time unknown but given the cars and signs, it is implied that it occurs around the 1950's. Italian brothers Primos and Secondo have been running a very delicious but very traditional Italian restaurant, Paradise. Despite Primo's fantastic cooking, American audiences come to the restaurant expecting spaghetti and meatballs like all the other Italian restaurants in New York. Younger brother Secondo recognizes this and is in a constant battle with Primo to make the restaurant more accessible, but Primo is too stuck in his ways. It quickly comes to light that the restaurant is failing and if the brothers cannot come up with the money they already owe the bank by the end of the month, the bank will foreclose. Luckily the brothers have a fellow, more successful restaurant owning friend who knows of a famous jazz musician coming to town. They plan to throw a party in his honor at the restaurant in order to reignite the restaurant's failing reputation. What follows is a hilarious and bittersweet series of events that changes up the way most movies of this nature are presented. Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job writing, directing, and starring as Secondo. Tony Shaloub also gives a great performance as Primo.

This is simply wrong.Sutherland's Oddball is not a hippie, but a hipster, and neither the language he uses (such words and phrases as like, baby, dig and negative waves) nor the personality of his character, are the least bit anachronistic. The hipster subculture that existed in the 1940s spoke in a slang they called jive, and every word and phrase uttered by the character of Oddball is entirely consistent with the way hipsters talked and behaved. That apparently so few modern viewers realize this, and think a phrase such as digging some wine and cheese could not have been uttered before 1964, is really quite sad. Believing that the movie would include such a glaring and silly anachronism as a '60s era hippie in 1944 WW-II cheapens the movie, and betrays a rather woeful ignorance of American cultural history. To believe that an actual hippie would become a tank commander is another glaring historical misinterpretation; no true hippie would ever have been involved in anything like that.

If the characters could have been developed and made relateable, then it would have been easier to care about the movie and it would have been more entertaining. Instead, it's not entertaining, and is a so-so movie experience. This movie is pretty much a waste of one hour and one half unless you have a thing for Ladd and want to get a peek at her slightly exposed breast in a scene where she wears Kristofferson's shirt in bed(this minor tease though--even for a former Charlie's Angels male teen being teased-- wasn't enough for me to like the movie, and it won't be for you either, unfortunately).

Aside from a slew of great directorial aspects, quite possibly the best aspect of this movie is the character development. Each main character is treated with such a fine eye. You get to really know these characters and even feel a sense of I know that guy from a lot of them. Each character is uniquely their own person and work so well together. The movie makes you believe that this fraternity can (and trust me, does) exist.

Well, she is sensational in it, luminous in Technicolour, oozing her unique brand of sex-appeal and vulnerability that Wilder was able to bring out better than any other director. She's everyone's dream girl and here Tom Ewell gets the best job in films, not only playing opposite her but moulding her into his fantasies too.There's much more to the film of course than being a sex comedy - it's also a sly comment on attitudes to sex in the repressed 50's and the staid family values of the times. The jokes and comic set-pieces are plentiful and funny, the comic timing of both leads immaculate. It's easy to forget Ewell as Munroe's foil, but he gets more screen time and carries off his frustrated lech part excellently, though I wouldn't mind having some of his daydreams.But it's Marilyn's film all the way. Although often set up by Wilder in potentially prurient situations, be it naked on the balcony, in suds in her bath (great plumber gag, by the way) or in the famous floating white dress over the subway vents, she's captivating and absolutely adorable every time she's on the screen, like a simpler, more innocent Holly Golightly years before Breakfast at Tiffany's. I've watched and reviewed other films of hers on this site where she's obviously just cast as eye candy but here she shows flair and charm in addition to her physical presence.As for director Wilder, he's absolutely on top of his game, so fluid is his work that I clean forgot it was an adaptation of a stage play. The only thing I didn't get was the insertion of a mention of the real Marilyn Monroe, being just too knowing a device which actually only confuses. Director and star were to reunite a few years later in Some Like It Hot, another cinema classic and the perfect double-feature film for this equally funny comedy to pair up with.
