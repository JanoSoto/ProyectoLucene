I don't believe a film has to be utterly faithful to the novel it is based on. But it should at least be faithful to the spirit of the original book. This film actually INSULTS the novel it is based on, taking moral and virtuous characters in the book and turning them into lewd, disgusting caricatures on the screen. The heroine of the story, Fanny Price, is meant to be the model of a pure, upright woman. She is supposed to be the embodiment of honor and duty and decency. In the film she mouths-off to her family, the people who raised her, supported her, and introduced her to a better life. Jane Austin's Fanny Price would rather DIE than show such disrespect to the family that cared for her. Not a SINGLE character is portrayed faithfully. It is PAINFULLY obvious the liberties the director takes with the story were taken to increase the sex appeal of the story. She introduces a whole trashy element to the plot line which is quite honestly an insult to Jane Austin's legacy. Someone who HATED Jane Austin could not make more of a mockery of this story. And then to introduce the whole issue of the evils of slavery into the film is even more ridiculous!! There is one mention, one sentence, in the entire book which vaguely mentions slavery. I am sick to DEATH of hearing that issue harped on. Directors seem to think that just by mentioning the evils of slavery it will give their film depth. The ORIGINAL story already has depth without bring up such a played-out issue as slavery. I think the director was trying to cover up how much she BUTCHERED Jane Austin's story by bringing up slavery. Don't insult Jane Austin's memory by watching such a travesty of a film.

I've heard it said that it made so much money because teen girls kept going to see it over and over again due to Leo DiCaprio, but I don't think that's the case; I think some people just really liked this film.Which of course mystifies me. The plot is the stockiest of stock plots; high-society girl falls in love with lower-class, but fun-loving rogue. Cue sappy music. But oh, conflict! She's already engaged to someone else, but he's kind of a jerk and she doesn't really love him (I know, it surprised me, too). At the end, the boat sinks, of course, and Leo DiCaprio dies, apparently having realized that the movie he's in is no good.Do you see the problem here? Every aspect of this film is utterly predictable, every single character is a character we've seen countless time in other, better films, and yet the stupid thing is almost three-and-a-half hours long. It spends so much time developing these characters and situations that we've all seen before, one has to wonder if writer-director Cameron actually thinks he's done anything original here. Indeed, I found myself predicting scenes before they happened, and I was almost always right on the money - with the exception of the fact that the dialogue I had in my head was less cheesy and hackneyed than what was displayed on screen. The only mildly interesting part of the entire affair is the sinking of the ship, and even then I want everyone to hurry up and die so the movie can just END already.Unfortunately, the actors aren't even at their best here. DiCaprio is downright dreadful, which wouldn't be so unfortunate if he hadn't displayed far greater acting talent than he did here in just about every other movie he's ever been in. Winslet doesn't fare much better, but she does what she can with what's given her. What's worse, great actors and actresses are severely underused, as in the case of Kathy Bates, who is given a criminally small amount of screen time.In short - uninteresting characters, a predictable plot, cringe-inducing writing, and decent-to-dreadful acting make viewing this film a rather unpleasant business. The ending is good, but that's only by virtue of the phenomenal special effects - and special effects do not a good movie make (see the Star Wars prequels).So, with all that in mind, again I ask ... why is this considered good?

It is widely recognised from critics and movie lovers as being one of the greatest achievements made to date, and not without reason. Although I wouldn't name it as one of my favourite films of all time, there is no denying its brilliance, its mesmerising charm and influential impact it has had on cinema ever since.Last night I was lucky enough to actually catch a special Valentines Day screening of the film at my local cinema, for what was my second time seeing the masterpiece. I have to say, I enjoyed the experience far more than my first, not just because of the quality of the restored version or that wonderful cinematic atmosphere you get when watching old classics, but because I believe 'Casablanca' is a film that gets better every time you watch it; You already know the characters and you already know the plot, and so the whole experience feels like a distant and personal memory that you share with the characters, something that ties in with the nostalgic tone of the film itself.With its captivating photography, soundtrack and long segments of real-time shots, the film is one that engages the viewer and sucks them into its world. The whole experience to me was fantastically surreal; there were moments where I would be totally connected to the movie, where I actually felt like I was back in the 40's. Every now and then my attention would be broke by the usual toilet goers etc., and I would realise where I was and as I said; it was surreal. The reason I mention this however that is it is testament to how immersive 'Casablanca' really is.Undoubtedly the two things that make the film what it is lie in the performances from the whole cast, and the absolutely solid script that was based on the early play Everybody Come to Ricks. First of all, if watching the film for the first time, you will undoubtedly feel like you've seen it before, and this is no coincidence for you've probably heard a lot of the dialogue quoted elsewhere. Many people have claimed 'Casablanca' as having one of the most influential and well-written scripts in film history, and I would be inclined to agree. Throughout you'll bear witness to some of the most famous lines to be shown on the big screen, and also be treated to perhaps the greatest ending monologue ever written for film, which is just as eloquently delivered by Bogart himself. Then there's the absolutely wonderful use of hard-bitten dialogue throughout, mixed with its very classy equivalent, which provides for some intense scenes whether evoking humour, pity, anger or pride; 'Casablanca' manages to achieve it all.I can't remember of the top of my head who once said this but whoever did was clearly getting at Michael Curtiz, under-appreciated director of 'Casablanca'. He said that the greatest directors blend into the fabric of their movies, never making their presence openly obvious; they make the rest of the crew look good. As time has gone on to prove, this is certainly the case here as Curtiz is a director who rarely gets mentioned when discussion on the movie is taking place. When watching the film for a second time however I kept this and mind, and noticed the superb amount of skill that did indeed go into making 'Casablanca' the masterpiece it is, and a lot of that comes down to Curtiz, who does a brilliant job bringing the entire production to life.The people whom he really brings out however are the cast, who unquestionably give some of their greatest performances here, creating characters that are fully dimensional and likable without being submissive to conventional 'hero' stereotypes of the time. Bogart plays 'Rick', the owner of a saloon in Casablanca, outcast from his homeland, and a man with a broken heart, unwilling to 'stick his neck out for nobody' as a consequence. Throughout, Bogart performs expertly, showing his brilliant screen presence that he has become known for, letting his character flow through naturally and with constant emotion. Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid play 'Ilsa Lund' and 'Victor Laszlo' respectively, delivering equally emotive and powerful performances that only go to compliment Bogart and the rest of the cast magnificently, creating chemistry that never lets down.I have deliberately avoided going into too much detail in this review merely on the basis that I feel I cannot and could not fully do this film justice by doing so.

Adapted from Phillip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner's history is one of a legendarily troubled shoot, and egregious financial disappointment. However, like some other films that experienced such stressful and humble beginnings and ultimately grew in importance and popularity with each passing decade (like Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption, The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life), Blade Runner's esteem now with film critics and audiences alike shows that in 1982 it was simply a movie that was decades ahead of its time.Blade Runner is as visually awe-inspiring a movie as you will ever see. Justifiably celebrated for its mesmerizing production design, Scott and his crew, also putting to work visual effects that don't show 26 years, paint a wrenching but no less aesthetically pleasing portrait of what maybe 2019 Los Angeles will look like dystopic, polluted and brimming with corruption and corporate greed. You could only hope to see such amazing eye-candy from a director who is arguably one of the last true visionary directors (that now being a term which, it seems, is thrown around nearly as much these days in Hollywood circles as You'll never work in this town again!).But therein does not lie that magic ingredient that makes Blade Runner the seminal masterpiece of science-fiction film-making &#x96; that is in two other aspects of the story. The first of those is its ocean-deep and universal themes. Blade Runner is a movie that challenges the viewer to ponder not only what it means to be human, but WHY we are human. Through the central characters of Deckard (the central male whom we know more about than he knows of himself), played by Harrison Ford, Rachael (the female replicant and love interest of Deckard's who is the most advanced of her kind but still knows only mortality), played by Sean Young, and Roy Batty (the revengeful replicant who wages war on both Deckard and his own maker), played by Rutger Hauer, Blade Runner is a timeless, universal and marvelous analysis and deconstruction of the human condition in all its dimensions. And the characterizations by Ford, Young and most notably Hauer all leave indelible impressions.Also broadening the narrative scope of the film is the mind-boggling fusion of postmodern cyberpunk and future neo-noir. This adds yet another layer of beauty and intrigue, especially in Vangelis' instantly recognizable score and with the cynical and introverted Deckard feeling much like a role Humphrey Bogart might have accepted.The second definitive sign of Blade Runner's colossal greatness lies in its cautionary tale view of the future &#x96; and in 2009, unlike 1982, we all know how alarming the possibility of it successfully predicting the future is. After all, 2019 is only 11 years away. Pollution, slavery, prostitution, global warming, corruption. Technological enslavement? Think about that the next time you buy a piece of audiovisual equipment or even the next time you fire up your computer. Good sci-fi always tries to predict the future. Only the very best get it right.In summary, you can throw 2001 A Space Odyssey or Metropolis or even The Matrix at me, but in my book, with its ageless eye-candy, its questions about life and human nature, and its gritty yet all-too-possible prediction of the future, Blade Runner is the definitive science-fiction movie of all time.

Justifiably celebrated for its mesmerizing production design, Scott and his crew, also putting to work visual effects that don't show 26 years, paint a wrenching but no less aesthetically pleasing portrait of what maybe 2019 Los Angeles will look like dystopic, polluted and brimming with corruption and corporate greed. You could only hope to see such amazing eye-candy from a director who is arguably one of the last true visionary directors (that now being a term which, it seems, is thrown around nearly as much these days in Hollywood circles as You'll never work in this town again!).But therein does not lie that magic ingredient that makes Blade Runner the seminal masterpiece of science-fiction film-making &#x96; that is in two other aspects of the story. The first of those is its ocean-deep and universal themes. Blade Runner is a movie that challenges the viewer to ponder not only what it means to be human, but WHY we are human. Through the central characters of Deckard (the central male whom we know more about than he knows of himself), played by Harrison Ford, Rachael (the female replicant and love interest of Deckard's who is the most advanced of her kind but still knows only mortality), played by Sean Young, and Roy Batty (the revengeful replicant who wages war on both Deckard and his own maker), played by Rutger Hauer, Blade Runner is a timeless, universal and marvelous analysis and deconstruction of the human condition in all its dimensions. And the characterizations by Ford, Young and most notably Hauer all leave indelible impressions.Also broadening the narrative scope of the film is the mind-boggling fusion of postmodern cyberpunk and future neo-noir. This adds yet another layer of beauty and intrigue, especially in Vangelis' instantly recognizable score and with the cynical and introverted Deckard feeling much like a role Humphrey Bogart might have accepted.The second definitive sign of Blade Runner's colossal greatness lies in its cautionary tale view of the future &#x96; and in 2009, unlike 1982, we all know how alarming the possibility of it successfully predicting the future is. After all, 2019 is only 11 years away. Pollution, slavery, prostitution, global warming, corruption. Technological enslavement? Think about that the next time you buy a piece of audiovisual equipment or even the next time you fire up your computer. Good sci-fi always tries to predict the future. Only the very best get it right.In summary, you can throw 2001 A Space Odyssey or Metropolis or even The Matrix at me, but in my book, with its ageless eye-candy, its questions about life and human nature, and its gritty yet all-too-possible prediction of the future, Blade Runner is the definitive science-fiction movie of all time.

What that means is that it can be enjoyed on two levels- as a decent low-budget sci-fi horror flick and also as an unintentional laugh-getter. Not an easy trick to pull off, but 'Return of the Fly' somehow manages. Edward Bernds, better known for directing dozens of Three Stooges shorts, directed here and also wrote the screenplay. A quick check of his other screen credits indicates 'Return of the Fly' was probably the peak of his cinematic career. It appears not much was expected of the film as he was given a budget of $225,000 to work with. In comparison, this is roughly half of what a typical Abbott & Costello movie cost. At first, it appears the story follows the 'Frankenstein' formula; another scientist takes up where the last left off, vowing to complete a failed experiment but THIS TIME won't make the same mistakes. Uh huh. In this case, it is the scientist's son, Phillipe, who takes up his father's mantle and determines to make his disintegrator\/integrator a success. In case you don't remember, this device is like an early version of Star Trek's transporter. But his assistant, Alan, turns out to be a con man who is only interested in stealing the machine's secrets and selling them to the highest bidder on the international disintegrator\/integrator market. His partner-in-crime (played by Dan Seymour, one of the greatest bad actors of all time) negotiates the price, which we never learn but assume is more than the budget of the picture. Vincent Price is back from the original 'Fly;' twenty or so years have passed but Price appears not to have aged a day. The adult Phillipe really does resemble his father (played by David Hedison) and when he suffers the same fate, his fly-head seems three times as large as the one in the original. I'm sure it isn't really (maybe it's the suit Phillippe is wearing), but it appears quite unwieldy at times, as when he runs through the wood or has to climb over gates or through windows. But the strangest visual moment has to be when evil Alan knocks out a nosy police inspector and puts him in the device after a guinea pig has already gone halfway through the process, so what reappears finally is the inspector with white furry hands and feet. And guess what the guinea pig has. 'The Return of the Fly' moves along at a good clip and it is the added intrigue of the disloyal Alan that keeps it from being a stale remake of the original. One can forgive certain excesses, such as one five minute stretch where it seems the disintegrator\/integrator is activated about fifteen times. Every time it is, Phillipe, Alan, and Vincent Price's Francois raise their goggles to their eyes to shield them from the blinding light, then lower them afterward. Up and down. Up and down.

In fact through the entire Hesei Series Godzilla is a villain. I like to think that by making Godzilla a villain that the people in charge of these films are admitting that Godzillla is better as a villain and the whole concept of him being a hero to japan made his popularity decline a bit. Godzilla looks pretty good, he has fangs in this one so he looks pretty scary. There is nothing comical about Godzilla in this one, he is a villain and shows no sympathy for anything in his way.This film is very similar to Godzilla King of the Monsters. It is just Godzilla, no other monsters are in it if you do not include a species of sea lice that appears briefly at the beginning. It is just Godzilla going after Japan, not much more to the story. I do like how it flashes back to Godzilla King of the Monsters, that lets viewers know that it is not a re make.

Virtually most of the reviews I have seen here are rating it highly. Perhaps it was underrated until now. It is rightly underrated, it is very poor indeed. I was going to give it a 1 but I gave it a 2, it's a Hitchcock after all! I've got a number of Hitch movies in my collection, this was one I wanted to add to it. I didn't know anything about it but I knew the title and for some reason I was thinking it was a classic. Perhaps I had read the reviews here before. When I bought the movie I thought it was strange that it was hidden away in the Hitchcock movies, thinking as I was at the time that it was supposed to be a classic. It was rightly hidden away from the the good Hitch movies.The whole premise is ridiculous. I know it's based on a real event but it's no more a very nasty schoolboy prank than the real event and is certainly not the subject of an entertaining or thrilling movie (which this isn't).The lead character, Brandon, is an out and out dork (that's me being polite). He waxes lyrical about the intellectual beauty of murdering someone for the sake of it. Presumably he enjoyed the sound of his own voice, I can't imagine anyone else enjoying it. He really is an obnoxious character and just having to look and listen to him had me wanting to switch off very early on but I persevered.Equally, I found it very slow going. I (wrongly) thought that it was a slow burner and would explode into a gripping tale. No such luck.So it's a play shot for the cinema. It looks like a play, a very bad one. Apparently the play was a success, I can't think why.Don't get me wrong, the night before I watched Dial M For Murder, which is also a play shot for the screen, and what a contrast! One of Hitch's best versus one of his worst! Come to think of it, I think it is the worst Hitch movie I have seen.This is the movie in a nutshell Two half-wits murder a pal. They invite some people around and all-but tell one of them (their old teacher) what they did. He tells them they are crazy and turns them in. That's your plot. That's your movie. So so disappointing.I was waiting for a clever deduction of the crime. There wasn't one. I felt the other guests might play a part in the deduction, nope. I think they were there to pad out the time, though the girlfriend character was good and had some good lines.I watched the extra feature about the movie. In it they spoke of homosexuality in the picture, and much has been said here about it. I didn't notice it, they just came across as pals to me but I suppose you can make a homosexual angle on just about anything.Yes it was an experiment too, giving the impression of being one shot. The film changes with a close up of someone's back were very deliberate. Hitch said later it wasn't such a great idea.There were two Hitchisms that at least gave me some reward for watching it all the way through. The increasing speed of the metronome as Rupert (James Stewart) interrogated Phillip (Farley Granger), and the building suspense as the housekeeper cleared the items from the chest before attempting to open it, while we hear the main players talking out of shot.As I say in my summary, the biggest thing I got from this movie was disappointment. Expecting a classic and getting a very limp effort instead. Believe me, it's bad. Don't watch it if you're tired, you won't make it to the end. That said, you might be doing yourself a favour.

Maybe Coppola wanted a conventional pretty-boy who acts like a piece of wood juxtaposed with the interesting Oldman, to make him doubly attractive?

As far Stallone is concerned , i think his critics should be silent now that he cant play roles other than being Rambo , rocky , cobra ,assassins , lockup and other action packed thrillers. Stallone is an action super star with a very different approach , his characters some time are more focused on story and acting rather action. I always liked him more than Arnold Schwarzenegger, jean Claude van damme, chuck norris and especially Steven seagal. This is one of the most best performance of Stallone and on the hand a very gripping , interesting kind of film. This film is made for all ages of people.

I can't believe Life only has 6.1 stars, this should have at least 7.5.The plot is about how the characters played by Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence met during the age of the prohibition in New York under difficult circumstances involving a mafia guy that forces them going to a business trip to get liqueur from the south, but in this trip they are going to have problems with the law and will be unfairly sentence to prison for life. We will be able to enjoy very funny moments in the years that they spend in prison trying to get out. LIFE has one scene that is a tribute to the film Cool hand Luke that is really funny. this is my favorite Eddie Murphy's movie and one of his two funniest performances along with Beverly Hills Cup.

Quite a feat for a mostly B & W movie; actually, the color segments are letdowns. It is about the angels who parade around among us, unseen, observing. They are all rather poorly dressed. As they travel, it is implied that children, in their innocence, can sort of see them. The angels hear all, feel nothing.Our main character angel, played by Bruno Ganz, becomes interested in a pretty trapeze artist, and wishes to become human to enjoy the breadth of that experience ... preferably with her. Peter Falk can sense him, and somehow knows what's up. Peter Falk is playing Peter Falk.The dialog, read by me as subtitles, is often powerful and poetic. Even the mundane is given a strange power as a part of the human experience. The cinematography is wonderful. Scenes are unhurried, sometimes too much so. The actors are dutifully Euro-sleek. Falk is a scene stealer without seeming to try.Worth a look. Just don't expect Nick Cage and Meg Ryan.

It's more romance than a comedy because there were not many jokes but a story, characters and soundtrack made this film great. There were no boring moments. I've watched this film because of Wheatus music video Dirtbag Baby (this song is a theme of Loser) expecting to see something like that in a movie but a movie was different than music video and still I wasn't disappointed. Most of jokes were about Jason Biggs character and it wasn't very funny, actually it made me feel sorry for him. But anyways the movie itself was great. So if you are expecting this movie to be funny you may be disappointed but on the other hand it's a great love story.
