Filmed at the height of the hip-hop era, this movie is a basketball based comedy\/drama that challenges some popular stereotypes.The story begins as a dorky white boy, Billy played by Harrelson, becomes part of a street basketball scene in LA. He hustles the street smart black man, Sidney played by Snipes, by winning a 5 shot free-throw bet. Afterwards Sydney tracks down Harrelson and they begin basically what is a street basketball hustling operation, which they'll ride all the way to the top, or so it seems anyway.There are a few sub-plots in this movie, which give a nice break from all the slow motion screen time of street basketball matches. The story features betrayal of many characters, with some mildly interesting situations.The end is surprising, and I won't spoil it for you but things don't quite work out the way you think they will.This movie has good production values, and enjoyable script and story, and solid acting by all characters. Perhaps the worst character in a way was Billy Hoyle, who was almost so stupid you'd never believe he could be good at anything. But for the movie's sake, it all works out and overall is a good enjoyable movie that doesn't really deserve any rewards, but will reward the viewer with a couple hours of good entertainment.Except for the very brief nudity, I really see no reason for this movie to be rated R. There is vulgarity and adult situations as well. I really see no reason why teenage viewers would have a problem with viewing this movie, at most it would probably make them want to go play some basketball.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 April 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" White Men Can't Jump stars Wesley Snipes, Woody Harrelson, and the quite sexy Rosie Perez.

That pretty much sums up the premise of Brokedown Palace. The story revolves around two girls who have been best friends their entire lives. Alice (Claire Danes) is kind of a troublemaker and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) is more of the na√Øve, goody goody type. Right after graduating from High School they decide they need to cut loose, so they go to exotic Thailand (of all places).There they meet a mysterious Australian. Both girls fall for the guy and Darlene talks Alice into flying to Hong Kong to meet him. But vacation plans can really change when Customs finds two kilos in your backpack. Now sentenced to over 30 years in a Thai prison, they must rely on a shady American lawyer (Bill Pullman) to prove their innocence. But, in Thailand, being innocent may not be enough.To be honest, I didn't think I was going to like this movie. I mean, yeah, the idea of two girls in a Thai prison sounds intriguing, but I was pretty sure it wasn't that kind of movie. It does start out slow, but once they get busted the movie really holds your attention. These two young American girls are in a totally messed up situation and there?s nothing they can do about it. As a viewer, I could actually feel their frustration. There are also a few exciting, edge of your seat scenes. I don?t want to give too much away, but let me just say that trying to escape can be punishable by death.The only complaint I have is that they made the prison too nice. I wouldn't want to spend my vacation there, but compared to other film prisons, this one?s pretty tame. One of the highlights of Brokedown Palace is the acting. Claire Danes and Bill Pullman are excellent and Lou Diamond Phillips (it?s good to see him working again) is great as a slimy DEA agent.

In the wake of the John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King assassinations of the 1960s and fueled by the later Watergate scandal, the film had tremendous resonance with American audiences, becoming one of the highest grossing foreign language films ever released in that market.Based on the novel by Vassilis Vassilikos, which was itself based on the 1966 Lambrakis Affair in Greece, Z is at once a political thriller and satire. Set in an unnamed nation, it presents a politician who is strongly critical of American and Russian nuclear build up and his nation's participation in it. Denounced by the status quo as a communist, he is met with civic obstruction when he arrives to give a speech and afterward is struck down and killed by a speeding truck in the streets. A drunk driving accident, according to local officials. An assassination, according to his entourage.Although the film has a somewhat slow and uncertain build, once fully underway it becomes a rapid-fire series of sharply edited scenes in which the sloppy assassination plot is unraveled by a dispassionate magistrate sent to conduct an investigation--an investigation plagued by assaults on witnesses and civic cover-up. But in such a corrupt society, can the full truth ever be known? Director Costa-Gavras walks a very fine line here, presenting the characters as archetypes but endowing them yet endowing with enough human emotion to engage our interests and sympathies. And the cast is remarkable, with Yves Montond, Irene Papas, and Jean-Louis Trintignant particularly notable. The script is at once chilling and covertly comic, jeering at officialdom around the corners of its more serious business, and the overall look of the film--particularly in the violent crowd scenes--is truly memorable.The film has been restored to a pristine condition in its original widescreen and the DVD offers a number of language subtitles (including English) in easy-to-read yellow script. Bonus features are slight, but include the original trailer, samples of restoration work, and an extremely interesting conversation between novelist Vassilikos and director Costa-Gavras. Consta-Gravas also offers an audio-commentary--in French, which will be frustrating for those who (like me) do not speak the language.Although some viewers may not even notice the satirical tone of the film, and while some will be put off by its distinctly liberal slant, I think most viewers--including those who don't normally care for foreign film--will find Z a fascinating ride, particularly if they enjoyed the likes of JFK or THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.

His life, however, will be short-lived unless he is able to reverse his cell degeneration. Up to this point, his experiments have yielded only horribly disfigured mutants. Fortunately for the Doctor, his step daughter, Abby (Heather Locklear), arrives to confront him about her mothers death. With her DNA, Arcane may be able to save himself. But, lurking nearby is Swamp Thing - Dr. Arcane's nemesis who is intent on stopping him.- I've seen this movie at least a half a dozen times. With each viewing, I want it to be good. Although bits and pieces are enjoyable, overall it's just not a very good movie. For the most part The Return of Swamp Thing fails at being an action movie, it fails at being a sci-fi movie, and it fails at being a horror movie. Some of the acting, particular that of Monique Gabrielle, is noticeably wooden. I doubt that Gabrielle has ever delivered a line that sounded natural. Some of the special effects, particularly a few of the mutants, are anything but special. Many of the plot points can be seen from a mile away. For example, when we are introduced to Abby, we are told that she's the kind of person who prefers plants to people. Gee, I wonder who will be her love interest in the movie? - The movie does achieve a little success, however, at being a comedy. Some of the lines are genuinely funny. For example, when Swamp Thing reminds Abby that their budding relationship will be hampered because he's a plant, her response That's okay, I'm a vegetarian. Not great, but it does bring a smile to my face. Another scene that I'm fond of involves Jourdan poking a little fun at himself. Jourdan's pet parakeet happens to be named Gigi.

(I was as old as the character who plays Anakin, 10). This is still my favorite Star Wars movie (They are all good!) and it has the best light saber fight scene. (Actually its a toss up between Darth Maul vs Obi Wan and Anakin vs Darth Tyranus). Overall still a good movie. So far this is still my favorite Star Wars movie, but who knows? Maybe Revenge of the Sith will make this movie look like crap (and put all the other Star Wars movies to shame). It looks pretty good but so far this is still my favorite.This movie didn't feature many battle scenes, and could be slow in some parts, however it was still better than attack of the clones.
