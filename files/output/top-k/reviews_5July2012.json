[{"date":"5 July 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This effectively somber and seedy drama plays somewhat like the George C. Scott film Hardcore of 20 years previous. There's no denying that it gets pretty grim and ugly, so it's not for all tastes, and will be hard for some viewers to take. Nicolas Cage does a solid job as a private investigator named Tom Welles, who's hired by the elderly Mrs. Christian (Myra Carter) to examine an item she's found in her late husbands' possession. It seems to be an honest- to-God snuff film, and Toms' job will be to find out if in fact the girl in the film really did die. His investigation takes him into a pornographic underworld populated by an abundance of stereotypically twisted monsters. They're not all bad, though Joaquin Phoenix, in a highly engaging performance, is a new acquaintance named Max California whose dreams of fame and fortune didn't pan out and who now works in a sex shop. Max, seeming to be somewhat bored, welcomes the opportunity to assist in Welles's inquiries. Among the assorted lowlifes are slimy film director Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare, who's a real scene stealer), Machine (Chris Bauer), the masked star of Velvets' epics, and volatile thug Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini). This film is not exactly unpredictable, as it leads to a fair bit of foreseeable developments, and as it plays out falls into the talking villain trap more than once. Still, this is a reasonably compelling, fascinating walk on the dark side of life, at least in the early going, before the story telling starts becoming more conventional. A good supporting cast really helps. Anthony Heald, no stranger to slime ball roles himself, is an attorney, Catherine Keener, rather wasted, plays the thankless role of the concerned wife, and Carter is fine as the guilt ridden old lady. The best scenes revolve around the haunted mother of the murder victim, extremely well played by Amy Morton, and the climactic confrontation with Machine is also superb in the way it dispenses with some clichés and negates any sort of preconceived notions we might have had about the character. Jenny Powell, who plays the victim, is a stripper in real life and some actual porn actresses pop up in bits. The look of the film is appropriately gloomy, with lots of night scenes and the aforementioned climax which conveniently takes place in the rain. Overall, not bad; the film has some humour but mostly plays it straight until its inevitable conclusion. Followed by a direct to DVD sequel. Seven out of 10.

Yes, by 1970 standards, it was certainly dated, but audiences didn't seem to care. It was a smash hit and the Titanic of its time. It is the type of movie that MGM would have done in 1935 with Joan Crawford and Ray Milland (more about him in a bit!) as the lovers and Edward Arnold and Lionel Barrymore as the fathers. With Midnight Cowboy as the most recent Best Picture winner and big Hollywood musicals losing millions of dollars, how can an old fashioned love story so filled with clichés become so popular? Simply this-audiences needed something like this to bring them back down to earth from all of the social issues of the late 60's and early 70's and have a good old fashioned cry. While 1973's The Way We Were is probably the best love story of the '70's, Love Story (even with its generic title) isn't far behind, and influenced producers to look to simpler themes to bring in audiences. Without Love Story, there would have been no need for tearjerkers like Terms of Endearment, Beaches and Steel Magnolias, and that would have been a shame.Certainly, you cannot find more attractive and likable leads like Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw for this film; They are gorgeous, and were the hottest on-screen couple of the year. I think what makes the film work so well is that it reminds us all of our own mortality. John Marley, as MacGraw's earthy father, is magnificent, so totally likable that it is easy to understand why he would be friends with his daughter and that she would simply call him by his first name. As for Ray Milland as O'Neal's father, that is where the film's only real flaw comes in. His character seems to have no real motivation for being so controlling with his son. Milland, one of the best looking actors of the 30's and 40's, sadly gets some really bad close-ups here. Just take a look at his eyes. They looks like one of the monsters from the 1975 horror disaster The Devil's Rain. That's some Lost Weekend!.Love Story can be a trifle manipulative at times as the music swells to a powerful crescendo at melodramatic moments. But it is that music today that people remember, and it is beautiful. There are few totally perfect films, but Love Story takes predictability and makes it acceptable to be formula. It helps to rise above cynicism when watching films like this and just enjoy its tribute to innocent youth who must face mortality head on.

It has story problems, casting problems, and originality problems. The novelty of the Predator has worn out in this film, and the whole thing was a bore from start to finish. It's no wonder that this movie isn't brought up much when discussing the Predator franchise; it's overwhelmingly forgettable.So this time around, the locale has changed from a dense Mexican jungle to the city of Los Angeles. While this film could be admired for risking such a style change, the effect is unoriginal and very out-of- place. It takes away from the Predator's primal mystique. Also, for whatever reason, the script introduces an entirely new cast of characters, without a single returning actor and scarcely a mention of Arnold's original team. Again, this is not a bad change in and of itself, but here it only leads to a rehash of familiar plot devices. The audience already knows that the mystery killer is an alien hunter, but they still have to spend over an hour watching the main characters figure it out. Where's the fun, or the suspense, in that?The same can be asked of the Predator itself. At this point we've seen what the Predator can do, and this movie doesn't offer any new tricks. It looks the same, acts the same, and shamelessly rips itself off by copying the heat-vision POV (which is utilized randomly and pointlessly here), as well as the mask removal scene. They even reuse the 'ugly motherf@#$er' line. The movie would have been better served if the antagonist was a new variant of the Predator with some new tricks up its sleeve, à la the 2010 sequel Predators.Like the first film, Predator 2 has some character issues. Replacing the always enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger is Danny Glover, who makes a horrendous protagonist. He is constantly angry, overly violent, and completely unlikeable, and is just not believable as an action hero. The rest of the underdeveloped cast is just as bad, relying either on forced exposition to describe characters or painfully obvious archetype clichés to develop them. We hear about how much of a hero Glover's character is even though this is never demonstrated, and about his longtime friendship with his police partner, though this is never proved in their interactions. At one point, a female cop grabs a flirting Bill Paxton by the family jewels and threatens him to leave her alone. Okay, we get it; she's a strong and independent woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. There were many better ways to show it. Ultimately, you won't remember any of these characters ten minutes after you finish the movie.Put all these factors together and you get a severe lack of entertainment. While the first film was riveting and intense, this one is just an unremarkable bore. The story was lame and unwanted, the Predator itself is now derivative, and the characters are pathetic. The best thing about it was the musical score, and of course it was ripped straight from the original. The most interesting thing this movie had to offer was the possibility of a crossover with another classic sci-fi monster (and we all know how that eventually turned out). Don't waste your time with the lackluster Predator 2. I give it 2 out of 10 stars.

The Magnolia Theatre in Dallas included this one in its Summer Classic series and it drew a decent sized audience, even though the one-night-only showing was on the same evening as many of the local fireworks shows for Independence Day. If you are unfamiliar with this film, you should know that it garnered director David Lean his first of seven Oscar nominations. In contrast to this little film, Lean went on to direct such epics as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago.Marital infidelity has long been a favorite topic in Hollywood ... umm ... I mean on screen. Rarely is it treated with such respect as it is here. The story is based on a short play from the great Noel Coward. With numerous scenes added for the film version, it never feels forced or over-written. What really makes this one standout is that the two lead characters are basically happily married people who just stumble into each other and a bond forms ... despite their level-headed acknowledgments that it's not a good idea.Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) are just going about their daily routines when circumstances bring them together at the hectic train station. We learn this in the opening scene through the internal-dialogue (narration) coming from Laura. See, the bulk of the movie is a flashback as we are really starting at the end. This opening scene is brilliant as we can all relate to the frustration Laura feels as her yappy, but well-meaning friend, unwittingly crashes the going-away party. We see the torture on the faces of Laura and Alec, but it takes the rest of the movie for us to get the full story.The setting of a train station adds a time-sensitive element to the rushed time together. While they bond through tea, food and movies, the train whistle is the reminder that the precious moments are at the mercy of a schedule that won't allow for flexibility. This is no Meet-Cute of which films today seem to think is a required element. No, these are two real adults who have not before noticed an element missing in their lives. Perhaps Coward is saying that nothing must be missing for two kindred spirits to connect, but that the real choice continues to lie within each of us ... loyalty, fidelity and judgment are on constant alert.It should be noted that Celia Johnson's performance really carries the film. She was nominated for an Oscar and is just brilliant in her emotional roller coaster ride. Trevor Howard, a strong character actor, makes a terrific partner for her. They strike us as real people, not movie stars, caught in a real life dilemma. To prevent an over-wrought emotional wringing, we get the comedic balance of conductor Stanley Holloway and his flirtatious ways with prim and proper shopkeeper Joyce Carey. Their playful (yet similar) relationship counteracts the upper-crust complexity of Laura and Alec.The film and its players offer up a few interesting side notes. Celia Johnson was not a fan of acting. She was seduced into playing the role after her friend Noel Coward personally read the script to her. Celia was married to Peter Fleming, older brother of Ian Fleming - he of James Bond fame. Noel Coward had a multi-layered career that included playwright, actor, songwriter and singer, novelist and even director. Mr. Coward personally selected the Rachmaninoff piano concerto that so wonderfully accompanies the movie's happenings. The bookstore shown in the film was later spun off from Boots Pharmacy, which only this year was purchased by Walgreens. Lastly, the film was originally banned in Ireland for showing marital infidelity in such a positive light. Though released in 1945, it wasn't shown in the United States until 1946, thereby pushing the Oscar nominations to 1947.

While they bond through tea, food and movies, the train whistle is the reminder that the precious moments are at the mercy of a schedule that won't allow for flexibility. This is no Meet-Cute of which films today seem to think is a required element. No, these are two real adults who have not before noticed an element missing in their lives. Perhaps Coward is saying that nothing must be missing for two kindred spirits to connect, but that the real choice continues to lie within each of us ... loyalty, fidelity and judgment are on constant alert.It should be noted that Celia Johnson's performance really carries the film. She was nominated for an Oscar and is just brilliant in her emotional roller coaster ride. Trevor Howard, a strong character actor, makes a terrific partner for her. They strike us as real people, not movie stars, caught in a real life dilemma. To prevent an over-wrought emotional wringing, we get the comedic balance of conductor Stanley Holloway and his flirtatious ways with prim and proper shopkeeper Joyce Carey. Their playful (yet similar) relationship counteracts the upper-crust complexity of Laura and Alec.The film and its players offer up a few interesting side notes. Celia Johnson was not a fan of acting. She was seduced into playing the role after her friend Noel Coward personally read the script to her. Celia was married to Peter Fleming, older brother of Ian Fleming - he of James Bond fame. Noel Coward had a multi-layered career that included playwright, actor, songwriter and singer, novelist and even director. Mr. Coward personally selected the Rachmaninoff piano concerto that so wonderfully accompanies the movie's happenings. The bookstore shown in the film was later spun off from Boots Pharmacy, which only this year was purchased by Walgreens. Lastly, the film was originally banned in Ireland for showing marital infidelity in such a positive light. Though released in 1945, it wasn't shown in the United States until 1946, thereby pushing the Oscar nominations to 1947.

At just over 80 minutes 20 Million Miles to Earth moves along at a decent pace with the spaceship crash landing in the sea during the opening few minutes & the young boy finding the alien creature not long after but one has to say that while the script feels like it was going for a King Kong (1933) feel with some misunderstood creature captured by humans that is then chained up before escaping & going on a rampage through a well known city, here Rome instead of New York in King Kong it's hard to feel anything for the human character's as they are all so one dimensional & poorly developed from the strong arm local police to the romance between Calder & a female doctor that feels like an afterthought these people are either walking clichés or very bland & forgettable. Where 20 Million Miles to Earth excels is during it's set-pieces which include the already mentioned rampage through Rome, the alien creature Ymir is far more of a character than any of the humans here & I wasn't quite sure of the message here since Ymir is never actually seen trying to deliberately hurt anyone & it's us humans who are the aggressor's as Ymir is caged up, prodded, attacked by Dog's, stabbed with a pitchfork, shot at, electrocuted, chained up & finally killed without it ever really trying to invade or destroy anything. I did end up feeling a little for the guy actually, I would have preferred Ymir to live rather than any of the soldiers or cop's.The real highlight of 20 Million Miles to Earth is Harryhausen's special effects & how he can bring an inanimate puppet to life with such charming & charismatic results as seen here, it's been said before but Harryhausen isn't just a special effects man he's an artist. The effects work here is excellent for the period & even holds up well today & I'd much rather a stop-motion animated Ymir than most of the rubbish CGI computer effects work in more recent films but I suppose that's down to personal preference. Apparently the original design for Ymir was going to make him a huge Cyclops type monster but Harryhausen changed his mind, the effects scenes really give life to Ymir from his moving tail to the way he walks to it's expressions & mannerisms. The scenes in Rome at the end are terrific with Ymir smashing up through a bridge, fighting an Elephant & climbing the Coliseum. One curious thing I noticed while watching 20 Million Miles to Earth was just how many people wear hats in it, from the police to the army to just about any random character in it almost everyone seems to wearing some sort of hat or cap.Filmed in California & in Rome in Italy, the black and white photography is fine although the direction & acting are bland. 20 Million Miles to Earth was computer colourised for it's 50th anniversary release. Harryhausen & director Juran teamed up straight after this to make the all time classic The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958) & a few years later The First Men in the Moon (1964).20 Million Miles to Earth doesn't fair too well when the human character's are on screen but when Ymir is present things pick up immensely & it's Harryhausen's terrific stop-motion effects & wonderful set-pieces that save this from being a total bore.

Oh, what to say. Nosferatu is a perfect horror film in every sense. It transports us back to a simpler time in cinema, when jump scares weren't the main concern, but atmosphere and tonal consistency. Where performances still mattered, and weren't reduced to archetypal characters and stereotypes.Nosferatu was the only production from the company Prana Films in 1921, and despite not having the rights to Bram Stroker's novel, Dracula, ambitious writer Henrik Galeen was given the assignment and pursued the challenge in adapting his story to film. With legendary director F.W. Murnau behind the camera, as well, the project was shaping out to be a fascinating and unique look on the vampire himself. It was shaping out to be perfect, until Stoker's widow, Florence Stoker, denied the rights to her deceased husband's work for unknown reasons. With a few minor changes, Murnau pushed on and made the film, but when Stoker sued, initially, the punishment was to have every copy of the film destroyed. While that clearly wasn't enforced to the fullest degree, it is unknown if the version available today is the original cut. Some reports have the film running at a runtime ten to fifteen minutes longer than the cut commercially available today, however, no official evidence has proved that the cut we possess today is censored or not.There's almost no reason to reiterate the story of the film seeing as it's pretty much the story of Dracula, which almost everybody knows. The American cut of the film even refers to Count Orlok as Count Dracula, so the secrecy is corrupt. Let's focus on the film itself. First off, one can not deny that this is one of the finest horror films ever made. The technicalities behind the film are primitive, raw, and undeniably authentic. It was shot with only one camera, incorporates some very unstable editing, utilizes grainy film stock, and as a whole, is crafted extremely simplistically. This is not criticism, but observationist recollections of the picture as a whole. I'd personally much rather have all of those things than very glossy, pitch-perfect horror production. The primitive nature of the film is a breath of fresh air in a world where everything has to be so painstakingly perfect all the time.Nosferatu, himself, is played by Max Schreck, in arguably one of the greatest roles ever in a horror film. Schreck's character is tall, lanky, with large, bulging, unblinking eyes, equipped with a large, boxy nose, an unmoved expression always on his face, and stiff and unmovable torso. His first appearance on screen is jolting and brings a shiver to even the most experienced horror moviegoer. Schreck immerses himself into this role, making his vampire character not a character aware of implausibility but one, by the end, you believe could actually be real.I mentioned the use of film noir, as well. This is a recurring aspect for the film itself, mainly because it is so frequently and professionally used. The iconic stair scene where you see Nosferatu eerily walk up the stairs in shadow is a work of Gothic genius, and has become a staple of film noir in the horror genre. Not to mention, so has the delightfully creepy scene of Nosferatu ominously rising from his coffin and staring directly at the viewer. It is film technique like that that is truly invaluable.Starring Max Schreck, Gustav von Wangenheim, Greta Schröder, Alexander Granach, Ruth Landshoff, and Wolfgang Heinz. Directed by F.W. Murnau.

As a standard sci-fi movie (not as a sequel), this is fine. It is entertaining, it has a decent plot, it has good effects, and it has some great action set pieces. However, there are several problems I have with this movie, and most of them tie back to the director, James Cameron. First of all, the editing techniques that he is so famous for really irritate me. He often shows 5 or 6 different angles of the same explosion over and over and over again. Why do we need to continue to see this explosion 5 times. Just move on with it. Additionally, this film is the epitome of over-used slow-motion. Every action scene has it, and slo-mo is one thing that, unless it has a metaphorical purpose (like in Inception), is really unnecessary and annoying. I understand that these techniques are used to make the film look cooler, but it really doesn't in my opinion. It just makes it worse and more irritating to watch. I truthfully believe that James Cameron is an excellent visceral director. He knows how to establish a visual and milk it until the last drop of awesomeness. However, being good with visuals doesn't mean that you are good at anything else. That is the second problem I have with this movie.

The Schwarzenegger character is sent back to protect them, and Robert Patrick's T-1000 is sent to kill them, just like in the first (except in the first, Schwarzenegger was sent to kill them). It was also very predictable. As soon as the Liquid Nitrogen truck appeared, I called the ending. Then, when I saw that there were still 20 minutes left, I saw the rest of the movie coming. The only reason I gave this movie a 6 is because it was fun. The action sequences were very well directed, but everything else was either meh or just bad, and most of the blame lies with the director.

This time the bat is joined by Robin (Chris O'Donnell) and Batgirl (Alicia Silverstone) as the trio try to destroy Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman). I'm not going to sit here and call this one of the worst movies ever made but I will say that time hasn't been too friendly to it. I remember watching this film the day it was released and when it was over the sold out crowd nearly tore the theater apart with their boos but I thought it was mildly entertaining due to how bad it was. The term so bad it's almost good certainly belongs to a movie like this but after revisiting it all these years later it's easy to say it's gotten worse. Where do we begin? Clooney is a great actor and one of the best working but it's easy to say that he's really bad here and miscast. Perhaps if they were making a spoof Clooney's humor would have came in handy but his style just doesn't fit. Schwarzenegger's performance is beyond bad and the awful dialogue he's given should have made the actor quit the project. O'Donnell and Silverstone are both pretty bland and boring here. Who would have thought seeing Silverstone in tight leather wouldn't work? I'd say the only cast member who comes off good is Thurman who has no problem bringing the sexual appeal to her character. The rest of the film is pretty silly and we should have all known we were in trouble when they open the film giving tight shots of Batman's butt and the nipples in his outfit.

The term so bad it's almost good certainly belongs to a movie like this but after revisiting it all these years later it's easy to say it's gotten worse. Where do we begin? Clooney is a great actor and one of the best working but it's easy to say that he's really bad here and miscast. Perhaps if they were making a spoof Clooney's humor would have came in handy but his style just doesn't fit. Schwarzenegger's performance is beyond bad and the awful dialogue he's given should have made the actor quit the project. O'Donnell and Silverstone are both pretty bland and boring here. Who would have thought seeing Silverstone in tight leather wouldn't work? I'd say the only cast member who comes off good is Thurman who has no problem bringing the sexual appeal to her character. The rest of the film is pretty silly and we should have all known we were in trouble when they open the film giving tight shots of Batman's butt and the nipples in his outfit.

It's one of those movies that, despite its runtime of over 2 hours, I can watch again and again without ever getting bored at any time. What it clearly sets it above other masterpieces of this genre like 'The Godfather' is that every scene gives me something. While many other movies of its kind tend to have scenes that get a bit tiresome or just aren't that interesting or entertaining, 'Goodfellas' succeeds to deliver top-notch entertainment until the end. This is, of course, thanks to the extremely well written script and to the perfect cast. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro who play the main characters give so good performances, that I could not think of any other actor to play any of those roles and the rest of the cast is equally good. The movie has a perfect pacing which is also thanks to the narration of Henry Hill alias Ray Liotta. His voice accompanies us through the whole movie and is definitely a huge fun factor. He delivers his story so well that you virtually live through this movie with him. When he describes how he got into the organization and what it's like to be a wiseguy, you really comprehend and feel it. Then there are the technical aspects of the movie. The camera work is brilliant with very long tracking shots and scenes without a cut which take you as an invisible spectator along through the scenes. And last but not least there's the music. Scorsese makes use of well-known pop music of that time, which really adds to the atmosphere as a whole.In the end, 'Goodfellas' is my favourite Scorsese and gangster movie as well.

Future events, such as these, will affect YOU in the future. *glug* *glug* *glug* ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 July 2012","score":"","review":" Shellac-haired Criswell, bow tie and all, nods his head violent as though he were having a seizure, as he obviously reads from cue cards and narrates this tale of future events which happened in the past, concerning pompous aliens (who appear strangely human, and speak perfectly clear, yet bloviated, English) who resurrect the dead to kill the living, so that there are more dead to resurrect, in an attempt to convince humans that the aliens are really here on Earth, yet kill people who are aware of them, to keep Earthlings from detonating a bomb which will explode particles of sunlight, and thus destroy the entire universe. After killing an old man (played, in stock footage, by Lugosi) , he is miraculously resurrected as a taller, thinner, and considerably younger man who must hide his face behind a black cloak, for reasons which are either too complex for our simple Earth brains to comprehend, or just not explained in the alcohol-fueled mishmash of a screenplay. Initial UFO sighting by the pilots is said to happen at 3.45am, but it also is implied that it is taking place at the same time as the woman's funeral (who has a funeral at 3.45 am?) and everything appears to happen in broad daylight. But the subsequent funerals all appear to be held in the pitch black night, but police arrive on the scene after driving in broad daylight, only to arrive during the same night. The film's abrupt changes from day to night make it seem each scene takes place over the course of about 85 days. Or, can these pompous, nitwit aliens alter the earth's rotation around the sun, without anyone noticing or acknowledging it? Hilariously, insanely awful; this barely even qualifies as a film, as much of the footage seems to be silent footage, or stock\/ newsreel footage, with nothing linking it to the other scenes, with background noises and ridiculously dramatic music added to the soundtrack, with some almost completely meaningless original scenes interspersed throughout the reels of film.
