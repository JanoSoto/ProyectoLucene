I was more than pleasantly surprised at what a smart and highly original black comedy this was. Reese Witherspoon gives a razor sharp performance as Tracy Flick, an over achieving high schooler who plans to run for student body president unopposed until a faculty member persuades the school football captain to run against her. To say much more would just give away too many of the delightful twists and turns this story takes. Suffice it to say that the journey is more than worth it in this smart and stylish black comedy that holds surprises at every turn. Matthew Broderick, in a refreshing change of pace, scores a bullseye as the faculty member, who turns out to have a dark side you don't see coming and Chris Klein makes the most of his role as jock turned politician. Attention must be paid here and if you think you know what's going to happen, you're probably wrong and should just keep watching. A minor classic that is worth repeated viewings.

When they get together, they can make you believe anything. Produced and directed by Barry Levinson and written by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet, this film is best known for its timing. By a stroke of luck (for the producers and distributors) its release coincided with the outbreak of hostilities against Saddam, following hot on the heels of the revelation of President Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky. Spooky. The blurb on the video box reads as follows When the President of the United States is caught in a scandal just two weeks before the election, it's up to his White House adviser Ronnie Brean (Robert De Niro) to clean up the mess. Ronnie joins forces with Hollywood producer Stan Moss (Dustin Hoffman) to divert the country's attention from the President's crime. They decide that what is needed to stop the media spotlight is a war, but lacking a real war, they fake one. Actresses play pretty refugees and rock stars record stirring hit songs about freedom. Soon America is rallying round the President. But trouble arrives when and rough and tough Senator gets wise to the pair's tricks. Meanwhile, Election Day gets closer and closer&#133; Very odd. It's a perfectly reasonable summary until the penultimate sentence. Having just watched the film I can say without fear of contradiction that there is no rough and tough Senator who discovers what's going on. Was this an alternative plot-line that was abandoned? This wouldn't surprise me because the last Act is rather weak. The CIA wrecks the war story by announcing an end to the imaginary hostilities but Hoffman and De Niro, undeterred, come up with a soldier trapped behind enemy lines. It's from this point on that the drama flags. Schuman, the imaginary soldier, turns out to be a psychotic military prisoner. The plane, supposedly carrying him home, crashes (a very odd sequence because one minute they're flying through a storm and the next our stars are standing, apparently unharmed in the middle of the wreckage &#150; I don't think so!) and then Schuman tries to attack a girl at the farm on which they end up. The farmer shoots him and the plan has to change again &#150; he'll be brought home in a coffin with full military honours. Then, in the end sequence, Hoffman decides that it's all been so successful that he has to have a credit. As far as he's concerned, this is the greatest thing he's ever produced and he wants everyone to know that he did it &#150; as he points out, there's no Academy Award for producing. He's insistent and, as he leaves, we see De Niro indicating to the security men. The next thing we see is the TV announcement that Hoffman has died from a heart attack at the age of 58 or 62, depending on the buyout. Nice gag, but it's not really a satisfying payoff. I suspect that the real problem is that lack of a Third Act. The end of Act Two should really have been the discovery of the truth by that rough and tough Senator, with Act Three posing the really big problem of how they get out of that mess. As structured here, each complication is only ever an Act Two build-up &#150; the problems change but they don't really advance the plot. It's like the same joke told in different ways. It would be interesting to find out what happened to that elusive Senator. An afterthought this makes an interesting comparison with Primary Colours which, although less overtly funny and farcical, did at least try to make some kind of intellectual engagement with its subject. Never at any point in Wag the Dog is the subject of lying in politics for the greater good ever brought into focus. On the video box the Times in London is quoted as calling the film a treat, bright and intelligent. But surely it's not. I've reached the conclusion that film critics only refer to the intelligence of a film in a direct and inverse proportion to their own knowledge and understanding of the subject. In other words, the Times critic knows nothing about White House politics so, to him, obviously, it appears intelligent. Or am I just being cynical?
