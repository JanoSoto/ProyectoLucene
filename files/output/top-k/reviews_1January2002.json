Never is a particularly great deal made of why nobody notices Bruce Willis' presence. Never does the fact that he is shot early in the film have any strong effect on his relationship with Cole. This jumble of clues is never presented as a mystery to be solved, and thus, the little paradigm shift in the last minute doesn't really solve anything, and feels tacked on. No wonder why some people didn't see it coming - because the story's structure never even proposed that such a revelation was at all necessary. At least in The Usual Suspects, the final twist actually answered a question that was posed throughout the entire film. At least in Fight Club, the revelation near the end gave the movie its meaning.Okay, so Dr. Crowe's a dead guy. So what?Here, Shyamalan's just playing for shock value and lasting impressions. Though when I look at the other comments posted here, I'd have to admit he did that quite successfully.
