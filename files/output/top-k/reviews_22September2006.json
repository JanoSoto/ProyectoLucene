There have been times when I was bored when I have recited the majority of this movie in my head. I'm not going to tell you that any of the actors in this film are great. I'm not going to tell you that any of the people involved in this movie are good at any part of making movies. The Monty Python group made a number of productions, several of which I own, but the rest pale in comparison to this masterpiece. I view this as a collection of superb individual skits that happen to form a story. Each is so insanely hysterical that I can hardly believe that anyone had it in their mind to create it. From the banter between the French and the silly English kanigits, the rational of the scientists, to the mind boggling use of coconuts to simulate the sounds of a horse and other low-budget props make this movie an absolute classic. Not too much makes me laugh anymore. It brings a smile to my face just thinking about how ridiculously funny this movie is.

Brendan Fraser (George of the Jungle, Crash) stars as ugly geeky suck up Elliot and from the very start you can tell the whole film is centred around him and his personality. With many films this narrative device is often a bad way to go for example Shallow Hal was focused solely on Hal and his own issues but this 2000 film from Ramis differs because it is more funny and intelligent. Fraser does well as the poor character Elliot and his relationship with Elizabeth Hurley (Austin Powers, Edtv) is outstandingly funny. The two act very convincingly in-front of the camera the whole was through and enjoy many memorable scenes together. Perhaps many stubborn people will argue that the story is too basic with not much to it, and they are correct to an extent. I believe this film is very good for what it is. It's a comedy fantasy romance film, you know what I mean. I believe this film had to be basic because audiences are therefore appreciative of the genre and the many different types of jokes involving Satan, sex, relationships and character personalities. It's a very understanding plot moving at a quick pace with very light-hearted scenes. The whole idea of having the devil as a woman was also an interesting concept as Elizabeth Hurley dressed in very attractive clothes and presented a very sexual iconography. Having stereotypes in the form of Propp's hero Brendan, the geeky guy and Frances O'Conner who plays Alison acceptably as the goal for the lead character. There are many predictable jokes but this is one of those films which is enjoyable for what it is, a perhaps corny romantic comedy with different types of jokes and expressing views about the after life. I recommend this film for anyone who likes a consistent plot with funny characters who jokes about relationships. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 September 2006","score":"","review":" When looking at the poster and the title the connotations of the film are pretty simple, a film about a confused person who is under the control of an evil devil, but never did I ever expect it to be as good as it was.

I also remember bits and pieces of it from late night cable. With all this exposure, one would think I would actually get to see the movie in it's entirety. Initially, I didn't expect so much passion and depth from this movie. It also seems like this might be an homage or definitely inspired by Jules Dassin's Brute Force.The movie revolves around a lifer inmate (John Voight) at an Alcatrez-like prison in the wilderness of Alaska, run by an sob warden (crazy-eyed John P. Ryan). The warden had Manny (Voight) in a solitary cell, a cell that was welded shut, for three years. The warden is forced to release him after Manny wins his litigation in this matter. Everyone knows, the warden included, as to what Manny is going to do next. Escape or Die Trying !! The escape leads to a train yard and then to a train. Did I mention it takes place during an Alaskan winter ?This movie has it all. It first starts out as a prison movie. It is very gritty and graphic. It then turns into a escape\/heist picture, complete with sidekick (Julia Robert's brother). After the conductor falls off the train, it turns into the Towering Inferno disaster movie on a train. Through all this it is still an action movie. On top of all this, it layered with Shakespearean undertones mixed with Nietschian frosting. John Voight's performance as Manny is simply amazing. I would definitely characterize it as one of his best. Manny is the grit and the experience. He is juxtaposed by the relative innocence and idealism of his sidekick, Buck (Eric Roberts). The warden is the other major player. He acts as the pursuer and yet admires and fears Manny. They are more alike than each gives the other credit for. The train becomes a small stage (or maybe a petri dish) for the human race to play it's game out on.The finale is filled with everything a heroic epic needs. There is sacrifice, glory, determination, perseverance, freedom and a little bit of sadness. We don't actually see the finale. We just fade to gray and white. I don't think anyone could have done it better. I highly recommend this movie for fans of true cinema.

In fact, it's pretty entertaining for a, if i can put it like that, standard comedy built around a certain theme (bowling). I'm not getting into the story, since so many others have done that before me already. Let's get to the characters. I'll immediately say that I liked Bill Murray the most. He was awesome, close to being g@y but gallantly maintaining manliness through the entire movie. With his character, the movie kind of insults the viewer though. For instance, how can we expect the audience to actually like him? Don't get me wrong, he's a great character, but he's supposed to be the bad guy and he doesn't have what it takes to come over as the lovable kind. That's all good, but during the bowling matches it's just not right that the audience seems to like him. His arrogance and cockiness are spread throughout and should be a reason for the crowd to despise him, not like him. I understand that for the sake of the underdog argument, he's supposed to be liked by the masses, but it would have made the movie so much better in my eyes had he been just been despised by the crowd. Harrelson is under-doggy enough already, we don't need to have that emphasized any more. That said, Bill Murray's still a great watch.Randy Quaid, as the naive Amish, is great but slips up miserably at some points. The idea of having a naive Amish is lovely, it's just that at some moments, he's portrayed as plain stupid - in sharp contrast to just naive. For instance, there's a point where Harrelson says something like Holy sh!t and Quaid goes something like Where do you see sh!t? I don't recall the exact situation anymore, but such things happen in this movie while they shouldn't. The love triangle was kind of excessive to me. Please explain to me this evil lover is abandoned by chick -> lover meets chick again and although it is flat out OBVIOUS that the chick didn't like him, the evil guy still falls for her again after a few cheesy lines of 'let's get back together and make things good for the both of us, I never really wanted to leave you'. The 'evil lover' was underwhelming also, the 'good guys' were afraid of him but they never really had a reason to. It would have been so much, so much cooler had the evil lover type had a bunch of mean looking gangster types with guns around him. Over the top, of course, but so much more awesome. There is a problem with the lady also. The first few times we get to meet her, she seems like a hard-a$$ chick who can handle herself. Then at some point, when she says something to insult the evil lover guy, the tone of the scene shifts incomprehensibly to a situation where she gets abused by her evil friend. It just made no sense to me. She shows no depth in her acting either. In the scene where she and Harrelson visit Harrelson's hometown, Harrelson holds up very well but she just lacks what it takes to make the scene really work. To be honest, the lady just slowed the movie down, while not putting anything meaningful to the table. Harrelson was great, I liked his character and he put down his role pretty well. Some jokes with his fake hand were well done, sometimes fooling the viewer in a good way but also failing the gimmick once (I only saw it go wrong once, might have been more often).All in all, this movie is pretty fun but with a few adjustments, it could have been so much better.

In the scene where she and Harrelson visit Harrelson's hometown, Harrelson holds up very well but she just lacks what it takes to make the scene really work. To be honest, the lady just slowed the movie down, while not putting anything meaningful to the table. Harrelson was great, I liked his character and he put down his role pretty well. Some jokes with his fake hand were well done, sometimes fooling the viewer in a good way but also failing the gimmick once (I only saw it go wrong once, might have been more often).All in all, this movie is pretty fun but with a few adjustments, it could have been so much better.

With that in mind, a recommended viewing would be the John Carpenter directed movie, The Fog. John Carpenter did an excellent job showing the audience that you do not have to make a gory film to be scary. The Fog came out in 1980, 26 years ago, and it does not look outdated. Carpenter did a wonderful job mixing a ghost story with a bit of slasher as well.The centennial of the small town of Antonio Bay has finally arrived. However, the events of 100 years ago are about to come back to haunt the town, because a conspiracy of the town's founders resulted in the deaths of several lepers in a shipwreck. The conspirators had planned to lure the lepers' ship towards the rocks so that it would sink, and they could recover the cargo of gold and use it to pay for building the town. The sinister plot succeeded when a fog rolled in, blinding the crew, and forcing them to follow the false fire on shore. Now the ghosts of the crew are back and so is the fog that led them to their doom. Only now, it conceals and protects the ghosts, as they seek their revenge on the residents of Antonio Bay.Since this is a scary movie, the scare factor has to be there and fortunately, it was. Like Halloween, The Fog did not rely too much on gore, but more on actual creepiness. Too much of today's horrors rely on the gore factor. Carpenter also wonderfully creates a chilling atmosphere by using fog machines to its full potential. He proves that what you do not see is scarier than what you do see. John Carpenter also composed a perfectly chilling soundtrack, even though it is a little too similar to the Halloween theme.One thing confusing this is the R rating. There was very little language and the gore was not enough to warrant an R. There were zero signs of nudity or sexuality. In 1980, the PG-13 rating did not exist, but this movie could have gotten away with a PG rating. Oh well, the rating should not be something to complain about. After all, complaining about a movie rating is the last think you should be complaining about.For a horror film, the acting was good. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a hitchhiker named Elizabeth Solley. Janet Leigh plays a town official named Kathy Williams. Adrienne Barbeau played a very important role as a Radio Disc Jockey named Stevie Wayne. Hal Holbrook played the likable priest named Robert Malone. The very first scene involves John Houseman telling a ghost story to a few kids, which was done really well. The actors did well, but the real star was not any actors or actresses but the fog itself.There are not very many negative things to say about this film. There are a few plot holes and the premise is a little silly, but if you can look past those, you can enjoy this. As a horror movie it needs to do two jobs, one is to entertain and the other is to scare and it did both. This is a perfect movie to watch in autumn time with the lights off. If you are looking for a movie with lots of deaths and gore, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a creepy ghost story, you can do a lot worst then watching The Fog.

He chooses the far future and ends up many centuries ahead in a rather primitive society -the Eloi- that lives only for pleasure and fun.(or so it seems).

Real action and interest increases when George finds out who and why make such an easygoing life for the Eloi. It is the Morlocks a weird subrace that lives in caverns and tunnels beneath the surface and are the complete opposite to the Eloi. Why they take such good care of the Eloi is one of the picture's main ingredients.With little money but a good script, perfect settings, impressive make up (for 1960) and a bunch of fine actors, George Pal brings an unquestionably entertaining film that even includes message about mankind stupidity and dangerous behaviours.Rod Taylor takes his part seriously and is excellent as the time voyager; Ivette Mimieux puts a valuable feminine touch in a not very demanding role. Alan Young, Sebastian Cabot and Whitt Bissell (a regular in Sci Fi 50's films) are very convincing as George's friends back home who find hard to believe -who could blame them?- his pretended achievements.This is a simple unpretentious movie most enjoyable and entertaining in its genre.

Both movies involve a group of people stuck on a distant planet being hunted by an extremely dangerous species. After the initial onslaught, both movies then see the remaining characters attempting to survive while desperately working to get off the planet as soon as possible. So how can Pitch Black possibly seem fresh despite all these similarities? Well, the difference is in the details.When a spaceship is critically damaged by some sort of asteroid storm, the pilot is forced to crash-land on a desert planet that has three suns. Due to at least one of the suns being above the horizon at all times it at first appears as if the planet exists in constant sunlight. Soon after they arrive it becomes apparent that the survivors are not alone. A species of creature takes a few of them out before they have a chance to figure out what's happening. This reptilian looking animal appears to have a severe reaction to light of any sort and so the climate seems to be ideal for the marooned travelers to avoid contact. But when the three suns and a planet all align in a massive scale eclipse, the creatures are free to roam the planet, attacking any life-forms that they come into contact with. The crew will soon come to realize that they need to rely heavily on a convicted killer they were previously transporting if they are to have any chance of survival.The setup is a good one. The suspense builds dramatically as the light begins to fade away. But the thing that takes the movie to another level completely is the cast and the special effects. The effects are awesome, particularly when you consider that Pitch Black did not have a huge budget. In particular the initial crash scene is grippingly intense and kicks proceedings off with one heck of a bang. The creatures look real and frightening and the use of light and shadows works well for both the story and the budgetary constraints. The movie was filmed in Australia yet the planet appears alien due to the strange overexposed lighting used throughout the daytime scenes as well as the alien looking skeletal remains that dot the surface. Each member of the cast has a distinct persona as well as their own story to tell. Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) is an attractive young woman that comes awfully close to intentionally killing most of the crew during the crash landing in an attempt to save her own life, only to be considered a hero when they all live to see another day. She struggles throughout the movie with this cowardice and the undue praise that followed. William (Cole Hauser) is a morphine addicted mercenary intent on making sure a convicted criminal comes to justice. But the star of Pitch Black is undoubtedly Vin Diesel as Riddick, an escaped prisoner that the rest of the crash survivors rightfully fear. Diesel doesn't say an awful lot during the movie, yet every time he is on screen, he simply demands attention. I do feel that the creators tried perhaps a little too hard to make Riddick appear insanely dangerous, yet it's a credit to Diesel's performance that the audience still finds themselves in awe of him as well as hopeful to see more of him in action. The character was so successful that there is now a sequel called Riddick as well as a computer game based on him alone.Pitch Black is most definitely ripping off previous films as stated above, but it does what it does tremendously well. Considering the amount of dreadful monster films that have come out in recent times, the grittiness, setting and Riddick make this movie a complete success. I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction and horror.

I do feel that the creators tried perhaps a little too hard to make Riddick appear insanely dangerous, yet it's a credit to Diesel's performance that the audience still finds themselves in awe of him as well as hopeful to see more of him in action. The character was so successful that there is now a sequel called Riddick as well as a computer game based on him alone.Pitch Black is most definitely ripping off previous films as stated above, but it does what it does tremendously well. Considering the amount of dreadful monster films that have come out in recent times, the grittiness, setting and Riddick make this movie a complete success. I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction and horror.

This was a fantastic movie. Unfortunately almost no one in Hollywood gave it a second thought, or may be they only saw Jodi Foster.Don't get me wrong, Jodi Foster was great in her roll. However, Chow-Yun Fat was even better considering his background as a new comer to the Hollywood scene. Yes, it wasn't his first week here in the USA, but one that has followed his career over the past 10-20 years could see the remarkable improvement in his acting and language skills.Well, Chow-Yun Fat was always great in almost any roll he was given back in Hong Kong. Now, this movie really brought out the emotions deep inside him. We were also extremely impressed with his vastly improved English skills. Although, he had to pretend having a sort of heavy accent while playing the roll of a Thai king learning English.It was known that Chow-Yun Fat hired a personal speech\/language instructor to improve his chances of landing a big roll here. From this movie, we bet that both with his hard work and the great instructor, it has paid off.Like I said before, unfortunately, Chow-Yun Fat hasn't seeing the rewards for his efforts being recognized in Hollywood. As Jackie Chan mentioned, Asian actors only get the action hero or martial arts roll in Hollywood. They do not ever get the recognition that they deserve for any other rolls, specially those of Leading Man. It is as if Hollywood only see's Asian actors in action movies ONLY. I can assure you that they are much more capable than that.The only recognition Asians get are for women. When will this Hollywood BIAS end?!

First of all, I'd like to say right off that if you want a deep, thought-provoking story, then this is not the movie for you. Con Air works as a stress reliever; filled with explosions, extremely high number of casualties, bombs exploding, planes crashing, karate scenes etc etc.Nicolas Cage plays as a convict being released. He is set to go to Carson City by air, along with many other hi-profile criminals who are being transferred. He has a wife and a daughter waiting him for him, and he is looking forward to a new beautiful life. But then a slight problem comes in the way. The plane he is in is captured by the criminals, the leader of them being John Malkovich. Now it is up to Nicolas Cage to think of something so that he can get off the plane and see his family again. And then the action starts.Nicolas Cage was brilliant in this movie, he played up to his role extremely well; and Malkovich was excellent as the criminal leader who knows what he is doing, and is extremely good doing it.All in all, this is an excellent summer flick that acts more as eye-candy to the stressed soul who wants to see large scale gunfights and planes crashing. The movie would have been perfect if it had been able to add some twists to the story, but unfortunately the story is as linear as it comes.

There is plenty of good action and almost never a dull moment. The characters especially Tetsuo and Kaneda seem believable. It's not like some anime movies where you don't feel any empathy towards the characters. This movie is also a bit graphic which is why it should be watched by a mature audience, so if you are a bit queasy when it comes to blood, don't watch this video.
