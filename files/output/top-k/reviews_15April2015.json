The casinos are all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) whom Danny has a personal dispute with. They are all very smart people who know how to play outside the law and win. The plot is cunning and The gang of thieves stress and collaborate together to pull off the perfect crime in this clever film. I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I still admire it. Ocean's Eleven is a witty and funny film that keeps you thinking up until the end of the movie. Every detail is perfectly placed in the movie and I still catch new important clues relating to the plot every time I watch it. It really plays with small details and the relationships that the characters have with each other. There is a perfect balance of fun and seriousness in their job and you can really tell that based on their conversations and interactions with each other. It's a brilliant film that I can watch again and again without boring myself.This film is unique in the way it was filmed and edited. As Rusty and Danny explain exactly what they will be doing according to the plan, this film flashes to them enacting their plot as Rusty and Danny talk about it making it very neatly edited. It tricks you when it comes to time and location, making you really think about what is going on. I also love the cinematography of this film. It takes place in Las Vegas and you really get that when you're watching it. The dim lighting, and glamorous wardrobe selection really conveys what the film is trying to get across, as well as the characters as they are playing different roles. It's really the kind of film that makes you want to rob a Las Vegas casino. And who better than Brad Pitt and George Clooney to rob it with you? The cast is absolutely magnificent. It is picked perfectly with star studded actors. Each actor and actress plays their role exquisitely. The main character are introduced into the film showing exactly who they are and their distinct personality right off the bat, and you love each of the characters instantly. They are all quirky and have their own little comedic mannerisms and actions that just add to the hilarity of the film.I've seen other con-like robbery movies but this movie really is my favorite. There are even two sequels to Ocean's Eleven and I still keep this one close to heart. This movie reminds me of another robbery film, Inside Man (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Now this movie is more intense than Ocean's Eleven and is not a comedy like it, but it does share some of the same features. Both of these movies deceive you in the plot just as the characters have deceived their robbery victims. In Inside man, Clive Owen pulls off the perfect bank robbery just as Clooney, Pitt, and their crew did in Ocean's Eleven. I love both movies but I really enjoyed the comedic appeal that the Ocean's Eleven added to something serious like robbing a place. It really makes it more entertaining for the audience and makes you love the quirky characters even more.This movie is simply a delight to watch. I could watch marathons of these movies and still wish I had more to watch. Clooney and Pitt steal the show in this film and lead us through this funny and smart plot effortlessly. The whole idea of this movie is simply gold and the whole cast shows us that throughout every scene. I really think highly of this film and encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to take the time to watch it. I would also suggest watching its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007), as they are written just as perfectly as the first one.

Dorothy of course gets upset as a woman wanted to get rid of her dog Toto and she runs away,only to get whisked away into the magical world of OZ. Now Dorothy is in the magical world and she has to try and find a way home. Along the way she meets a wicked witch,a white witch named Glenda,a lovable lion who wants courage,a tin man who wants a heart and a scarecrow who wants a brain who are all very well done.So here is the good,the bad and the verdict.The good The visuals are very good (yet I did find a problem with it as well which will be talked about in the bad section). The cast was very good,especially the late Judy Garland who did it justice as Dorothy our main heroine in the film and the premise is original and not predicable. Think of it as Alice In Wonderland where she goes to another dimension and the 2013 James Franco flick OZ The Great & Powerful which was also a fantastic film.The music was very good too especially the iconic song Somewhere Over The Rainbow and Follow The Yellow Brick Road.The bad The backgrounds are just so false looking. Maybe its just me but you know once you see it in the colourful world that its not real as it looks like canvas in the background. Also the songs can get too irritating from time to time but I loved them all the same.Final verdict Overall this is a film that I have loved since I was a child and I was so happy to have picked up the 2 Disc DVD version of it in HMV a few days ago.

I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.Overall, if you like cop\/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion.

I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass.

The Greatest Story Ever Told stars Max von Sydow as Jesus Christ of Nazareth (von Sydow) in a feature-film chronicle of Jesus's birth by Mary (McGuire) all the way to his death on the cross & rising from the dead. The film starts with a reading from the Book of John, giving us a rather joyful start to Christ's life, but as the runtime continues, the frequent dullness of this film's events begins to take its toll on viewers. Why? Because this film suffers from utter faithfulness to the Book it's based on, never once showing any sign of creative liberty or inspiration. Unlike 1956's magnificent The Ten Commandments, Greatest Story fails to heighten the tension that would have come in reality for such amazing events and doesn't take any risks. For instance, after Jesus's baptism, he runs into Satan in the mountains and is tempted by a supposedly menacing figure. All of Satan's taunting fails to reveal pure soulless evil in him, even though he is the Devil. Even some better camera-work, lighting, and direction on Stevens's part would have made it seem like a heated argument rather than a dull bickering in the dark. Truly, the lighting often makes it incomprehensible to see who is talking or even where people are. But there are moments when the actors' and score's work alone create some charming scenes, such as Jesus healing a cripple, entering the temple, and dying on the cross. While the camera-work is mediocre in many eventful moments, relying on long unedited shots for comprehension, it truly succeeds on landscape shots, giving the Jordan River and the capital of Jerusalem a true sense of grandeur. Sadly, the film also relies on overly preachy segments for grandeur, especially a couple of overlong scenes of prayer from Jerusalem's men & women. What mainly saves Greatest Story are its main all-star performances. Max von Sydow gives Jesus the spiritual mentality he needs to appear wise and kind to all. Charlton Heston, who starred as Moses in The Ten Commandments, brings back the same authoritative attitude and vigor to steal whatever scene he's in as John the Baptist, elevating interest where it couldn't have existed. Other supporting standouts are David McCallum as Judas Iscariot and Joanna Dunham as Mary Magdalene. The Greatest Story Ever Told doesn't make much impact with its 3-hour runtime like Commandments did; in other words, it's an overly faithful biblical epic for the overly faithful.

The spark just isn't there with the actors; if there was just the hint of danger between the two, of temptation, it might work. But there isn't.Ann Todd - who, unlike, Peck and Valdi, was Hitchcock's first choice - actually has more chemistry with Peck as husband and wife together, though only gets one meaty monologue (which is cleverly pointed out by the character as to be a 'speech'), though it only goes so far and still makes her a 'type'. Still, there's enough to make it engaging for the points of a mystery whodunit, and a little Charles Laughton goes a long way (he has two memorable scenes, and one where he kinda sorta has a friendly chat with Todd is maybe the most darkly funny and weird scene of the movie, the most 'Hitch' in his way).All the same, it shouldn't seem mysterious as to who really 'dun' it, and that's not here or there.

There was no doubt that following the two detectives hunt down John Does was going to be a treat. But what Fincher does so beautifully here is surpass the intrigue caused by the film's writing with pacing that escalates the film's events from noteworthy on a base level to thrilling. It would have been so predictable and placid to simply follow each of the seven murders like a trail of breadcrumbs, allowing the final murder scene to be the murderer's reveal and the film's final confrontation, but instead we're introduced to John Doe as a character about halfway through the film. While Spacey himself doesn't get screen-time until he turns himself in in the third act, Doe is characterized through his ruthless pragmatism in immediately shooting at the detectives when they discover his apartment (rather than try to convince them that he's not their guy), which is later contrasted by his decision to spare Mills' life Doe was hell-bent on carrying through with his plan, and the senseless killing of an officer would only cloud the message his murders were supposed to send. Not to mention the fact that Mills was destined to be his Wrath.On that point of Mills as Wrath, there is a plot hole to discuss, or at the very least an incongruity. The fact that every other murder victim seemed to be the result of over a year of planning (especially Sloth, who was literally entrapped for over a year) does conflict with the decision to make Mills Wrath after only knowing that he exists for a few days. Doe is endlessly scheming and insanely careful (sanding off his own fingerprints in the off chance that he's discovered), so why would he put his plan into motion without hammering down a surefire candidate for his Wrath? While Doe could have simply decided that he was going to make whichever detective came after him his Wrath, it sort of undermines the perfect casting of the passionate and unfocused Mills as the man who would allow Doe to get the better of him. Looking back at the scene where Mills kicks down Doe's door, would just any detective have the gall to ignore the law so brusquely? Perhaps Somerset was supposed to be the unique one, a bastion of purity and law-abiding good-nature (whose positivity has been hammered down over time by the city's unwavering cruelty into apathy) in the sea of brutish and violent officers like Mills and John C. McGinley's California. If this was intended to be Doe's true message, a commentary on the state of the police force, it seems a little weak. Granted, this is all based off of what could have just been a simple oversight in order to deliver the most interesting twist ending possible, but it muddles the impact of the film's ending after moving past the surprise of it.

However, with The Newton Boys, he attempts to infuse his laidback style with a true crime caper, concerning the Newton Gang, a group of four brothers who robbed banks in the United States during Prohibition. He conducts the film in an episodic manner, devoting over two hours to these brothers, their robberies, and their schemes by simply allowing their conversations to prevail and the charm of the actors to carry the film.The ringleader of the gang is Willis Newton, played by Matthew McConaughey, a suave, smooth-talker who maps out these heists. His brothers are the amiable ladies man Jess (Ethan Hawke), the lovable softy Dock (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the youngest and wiliest Joe (Skeet Ulrich). In addition, the brothers seek the help of Brentwood Glasscock (country singer Dwight Yoakam) to help blow the safes of banks with ample amounts of nitroglycerine.

Linklater's investment in his characters is noted with every film I've seen from him, but here, it's as if he's within arm's length of his characters at all times, never gravitating towards them to learn about them, despite the glacial-pace of the film. The conversations between the men reiterate tired ideas describing how robbing the banks isn't a bad thing because they're essentially stealing from insurance companies, so clearly, stealing isn't so bad. These conversations undermine the titular characters, and the coffin-sealing nail is no perspective is ever provided on these men to show how we're supposed to view them.So The Newton Boys drags on without much energy, like someone who worked a forty-five hour week and begrudgingly took on a twelve hour shift to follow it up. As it meanders and rifts around, it manages to drain the energy out of us, the audience, as well, and we're left with a film that's lifeless and impotent, two traits I never thought I'd associate with Linklater.

The film has sometimes been read as a comment on communism or feminism, but in its heart it seems to me like a comment on the human condition in general, and remains one of the best Asian films I've seen. The film's now famous distribution issues started in China actually, where the film was supposedly banned for a short time even though the script was approved by the censors. The controversy was apparently raised because the movie can be read as a criticism of traditional Confucian ideals. It was later adapted into a homonymous ballet by the National Ballet of China, also directed by Yimou Zhang.The movie is set in a single family compound and practically every scene happens inside its walls. This location also serves as a microcosm in encapsulating the past (or the current even) Chinese society in a nutshell. It's a story of several women trying to get recognition or control the situation in which they're practically powerless, bound to a master whose face is constantly obscured or out of camera's reach. The final shot of the Fourth Wife walking in circles outside her ex-room is particularly striking as it shows that fighting for progress and standing up for yourself is basically pointless and will get you nowhere as the system will run you over.The story takes place throughout the four seasons, and many of the outdoor shots repeat with a different weather mechanic or differently arranged lanterns decorating it, to portray the never-ending cycle of cruel tradition which lives on and on, regardless of the time period. The weather may change, but the lanterns stay. But really, you just have to love the visual design of this movie. Static camera and very formal framing, the beautiful usage of shades of red, the huge traditional housing location whose magnitude completely swallows the characters...

The characters are unforgettable and at the very least relatable, you see them and know their plight as they go through this dark period of time.So what's the bacon? Bob Hoskins plays Harold Shand, a London Gangster who's brought about peace in the Capital's gangster scene. However, on the day he plans to sign a giant East End development project with American investors, his organisation is rocked by the murder of his childhood friend and a bomb blowing up his Rolls Royce. Shand now has the ordeal of tracking down the people attempting to destroy his organisation whilst at the same time keeping it a secret from the Americans.So, the good stuff? All of it if I'm honest. It's got heart, with all the characters being at the very least human, not invincible husks with no personality and no real human traits. Shand isn't invincible, he's simply a man who's built himself up from the gutters of the London slums to become the kingpin of the city, and you can really feel for his emotions and really want him to find a way out all the way through the movie.The story is an absolute cracker, strong, coherent, chocked full of twists and really good fun to sit through. At the same time the film, unlike many of the same period, is surprisingly subtle. There aren't an onslaught of nauseating gun battles, nor is it just continual fist fights with no connection to the plot other than to cram in a load of action. It is a fantastic blend of story and style, which I love to bits!To top it all off as well, the soundtrack, although very simple, is fantastic and absolutely catchy. Bet your bottom dollar that you'll be humming the theme tune to this movie for a week after viewing!What else can I say? The story's great, the characters are great, the music's great, it's grounded, down-to-earth and overall a fantastic movie. One of my all time faves and definitely my favourite gangster flick!

As a woman, one feels that one should be safe and secure with a husband like that - at the same time that one's hormones would be working overtime! -) That is a very unusual combination in a man.Kim Novak is also perfect in her role. She was very pretty at this time - although never on par with the great Hollywood beauties, such as Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Ava Gardner or Elizabeth Taylor. Novak shows here that she could play both the Lady and the Tramp - two totally different character types. One thing that is a bit strange though, is that Judy could not play the role of Madeleine better in the latter part of the movie, when she had got to the stage that she wanted to do everything to please Scottie. I mean when she had played that role so successfully in the early part of the story, she ought to have been able to use the same posture, the same way of walking, the same modulated speech etc. also if she had no one to coach her anymore. That was a big plot-hole, really. Also, as many others who have commented here, I think it was a mistake to reveal the solution to the mystery so early on. That made the remaining part of the movie less interesting - although one still wanted to know if Scottie would forgive Judy and be able to love her as herself.

That was a big plot-hole, really. Also, as many others who have commented here, I think it was a mistake to reveal the solution to the mystery so early on. That made the remaining part of the movie less interesting - although one still wanted to know if Scottie would forgive Judy and be able to love her as herself.

The story is ingenious of course, but I do not believe anybody would use it for a production for an adult audience today. The mumbo-jumbo element is too improbable and immature - also when it turns out that is was a false lead. It is a typical plot for a mystery novel or TV series for 11- 15 year old girls. I did not find the movie especially suspenseful or scary either, despite of it being a Hitchcock movie.With this said, I enjoyed the movie for the actors. I love James Stewart - he was so handsome and stylish as a middle-aged man, and he also had that decent and wholesome aura. As a woman, one feels that one should be safe and secure with a husband like that - at the same time that one's hormones would be working overtime! -) That is a very unusual combination in a man.Kim Novak is also perfect in her role. She was very pretty at this time - although never on par with the great Hollywood beauties, such as Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Ava Gardner or Elizabeth Taylor. Novak shows here that she could play both the Lady and the Tramp - two totally different character types.

Gates lived in Cabrini&#x96;Green while Agee and his family resided in West Garfield Park.Although never a basketball player or from a poor neighborhood, this touches home for me a bit because I am from the Midwest and have spent a fair amount of time in Chicago. And then add Marquette University, a place I have been to countless times, and you are practically in my backyard.The strength of this film is that -- despite the title -- it is not about basketball. That is what drives the narrative, but the deeper story is one of race, class, poverty, unemployment, crime, family values and more. These are real issues, and whether or not we face them, they are holding entire communities back from succeeding.Although violence is never a focus of the film, it remains ever on the edges. The families of both men have experienced losses since the release of the film. On Thanksgiving morning 1994, Agee's older half-brother, DeAntonio, was gunned down at Cabrini&#x96;Green. In September 2001, Gates' older brother, Curtis, 36, was shot to death in the Chicago Lawn neighborhood. Arthur's father, Bo Agee, was murdered in 2004.

I have seen thousands of movies in my sixty plus years. I watched Scarface for the first time today. What a bad joke. The performances by Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer are some of the very worst performances I have ever seen in my entire life by an actor and actress. I actually give this movie a minus 500 on a scale of 1 to 10. I only kept watching this movie to see if it pick up or got better. The movie Scarface only got worse. If actual criminals were actually as stupid as Al Pacino came across portraying Tony Montana then there would be no crime. How could the character Elvira Hancock as played by Michelle Pfeiffer ever be considered to be sexy, desirable, attractive or a sex object? Maybe a dead opossum would be attracted to other dead meat. I feel I was betrayed by the average rating of 8.3 by 454,262. I realize that signs of intelligent life are getting harder to find but 8.3? I will never trust the average rating for any movie on IMDb again. I endured 170 minutes of frustration and total lack of entertainment. It is too bad that Tony Montana was not gunned down in the opening scene and the rest of the movie could have followed the seagulls who were more interesting. Matter of fact, the seagulls were a lot sexier than Michelle Pfeiffer. It will be difficult for me to ever try to watch any movie with either Al Pacino or Michelle Pfeiffer in it. Oh, Michelle Pfeiffer could have been gunned down in the opening scene but unfortunately she survived the entire movie. How sad.
