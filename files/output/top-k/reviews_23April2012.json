The Pinkerton Detective Agency is called in to try and deal with these notorious outlaws.I love this western for many different reasons. Chief amongst them is simply that it looks and sounds gorgeous, full of authentic period detail, beautiful costumes, rich traditional music and expertly staged action. I also love the cast, all of whom are tremendous; some may dismiss the idea of casting four sets of real life brothers, but it works beautifully because they are all great players. David Carradine and Stacey Keach as Cole Younger and Frank James in particular are two of the few actors I can think of who could pull off these larger-than-life roles and not look ridiculous. Everyone is great though and special mention has to go to Reed as Belle Starr, who sizzles up the screen and matches the machismo shot for shot. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it though is its detached political stance - one view of Jesse James is as a heroic fighter who refused to bow to the North and stole from wealthy Yankee businessmen, whilst he and the gang can just as easily be labelled as bigoted cut-throats and killers. The movie doesn't preach either way, but it does emphasise the protagonists' army bushwacker pasts and their sense of disbelief and resentment at the Confederate defeat, whilst making no apologies for their actions. This tension builds towards the excellent finale at the infamous disastrous bank raid in Northfield, where I'm caught between satisfaction that the bandits have finally met their comeuppance and sheer horror as they are trapped and shot to pieces. The slow-motion sequence with the horses jumping through the windows as they desperately try to escape is one of the most powerful and visually arresting moments in all western cinema. The movie was obviously a labour of love for director Hill and co-writer\/co-producer\/star James Keach, and they've created a rich, mythic depiction of the end of the Old West, balancing the traditional gunfights and saloon scenes with pensive moments, square dances and rural landscapes. Its trump card is the fabulous music by Ry Cooder, which mixes a contemporary score with period instruments, traditional songs and moody interludes and enhances all the key sequences, becoming an integral part of the story (the Rally 'Round The Flag recital the boys object to, Jim and Bob singing and playing the Jewish Harp on the train) and completely immersing the viewer in 1870's America. A sensational and thrilling western, not to be missed, for both the tremendous direction and the pleasure of watching the Carradine, Keach, Quaid and Guest brothers in action. For other cinematic versions of the James-Younger gang's exploits, check out Nicholas Ray's 1957 The True Story Of Jesse James or Philip Kaufman's 1972 The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid.

A startling mix of action, historical drama, thriller, horror, fantasy and (most importantly) erotica. It is a film that is hard to categorise and indeed lurches quickly from one to the other, often within the same scene.Watching this, I suspect my reason for enjoying it so much is that it is charming and inventive. It is a flawed film (something I will elaborate on later) but it is so shameless in its style and story that I can't help but be swept up in it.The story itself starts out very simply, a Beast (la bete!) is terrorising a region of France so the King sends a taxidermist and knight to the region to capture the beast and bring it back to Paris for examination. The knight, Gregoire de Fronsac brings with him an Indian, Mani. The film soon plunges forward with other tales of incest, political intrigue, assassination and religion at an alarming rate, so fast in fact that some of the more subtle parts of the film don't get the time and the resolution that they deserve.Some of the actors are extremely familiar, including Vincent Cassell (one of my favourites) as the slimy and creepy Jean-Francois de Morangias, who lost an arm in Africa to a lion. Samuel Le Bihan (Fronsac) and Monica Belluci (Sylvia) are reasonably good but despite the genre blending nature of the film, the characters (among others) are irritatingly under-developed. Whilst each has a reasonable back story, motive and so on, there is little characterisation beyond that.The director, Christophe Gans appears to be a huge fan of slow motion, the effect coming in often at bizarre and borderline intrusive times. Whilst the action is very entertaining, the fighting scenes in some cases are obviously shoe-horned into the scene with little or no relevance to what is currently going on. The film also goes on for a long time and could easily shave off several scenes overall and not lose pacing or characterisation. All in all, an odd film. I find it really quite entertaining and inventive, enough that I can overlook the flaws that can be levelled at it.

The first, a William Castle-directed picture that has long been a baby-boomer favorite, is undeniably scary, although much of the picture's ghoulish occurrences, as it turns out, are man-made machinations in the furtherance of a sinister scheme. Robert Wise's 1963 film is considered by many (including myself) the single most frightening film ever made, although nothing blatantly horrible is ever shown, and the film's ubercreepy happenings just might all be the product of Eleanor Vance's (Julie Harris') deranged mind. And then there is the '73 film, which, I get the feeling, is often dismissed as a poor cousin of its 1963 forebear, but which a recent viewing has once again demonstrated, to this viewer, to be the most harrowing, nerve-racking and possibly edgiest of the bunch. In TLOHH, which Richard Matheson scripted and which was based on his 1971 novel Hell House (Matheson had already written a very scary haunted-house short story called Slaughter House in 1953, as a sort of warm-up), not only are the hauntings incontrovertibly genuine, but bloody, horrifying and murderous, as well. As it's referred to in the film, the Belasco House, aka Hell House, is the Mt. Everest of haunted houses...and for good reason, as it turns out!In TLOHH, as in The Haunting, a quartet of investigators goes to an abode with a very bad reputation to investigate the paranormal. Here, dying millionaire Deutsch (Roland Culver) sends the team off to ascertain if there really is such a thing as survival after death. The team consists of a physicist, Lionel Barrett (Clive Revill), who is accompanied by his beautiful wife, Anne (Gayle Hunnicutt); a mental medium, Florence Tanner (former child actress Pamela Franklin, top billed here); and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, the only survivor of a previous Hell House investigation (Roddy McDowall). Barrett believes that the house's spectral manifestations are the result of mindless, directionless energy forces that can be dissipated with a new scientific gizmo of his, whereas Tanner is very much a proponent of the theory of multiple surviving personalities being responsible for all the terror. But whose theory is correct?I've got to tell you, TLOHH is, quite simply, everything I think a great horror movie should be. Director John Hough, who had already helmed Twins of Evil and would go on to create such psychotronic favorites as (the Disney horror films) The Watcher in the Woods and Escape to Witch Mountain, here utilizes off-kilter camera angles, extreme close-ups and moody lighting to engender a decidedly menacing atmosphere, while the great lensing of DOP Alan Hume and the wonderfully eerie, mostly electronic score from Brian Hodgson and Delia Derbyshire only add to the deliciously nasty feel. All four leads are just marvelous, and are given ample opportunities to shine. British actress Franklin, who had previously pleased viewers in such spooky films as The Innocents, The Nanny and Our Mother's House, is just terrific in her ectoplasmic scene, and when fighting a demon-possessed cat, and when having sex with an invisible spirit; just try to NOT feel chilled when you see her giggling face, postcoitus. New Zealander Clive Revill is fine throughout, and never better than when reacting to a particularly violent dinnertime poltergeist attack. Gorgeous Gayle Hunnicutt, the only American in the cast, gets to have a few lustfully possessed, somnambulent interludes that should just amaze you, and Brit Roddy McDowall...well, he just about steals the show, for this viewer. Just look at how excellent he is while chiding scientist Barrett from atop the staircase--You do not fight this house!--and while engaged in mortal combat with the Belasco spirit. This is some kind of Oscar-calibre work here, at least of the Supporting Actor category. Just remarkable, really. As for Matheson's screenplay, yes, it does excise much of the sex and violence from his horrifying novel, but even still, is grimly effective. And as for Hell House itself, it just might be the most convincingly scary, from an architectural standpoint, of any of the houses in my Big 3. House on Haunted Hill's modernist abode (actually the Ennis House, in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles) was certainly striking, as was The Haunting's Hill House (actually Ettington Hall, now the Ettington Park Hotel, in Stratford-upon-Avon), but Hell House, with its carved gates, gargoyled pillars and Gothic towers, really does look like the real deal (Hell House is actually Wykehurst Place, in Bolney, West Sussex). This is a house that tells you, at first glimpse, that all visitors will certainly be in for a rough ride!Two words of advice for all prospective viewers of this splendid horror film, one of my all-time faves. First, turn up the volume, as there is a LOT of almost subliminal mishegas transpiring on the soundtrack. And second, have a nice, hot cup of herbal tea at your side, both to calm you down and to fight off the chills that will assuredly be coursing down your spine. Trust me, you're gonna need it!

As it's referred to in the film, the Belasco House, aka Hell House, is the Mt. Everest of haunted houses...and for good reason, as it turns out!In TLOHH, as in The Haunting, a quartet of investigators goes to an abode with a very bad reputation to investigate the paranormal. Here, dying millionaire Deutsch (Roland Culver) sends the team off to ascertain if there really is such a thing as survival after death. The team consists of a physicist, Lionel Barrett (Clive Revill), who is accompanied by his beautiful wife, Anne (Gayle Hunnicutt); a mental medium, Florence Tanner (former child actress Pamela Franklin, top billed here); and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, the only survivor of a previous Hell House investigation (Roddy McDowall). Barrett believes that the house's spectral manifestations are the result of mindless, directionless energy forces that can be dissipated with a new scientific gizmo of his, whereas Tanner is very much a proponent of the theory of multiple surviving personalities being responsible for all the terror. But whose theory is correct?I've got to tell you, TLOHH is, quite simply, everything I think a great horror movie should be. Director John Hough, who had already helmed Twins of Evil and would go on to create such psychotronic favorites as (the Disney horror films) The Watcher in the Woods and Escape to Witch Mountain, here utilizes off-kilter camera angles, extreme close-ups and moody lighting to engender a decidedly menacing atmosphere, while the great lensing of DOP Alan Hume and the wonderfully eerie, mostly electronic score from Brian Hodgson and Delia Derbyshire only add to the deliciously nasty feel. All four leads are just marvelous, and are given ample opportunities to shine. British actress Franklin, who had previously pleased viewers in such spooky films as The Innocents, The Nanny and Our Mother's House, is just terrific in her ectoplasmic scene, and when fighting a demon-possessed cat, and when having sex with an invisible spirit; just try to NOT feel chilled when you see her giggling face, postcoitus. New Zealander Clive Revill is fine throughout, and never better than when reacting to a particularly violent dinnertime poltergeist attack. Gorgeous Gayle Hunnicutt, the only American in the cast, gets to have a few lustfully possessed, somnambulent interludes that should just amaze you, and Brit Roddy McDowall...well, he just about steals the show, for this viewer. Just look at how excellent he is while chiding scientist Barrett from atop the staircase--You do not fight this house!--and while engaged in mortal combat with the Belasco spirit. This is some kind of Oscar-calibre work here, at least of the Supporting Actor category. Just remarkable, really. As for Matheson's screenplay, yes, it does excise much of the sex and violence from his horrifying novel, but even still, is grimly effective. And as for Hell House itself, it just might be the most convincingly scary, from an architectural standpoint, of any of the houses in my Big 3. House on Haunted Hill's modernist abode (actually the Ennis House, in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles) was certainly striking, as was The Haunting's Hill House (actually Ettington Hall, now the Ettington Park Hotel, in Stratford-upon-Avon), but Hell House, with its carved gates, gargoyled pillars and Gothic towers, really does look like the real deal (Hell House is actually Wykehurst Place, in Bolney, West Sussex). This is a house that tells you, at first glimpse, that all visitors will certainly be in for a rough ride!Two words of advice for all prospective viewers of this splendid horror film, one of my all-time faves. First, turn up the volume, as there is a LOT of almost subliminal mishegas transpiring on the soundtrack. And second, have a nice, hot cup of herbal tea at your side, both to calm you down and to fight off the chills that will assuredly be coursing down your spine. Trust me, you're gonna need it!

From its low budget, to its vintage Charlton Heston performance, to the shock revelation, to the infamy of the 'Soylent Green is People,' line, to the very dated look of the film, there is a lot to tempt a viewer to laugh rather than work with it for an experience.But laughing the film off fails to recognize one thing---it is a pretty good movie. It is also a rare type of film---one that takes on an interesting moral topic for our society in a manner that is entertaining and lacks pretension. The film falls under the dystopian sci-fi sub genre, which I have a soft spot for. As far as those types of films go, Soylent Green has a creative and vivid concept of the future. It is a bit like A Christmas Carol for planet earth---'This is what will happen if we don't change our ways!' And frankly, even in this day and age we have not changed things enough to avoid a bad era sometime in the future. At every turn Americans seem to have a doom and gloom notion that reveals their knowledge deep down that trouble is ahead if we don't change our ways and solve a great many problems.Soylent Green came about in an era that perfectly exemplifies this sort of activist mindset, the awareness of what people do to the earth and what that could come to mean. As the youth of the 1960's rebelled and became more socially aware, an explosion of small causes and awareness niches took root in the early seventies. One of these was environmental activism, the idea that earth needed protecting, particularity from the trappings of consumer culture. Unfortunately, this idea has more or less been only at the fringe. But Soylent came about when these ideas were new and close to becoming mainstream. The brilliant opening montage is one of my favorites in any film I've seen. It pretty well sets the stage for the film in a number of seconds while creating a mini work of art which sets a mood of agitation under the rest of the film. However, this short montage is the manic build up, and despite intrigue, murder and the stress of living in a world that is shutting down under the burden of overpopulation, the rest of the film has an emptiness and placidity to it. We are disturbed by images a pea soup air, shovel loaders full of people, and staircases full of sleeping people at all hours of the day. But a calm loneliness pervades. Part of this is because a big part of the film is about relationships. This is both unusual for a dystopian film and what is arguably a B- movie. The acting is amazing. Charlton Heston is a hard nosed detective, Thorn who grew up after overpopulation problems took over. His roommate, case researcher and most importantly best and only friend is a smart, tired old man named Sol, who remembers earth before overpopulation. Imagine landscapes, flowing streams, wildlife, fresh and unprocessed food being only memory. It is a very emotional thing for Sol, and the viewers. It only becomes emotional for Thorn after a meal with Sol consisting of fresh food taken from a murdered rich person's apartment.In many ways this film is a police procedural with some sci-fi dressing. But it quickly touches on a variety of issues in a surface way politics, class warfare, isolation, secretive government, gender relations, religion, spirituality, ethics. Most important is the moving relationship between Thorn (Heston) and Sol (Edward G. Robinson). It is a rock in the center of a society and planet that is crumbling. It is also the rock at the center of the film, bringing out career best performances from both actors. During the moving death scene where Sol checks into a sort of voluntary death program which involves a film of nature with music to pass to, all sci-fi evaporates, leaving the viewer only the subject of friendship. As the coda of the film happens, we are left to wonder if Thorn is more tortured by the horrible truth he's uncovered or the loss of his only friend in the world.

The film opens in 1914 in German East Africa, present day Tanzania, where an English missionary and his sister are taking a church service. They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

They are interrupted by the steam boat 'African Queen' and her captain Charlie Allnut. He informs them of the war that has broken out in Europe and as such they are stranded in an enemy country. It isn't long before the Germans turn up and burn down the village; they leave the missionaries but the affect leaves the preacher a broken man and he soon dies. When Allnut returns he takes the sister, Rosie Sayer, aboard his boat and sets off down river. He suggests they find an island and sit the war out but she has other ideas... she wants to continue down river, past a German fort, over deadly rapids and on to the lake. This lake is patrolled by the German ship the Queen Louisa which is the only thing keeping British forces from attacking the German colony. She intends to take their small boat and sink the Louisa! I really enjoyed this film; Bogart was great as the gin-swilling steamer captain and Katherine Hepburn was equally good as the prim sister of the preacher; the two of them had a great on screen chemistry. Director John Huston did a fine job creating an exciting story; I was surprised just how good some of the special effects looked; it really looked like their small boat was being tossed around in the rapids even though a model was used... it helped of course that much of the movie was filmed on location in Africa; the scenery looked real because it was! While at heart the film is a romantic story between the two very different characters I couldn't help thinking about the film 'Apocalypse Now' as the boat went further and further along the river getting into various scrapes and approaching the deadly conclusion to its mission... this film is of course much lighter in tone! That isn't to say there isn't tension and more than once it looks as if the two protagonists are going to die before completing their self-given mission. If you want a good adventure that is suitable for all ages you could do a lot worse than this... I highly recommend it.

This rich man's wife owes cash to a goon. She is subsequently kidnapped and the big Lebowski assigns The Dude the task of being the bag man in return for a load of money. The mission is screwed up, however, when The Dude's friend Walter joins in and messes things up. This leaves The Dude in a shaky position where he has to attempt to reclaim the money.This is a defiantly pointless film. It's a crime-comedy with very little emphasis on realism. It's played for laughs pure and simple. It benefits from an impressive cast. Jeff Bridges is good in the lead role, with some funny support performances from John Turturro as a sleazy bowler and Philip Seymour-Hoffman as the big Lebowski's personal assistant. Although I found John Goodman a little overbearing and annoying to tell you the truth. It's a highly stylised film, which you would probably expect coming from the Coen brothers. It isn't always as funny as it thinks it is though, although there are admittedly a number of very funny moments. It was nice to hear some good sounds in this one though. In particular a couple of ultra-cool laid back tunes from early 70's Italian movies, namely Piacere Sequence by Teo Usuelli (taken from the giallo 'Amuck') and Traffic Boom by Piero Piccioni (taken from the comedy 'All Screwed Up') - the latter of which was the soundtrack to the film within a film here.Its story-line is very unfocused, maybe that's the point I suppose but it certainly means that in order to enjoy the film you need to be able to overlook this. It's surely no coincidence that lots of people say they weren't too keen on this film the first time they saw it and it took subsequent viewings to appreciate. I myself am pretty much the same and this no doubt explains its lukewarm performance at the box office and then it's slow-burning success on home video. Having said all this, despite being an entertaining film, I still find it kind of hard to understand the real appeal of this movie.

Somehow, with a minimal budget of $300,000, Coscarelli managed to make the wildly imaginative film stand out from other films at the time while at the same time holding up over the years. The film is a true testament to the power of independent horror films and what happens when a creative mind is allowed to run free. Studio executives who don't know how to bank on anything other than remakes and sequels should really watch the film and take notes.Mike and his older brother Jody are left to fend for themselves in the wake of their parents' passing, which puts a particular strain on Mike who has a nagging fear of separation. His instincts are correct, as Jody plans on sending him away to live with his aunt so he can perhaps have more time to play guitar on his porch with the local ice cream man, Reggie. Such fears are cast aside quickly, however, when it is discovered that the mysterious Tall Man at the local cemetery is repurposing dead bodies as dwarf slaves in an effort to take over the world. Huh? You may say. Huh? is right.While it certainly isn't a film for everyone, Phantasm gets by with enough bizarre visuals, jarring violence and broad concepts to reel in even the most cynical of horror fans. It also helps that the film is packed with lovable characters brought to life by charming actors. Michael Baldwin (of no relation to 30 Rock's Alec Baldwin) plays the young Mike Pearson, while Reggie Bannister (who could pass as a doppelganger for 30 Rock's Scott Adsit) plays Reggie the ice cream man. Likewise, Bill Thornbury (Sorry, 30 Rock reference not found, please try again later) brings big brother Jody to life with a likable quality that almost makes you forget you're watching characters in a movie. Then of course there's the great Angus Scrimm as the Tall Man. This single bit of casting almost serves as the linchpin of the whole film. Scrimm's stage presence combined with his uber-creepy vibe is a big part of what makes Phantasm work.Like something straight out of a dream journal, Phantasm is completely out of this world and off-the-wall. Despite its lofty ambitions, the film works. Not only is it as creepy as anything you'll see, it's also gruesome and genuinely tense. This is of course balanced well with its characters who you will certainly want to follow in the adventures of the next three films (here's hoping for a Phantasm V while everyone's still young). It's a film that works on multiple levels and as time goes on, it seems to be holding up even better than before. Phantasm isn't a nightmare so much as it is a dream come true.

Scrimm's stage presence combined with his uber-creepy vibe is a big part of what makes Phantasm work.Like something straight out of a dream journal, Phantasm is completely out of this world and off-the-wall. Despite its lofty ambitions, the film works. Not only is it as creepy as anything you'll see, it's also gruesome and genuinely tense. This is of course balanced well with its characters who you will certainly want to follow in the adventures of the next three films (here's hoping for a Phantasm V while everyone's still young). It's a film that works on multiple levels and as time goes on, it seems to be holding up even better than before. Phantasm isn't a nightmare so much as it is a dream come true. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"23 April 2012","score":"","review":" When writer\/director\/producer\/editor Don Coscarelli made a little film by the name of Phantasm in the late '70s, little did he realize that he was creating a cult-classic, let alone one that would spawn a series which would endure for multiple decades. Somehow, with a minimal budget of $300,000, Coscarelli managed to make the wildly imaginative film stand out from other films at the time while at the same time holding up over the years. The film is a true testament to the power of independent horror films and what happens when a creative mind is allowed to run free. Studio executives who don't know how to bank on anything other than remakes and sequels should really watch the film and take notes.Mike and his older brother Jody are left to fend for themselves in the wake of their parents' passing, which puts a particular strain on Mike who has a nagging fear of separation. His instincts are correct, as Jody plans on sending him away to live with his aunt so he can perhaps have more time to play guitar on his porch with the local ice cream man, Reggie. Such fears are cast aside quickly, however, when it is discovered that the mysterious Tall Man at the local cemetery is repurposing dead bodies as dwarf slaves in an effort to take over the world. Huh? You may say. Huh? is right.While it certainly isn't a film for everyone, Phantasm gets by with enough bizarre visuals, jarring violence and broad concepts to reel in even the most cynical of horror fans. It also helps that the film is packed with lovable characters brought to life by charming actors. Michael Baldwin (of no relation to 30 Rock's Alec Baldwin) plays the young Mike Pearson, while Reggie Bannister (who could pass as a doppelganger for 30 Rock's Scott Adsit) plays Reggie the ice cream man.

I do not know how they managed all that filming, but the cat is simply too good. No CGI then, so it had to be a trained animal. Wow!!That said and done, let us come back to the stories. All three are vapid, with the first bordering on the absurd, the second, being full of pointless, gratuitous violence and the third, R L Stine-type yarn, being more suitable for a kiddie audience than for adults. King is a highly talented author of the horror genre, but even highly talented people can get jaded sometimes, or face writer's block. This film appears to have been written when King was suffering from a similar malady. After reading the credits that the screenplay was by King himself, I was looking forward to a stunner, or at least something creepy. Sadly, this movie joins the list of King's mediocre output, which he gave from time to time, in the eighties.See the movie for the cat, not for Stephen KIng.

Arriving nearly ten years after its predecessor and in a decidedly different climate, Phantasm II shifts gears from the creepy, dream-like original to a unique action\/horror hybrid and passes with flying colors. While the tone is noticeably different from the first, most of the elements that made the original so special are re-arranged to make something altogether different and ultimately, well, fun.Picking up where we left off in the original, Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Mike (re-cast from Michael Baldwin to James LeGros) effectively send the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) packing. Unfortunately, after spending a number of years in a mental hospital, Mike starts having visions of his foe as well as a mysterious young girl (Paula Irvine). Together with his surrogate big brother, he goes on a cross-country quest to track down the Tall Man and defeat him once and for all.Phantasm II is a rare case of a sequel breaking away from the format of the original and succeeding in its own right. The film makes nods to horror movies of its time -- there's a bit of Elm Street and Evil Dead sprinkled throughout -- and it's remarkable how well it comes together. Coscarelli does an excellent job of keeping the pace going while balancing ambitious ideas and bizarre special effects. It's not quite as challenging as its predecessor, but that's part of the film's charm. Bannister is as game as always as the lovable Reggie, while LeGros steps into Baldwin's shoes effortlessly. The two have excellent chemistry together and the journey they take is every bit as fun and the frenzied finale the film offers.From front to back, Phantasm II is good old spooky fun from the late '80s as only Coscarelli could deliver. And if that's not enough for you, there are still two more enjoyable sequels to plow through. Phantasm II is but a landmark in one of the most bizarre and unique horror series of its time.
