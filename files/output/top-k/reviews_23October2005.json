If todays youth today find these films funny. There is a real problem with this country. Of course I knew that when they elected an In-educated hick as President in 04 and a cartoon as Govenor of CA in 03. I thought this was awful. forgive me all you American girls who loves this crap. Movies are made to be something. This is nothing. Buy Dave Chapelle, thats comedy, Of course Richard Pryor is the greatest ever in stand up. You want to really crack up rent Robin Williams on Broadway. Or Even better some Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. A little real talent and comedy never hurt anyone.

This film has received an average vote of 7 out of 10!?!? I was in the cinema tonight, watching this movie at the Gay & Lesbian film festival with my boyfriend and two friends, and this was WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! Why? For the following reasons1. The STORY - or lack of same - is HORRIBLE. Not just bad, but horrible. Someone should have told the author that when you write a story you need to a) Have something on your mind that you want to tell the reader\/receiver; b) have a red line in the movie that connects the scenes, persons and events; and c) reach a conclusion in the end of the story. Unfortunately, story has neither. The events are totally rambled up, the focus seems to be moved at least a dozens of times during the (all to long) length of the movie, sudden events come without any purpose, explanation or, worst of all, point.2. The ACTING is INCREDIBLY LOUSY. Nothing really more to be said. Daniell Day Lewis looks nice, but the acting is just so incredibly amateur-like that I couldn't believe it.3. The DIALOGUE is Awful. There was one - ONE - line in the whole movie that actually worked (when the uncle says I'm a professional businessman, not a professional Pakisthani. The rest just screams 'I'm a 11 year old trying to write a screenplay'.4. The CUTTING is - I'm running out of bad words hear, so I'll just stick to horrible, cause that pretty much sums it up. When the cutting is done well you won't really notice it, but in this movie the cutting is done in all the wrong places - either too soon or too late.On the bottom line, you might think There might be some redeeming qualities, there must be something good to say about this movie. But there's not. Sorry. But I have nothing good to say. It just downright horrible.1 out of 10. That's a minimum. Avoid at all cost.
