","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"14 April 2010","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" GoldenEye is a franchise-killer. It's not even good enough to be as bad as a straight-to-video teen slasher such as, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer. To those just looking for some fun action and gore -- look somewhere else. Most of the kills in GoldenEye are ultra-fast or off-screen. A few tiny snips and the film could have been a PG-13. Even Paul Anderson's PG-13 Mortal Kombat abomination left the greatest martial arts characters in video game history with a little bit of dignity intact.Martin Campbell, with his inability to properly stage or direct an action or suspense scene, has made James Bond look like a B-grade INSPECTOR GADGET that should be hidden in a closet somewhere. The baddies aren't kept in the dark to create a mood -- they're kept there to hide their low-budget appearance and their director's inability to direct. Bond walks around like a WWE wrestler, grunting at everyone and using quips in an attempt to cover his tracks (but, at the same time, he skins other people alive and leaves them hanging from trees). Next time M Branch decide to send only 1 of their peeps to represent, they may want to reconsider sending the mentally handicapped guy in the bunch. Or was this the James Bond's version of the Special Olympics? As for the story? Who cares? Obviously not the filmmakers. There's no believable human character to follow, identify or empathize with. It's just some 25 year old actors playing teenagers with a few older characters thrown in to attract the adult demographic who watched Bond movies when they were still good. The best thing anyone could get out of GoldenEye is a refund. If you have any respect left these franchises or simply value your free time stay far, far away from this movie. Hopefully Martin Campbell will stay just as far away from a camera, before taking it upon himself to defecate all over another beloved film franchise.
