It is marginally successful, and in fact most of its flaws come from trying to simplify things too much.It gets off to a pretty good start, with the small planet Naboo being invaded by the Trade Federation battleships.

Some people have whined about the taxation of trade routes being a mundane sort of conflict, but they're forgetting history remember No taxation without representation? Real- world wars have been fought over less exciting issues. Phantom Menace quickly gets past the specifics and into the adventure anyway, so it hardly matters. There are many complications on the way to the climax, including an exciting futuristic chariot race straight out of Ben Hur, and some subtle political machinations in the galactic senate. The final battle is spectacular, on the ground and in space, wrapping up with a dramatic lightsaber duel.The movie struggles a little trying to find a protagonist. Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn is more of a mentor\/father figure, and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi is absent for the second act, so neither one quite measures up; similarly, young Anakin Skywalker is only introduced halfway through. Both Neeson and McGregor do good jobs, even if their characters are very simple, and their presence really carries the whole show. The other lead actors are weaker Natalie Portman is disappointingly bland as the queen of Naboo, and Jake Lloyd (Anakin) is a typical child actor. Most of the other characters are CGI. The real problem is that the story being told is not a personal one -- unlike the hero's quest of Luke Skywalker -- so each character ends up just serving the plot.Visually I think Phantom Menace is the best of the series. It uses digital effects, but it's not overwhelmed by CGI like the later movies. The sets and locations are real, and many of the spaceships are actual models. We get the best of both worlds the broad scope of CGI and the reality of practical effects. The design is a big reverse from the classic films, substituting the gritty, lived-in look for a more polished, Art Deco quality. This makes sense, since the prequels are meant to take place in the galaxy's Golden Age, before the dark times. The ships, costumes, and creatures are all consistent with the basic style of the earlier movies.I mentioned oversimplification before. More than any other Star Wars movie, this one seems to have been written for children, maybe because one of its main characters is only ten years old. This makes sense, although it's at odds with Episodes II and III, which were both darker. Ultimately the story doesn't really do much, and it ends up feeling like a frivolous adventure -- it's fun, but it could have been a lot more. The less said about Jar-Jar Binks the better.

It builds on the previous two movies, but it's bigger, brighter, and more colourful. There's the explosive final battle against the evil Empire as well as the resolution of the more personal conflict between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. However, it's not quite a tour-de-force there are some cumbersome info dumps, which slacken the film's pace, and the direction and photography are a little too simple. Worse is the treatment of the supporting characters, since just about everyone besides Luke and Vader get reduced to minor roles.The action scenes are definitely the movie's greatest strength. In the first act our heroes rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, with both a classic Ray Harryhausen monster fight and an all-out brawl on Jabba's sail barge. The speeder bike chase on Endor is a breathtaking highlight, filmed entirely with models and steady-cams; it's better than Episode I's pod race and just about outdoes the first movie's classic trench run. The Battle of Endor itself is an amazing accomplishment, and the space dogfights went unmatched for the next twenty years. Luke and Vader's lightsaber duel is more emotional than technical, but satisfying anyway.The exposition, though, is really a problem. There are two kinds of scenes in Jedi action set pieces and info dumps. Luke visits Dagobah again so that Yoda can confirm that Vader is, in fact, Luke's Father; Luke then gets the full story from Ben Kenobi's ghost. There's also a pause for Luke to reveal to Leia that they're brother and sister, which only functions to write off the romantic triangle of the previous film. Many of the scenes with the Emperor are talky and static. This all feels like the perfunctory tying-up of loose ends, which could have been handled in a more exciting and dynamic way.The script closely follows the story of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, to the exclusion of Han, Leia, Lando, and the others. George Lucas has said that the entire six-part series is really about the fall and redemption of Anakin Skywalker, and Return of the Jedi bears that out. Their conflict is the solid emotional centrepiece of the film, coming close to its mythic, Oedipal roots. The final triumph of both the Rebellion and the Light side of the Force is a very satisfying moment; it's good to see the good guys win big. If only the other characters had more to do.The Star Wars movies have always had great design, effects, and music, and Jedi is no different. The themes are strongest in this one the cold, mechanical quality of the Empire is emphasised by the skeletal image of the new Death Star, which matches Vader's scarred face and the Emperor himself. The music is suitably sinister. The Rebels, on the other hand, are colourfully democratic there are many different alien races and different types of starship in their fleet, and the costumes are mainly earthy greens, browns, and reds. The Ewok planet, filmed in the redwood forests of California, is also terrific. For me that's the best part of the movie, and the series as a whole. The ultimate victory over the totalitarian Empire is an act of ordinary people (and Ewoks), rather than superhuman heroes.

They have consistently made wonderful animated pictures that are very funny and heartwarming, and all have memorable and soon to be iconic scenes. They never pander to children, nor do they rely on cheap gags or melodrama. This film is the epitome of what PIXAR is about. Toy Story is one of the greatest animated films, that in recent years has only been topped by a few other PIXAR films.In the world this film sets up, toys are all alive, though they don't let that known to people. They play their roles are toys and when the people are not in sight, they talk about their job of being played with, and their personal lives. It's Andy's birthday, and all the toys in his room are worried about this fate with new toys coming in. Woody the cowboy doll is the leader of the group and is Andy's favorite toy, but Andy just received a new space toy, Buzz Lightyear, and now Woody is playing second fiddle and he doesn't like that. After mistakenly knocking Buzz out the window, the toys turn on Woody and he and Buzz end up on an adventure trying to find Andy and make it back to his house before he and his family move.The characters are always walking a fine line here, and never once do they fall off into one side. Woody could be very unlikable. He's always complaining, shouting all the time and he does some pretty mean things. Woody may be occasionally ill intentioned, but he is never malicious, and instead of being a complete jerk, he is often fighting between what is right and wrong and picks the former. The characters can be mean, but they're well intentioned in the end, and it's what shows in them. This film is of course a technical achievement, boasting that it's the first feature length fully computer animated movie. The animation looks great still today, but in a film world dominated by special effects and computer animation, it's very difficult to impress, but what still stands out about this film's look is it's visual style. From strange mid 50s interior designs to the atmospheric and beautiful golden hour look of certain scenes, this movie has such unique sets and shadows and just the atmosphere overall is very involving. The exciting chase and action sequences are also remembered and still today look dazzling. But what makes those scenes, namely the whole moving van sequence at the end, is the emotion. You feel for these characters, and the Falling with style callback that could feel contrived and corny, comes off as heartwarming. All the great scenes in the film have a level of humanity underneath all the negativity and cynicism of Woody that makes this animated toy feel very human.Randy Newman can be a little samey in some of his musical work, but his songs and score work very well here. The songs give us insight into what the character is feeling, and raise the emotion. His score plays off really well, and is catchy and bouncy without being cheesy. You'll find yourself singing these songs and humming the music after watching this.Toy Story is animated masterpiece. Unlike many of Disney animation's masterpieces, like the wonderful Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, this plays as a film instead of a great animated movie. It's a timeless film that will surely entertain many generations to come. It's a true classic!My rating **** out of ****. 81 mins. Rated G.

What reviewers need to remember is this Jurassic Park was in many ways a kid's film. The Lost World has sought to do something similar which explains why I loved it as a youngster.I think it deserves more than simply 6.0\/10 from IMDb, but I know why it has received this overall rating. Various people have written reviews of this film which are little more than rants and then they have given a 1\/10 rating, which is absurd. It's surprising that quite a lot of people have done this kind of thing and unfortunately it has taken the overall vote of the movie to just 6.0, when it deserves about a 7.The direction is the kind of thing you would expect from Spielberg. It is certainly not his greatest work, but it is worthy of his name. His direction outshines all the other contributors to this film, even the actors. It is certainly a film you come away from saying Yep! Only Spielberg could do that!The acting is good especially Goldblum and Postlethwaite. The young actress, Chester, is also impressive as is the earlier Vaughn. I am also glad that Attenborough plays his part again, as he was crucial and outstanding in the first movie.The story I think is actually quite good. I couldn't follow some of the earlier bits of the movie dialogue when I was younger but today I finally knew in total what was going on. Interesting...The special effects are becoming the slightest bit dated but they are still special.Finally, the music is very good.There are obviously criticisms of this movie.

And let's not forget that a lot of this movie was for the kids. Still, I'm glad the city scene is in the film. I also cannot work out how the T-Rex got out and killed the crew and then got itself back into the vault, whilst for the rest of the journey the ship managed to head straight on target for the harbour without losing it's way though everyone had been eaten ... But there were some big defects in the original movie too. I have thought about this and I don't think it's such a big deal in an action movie, because all we really want is action. Whether it makes sense is, to some degree, irrelevant. What is intolerable is bad acting in order to simply produce an action film but this film does not suffer from this problem.This is a far better movie than the majority of films which have been made. It is everything you want to see in the cinema it is good, fun entertainment!

It was a real favourite of mine when I was younger and having just watched it today, being a young adult, I still enjoyed it. What reviewers need to remember is this Jurassic Park was in many ways a kid's film. The Lost World has sought to do something similar which explains why I loved it as a youngster.I think it deserves more than simply 6.0\/10 from IMDb, but I know why it has received this overall rating. Various people have written reviews of this film which are little more than rants and then they have given a 1\/10 rating, which is absurd. It's surprising that quite a lot of people have done this kind of thing and unfortunately it has taken the overall vote of the movie to just 6.0, when it deserves about a 7.The direction is the kind of thing you would expect from Spielberg. It is certainly not his greatest work, but it is worthy of his name. His direction outshines all the other contributors to this film, even the actors. It is certainly a film you come away from saying Yep! Only Spielberg could do that!The acting is good especially Goldblum and Postlethwaite. The young actress, Chester, is also impressive as is the earlier Vaughn. I am also glad that Attenborough plays his part again, as he was crucial and outstanding in the first movie.The story I think is actually quite good. I couldn't follow some of the earlier bits of the movie dialogue when I was younger but today I finally knew in total what was going on. Interesting...The special effects are becoming the slightest bit dated but they are still special.Finally, the music is very good.There are obviously criticisms of this movie. I do think the film lost a considerable amount of it's seriousness when the T-Rex entered the city. But, nevertheless it is what we all wanted to see! And let's not forget that a lot of this movie was for the kids. Still, I'm glad the city scene is in the film. I also cannot work out how the T-Rex got out and killed the crew and then got itself back into the vault, whilst for the rest of the journey the ship managed to head straight on target for the harbour without losing it's way though everyone had been eaten ...

Basically set in the 1950's Hollywood, movie screenplay writer Joe C. Gillis (Oscar nominated William Holden) narrates the story going to flashback that leads up to the murder seen at the beginning. Joe is struggling to get his work sold to any studios and has debts, and one night he ends up with his car getting a flat tyre and at the mansion of a former silent movie star on Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Gloria Swanson) lives alone with butler and driver Max Von Mayerling (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Erich Von Stroheim), and has been doing so for many years since losing her popularity, becoming deluded and demented since, believing that one day she could return to the industry. Max being her ex-husband and former director who still has feelings for her is very protective of Norma, but she wants Joe to move in to the mansion to write a new screenplay for her to make her comeback, and in the process her becomes her lover and gigolo. Even though he is getting paid for doing this, he slowly starts feeling trapped, and seeking friendship he leaves one night to see Artie Green (Jack Webb), and he bumps into studio reader Betty Schaefer (Oscar nominated Nancy Olson). They quickly become attracted to each other, but Joe still returns Norma feeling some very warped sense of loyalty to the old actress, of course he still meets up with Betty to help her with her own script idea. By the time it seems the couple have fallen in love, Norma finds out and feels extremely jealous, she tries to sabotage whatever they have together. In the end Joe makes the hasty decision to threaten to leave the mansion, and that is when Norma really loses her mind and shoots him dead, so he has been narrating from beyond the grave, and with the press showing up about the murder her demented mind of fantasy thinks that she has made her longed after comeback. Also starring Fred Clark as Sheldrake, Lloyd Gough as Morino, The Ten Commandments director Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, Ray Evans, Jay Livingston and Sherlock Junior silent star Buster Keaton. Mostly all films about Hollywood before this were jolly and often musical, but this was the first to really show the cynicism and darker side, with fantastic acting, a witty script, and all the usual traits and tricks I have come to expect from a great film noir, a brilliant satirical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for Franz Waxman and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Motion Picture Score, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay. I am big! It's the pictures that got small was number 24, and All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.

The testimonies of personalities (including lead actor Rod Steiger) was very captivating and something urged me to watch it right away. Here's a psychological and moving drama about a Holocaust survivor whose life haven't changed for best, instead, he remembers the ghosts from the past in a chaotic and criminal New York that resonates part of his tragic life in a concentration camp during the war. In a magnificent and heart-breaking performance, Rod Steiger plays Sol Nazerman, a Jewish pawnbroker who lost his belief in mankind after losing his whole family in a concentration camp and seeing the horrors of war. The only thing he beliefs is in money because that's the only thing that lasts and the only thing that makes the world and people go round, he says that to the young and ambitious Jesus (Jaime Sanchez), who works for him in his pawnshop trading a little sum of money for people who wants to exchange old things for the money, and they'll always think that he can give more cash to them than the very few he gives to them.Sol is a solitary, bitter and rigid man who pushes people away from his life, he doesn't need people's sympathy, it doesn't help people feel sorry for him. Geraldine Fitzgerald plays a friendly woman interested in this man's life after trying to make him interested in helping a community center of the city. He's not interested in her or in anyone; he only lives for the money waiting for death to come and put him out of his misery, he can't kill himself, and he keeps tormented with his past that seems to be happening again in the crowded and violent streets of New York. Through amazing and brief flashbacks we follow Sol and his horrific experiences during war, along with a similar situation during his recent life that evokes that, for instance, when he sees a black man getting attacked by a group of people, he stops, watches the scene and right away he remembers a man trying to escape through a fence in the camp, then being shot by a Nazi officer. And he keeps remembering, suffering, and not dying, always keeping his pain to himself.The movie doesn't keep always on Sol, it also follows Jesus, the happy man who works for Sol, learning valuable life lessons of how to take care of the shop, and the importance of money in everyone's lives. These two opposite forces have some clashes, little arguments but they seem to go well with each other without realizing what bothers one another. Oscar wants to be successful as Sol, but he's too confident and positive on the same things that are twisted and miserable to Sol, he's too innocent about the world's hardness, barely realizing that he'll be connected with a group of thieves that wants to steal Sol's money, and he might be the one who'll help them with the plan.Steiger makes of Sol a contradictory character in who we want to feel sorry for his loss and his tragic life but at the same time, he's not that likable, he's brute and introspective at times, mumbling a few words, and he can't make a person feel completely bad about himself, or herself, not caring about their problems at all. Yet, you feel that he has been through a lot of things, and it is too difficult not to relate with him. He makes us remember of ourselves, in times we are desperately just like him and we want to throw everything away, give up on things, and other times we might believe that death is the only answer. In the case of Sol, he should be more thankful for the life he has, and try to do and be more than just suffer; he has a family (in another state where he spends his vacations) that likes him, he has support from people and want to talk to him about anything. Will he be able to forget his past and live a better life? Maybe, maybe not but until then life repeat itself and Sol can only aspire to die or get killed.The Pawnbroker has not only great performances and a terrific screenplay but many great things too, like the dramatic music of Quincy Jones, using a little bit of jazz; and a meaningful art direction, not only during the war, but also (and especially) the pawnshop of Sol, with lots of grids, a resemblance with the concentration camps that it's almost impossible to see a thing. It's the new prison of Sol and he doesn't realize that, if earlier he lived to see only misery and death, now we can only see the money. The only thing that is equal between both is that he can only see people behind these grids and barbed wires, the dramatic and sad division of human being.It is a sad story that has one small happy moment right in the first scene after this, you must be very spirituous to watch this film. But I urge you to watch it, because it is one of the rare films on the subject made in the 1960's and to at least see how great Rod Steiger is, with his ability to play a psychological character that is not that easy to comprehend, a difficult role and Steiger's favorite of all of this roles (sadly he was robbed at the Oscars). It's a powerful, memorable and relevant work and one of the best directed by Sidney Lumet.

I suppose I will have to make an attempt to defend the goodness of Moonraker For one, the plot of this movie at the time was somewhat original and futuristic. Even now, it still stands out to a lesser degree. Second, the gadgets (one weapon in particular) made for a nice little battle at the end of the movie. Third, the Bond girl known as Dr. Goodhead is quite the attractive intellectual who can hold her own despite her cover. Fourth, the main villain while lacking personality is sinister and has some catchy dialog. Fifth, here it comes... the return of JAWS. Yes, the metal mouth giant played by the same actor comes back for his second and unfortunately final outing in the 007 film series. Though JAWS doesn't get quite as much screen time he got in Spy Who Loved Me, his performance suffers no less and still brings much entertainment to the action scenes that he is in. One more thing about JAWS and then I will move on... I really liked how his character turned out near the end of Moonraker. Without giving spoilers, this is one reason I wish JAWS was brought back a third time. The other reason of course being that his character is just so unique to begin with. Seriously, I don't think MGM noticed the potential franchise they could have had with this particular Bond character. To finally move on, the pacing might not have been quite up to par as it was with the Spy Who Loved Me and I think that is one problem critics had with Moonraker. As for me, the pacing didn't ruin a thing and I can't think of any major or central moment as to where the pacing lagged. Another reason critics bashed Moonraker is because of it's over the top futuristic plot theme. I beg to differ; this is part of what made Moonraker stand out from the typical and occasionally overused 007 formula. Trust me folks, Moonraker holds up there with its predecessor that critics so dearly praised though rightfully so and as I commented at the start; this may have been a peak in the 007 series especially considering a few of the future Bond films that came after it.

I must have been watching a different movie because I consider this to not only be one of the best 007 films but also the peak of Roger Moore's career as Bond. I suppose I will have to make an attempt to defend the goodness of Moonraker For one, the plot of this movie at the time was somewhat original and futuristic. Even now, it still stands out to a lesser degree. Second, the gadgets (one weapon in particular) made for a nice little battle at the end of the movie. Third, the Bond girl known as Dr. Goodhead is quite the attractive intellectual who can hold her own despite her cover. Fourth, the main villain while lacking personality is sinister and has some catchy dialog. Fifth, here it comes... the return of JAWS. Yes, the metal mouth giant played by the same actor comes back for his second and unfortunately final outing in the 007 film series. Though JAWS doesn't get quite as much screen time he got in Spy Who Loved Me, his performance suffers no less and still brings much entertainment to the action scenes that he is in. One more thing about JAWS and then I will move on... I really liked how his character turned out near the end of Moonraker. Without giving spoilers, this is one reason I wish JAWS was brought back a third time. The other reason of course being that his character is just so unique to begin with. Seriously, I don't think MGM noticed the potential franchise they could have had with this particular Bond character. To finally move on, the pacing might not have been quite up to par as it was with the Spy Who Loved Me and I think that is one problem critics had with Moonraker. As for me, the pacing didn't ruin a thing and I can't think of any major or central moment as to where the pacing lagged. Another reason critics bashed Moonraker is because of it's over the top futuristic plot theme. I beg to differ; this is part of what made Moonraker stand out from the typical and occasionally overused 007 formula. Trust me folks, Moonraker holds up there with its predecessor that critics so dearly praised though rightfully so and as I commented at the start; this may have been a peak in the 007 series especially considering a few of the future Bond films that came after it.

The Kristofferson character has supervised the building of several quite ingenious movable barricades. The idea is they can hide behind these, using them to roll up and attack the pinned-down hit-men who are out to murder them. The basic concept is 'stay behind these and you won't get shot', yet repeatedly during their approach Kristofferson has to pull immigrants back behind the protection of the barricade because in their hysteria they keep running out into the open to throw their dynamite at the bad guys -- and risk being shot. You can almost sense the Kristofferson character shaking his head in disbelief at their stupidity, wondering why he's risking his life to even bother to help. The viewer also can't help but feel the same way during this entire movie.For a movie such as this -- a 'little guy standing up to a bully' theme -- the basic essential is you're supposed to CARE about the little guy. In Heaven's Gate, you don't, not even close. In fact, the poor peasant immigrants here are so shallow, so non-dimensional, so loud, so hysterical, so non-thinking that you actually almost find yourself rooting against them. They're just a screeching horde, individuals of which come and go throughout the film and you have no idea who they are, why they're there, and what their dreams are, and as a result you don't care about any of them. However, the movie as a whole is not horrible -- there are certain scenes that are actually very well done. But as a whole it's unreasonably long and worse, uninteresting. The codas at the beginning and ending of the film of the Harvard graduation and Kristofferson aboard his yacht as an old man are completely pointless -- take them out and nobody would miss them. Most scenes go on and on for entirely too long, for no apparent reason other than the director seems to love everything he does. Like most famous movie directors who achieve fame and praise early on, each of their successive movies seem to get longer and longer and longer, yet not necessarily better, because they fall in love with their own greatness -- and because the studios cater to them and let them. Such is the case here. I do however appreciate Cimino's attempts to accurately recreate the old west -- mud, filth, dust and smoke included. However the way it's done is went completely overboard. So much of the movie is shrouded in murk you literally can't see or hear anything. James Cameron's Titanic is the polar opposite of Heaven's Gate. Both movies are very long, tragic tales, and both went terribly over-budget -- each threatened to bankrupt the studio -- yet Cimino's film emerged as a pretentious failure while Cameron's film earned a billion at the box office and is a true masterpiece. Even hardened, cynical types get teary-eyed by the end of Titanic, even if they won't admit it, and are awed by the photogenic beauty of the film. The difference between to two films is Cameron populated his story with people you actually cared and rooted for -- you wanted the poor immigrants in steerage to overcome their plight, to survive along with (maybe instead of) most of the rich worthless snobs in First Class. Cameron's poor may have been caricatures too but they were not obnoxious -- he filled them with nobility and made sure they took it upon themselves to fight for their lives without the need for outside guidance. The main characters and immigrants in Heaven's Gate are simply annoying, the story incomprehensible, and the muted dusty cinematography is shameful.Kristofferson is rather bland as the Harvard educated sheriff. Hupert is hard to understand, but really does look like a prettier version Anna Pacquin as some here have mentioned. John Hurt's character is a mess -- however the scene atop his horse where he disappears in a cloud of smoke is amazing. Sam Waterston is deliciously evil as the leader of the 'posse'. Chris Walken is also very good as a bad guy -- you never know what he's going to do or what he's capable of. However, when he takes the time to write a good-bye note while trapped inside a burning cabin it's the highpoint of ridiculousness -- and that scene pretty much sums up the movie.

Even hardened, cynical types get teary-eyed by the end of Titanic, even if they won't admit it, and are awed by the photogenic beauty of the film. The difference between to two films is Cameron populated his story with people you actually cared and rooted for -- you wanted the poor immigrants in steerage to overcome their plight, to survive along with (maybe instead of) most of the rich worthless snobs in First Class. Cameron's poor may have been caricatures too but they were not obnoxious -- he filled them with nobility and made sure they took it upon themselves to fight for their lives without the need for outside guidance. The main characters and immigrants in Heaven's Gate are simply annoying, the story incomprehensible, and the muted dusty cinematography is shameful.Kristofferson is rather bland as the Harvard educated sheriff. Hupert is hard to understand, but really does look like a prettier version Anna Pacquin as some here have mentioned. John Hurt's character is a mess -- however the scene atop his horse where he disappears in a cloud of smoke is amazing. Sam Waterston is deliciously evil as the leader of the 'posse'. Chris Walken is also very good as a bad guy -- you never know what he's going to do or what he's capable of. However, when he takes the time to write a good-bye note while trapped inside a burning cabin it's the highpoint of ridiculousness -- and that scene pretty much sums up the movie. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"11 March 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The eternally-suffering immigrants in this movie -- having arrived into wide-open 1890 Wyoming from all sorts of corrupt, filthy, illiterate, third-world countries -- are no doubt a product of their home environment. They can't seem to be quiet long enough to reason out how to solve their predicament. Without the help of the rich, smart white guy they would be killed by the rich, evil white guys.Spoilers....A fine example of this is during the final battle at the end of the movie. The Kristofferson character has supervised the building of several quite ingenious movable barricades. The idea is they can hide behind these, using them to roll up and attack the pinned-down hit-men who are out to murder them. The basic concept is 'stay behind these and you won't get shot', yet repeatedly during their approach Kristofferson has to pull immigrants back behind the protection of the barricade because in their hysteria they keep running out into the open to throw their dynamite at the bad guys -- and risk being shot. You can almost sense the Kristofferson character shaking his head in disbelief at their stupidity, wondering why he's risking his life to even bother to help. The viewer also can't help but feel the same way during this entire movie.For a movie such as this -- a 'little guy standing up to a bully' theme -- the basic essential is you're supposed to CARE about the little guy. In Heaven's Gate, you don't, not even close. In fact, the poor peasant immigrants here are so shallow, so non-dimensional, so loud, so hysterical, so non-thinking that you actually almost find yourself rooting against them. They're just a screeching horde, individuals of which come and go throughout the film and you have no idea who they are, why they're there, and what their dreams are, and as a result you don't care about any of them. However, the movie as a whole is not horrible -- there are certain scenes that are actually very well done. But as a whole it's unreasonably long and worse, uninteresting. The codas at the beginning and ending of the film of the Harvard graduation and Kristofferson aboard his yacht as an old man are completely pointless -- take them out and nobody would miss them. Most scenes go on and on for entirely too long, for no apparent reason other than the director seems to love everything he does. Like most famous movie directors who achieve fame and praise early on, each of their successive movies seem to get longer and longer and longer, yet not necessarily better, because they fall in love with their own greatness -- and because the studios cater to them and let them. Such is the case here. I do however appreciate Cimino's attempts to accurately recreate the old west -- mud, filth, dust and smoke included. However the way it's done is went completely overboard. So much of the movie is shrouded in murk you literally can't see or hear anything. James Cameron's Titanic is the polar opposite of Heaven's Gate.

One thing I noticed with those fun-sponges who hated this movie, is that they are all (I mean it, all of them) comparing it to the book.Forget about the book. I actually thought this movie was better, I who have read the book approximately 50 times, so this is a high compliment. Perhaps Alfonso Cuaron should have written the book, rather than Frances Hodgson Burnett.I can't remember when I first saw this film, but I suspect I was about 2 or 3 years old. As a child, I adored it. As an adult, I appreciate it even more. What you all need to remember is that there is a demographic for this kind of film. I suggest girls about 7 to 12 years old, but adults can also appreciate it, if this is their sort of thing. Also, you have to be prepared to cry.I can understand why someone wouldn't like the movie, but I what I can't understand is why they would give it a bad review. For example, I didn't like 'Black Swan', but I acknowledged it was a good movie. Alright, now my ranting is out of the way.It is beautifully filmed. Cuaron uses colour to show the juxtaposition of Sara's India with dreary and depressing New York perfectly, and the music is wonderful. Anyone who accuses Liesel Matthews of being a bad actress needs to watch the scene in the attic, just after she realises her father has died. She draws a circle around herself with chalk, mirroring the scene at the beginning where Prince Rama draws a circle around his wife to protect her. I never cry so much than when I watch this scene.Although the themes of the movie differ from the book, as I said earlier, I think these themes are better. For one, the theme of the book is that a girl is a Princess when they behave, when they are good and virtuous as Sara is. I find that a bit lectury. It's like the Santa Claus myth, trying to bribe\/blackmail children into being good, but the theme of the movie, which is that all girls, even horrible ones, are Princesses is lovely. It is forgiveness before the wrong has been committed.I watch 'A Little Princess' every time I'm sick. You'd be surprised how effective it is. I suppose I cry the sickness out of me. Also, if you find the ending not too corny for your tastes, remember that this is a movie for children. Children want happy endings.

But they managed to return back to Earth out of sheer determination, bravery, and luck, with coordinated help from a much focused ground team. Capturing the attention of the world at that time, the survival of these astronauts was one of the great moments of the 20th century.This is unmistakably a film about the triumph of the human spirit, of Man's innate determination to survive no matter how bleak the circumstances are. Directed by Ron Howard, Apollo 13 stands tall among other exemplary examples of inspirational cinema, and despite many of the sequences being rendered with CG visual effects, it remains to be an affecting human story of substantial worth. Deservedly nominated for nine Oscars including Best Picture, Apollo 13 also features a splendid score by James Horner, who also scored for Braveheart (1995) in the same year.Ron Howard is a fine director, albeit without a unique style to call his own. Although he is quite inconsistent with his output, Apollo 13 ranks as one of his top films alongside considerable efforts such as A Beautiful Mind (2001), and Frost\/Nixon (2008). His lucid switching among sequences in space with Jim Lovell (Hanks) and his men, sequences in the chaotic ground control station with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris), and sequences shot from the perspective of the astronauts' worried loved ones gives the film a kind of understated wave of human drama that rises and falls complementarily.The most exhilarating sequence from Apollo 13 is without doubt the launch of the rocket. The visual effects are respectable for a mid- nineties film though it seems more dated with each viewing. It is the sound mixing, however, that truly transforms the film into an extraordinary experience, as if the viewer is brought to the site of the launch. Despite viewers knowing how the story ends, Howard manages to create one of the most nail-biting climaxes in American nineties cinema &#x96; the anticipation of the astronauts' pod emerging in the sky after more than three minutes of transmission silence as it cuts and burns through the Earth's atmosphere.The joy and sheer relief of everyone matched by the soaring main theme of Horner's score after the emergence of the pod will make even the most emotionally-hardened viewer pump his or her fist into the air.

Now before I get on with those reasons, let me state as I did in a previous James Bond review that Roger Moore is the least of my preferred portrayals of the character. Still, this particular film is not only one of Moore's best outings as the 00 Agent it is also one of the best Bond films period. Moving on to why I like Spy Who Loved Me so much For one, the pacing of the film is near perfect. I wasn't bored for a minute. Secondly, The Russian Agent known as 'Tripple X' (ha ha) is Bond's equal in just about every way. Third, one of my few all time favorite Bond villains makes his first appearance in the series... JAWS. This guy is so unique that the movie is almost worth seeing just for him (and for Tripple X too). Fourth, Moore's character of Bond is more humanist and less egotistical.

Moving on to the plot of the film... To be honest, it is nothing unique. In fact, the only minor complaint I have is that the lesser Bond villain is very bland and fortunately doesn't get much screen time unlike the bland villain of Thunderball who got way too much screen time. OK, back to Spy Who Loved Me... JAWS gets a good portion of screen time as he should and interestingly enough JAWS doesn't speak a word throughout his entire presence.

Still, this particular film is not only one of Moore's best outings as the 00 Agent it is also one of the best Bond films period. Moving on to why I like Spy Who Loved Me so much For one, the pacing of the film is near perfect. I wasn't bored for a minute. Secondly, The Russian Agent known as 'Tripple X' (ha ha) is Bond's equal in just about every way. Third, one of my few all time favorite Bond villains makes his first appearance in the series... JAWS. This guy is so unique that the movie is almost worth seeing just for him (and for Tripple X too). Fourth, Moore's character of Bond is more humanist and less egotistical.

Fist of all, there's no plot. At all. As a result, we never what exactly is going on or why. It had something to do with a poet named Ahmed ibn Fadlan, who is banished from his home for looking at the king's wife the wrong way. He then gets recruited by a bunch of viking dudes, who are assigned to find out what(or who) is plundering a certain kingdom. Then the warriors fight the monsters, then rest. Then they fight the monsters again, then rest. Then they fight the monsters again, then rest. Then they fight the monsters one last time, the end. The warriors, aside from having no personalities, have no names. We never learn anything about them. The same goes for Ahmed, other than he is afraid of heights. We are not properly introduced to him or the other characters, as a result it's impossible to care about them. I can't comment on the acting because I couldn't find any. As I said, no one has any personality whatsoever. We don't even learn their names for crying out loud! This might have been forgivable if the much hyped action scenes were any good. Sadly, the action is filmed through a filthy lens and shaky camera work, so you can't tell what is going on at least half the time. More confusing than exciting if you ask me. Bad action, bad dialogue, bad acting, non-existent plot, sloppy writing, lots of pointless scenes, this movie flat-out sucks. Not one of the worst I've seen, but still quite awful.

What do you know? Some urban legends are actually true! Based on a novel by John O'Brien, it's a love story, but a love story with a twist. More of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please run down to the store and get another bottle of vodka while I write the next paragraph).Having lost his job and his wife through drinking, alcoholic Ben Sanderson sells everything he owns and decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. He finds a cheap motel and goes for a drive. He almost hits a young woman, a prostitute called Sera. The next day he propositions her and they end up spending the night together, just talking. Her pimp, Yuri, is not pleased that she has not come back with very much money and sends her out the following night. She looks for, and eventually finds, Ben and invites him over to her place. This is just the beginning of a relationship that will take Sera on quite a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I won't say any more for fear of bringing the wrath of the spoiler police.I first have to say what a truly excellent script this is, some really great dialogue and a really well made film. The soundtrack is very good too, featuring plenty of songs performed by Sting in a cocktail lounge style. There's even a song co-written and performed by Nicolas Cage! Talking of which, he put in a truly stunning performance that fully deserved the Best Actor Oscar that year. I also thought Elisabeth Shue was exceptional as well, she fully deserved all the nominations and awards she won for this part. I will also give an honourable mention to Julian Sands as Yuri, whose performance was good, but maybe overshadowed by the other two.So, if we add together the soundtrack, the script and the performances, we've got a really great film. Well, it is great, but there are periods where we lose sight of Ben and concentrate on Sera which I found a little distracting. I'd have liked to have seen a few little cut scenes of Ben interspersed so we didn't lose track of him while telling Sera's story. Having said that, it's still a really great film and one I would happily watch again&#x85; Highly recommended.My score 8.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 March 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I heard that this is the film that Nicolas Cage actually does some proper acting, thinking it was just another urban legend I sceptically turned on and watched.

Westworld is an early attempt at this genre of science fiction, being released in 1973. The subject matter is tackled in a creative way. This film takes place at America's newest and most popular amusement park. Guests are able to choose from a variety of three realistically simulated situations all referred to as worlds; Romanworld, Medievalworld, and of course Westworld. Romanworld is barely in the film at all only showing very brief glimpses. There is actually a decent amount of Medievalworld shown throughout the film. Unfortunately, there was never a big joust sequence even though it was hinted at. Main focus, as if you didn't know from the title, is Westworld. The movie starts off at a slow pace introducing the concept, and effectively giving us a cinematic representation of what it would be like for a first timer at the park. Once the newcomer gets comfortable in his setting with the help of his friend who has lived the experience all ready, the movie picks up the pace and remains rather action oriented throughout the duration. All of the typical things you would expect tourists to do in an old west setting where there are no consequences, start occurring including; shootouts, bar fights, jailbreaks, friendly saloon visits, etc&#x85; A little over halfway through a serious problem happens, the scientists are no longer in control of their robots. I will not get into details, as I would hate to ruin the film. The acting all around is decent, but in particular Yul Brynner, as the gunslinger robot, shines in what might be the best portrayal of a robot I have ever seen in film.
