[{"date":"8 September 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" If you are traveling abroad in an Alfred Hitchcock film, chances are things are going to go wrong. Such is the case in The Man Who Knew Too Much, a very early Hitchcock film that he actually remade twenty years later. The film stars Leslie Banks and Edna Best as a couple on holiday in Switzerland along with their young daughter. Everything is going fine until a friend of theirs is murdered, and in his dying breath he tells them a crucial piece of information about an imminent assassination attempt. The couple has to keep this information safe and sound, but when they deny having any information their daughter is kidnapped and they must try to do all they can to get their daughter back and stop this assassination from succeeding.The Man Who Knew Too Much has pretty much all the makings of a good film. It has a well thought out and well executed story, well rounded and multi dimensional characters, and with Alfred Hitchcock in the directors chair he obviously does some interesting things with the camera throughout the film. We see a variety of unique shots that would later translate into Hitchcock's overall style of filmmaking. The acting is pretty sub par aside from the great Peter Lorre, but it's not too dreadful.The thing is, I just wasn't crazy about this film and it really didn't do much for me. The story, while neat and intelligent, is a little disjointed at times and I found myself getting lost pretty easily. The film really tries to be suspenseful, but it isn't at all. This is definitely due to the time period and how much different films were made back then, but I honestly didn't feel anything during The Man Who Knew Too Much.Hitchcock shows that he will one day grow into a legendary director through some of the unique camera angles and movements he employs in this film, but overall I found the film to be a little lackluster. I shrugged when it was over, and I could not see myself watching this again. It's not an inherently bad film, it's just not much of anything.

They're pretty standard - I mean, how much can you do with them that's unique original? The Legend Of Hell House doesn't really rise above that in most ways. It IS, after all, a haunted house movie. Most of what happens in it isn't especially fresh or original or surprising. At least the movie is honest in acknowledging that it's not based on a true story, although it tries to establish some credibility right off the top with a caption saying that the things in this movie could happen, with the words attributed to a clairvoyant and psychic adviser to European royalty. Right. That seals the deal for me!Having said all that, I do want to say that this is one of the more effective haunted house movies I've seen. Director John Hough made absolutely superb use of the setting of the house. After a brief introduction to the story, the whole thing is set inside the house and that works very well. Interestingly, I found the movie far more effective when there was nothing happening. Once tables start shaking and objects start flying and doors start opening and closing you're just into the typical genre. It doesn't really hit home. But when nothing unusual was happening, you're dealing with the setting and with the cast - and that was the other strong point of this movie.The cast was superb and the characters are interesting. There's a physicist who dabbles in parapsychology (Clive Revill) and his wife (Gayle Hunnicutt), and a couple of mediums - Florence (Pamela Franklin) and Benjamin (Roddy McDowall), who is supposedly the only one who escaped the house alive and sane after a previous attempt to figure out what was going on many years before. They all did very well in these parts. They kept my attention, and when the focus was on them and not on the unusual goings on, this was an even more effective movie. They don't get along well, they don't trust each other. They're interesting, and their relationship was interesting.The weakest part of the movie was the purpose of investigating the house. I never really understood it. A wealthy man has hired all of them to spend a week (only and specifically a week) to supposedly prove that there's life after death. How are they going to do that? How are they going to come up with objective, indisputable proof? I didn't really get that. And even if they figure out a way to do that and get close to doing it, why, then, only a week? So this man, who wants proof of life after death, is going to pull the plug after seven days, even if another 24 hours would make the difference? That seemed silly and self-defeating on his part.That is a weakness, and it is, in many ways, pretty clich√© and standard for the genre. But the directing and acting make up for those weaknesses.

When he gets out he learns that his now ex-wife has married another guy (John Travolta) but Eddie still plans on getting her back. I watched this film the first day it was released into theaters and I thought it was one of the best films of the year. Today I still considering it one of the most neglected and overlooked gems of the decade and I know I'm in the minority but I see it as a real masterpiece. I think a lot of people are turned off because of the subject matter and because the three lead characters are all so ugly and do some pretty vile things that they have a hard time connecting or feeling anything for them. For me, I think the film perfectly captures that love that these types of people can still feel. I think most people want to see love stories about beautiful people who do beautiful things. They don't want to see love between a bunch of losers like Eddie and Maurine. Nick Cassavetes directs his father's screenplay and I think he perfectly nails the situations, the atmosphere and the all around lifestyle of these two deadbeats. The first half of the film takes place when the two are together, living in filth and the entire situation is certainly one that you'd call unhealthy. The rawness is these scenes is just so real that Cassavetes deserves credit for keeping everything together. The second half of the film gets even stranger when Eddie goes to get his woman and the impact this has on her other family is something that I'm sure will outrage many. Penn gives a terrific performance and it's a real shame this here didn't get him any Oscar consideration. The way he plays Eddie early on is something he could do in his sleep but the real amazing part comes during the mental breakdown sequence and how different the character is in the second half. Penn is basically playing three different people here and he does a marvelous job on each. Wright is also terrific in her part of the conflicted wife and Travolta gives one of his best and funniest performances here. Harry Dean Stanton is terrific in his small bit as is James Gandolfini as a scumbag neighbor. Again, most people are going to be turned off by the material and some of the harsh things that happen but to me SHE'S SO LOVELY features Penn at his greatest and its low story is just so raw and powerful that I can't help but love it.

The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of he who walks behind the rows giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning, but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film.Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother, she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit, and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways, June's visions of sick children comes true. All of the kids in Grand Island start becoming ill with high fevers and pretty soon their teeth begin to fall out. And that's when some of the adults in town begin dying off in gruesome ways.The big plot reveal (told to viewers near the end of the film) is that Josiah was taken in by some travelling preachers as a child and eventually became a very gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The travelling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well. Grace also finds out that Josiah can control all of the children in the town by finding a child like himself (a lie child). That child is Grace's sister Margaret. The lie surrounding Margaret is that she is actually Grace's daughter whom Grace abandoned years ago. It's up to Grace to destroy Josiah and save the children. Children of the Corn IV is a step up from part III. The films itself looked a lot cleaner and sophisticated then it's predecessor and I liked the franchise returning to the rural setting. There were some gory moments and genuinely scary scenes which was missing from the third film. I recommend it. Acting was great (Naomi Watts), had a good story...definitely one of the better sequels in the franchise.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 September 2012","score":"","review":" Children of the Corn 4 is much more thought out than the rest of the sequels.

The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of he who walks behind the rows giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning, but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film.Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother, she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit, and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways, June's visions of sick children comes true.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find a snappy, frank, and surprisingly fresh comedy filled with delightful performances and dialogue, colorful costumes and set designs, and a clich√©d but solid message about life. Rosalind Russell plays Mame Dennis, who takes in her nephew Patrick (Jan Handzlik) after her brother unexpectedly dies. What ensues is a very fun romp about the adventures and trials of Mame and Patrick over 9 years as he grows up and they weather the Great Depression. The film is populated by a wide assortment of colorful, entertaining characters and comedic situations. And, for a 54-year-old movie, I actually found it to be hilarious. I laughed out loud several times throughout, for example when Mame at one point tries to mount a horse, and the dialogue is genuinely funny without straining too hard, with jokes rarely falling flat. The film's comedic success is amplified by its enormous heart, which takes center stage during several dramatic, emotional moments. The film wears its heart on its sleeve but never lapses into overdone sentimentality. As the movie's famous line goes, Life's a banquet, and some poor suckers are starving to death. The film's message to live your own way and to the fullest no matter what really resonates, even if it is a bit unoriginal. The film takes thinly veiled shots at the norms, prejudices, and judgments of mid-20th century American society. It has a blast shooting down anti-Semitism, socioeconomic elitism, social judgment (involving such topics as unmarried pregnancy), to name a few, and it's 143-minute runtime flies by. The film itself, especially the cast, seems to be having a great time as it progresses, and I couldn't help but to be sucked right in. The performances are very good across the board. Rosalind Russell is just perfect as Mame, capturing her larger-than-life personality and big heart. She's an ace at spouting out the character's lightning-fast lines with impeccable comic timing. Coral Browne also gives a great comic performance as Vera, although she doesn't have as much depth as Russell. The rest of the supporting cast are all very good as well. Jan Handzlik is endearing and funny as a young Patrick, and Peggy Cass is outstanding in a paper-thin role (she did a good job, but her Oscar nomination is perplexing). I also thought Joanna Barnes was a riot as Gloria, and Lee Patrick and Willard Waterman are excellent as her parents. Overall, Auntie Mame is a hugely entertaining, even uplifting movie filled with wacky characters, spot-on comedic performances, hilarious writing, and a big heart. It's not the deepest movie you'll ever see, or the least conventional, but it's an absolute delight. Highly recommended.

Noted feminist writer Rita Mae Brown wrote the screenplay, and Amy Jones, a graduate of the Roger Corman filmmaking school, is the director. Its element of satire may not be readily apparent, but it *is* there. When the movie comes to its now iconic shot of the killer standing astride a cowering victim, with his deadly weapon dangling suggestively between his legs, it does become more apparent that this movie does work as a comment on other slasher films of the era how they centre on depraved male killers and how their weapon can be viewed as a surrogate penis. Note, too, how most of the male characters are not terribly useful, even if they're not utterly demented the women will have to learn to fight for their lives if they're going to survive this night.Of course, this delightfully trashy flick does manage to have it both ways, as it's heavily exploitative as well, taking the time (and we do appreciate the movie for this) to stress the ladies' assets in a nice shower scene. Gore effects are also impressively done, and some great and memorable gags are created, like the one with the pizza delivery guy. Clocking in at a very reasonable 77 minutes, The Slumber Party Massacre is the kind of flick that gets down to business pretty quickly, and in which the prospective viewer won't have to deal with too much in the way of filler. The acting is just what one should expect adequate at best, although it must be said what a beauty co-star Robin Stille is, as the appealing next-door neighbour Valerie. The film also began a very respectable B movie career for co-star Brinke Stevens, who plays an early victim. Hell, there's a lot of eye candy here, as even an unfortunate telephone repair woman is played by a lovely blonde named Jean Vargas. The music, which is by the brother of director Jones, is some delicious organ based stuff, strongly reminiscent of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, and is cheesy and creepy in equal measure.All in all, this is fun stuff if one enjoys the sleazier side of slashers, and it works whether you care about the movies' message or not.Eight out of 10.

Before they actually legally divorce, both scientists decide to take trips, separately that is. Emilt head off to Africa to study animals and Jessup heads to Mexico to explore and collect a drug used by some natives in spiritual rituals. When he comes back from Mexico, Jessup brings samples of this untested drug and decides to use it in the confines of a new isolation tank. He believes this drug taps into the most primal essence of the human being. It isn't long before stuff starts happening (like Jessup actually altering himself and turning into a primate!). Despite warnings from his colleagues to stop experimenting with this drug, Jessup soldiers on in his quest for that ultimate truth. Despite being close to divorce, it is only Emily who becomes convinced that Jessup is actually onto something new and fascinating, but also extraordinarily dangerous and life threatening and begs him to stop the experiments. Her motivation is pure and simple love, her love for him is a true and Jessup's love for his ultimate truth quest. Yet, whenever she tells him that he loves him, he answers with something else. Without spoiling anything, it is Emily's love that plays a crucial role in the film's outlandish ending.

It never occurred to me at the time that I was watching, in essence, a love film disguised as an FX psycho drama. Dr. Jessup (William Hurt's big screen debut) is a scientist obsessed with finding the ultimate truth about life and what makes us human beings. He and his fellow scientist friend, Arthur (Bob Balaban) conduct experiments in an isolation tank, where Jessup floats in water with electrodes connected to his head. He wishes to explore his consciousness on anther level, so to speak. He meets and marries Emily, another fellow scientist who falls madly in love with him. Emily truly loves Jessup despite him not showing any signs of true affection or love towards her. 7 years pass by and Jessup and Emily now have 2 little girls and are on the brink of divorce, apparently on Jessup's insistence. Before they actually legally divorce, both scientists decide to take trips, separately that is. Emilt head off to Africa to study animals and Jessup heads to Mexico to explore and collect a drug used by some natives in spiritual rituals. When he comes back from Mexico, Jessup brings samples of this untested drug and decides to use it in the confines of a new isolation tank. He believes this drug taps into the most primal essence of the human being. It isn't long before stuff starts happening (like Jessup actually altering himself and turning into a primate!). Despite warnings from his colleagues to stop experimenting with this drug, Jessup soldiers on in his quest for that ultimate truth. Despite being close to divorce, it is only Emily who becomes convinced that Jessup is actually onto something new and fascinating, but also extraordinarily dangerous and life threatening and begs him to stop the experiments. Her motivation is pure and simple love, her love for him is a true and Jessup's love for his ultimate truth quest. Yet, whenever she tells him that he loves him, he answers with something else. Without spoiling anything, it is Emily's love that plays a crucial role in the film's outlandish ending. Watching the film last night for the first time on bluray I realized I was watching a twisted sci-fi love story. At the hands of late maestro Ken Russell it was hard to imagine Altered States as a regular Hollywood feature. As with other Russell films (The Devils, Crimes Of Passion), there's a heavy religious allegory during Jessup's trips with the drug, with some stunningly bizarre visuals rarely seen even in today's films. This is NOT a regular Hollywood film, despite being done there. Without Ken Russell's guidance this would have been a tepid horror fest.You'll do no wrong in Checking Altered States, a movie that (to me at least) has stood the test of time and looks very little dated. Altered States is a roller-coaster ride!

I have to say at the time I thought it was the coolest movie ever. Had lots of action, some good humour, gory deaths and SHARKS! I've always wanted a more modern shark movie ever since I saw the first Jaws. Now that I'm 26, I have to say; this movie ain't it.The original Jaws and to an extent, Jaws 2 have really been the only solid shark movies to ever come out. Deep Blue Sea tries to put a unique spin on the idea of sharks and the concept is interesting enough. We have an aquatic research station in the middle of the ocean where they are holding three genetically altered Mako sharks. This movie puts its characters into an interesting position; their aquatic base is critically damaged and sinking and so they need to get to the surface. This addresses the common issue with shark films; you want to live? stay out of the water. These people had no choice. But this is also where the movie fails on the level of logic. The sharks are able to navigate through the installation as long as an area is half-flooded and they're able to sneak into rooms and wait for people. I won't bother with the rhetorical questions about how they're able to do this. Obviously this is just a dumb popcorn movie. But stuff like that always annoyed me. There's plenty opportunities where these characters HAVE to get into the water so why add scenes where the sharks have to seek them out in areas where the people are still partially dry?The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, the CGI is rather poor even by '99 standards. But overall the performances are pretty good by the cast who at the time were generally unknowns. So if you decide to watch it, know what you're getting into and just shut your brain off and enjoy.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 September 2012","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, Billy Wilder got their first with Avanti in which Jack Lemmon and Juliette Mills journey to Ischia to claim the respective bodies of his father and her mother who have been killed in a road accident, only to discover that they have been meeting on the island for years clandestinely. They start out as antagonists and end up in the sack, natch. Here Sydney Pollack puts a little spin on it inasmuch as Ford and Scott Thomas are not on a vacation island thousands of miles from home when - in this case - their spouses rather than parents - fail to survive a plane crash. Pollack also allows us to see both Ford and Scott Thomas at work whereas Lemmon on Mills had left their day jobs behind. Still there are enough similarities for plagiarism to rear its ugly head, so what else is knew. This eluded me on release and I found a Russian version in a Thrift Shop, recognized Scott Thomas on the box, know she always delivers so took it home. I was pleasantly surprised, especially after reading the first few pans here on IMDb. Scott Thomas was good as ever and a tad warmer than she often plays and works well with Ford who probably was, as someone remarked, a touch old for the role. Overall I enjoyed it and may well give it another whirl in a year or so.
