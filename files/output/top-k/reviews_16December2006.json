[{"date":"16 December 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I seriously enjoyed watching this movie for the first time some years ago and whenever it gets aired again somewhere (which luckily happens from time to time in European cable television) I experience the same thing, I'm moved, entertained and end up wishing there were more movies like this one.It all deals with Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in urban London, Leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to a hilarious New Age Men's Group and falls for straight guy Brendon, played by dashing James Purefoy, who turns out not so straight after all. Thrown in as side characters are the equally great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving whose side story alone is worth watching the movie, Simon Callow as the leader of the Men's group, turning in a great as ever performance. But it's really hard to pick some folks out here, because every character, the female ones like Jennifer Ehle's, Julie Graham's and Harriet Walter's as well, are exquisitely acted. Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a little pale compared to his co-actors but it benefits his somewhat subdued character.The idea behind this movie is a simple one There is never only black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always stand the test of time.Leo identifies as gay but ends up falling for a woman as well who turns out to be his teenage sweetheart and Brendon's long time girlfriend. Brendon starts out straight but gets to learn that gay may be more than just an option for him and being bisexual might not be that bad after all. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and loving it and even the straight folks in the movie, like Angie, Leo's female roommate, get their fair share of love and funny moments up until the end of the movie. The comedy bits(especially Tom Hollander who's just hilarious) are funny and on point and the emotions are believable, as confusing as they may appear at times reading this summary.What I like about this movie is its genuinely positive notion. Whether you're gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, this movie leaves you feeling that it's just okay NOT to be sure and that not being sure might be something worth living out as well! Sexuality is portrayed fluid in this movie and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem with it, apart from all the gay\/straight camp fights that you sometimes get fed with in other gay themed movies. I can only wholeheartedly agree with the subtext of the movie, that what you feel certain of one day, when you think you identify as gay, straight, whatever, can look very different on another. I have never seen (what to call it?) bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification being portrayed in such a heartwarming and true to life manner. This movie dares going where few movies go, gay or straight movies, by not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on that. It goes further and assumes that there may be a life to sex after well-known classifications and I think the times are more than ready for that and other movies exploring postmodern themes like this one! And for all others who don't care about that, heck, it's just a funny comedy worth watching on a rainy Saturday evening with some popcorn on your hands. Give it a try!Loved it!

Last year I saw the film for the first time on the big screen at the Screening Room in Amherst. Once again, as it seems to have become a yearly tradition there, I have found myself loving it just as much the second time this year. Frank Capra has put a masterpiece onto celluloid here, and that is quite a feat for a holiday niche film. Never dull, always heartwarming, funny, and true, It's a Wonderful Life is truly one of cinema's shining achievements.Sure there is the whole cliché of seeing the world as though you have never existed; the waking up to show how important life is to so many. It's a rendition of Dickens yet spun in a way that makes it its own. The entire film could have run with the gimmick and created a complete story from it, as numerous reinterpretations have done&#151;Mr. Destiny, The Family Man, etc&#151;however, that would have been the cheap way out. Instead the filmmakers have started us at the end, a tragedy has occurred and a man's faith in life is waning. Prayers have been sent above and the Gods have decided to send down an angel to help our hero out of his predicament. Well this angel knows nothing about George Bailey, so for the first three quarters of the movie we go along for the ride to catch up on the life of this great man, just as our angel Clarence does the same. We are shown the life of a man who has given the whole of his being for those around him. With naught a selfish bone in his body, George continues to sacrifice his happiness for the joy to see his friends jubilant. Through his good deeds, he eventually wakes up to the treasures of life that have been in front of him the whole time and really takes a small town from the Depression to a close-knit, successful society. It is almost too difficult to think he could be in so much trouble that he would be contemplating suicide, but once again we see his caring nature come through in that trying, desperate moment. When the story finally catches up to itself we learn that the predicament he is in is actually one of another that he has taken responsibility for in order to see if he can't solve the town's problems again.James Stewart is a revelation here. The self-deprecating nature is prevalent at all times, and the intellect his character contains juxtaposes nicely with the humor and goodnaturedness. Stewart is George Bailey, as the role fully encompasses his being. Every nuance of emotion is etched to his face as he goes from wide-eyed explorer to smitten lover, responsible adult, compassionate son and brother, loving husband and father, beaten failure, and finally redeemed hero and friend to all men and women he has ever come across. Of course what hero can exist without a nemesis of equal power whose immense strength comes from evil? Here we have the loathed Mr. Potter played brilliantly by Lionel Barrymore. I don't think anyone who has ever seen this film can have any real compassion for this man who is truly a scrooge to all. People are numbers and figures to him, which need to be conquered and claimed as his own. Barrymore is despicably slimy and true to his character at all times. There must also be mention of the beautiful Donna Reed as our protagonist's love interest. Her striking beauty and self-assuredness shows why George Bailey could be so taken by her, always getting distracted away from his dreams of leaving Bedford Falls. The sexual tension between Reed and Stewart throughout begins humorously at a dance and after when drenched with water and culminates in a serious and real moment as the love takes over during a phone conversation with an old friend. The relationship is believable from start to finish, portrayed even by the young actors who played their roles as children.True there is a segmented population during Christmas time containing those who watch A Christmas Story, those with a love for Christmas Vacation, and those championing It's a Wonderful Life among many others. I must say that I have been converted to Capra's classic film and would have no problem watching it every Christmas for the rest of my life. The story means a lot of things to many people and has been remade countless times in many forms, (there are chunks of time here which show how even Back to the Future II is ripping it off completely). If you want a perfectly written and acted tale of the joy of giving and the strength of friendship to help show the true meaning of Christmas, look no further than this gem that has endured for 60 years. Yes, I will be purchasing the newly released 60th anniversary DVD&#151;sometimes waiting half a century has its benefits as the first copy I own will be the definitive package available.

It's a gimmick that actually does a service to a movie that otherwise would've been just another soapy rom-com about a woman looking for a father for her baby. Mollie (Kirstie Alley, in one of her most memorable performances, chiefly because she's believable and sympathetic most the way), gets knocked up by her boss (George Segal, also quite good as a smug a-hole), and decides to have the baby thinking he might act as the father. He doesn't, and she gets taken to the hospital thanks to cab-driver James (John Travolta, his kinda-sorta mini-comeback in the tail end of the 80s), and he soon befriends Mollie after returning her purse to her after her delivery. Soon a relationship unfolds, but not at first with him as Mollie tries to find someone who will be a *father* to her baby. All the while, the plucky little tyke just wants the guy who makes him laugh the most- and doesn't annoy him by changing the channel when Snuggles the Bear is on.So yeah, a lot of Look Who's Talking, when I think back on it, is pretty cute and almost leans threateningly to the schmaltzy. But what saves it is its fantastic sensibility, mainly in the screenplay where the humor is genuine (however here and there of a sitcom side), and dealing through all of the goofy baby jokes a story and characters that shouldn't be un-sympathetic or even un-empathetic to some viewers. And more often than not, the jokes connect so well that I still grin thinking back to more than a few scenes and lines, like when Mollie- trying one last time- takes Mikey to see his real father, and then as a fight almost breaks out, Mollie breaks a statue, and Mikey follows along (Take that, Tonto!) A terrific piece of casting is done on the supporting side for Abe Vigoda, who is pretty much hysterically funny in any scene he's in. Travolta, too, is surprisingly funny and amiable here, with his charm meter the highest it's been since. Although the ending is probably way too 'uh-oh', and the final little scene in the credits is a cheap set-up for lesser sequel(s) time, this is a movie that works best on its merits of working cleverly in a conventional format, but also with a good, bright soul to it too. I mean, what do you expect from a talking baby movie? Whatever it is, this is probably the best of the bunch.

It's a gimmick that actually does a service to a movie that otherwise would've been just another soapy rom-com about a woman looking for a father for her baby. Mollie (Kirstie Alley, in one of her most memorable performances, chiefly because she's believable and sympathetic most the way), gets knocked up by her boss (George Segal, also quite good as a smug a-hole), and decides to have the baby thinking he might act as the father. He doesn't, and she gets taken to the hospital thanks to cab-driver James (John Travolta, his kinda-sorta mini-comeback in the tail end of the 80s), and he soon befriends Mollie after returning her purse to her after her delivery. Soon a relationship unfolds, but not at first with him as Mollie tries to find someone who will be a *father* to her baby. All the while, the plucky little tyke just wants the guy who makes him laugh the most- and doesn't annoy him by changing the channel when Snuggles the Bear is on.So yeah, a lot of Look Who's Talking, when I think back on it, is pretty cute and almost leans threateningly to the schmaltzy.

By this point, I was obviously a Disney completest. So I bought it (on VHS), and watched it. What can I say? It's a joke! Let's try to take it, scene by scene. First, we are told of the story of the selfish Prince with no love in his heart. A beautiful, magical Enchantress turns him into a Beast (a furry animal, human-sized, with monster teeth and claws) when he dismisses her on the basis of what he perceives as her surface ugliness. Okay, good story. Makes sense. Decent set-up - for who could ever love a monster? the story asks at the end.Well, we're going to meet her (the One who could love a monster). Her name is Belle, and she is a misfit in her small provincial French town. She reads books all the time while the townspeople feel beautiful girls should spend all their time waiting for a handsome man to make them wives and mothers. So, next we meet the handsome man who wants to be her husband, Gaston. He's conceited and arrogant - a real jerk, but a fairly accurate product of the time, with less than ideal views on independent, free-thinking women. Which Belle is. This is an okay establishing scene. We're told a lot. The characters are definitely a little flat, but the only real problem is, perhaps, that the woman singing (and speaking) Belle's part has a sort of grating voice. I'm not kidding.So, her father is an inventor who gets lost in the woods on his way to a convention and after being chased by the unsavory creatures in the woods to the Beast's Castle, he is imprisoned by the Beast in his tower. Belle is lead to the castle by the father's runaway horse, and when she finds him, she meets the Beast, who is just the biggest creep in cinema history, once we know it's actually that selfish Prince. Nice to know being this Beast hasn't taught him a thing about humility. Belle begs for the Beast to release her father, but he refuses. So she offers to take her father's place and that... SUDDENLY melts the Beast's heart... A little. He agrees, the father is taken back to his home by a Spider Carriage, and Beast offers to give her a more comfortable room.Now, by this time is where we start to get really worn out by the huge plausibility and character flaws. Belle is the woman, who is given the film's title of being so Difficult (important to remember), but it's Beast who is the moody one. Which is understandable, since he was turned into a Beast. But isn't the least bit understandable, given all we've learned about Karma. If you are a bad person, bad things happen to you. Beast got what he deserved, and it's incredibly selfish of him to expect that the work he has to do to become human again will happen on it's own. But the filmmakers have convinced all the people who like this film that it's not a problem. Because they've FLUFFED it up, by just tossing it to the side and saying, oh, he's just got a bad temper. What does that mean? It means, Beast is still a bad person waiting for Love to make him human. So in effect, he'll still be a bad person when he's human, only he'll be human.Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. Because Beast, over the course of the film, learns to love Belle and becomes a hero. But right from the get-go, we are not supposed to like Beast. Then, under some extremely disturbing circumstances, Belle is thrown into the Castle and through some lame musical numbers (again, I'm not kidding, these musical sequences are not up to the standards of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin), we are manipulated into believing oh, look, they fell in love so quickly! Another example of this type of insulting manipulation is the scene where Gaston is convincing the townspeople that the Beast is evil. He sings 1 stupid song and suddenly, everyone in the town is storming the castle, Frankenstein-style (big points for originality there).This film is just one big sappy, unconvincing mess. If anything, it offers some extraordinary colors, 1 funny song (Gaston has it's riotously hilarious moments - and every last inch of me's covered with hair!), and Jerry Orbach (yep, that crusty detective from Law & Order) is fantastic in his role as a Parisian candelabra, with an impeccable accent. But other than that, this movie just caters to girls and women, assuming that if you dumb it down for them, they'll love it. I hate seeing that happen, but it looks like the ladies (and some gay people) fell for it. Two Thumbs Down.

Other than a demon scene at a dance club and a few stray body parts in a hospital, the horror is really in the background. What we have is a cross between a war movie and a Lynchian what is real? film.I've had my share of Vietnam movies, because they're all the same to me. Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Casualties of War and Hamburger Hill can all be the same film for all I care. Even Full Metal Jacket to some degree (though luckily the focus is more on boot camp and less on the war). In this movie, the war is everywhere and nowhere... it makes for a backdrop to the actual story. I could have used a different setting, even if it was just a different war (Grenada?), but I guess Vietnam is such a movie cliché that it couldn't be avoided.Now, the David Lynch aspects were very well done. Most of the time you don't know if Robbins is awake, asleep, hallucinating or something else. Many people will be turned off by this. But like Next Door and unlike most Lynch films, you should know the plot by the end and a second viewing will make a lot more sense to you. Well, maybe not the demon part. But the rest.I have said in other reviews that Tim Robbins is possibly the greatest actor in human history. He is like the white Morgan Freeman.

I'd long heard it was one of the best mystery thrillers ever made, and its near unavailability on DVD made it especially tantalizing. So when I finally stumbled across a copy today, I was thrilled. I had studiously avoided reading anything about the plot, so I had no preconceptions about the movie, beyond that it was supposed to be good.What a disappointment!! Now, I'm not saying it was a total waste of a movie (note the 6\/10 rating I give it), I just can't remember the last time a movie so let me down. The plot was, at turns, ridiculous and predictable. The jewelry thief plot was absurd how could Caine's character have been roped into that mess so easily? Wouldn't he have wondered why Olivier's character was not going to go out somewhere so he'd have an alibi during the robbery? Why was Caine's character so inconsistent during this scene -- one minute he's cynical and suspicious about the whole thing, an instant later he's gleefully dressing up as a circus clown and doing pratfalls off a ladder?

This is because at the start of Episode V, you see Vader on one of those Star Destroyers.Those Imperial space ships, which looks like a slice of cheese in white with their big triangular shapes, also appear in earnest in Episode VI, but I think I am going to jump ahead......The only exciting part in Episode V seems to be when the small band of rebel fighters destroy two of the Imperial walkers, which look like large metallic horses in white, armed with 2 twin cannons. One rebel fighter used a harpoon string to knock out one walker; the other fighter actually was brave enough to get into the underbelly of the walker, rig that area with a thermal bomb, and then the bomb blew up causing that walker to go down for good.Another exciting part was the awful part---you still witness Vader's evil wizardry, including the part when he magically chokes to death one of the Star Destroyer officers for failing to stop the rebel forces soon enough.Besides the confrontation of the rebel forces with the Imperial walkers, the action in Episode V was less exciting than all of the other Star Wars flicks, but you see things that you normally see in space--an asteroid field where some of the Imperial ships chasing some of the rebel fleet were destroyed, and of course, the different colors of the planets.Of course, like any Star Wars movies, there are quiet moments in Episode V through those famous clashes involving light sabres and ship attacks. The quiet moment that I had to carefully look into was Luke's Jedi training with Yoda while Luke was on Dagobah. This Jedi training was a little bit like army boot camp and prison torture, especially when Luke, in a handstand, uses the force to try to move a heavy object.Well, the conclusion of the flick doesn't involve an explosion, but instead, it is in two parts Vader fighting against Luke, and also Han Solo being condemned to be frozen alive in a carbonite casket. Some of the Star Wars fans may have been a little sad to see one of the good guys being frozen alive.In addition, there was even larger tension when the Star Destroyer was going to use the tractor beam on the Millennium Falcon after Luke, who confronted Darth Vader on Cloud City and lost his hand in a light sabre fight, says that he will never turn to the dark side of the force, although Vader says by doing so, he can save the galaxies from further doom. In other matters, Han Solo, after rescuing Luke from Vader, finds out that the Falcon had its hyperspace drive tampered with. It seemed like hope was going to be destroyed fast for the good guys on the Falcon with the tractor beam on the Vader ship about to be activated on the Falcon, until that miracle droid, R2-D2, found a way to repair the hyperspace drive control, and just like that, like as if it was fired from gun, the Falcon disappears into space at light speed. Vader is shocked. Well, you see a little good in him....I anticpated that he would magically choke the new Star Destroyer admiral for letting the Falcon escape, but he decides not to, and focuses his ideals on the construction of a second Death Star...which will appear in earnest in Episode VI.The final shots of the movie, as I found out, is Sullust, a rebel staging area in space (not on a planet), where the Falcon is rescued by large rebel fleet mostly made of transport ships and frigate ships, and will play a very major part in Episode VI. Here, Leia and Luke are determined to confront the evil Jabba the Hutt and try to rescue Han Solo from the carbonite casket.

All the right elements of action, romance, chivalry, and honor serve to bring out the deepest subtleties of the human spirit, with a refinement which can only be appreciated to the unfortunately rare extent it deserves by those who find it nothing short of the most personally and permanently transfiguring experience, rather than as the mere entertainment it no less abundantly is. . . .

In fact, I never realized just what a superb character actor Mr. Wilson actually is, until given a chance to compare this performance, of Don Rafael Montero, with his part, for instance, as the equally though much less demandingly evil ex cop, Jack Travis, in Lethal Weapon III. As Captain James T. Kirk, from the Star Ship Enterprise, would have put it, he's definitely earned his pay for the week, along with other compensations just about as harrowingly reminiscent of the great Kodos; that is, next to an equally fine performance, of Captain Harrison Love, played by Matthew Letscher, whose own chivalrously ignoble sense of honor had also come to its most Divinely-Predestined End (Psalms 576), as seen through the eyes of its very own worst enemy. . . . And it's certainly no surprise to see the name of Steven Spielberg among the list of credits, for the same reason it would have been quite a surprise to me had just about anybody else been able to pull off this particular little stunt. To quote still another line from the film, which might as well have come directly from, again, the Final Anti-Type, the Seventh and Last Head, on the Image of the Beast, The children should never have to see the things we do, after-all; and yet, to the contrary, he, as with any real traitor to his own class, should be among the first to insist that the children not be spared even the most tastefully as well as meaningfully well-proportioned violence in this one! But, to be perfectly honest, I have very little hope here, for essentially the same reason&#151;He'll Never Be Rid of Me!

You might think that such a person would not be an ideal candidate for a slice of life drama, but I think this movie proves that thought wrong. Things get interesting when Sammy's brother Terry shows up at her house after a year's absence. Terry fully appreciates the truth of Robert Frost's comment, Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in. Though there is a strong bond between the siblings forged by their parents having been killed in a car crash while they were young, Sammy's enthusiasm over Terry's return is checked when she learns that Terry is at loose ends and just wants money. Terry is Sammy's opposite - direction-less, jobless, spontaneous, confused - but he is not without great personal charm. The heart of the movie deals with how two such different personalities interact in a brief interval in their lives. The relationship that develops between Terry and young Rudy is captivating and is developed with non-Hollywood believability. Sammy's faith plays an important part in her life while Terry thinks the faith business is all a fairy tale and he will have nothing to do with it. In one of the most affecting scenes Sammy arranges a meeting between Terry and her priest, Father Ron (played by director Lonegan no less). Ron is not played stereotypically but rather as sincere, forthright, and questioning. He blunts Terry's cynicism with the question, Do you think your life is important? And for a moment we see that Terry is engaged, and it is at that moment that we have hope for his future.The appeal of this movie in general is its honesty - all conflicts are not resolved happily, just as in real life. But, in the end, each of the siblings has edged just slightly towards the other - Sammy becoming a bit more free spirited and Terry a bit more appreciative of family and stability. Small changes from a brief encounter is more than what can usually be expected.Others have compared Mark Ruffalo to a young Brando. I found his performance almost imitative of Brando - same speech patterns, same head turns, same eye movements. But I found Ruffalo's performance compelling - you can do worse than a successful Brando imitation. In fact all the performances are excellent, particularly the young Culkin.Sammy's relationship with her boss struck me as unbelievable at first, but when I thought of the number of unusual couplings I have seen over the years, this one did not seem so far-fetched after all.The themes in this movie, of the influence of one's past, of love and alienation between siblings, of failures realized and imagined, of the refusal to grow up, are essentially the same as those dealt with in Five Easy Pieces. You Can Count on Me has a lighter touch than Pieces, and leaves you with a bit more optimism regarding the fates of its characters, but I would strongly recommend Five Easy Pieces for a different and more sober take on the themes, or for just being an excellent movie as far as that goes.

Time and time again I have heard the phrase, They don't make them like this anymore, when The Shawshank Redemption is spoke of. However, it should be noted that Shawshank was not the first movie of its kind and owes much credit to its predecessors (taking elements and ideas from movies like Dead Man Walking, It's a Wonderful Life, etc.) Well paced and often times very moving, The Shawshank Redemption provides us with what is initially a very realistic situation middle aged man Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is put on trial wrongfully (as far as we know) for murder. Found guilty, he is put in jail for a life sentence. As the movie progresses , in part from beautiful cinematography, and in part from lightly tugging at the audiences heart strings, we are able to sympathize with the inmates, and almost pity them. The concept of having a home and not knowing what to do when not in your comfort zone is something that the Shawshank Redemption uses to make a simple idea into a very good full length movie. However, it is ranked #2 on IMDb's top 250 (with a rating of 9.2 it is actually higher than The Godfather, thus should be ranked #1) and this, I believe at least, is an undeserving spot for The Shawshank Redemption. While it is very good, it is certainly not among the ranks of Citizen Kane, The Godfather and others on that level. Providing us with little or no historical or cultural relevance, the movie likely earns its ranking because people can identify with it, so they end up enjoying it, and end up giving it a 10 out of 10 because they enjoy it so much. Though it pains me to say it, just because a movie is highly enjoyable, it does not make it great by any means. Andy Dufresne acts as a metaphor for the rest of the human race, and shows, how sometimes, we are all wrongfully accused of something or other. However, the movie pertains only to itself, not taking on anything bigger-- so it stays a very good movie rather than an excellent one.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 December 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" First thing's first, if you know the history of Disney's animated features, then you know a little about what Disney was going through when they made the original Rescuers. They were dealing with lackluster animated films, which they weren't able to produce more than 3 or so per decade since the 1950's. The '60s were very hard, especially with the failing health and eventual death of Walt Disney, but they managed to come out on top with The Jungle Book. But the '70s were a different story. Both 1970's The Aristocats and 1973's Robin Hood were not met with even close to the same success of '60s hits Jungle and 101 Dalmatians. So of course, if Disney's latest investment, 1977's The Rescuers, weren't able to work out- it was pretty clear they would have to make another Mary Poppins \/ Bedknobs and Broomsticks blockbuster (which would be the disastrous Pete's Dragon) and hope their feature-length Winnie the Pooh package film would pick up the slack.However, The Rescuers was a hit with audiences and critics (becoming one of their most successful films, animated or non, of the decade). And there's a pretty obvious reason for that. The story was very touching, the characters were one of a kind, and the movie itself when it came together, had everything. Humor, tears, excitement. It was a perfect Disney film. So, really, a sequel to this film was never actually a very good idea. Because in this film, we see the filmmakers trying to replace everything in the original. And they're only able to be second rate in their attempts. Penny the orphan from the first movie is replaced by a little boy, Cody, who's not an orphan but a little explorer \/ animal activist. In the original film, when Penny needed the mice to save her, she says quite plainly - how can two little mice save me (from these villains)? And that was important. But in this film, there's none of that. Though there are some unbelievable scenes where one of the mice (or even 3) are able to hold little Cody's weight just by holding onto a rope. Sorry, but that's impossible. No wonder there was never a line in the movie about 2 little mice, because then everyone would have laughed because this is ridiculous.The original villain, Medusa, is replaced by another greedy baddie, Percival C. McLeach. So, 2 little mice can save us from greed... Why is it always a greedy thief? Because Bernard and Bianca can't handle international terrorists? Or Michael Jackson? The other 3 original villains, Snoops and the 2 crocodiles, are replaced here by 1 villain, a salamander named Joanna, who's probably the cutest character here. I'm not kidding- just watch that scene where she swims out of the river and waves 'goodbye' to McLeach. The original Albatross, Orville, is replaced here by Wilbur- which was just an excuse to hire John Candy, who had huge success with his classic '80s John Hughes family comedy, Uncle Buck. And right here is a good example of where the movie goes horribly wrong. Wilbur arrives in Australia, injures his back, then the movie goes for a 4+ minute sequence (split into two) with a bunch of mice operating on him while he is flopping around and wailing. Does that sound appealing... to anyone?So anyway, bottom line - I think this film was meant more for the audiences who prefer blander fare like those Don Bluth films. But for Disney, this has absolutely none of that great Disney magic that films like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid were able to recapture from Disney's stagnant, stumbling '80s. The one saving grace here is the incorporation of computer animated technology. Now, usually, I cry foul and whip CGI every chance I get. But about this time, Disney began their collaboration with Pixar to make animated films with some obvious computer-generated backgrounds so they could have sequences like several of the ones in this movie, where the movie functions as a roller-coaster ride (most notably the opening credits sequence where the camera SPEEDS through a field of some kind of flower, and a couple of Wilbur's great flying scenes).

","genre":null},{"date":"16 December 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" First thing's first, if you know the history of Disney's animated features, then you know a little about what Disney was going through when they made the original Rescuers. They were dealing with lackluster animated films, which they weren't able to produce more than 3 or so per decade since the 1950's. The '60s were very hard, especially with the failing health and eventual death of Walt Disney, but they managed to come out on top with The Jungle Book. But the '70s were a different story. Both 1970's The Aristocats and 1973's Robin Hood were not met with even close to the same success of '60s hits Jungle and 101 Dalmatians. So of course, if Disney's latest investment, 1977's The Rescuers, weren't able to work out- it was pretty clear they would have to make another Mary Poppins \/ Bedknobs and Broomsticks blockbuster (which would be the disastrous Pete's Dragon) and hope their feature-length Winnie the Pooh package film would pick up the slack.However, The Rescuers was a hit with audiences and critics (becoming one of their most successful films, animated or non, of the decade). And there's a pretty obvious reason for that. The story was very touching, the characters were one of a kind, and the movie itself when it came together, had everything. Humor, tears, excitement. It was a perfect Disney film. So, really, a sequel to this film was never actually a very good idea. Because in this film, we see the filmmakers trying to replace everything in the original. And they're only able to be second rate in their attempts. Penny the orphan from the first movie is replaced by a little boy, Cody, who's not an orphan but a little explorer \/ animal activist. In the original film, when Penny needed the mice to save her, she says quite plainly - how can two little mice save me (from these villains)? And that was important. But in this film, there's none of that. Though there are some unbelievable scenes where one of the mice (or even 3) are able to hold little Cody's weight just by holding onto a rope. Sorry, but that's impossible. No wonder there was never a line in the movie about 2 little mice, because then everyone would have laughed because this is ridiculous.The original villain, Medusa, is replaced by another greedy baddie, Percival C. McLeach. So, 2 little mice can save us from greed... Why is it always a greedy thief? Because Bernard and Bianca can't handle international terrorists? Or Michael Jackson? The other 3 original villains, Snoops and the 2 crocodiles, are replaced here by 1 villain, a salamander named Joanna, who's probably the cutest character here. I'm not kidding- just watch that scene where she swims out of the river and waves 'goodbye' to McLeach. The original Albatross, Orville, is replaced here by Wilbur- which was just an excuse to hire John Candy, who had huge success with his classic '80s John Hughes family comedy, Uncle Buck. And right here is a good example of where the movie goes horribly wrong. Wilbur arrives in Australia, injures his back, then the movie goes for a 4+ minute sequence (split into two) with a bunch of mice operating on him while he is flopping around and wailing. Does that sound appealing... to anyone?So anyway, bottom line - I think this film was meant more for the audiences who prefer blander fare like those Don Bluth films. But for Disney, this has absolutely none of that great Disney magic that films like Aladdin and The Little Mermaid were able to recapture from Disney's stagnant, stumbling '80s. The one saving grace here is the incorporation of computer animated technology. Now, usually, I cry foul and whip CGI every chance I get. But about this time, Disney began their collaboration with Pixar to make animated films with some obvious computer-generated backgrounds so they could have sequences like several of the ones in this movie, where the movie functions as a roller-coaster ride (most notably the opening credits sequence where the camera SPEEDS through a field of some kind of flower, and a couple of Wilbur's great flying scenes). Now, that's magical, if not exciting and great fun.But with this sequel, we lose all of what made the first great - the true danger, empathizing with the lonely orphan, and the whole idea of seeing a character's darkest hour and journey, so when we finally see their brighter day, it really feels as though they triumphed.

This film is a hoot! I agree completely with Ebert's beautiful review. It is fascinating, heartfelt, true to character, place and situation, extremely funny, and sometimes painfully violent. I would only add that as an entertainment, it is one of the most disorienting experiences a viewer can find in the cinema. It is fascinating to watch this film back-to-back with the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple, a great film in its own right, but which seems like the preparation for their masterpiece, Fargo. The tension is almost unrelieved in Blood Simple. But the ending violence is so over-the-top, that the viewer suddenly realizes that they are really being sneakily had by the filmmakers and that the joke is on them. In Fargo, the tension is also unrelieved. But here the film starts with the audience being in on the outrageousness of the events and the almost cartoon-like characters with their outrageous accents. But still we don't know sometimes whether to laugh or feel chilled (with the events AND that bleak Minnesota winter!) The audience experiences two strands of tension - the crime, and Jerry Lundegaard's exponentially growing nightmare. Who doesn't identify with the moment when in total exasperation at the unfolding of events, Jerry has that tantrum, trashing his desk. Granted we haven't all had our spouses kidnapped for money! But we are right there with Jerry, feeling his helplessness. What a tour-de-force of acting from William H. Macy, with France McDormand's human-wise Marge, and Steven Buscemi's SadSack crook creating and leading one of the greatest acting ensembles to grace an American film in years. The audience thinks from the very beginning, that that bizarre Steven Buscemi sure seems funny-lookin in this movie. And when that phrase is uttered in two of the funniest moments of the film, we in the audience laugh, knowing the film-makers are actually making fun of us at these priceless moments. We may be in on the jokes, but the film-makers are absolutely onto us - and they have fun in letting us know that. Frances McDormand's Marge, with her genuine, caring persona, a smile that lights up the screen, and the most-musical of accents - absolutely nailing the rhythms and cadences of that beautifully distinctive speech (little-known outside that part of the United States until this film came along) is a revelation in this movie. It makes the audience want to see any film she has ever been in before!This is a movie that became an instant classic, plunging the viewer into an alternate universe of feelings, situations and characters that they identify with, are repulsed by, laugh at, and ultimately embrace.

Their love for each other is strong, but they eventually get caught and end up in prison. While on the inside they start a riot and successfully escape, continuing their roaring rampage pf hell on the streets. They are Natural Born Killers.In the film Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone skillfully creates a film that is in your face in terms of black comedy, violence and it's message of the media. Throughout the film, Stone uses Dutch angles and the different camera types to emphasize the fact that the main characters live in an askew universe. The Dutch angle is used to portray the psychological tension in the film. The entire film is not grounded in any reality, this is evident in the scene after Mickey and Mallory kill the Native American and she breaks the fourth wall barrier by talking to the audience. Throughout the film, Stone also uses black and white scenes which show the inner and outer moments for the specific character. For example, when one of the two men who enter the restaurant talks ill about Mallory to Mickey, the scene turns black and white as Mickey has an outer experience and imagines himself in blood killing the two men. Also in the I Love Mallory segment, Mallory is groped by her father. This scene is also in black and white, but he probably never grabbed her; her father, in her mind, is groping her with his words.One of the main symbols in the film is the snake, which is a symbol for knowledge. The rattle snake saves Mickey while he tries to break out of prison by biting the horse the guard is on, but then the snake is also the reason that Mickey and Mallory end up in prison again. Stone uses colours throughout the film creating a surreal experience. The colours he uses are red and green and show evil and sickness. The colour red appear whenever Mickey's inner demon appears, right after the interview he kills everyone and it fades to red, then fades into the prison brawl. The colour green occurs when something violent is about to happen, such as the Drug Store shootout and the lime pie at the beginning.I for one had a headache after watching this and can only recommend it as a one time only viewing. If it weren't for the over-the-top performances by every single person in this film, I would have graded it lower. With the exception of Lewis, everyone does an outstanding job of adding fuel to the fire of this film. Harrelson gives one of his best performances of his career as the insane, blood-thirsty Mickey Knox. Harrelson carries this film on his back and he is the driving force behind what is actually good about it. Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore play the authorties and again, over-the-top performances from both of them. Robert Downey Jr is the media journalist and his transformation at the end is funny and horrifying at the same time. Downey Jr was a perfect choice for that role. It's Lewis that drags the film down, with her annoying, scrawny ass yelling and kicking all over the place. She isn't the best looking person either.To sum up the film, it would be that it gives off that feeling that it was a student film with a big budget. Sure everything could have meaning behind it, but where does one draw the line. I don't know, but I can tell you that Stone crosses it. There's using something artistically, then there's overkill, NBK is full of overkill. I can only imagine what Tarantino's script would have been like if it were filmed, and not what Stone did. The black comedy, although good in some places, didn't really need to be in here. The film suffers from it. With Stone it is usually hit or miss. NBK is that odd one that lies somewhere in between, more along the line of a miss, but not over it. It's certainly not his best effort, but not his worst either.

Robert Downey Jr is the media journalist and his transformation at the end is funny and horrifying at the same time. Downey Jr was a perfect choice for that role. It's Lewis that drags the film down, with her annoying, scrawny ass yelling and kicking all over the place. She isn't the best looking person either.To sum up the film, it would be that it gives off that feeling that it was a student film with a big budget. Sure everything could have meaning behind it, but where does one draw the line. I don't know, but I can tell you that Stone crosses it. There's using something artistically, then there's overkill, NBK is full of overkill. I can only imagine what Tarantino's script would have been like if it were filmed, and not what Stone did. The black comedy, although good in some places, didn't really need to be in here. The film suffers from it. With Stone it is usually hit or miss. NBK is that odd one that lies somewhere in between, more along the line of a miss, but not over it. It's certainly not his best effort, but not his worst either. Give it that one viewing that it needs, then decide whether or not you can stand taking Tylonol Extra Strength after every viewing.

Hugely undeserving of all the people of this town giving up their time to see it. They're nutty as a fruitcake, if you ask ME! Even though, unlike Richard Aird hopeless, brainless, pointless, pitiful pantomime, Disney's Lion King has a professional production, reasonable animation, good drama, and admirable songs, it simply can't stand comparison with Disney's recent animated hits like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin - it's too obnoxious and depressing!
