[{"date":"5 October 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Fight Club is drama\/thriller from 1999. It is directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Gone Girl, The Social Network) and was written by Jim Uhls (Jumper) who adapted it from the Chuck Palinuk (Choke, Romance) novel of the same name. It star Edward Norton (American History X, The Illusionist, The Incredible Hulk), Brad Pitt (Inglorious Bastards, World War Z, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Helena Bonham Carter (The Kings Speech, Sweeny Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland).Fight Club is about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who starts a fight club with his eccentric friend, Tyler (Brad Pitt). Tyler begins to take the club in a different direction, but all of this is threatened by Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who has the same problem as Edward Norton.David Fincher's incredible directing cannot go unnoticed. This film is one of those that is perfectly directed. His style is all over it and the darkness and comedy are shown perfectly on screen. His perfect precision and style are evident in this film. It is technically perfect in every way which is also thankful to its cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth (Gone Girl, The Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and editor James Haygood (Tron Legacy, The Game, Panic Room).Another great aspect of this movie is it's writing by Jim Uhls. Now, I haven't read the book Fight Club by Chuck Palinuk but his contribution can't be unnoticed. The plot of this movie is very clever and smart but it is adapted finely by Uhls. He constantly spews out famous line after famous line that this movie is known for. He balances the seriousness and the comedy very well.I have little complaints about Fight Club, perhaps takes itself too seriously when trying to convey a message, almost as if it thinks it is something more when it really isn't. While the message is good, it is impossible to do for most but a step towards it just might be enough. Anyways, I think anyone who loves violence, dark comedy and clever writing will highly enjoy this flick.

It was written and directed by Akira Kurosawa (Yojimbo, Rashomon, Ran). It was also written by Shinobu Hashimoto (Rashomon, Ikiru, Throne of Blood) and Hideo Oguni (Ran, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Ikiru). It stars Takashi Shimura (Ikiru, Rashomon, Throne of Blood), Toshirô Mifune (Rashomon, Yojimbo, Throne of Blood) and Isao Kimura (High and Low, Ikiru, Stray Dog). Seven Samurai is about the samurai (Takashi Shimura, Toshirô Mifune, Isao Kimura) hired to protect a small village from oncoming raiders and how they prepare the town and ultimately fight for it.Akira Kurosawa is one of the most famous of all foreign directors for a reason. He has a way of composing his shots that is like no other. Every image in this film is a painting. His ability to truly put you in 16th century Japan is far superior to the Hollywood directors attempting to make an epic period piece. Watch this film if you want to see what Japan used to not only be like but felt like.I feel if Takashi Shimura wasn't Japanese but American and had the same amount of talent he would be spoken in the same breath as Jimmy Stewart, Paul Newman and many other incredible 50's actors. It's a shame he isn't that recognized because his talent is incredible. I don't speak Japanese but this man transcends language. In this film, you believe every aspect about him and all of his small mannerisms. He truly feels like a real person.Why I do think this is a really good film and everybody should watch it, I feel as if it is slightly overrated. Many filmmakers declare this as one of the best films of all time, I wouldn't consider it in the top 50. It is a bit too long (3 and a half hours), and could definitely use some cutting. This doesn't mean it is necessarily boring and maybe I just don't fully understand it and will take a few more viewings to understand. However I do still highly admire this film and you should spend a day and watch it.

John Cleese steals much of the show with his delicious overacting, yet Eric Idle makes the strongest impression as everything from a randy marriage counselor to one of Hell's Grannies. Meanwhile, Terry Jones squints, Michael Palin smirks, and Graham Chapman disapproves of everything. None are as sensational as they would become, but all make impressions.For all that it has going for it, And Now connects only about half the time. Gilliam's animation seems slower and more ponderous here than it did on television, and the one-joke nature of his cartoons gets exposed in a way they didn't as television interstitials. A kind of pokiness cuts into the live-action material as well, like bits involving mice that squeal on key when hit with a hammer and men with tape recorders up their noses. Each of these may be only a minute or so, but they feel much longer.Several of Python's best-loved sketches don't appear here, like the Ministry of Silly Walks, the Spanish Inquisition, and the Crunchy Frog. The best-known sketch that does appear, the Dead Parrot, is actually a little dead itself for some reason. Director Ian MacNaughton was Python's usual director for television, and if anything shoots things in an even flatter manner here than he did for the BBC. Perhaps it's because television was Python's medium, for the way it offered a kind of subversive platform for their entertainments.Other sketches do shine. The Funniest Joke in the World is a great laugh unless you're German, in which case view with caution. Even better is the Milkman sketch, which demonstrates the pitfall of falling for the wrong woman.Overall, And Now makes for a fine Python primer, a starter course as another reviewer suggests.

Well, his sister lives in the deep south, married to the local sheriff. Now, this area is in major trouble because we've got the old white supremacists out on the warpath, led by none other than R L Emery. There's this other guy who doesn't think Emery is white enough who, at the start of the film, bludgeons to death a black reverend while all his skinhead mates look on. And one of the skinheads is the teenage son of Dee Wallace Stone.Now that's a lot of story with no Tommy involved, right? It does take some time for him to show up but doesn't take much time for the old Nazis to get right on his case and also start hassling his sister. Didn't they watch Best of the Best 2? No one messes with Tommy's family! Eric Roberts isn't in this one by the way, and I think it was probably because his character took the rap for killing the bad guy in the last film. Otherwise I can't think of a reason how Tommy got away with breaking a guy's neck in front of a screaming crowd.Anyway, while a schoolteachers goes up against R Lee Emery (who doesn't get a credit here for some reason), Tommy goes up against the far more dangerous henchman, played by Drake from Aliens! Drake is all up for a bit of ethnic cleansing and gets his army of skinheads some hardware while Tommy breaks all their noses while dressed as a clown.Just when I thought this film was never going to get going Drake kidnaps Tommy's nephew and the fight is on! Tommy and the guy from Happy Gilmore head off to the Nazi compound and start wasting their way through a skinhead army in a whirlwind of machine gun fire, explosions, and even an M80 machine gun.
