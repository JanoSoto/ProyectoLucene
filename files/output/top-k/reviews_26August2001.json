I LOVE the first three films, seen them a million times, got the videos, watch them when they're on the tube... and this movie DOES NOT live up to their legacy.  The plot is paper thin... the characters are almost transparent... The action, such as it is, is predictable.

I'm not really sure that either performance is Oscarworthy, as many people have said, but they both fall into their characters and make you believe in what they're doing. The other performances were also very good. The other positive was how the director caught the feel of the helplessness of Falls City (the town where this takes place). The dark, moody lighting and the decay that seemed to surround their lives was the perfect backdrop for the film.However, the film does have problems. Brandon Teena's story is not fully explained. Unless you are aware of her story, you don't know how she wound up becoming sexually confused, and a little more explanation of this would have been helpful. The other problem I had was with the pacing. As a lot of people on the comments board have noted, this movie is very slow. Some movies are slow in that they build up to something, but the pacing in this movie is very bad. The writer probably intended to give you an idea of what a nothing existence there is in Falls City, but instead it makes you wonder when the payoff is coming.But it is a good movie. It makes you think about homosexuality in Middle America, which is definitely something worth thinking about and not ignoring.

About a few million times, or even more, is the answer your going to give or your lying. Patrick Bateman says these things to himself all the time, he just takes it to it's literal extreme- actually doing it...This is the basis of the book and the movie 'American Psycho'- the later which I am reviewing. It's a dog eat dog world, and he Patrick Bateman is the top dog, or he'll do something about it... kill everyone higher than him.The plot is non-existent. It's about a yuppie in 1987 named Patrick Bateman, he has to be the best, or be nothing... if you tick him off, make him jealous, or turn him on, blood is going to fly. He gets mad just because someone has a better business card than he does; he kills a homeless man because a bum and him have nothing in common except being human - even after he the bum praises Patrick.His motto is 'Death comes to those who are worse than me or greater, at the hands or axe or knife or chainsaw of myself'I think one of the main reasons I love this movie is that for years my worst enemy have been yuppies, and the other being the fact I myself am a 'Patrick Bateman' as everyone else is, were all perfectionists on some level or we all want to get ahead and be the best, as I pointed out earlier.This would make a great horror film, but instead it makes an even better comedy. Anyone who would call this a horror-film would call 'Dr. Strangelove or how I learned to stop hating and love the bomb' a paranoid, war, thriller- aka they're insane!American Psycho is a satire of the 'Yuppies', you know those movies from the eighties about eighties yuppies and this is the same thing, one funnier, better, and oh yeah and our hero is a murderer.The performances are sheer brilliance, I cannot say enough about how well they all do. They are like the godfather, nobody could play these characters- ever except the ones chosen, whereas most movies if you know other choices you can picture them in these roles, but not here.Also the set design is amazing too, each room looks better than the last, it makes us envy it's characters, and that's nearly impossible in a Horror Film or Comedy- as in horror your either a killer or your being killed and in a comedy you know that people are always laughing at you, unless you make a bad joke.However, the most brilliant thing to note is the direction. In my mind their have been three truly master shot makers ever, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese, but now I can add Mary Harron to my list, making it four.

And for good reason - Memento is one of the most intelligent, thought - provoking and quite simply amazing films I have ever seen.To put the film's odd backwards approach into some degree of perspective, while watching you simply feel as if you are in the mind of Leonard, who has a condition which does not allow him to make new memories. We view the scenes in much the same way as Leonard views the world, with the same questions - who is that? Why are they talking with such familiarity? Where is this place? And most importantly, who can be trusted? We are as confused as Leonard during most of the movie and therefore have to concentrate as hard as he does. The difference is that we can gradually piece together what we have seen, whereas Leonard must keep a fat book of notes on everything he knows, and constantly pulls out Polaroids in order to affirm where he has been. In all, it is a sad state of affairs.Indeed, the beauty of the movie lies in its emotion - its sense of desperation and sorrowful hope. The movie plays with our emotions using Leonard, as he often seems to be an emotional void with a very faint sense of hope that he will solve the murder of his wife. Eventually, the audience knows what has happened to her, and that people constantly try to tell him that her case has been solved, but Leonard knows nothing. He essentially sabotages his own mind in order to have that single, missing piece of the murder case continually hanging in the air, making for a very sad, desperate character for whom we feel great pity. The simplicity of the movie is also displayed here, in that the basic action of crossing out a few words means that Leonard must embark upon his desperate search again. He is deceitful to himself, and does not even know it - the audience is left with the mixed emotion of feeling sorry for Leonard, and being angry at him for double-crossing himself at every turn. We do not know what to think of him, meaning that such a character is a powerful tool. I remember that when I saw this in the cinema, certain parts amused the audience greatly, such as when Leonard found the empty bottle, without recalling why he was there in the bathroom, and thought, I don't feel drunk..... I didn't find this funny at all, nor do I think Nolan was attempting to insert an element of comedy. I simply felt sorry for him, knowing that this is the continual path of his life. Since I saw L.A.

He creates an unsure, sad and lonely character and constantly makes us wonder what exactly what is going on in Leonard's brain. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss also do well in that they keep us guessing - can they be trusted? Who are they really?

Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe, but I doubt it; Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics, while not denying its basic greatness, have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable, many find her judgemental, and feel that her Stoic, Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Stand-by, do nothing, and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern, is it?OK, so if you don't like the main character, if you don't like what she has to say, then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in Post-Imperial terms, as a critique of Slavery. After all, the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga, which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim, but who am I to deny the possibility? Maybe it plays a part in the subtext of the novel.So, I'm a modern script-writer who doesn't like the novel, it's pre-occupations or even Fanny Price. What do I do? I completely re-write the story to take a possible minor sub-text (slavery) and turn it in to the driving narrative force. I then take smart as a whippet, stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!I don't know what this film is, but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms, but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But, jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen, you ought to at least like the source material; Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't like the main character, you shouldn't be able to completely re-invent her. Or if you do, you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.

I then take smart as a whippet, stubborn yet passive Fanny and turn her into a ballsy version of Bridget Jones. With an attitude. I then string together a couple of scenes from the book with a few invented bridging scenes to advance the romance. Et Voila! I have a completely different story!I don't know what this film is, but it isn't Mansfield Park. Enjoy it on its own terms, but don't ever get the idea that your watching Austen on the screen. But, jeeze. I think that if you're going to adapt a novel for the screen, you ought to at least like the source material; Otherwise, what's the point? If you don't like the main character, you shouldn't be able to completely re-invent her. Or if you do, you should have the decency to be a little ashamed.

Every director can bring his or her fresh eyes to a play and make it new. Even so, I think we are obliged to stay true to the basic tennents of the text. Are the works of Jane Austen as open to interpretation? Maybe, but I doubt it; Certainly not if MANSFIELD PARK is anything to go by.MANSFIELD was always my favourite of Austen's six novels. Many modern critics, while not denying its basic greatness, have problems with the book. Many find FANNY PRICE unlikeable, many find her judgemental, and feel that her Stoic, Augustan approach is hard to relate to. Stand-by, do nothing, and eventually he'll see the error of his ways and come to love you. Not very modern, is it?OK, so if you don't like the main character, if you don't like what she has to say, then what do you do? Look for other aspects of the story you can relate to. In recent years some critics have chosen to see MANSFIELD PARK in Post-Imperial terms, as a critique of Slavery. After all, the family's wealth is based on plantations in Antiga, which were run by slaves. Is that what the book's about? Is it? I don't know. I think the evidence is a little slim, but who am I to deny the possibility?

The best part of the movie is the backdrop itself, for which Ridley Scott aggressively takes the moviegoer on a trip throughout all corners of the Roman Empire, and even to their concept of heaven in the process. Definitely worth the money, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.I was disturbed, however, by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing, please stop reading now.OK, first of all, Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd, Commodius lived for 12 years (180-192 A.D.) so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either (he died in a wrestling match). Also, he was known for his physical strength, so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.These items, taken alone, bother me a little, but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one, soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married, so all of Maximus' talk of going home to see his wife really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land, but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also, Rome was in a defensive posture; most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians; he stepped up efforts during his regime, believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire, he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a super emperor; my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago, we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did (and didn't do), and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.Having said all that, I really did like the movie. I give it an 8\/10, with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart, but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it, but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.
