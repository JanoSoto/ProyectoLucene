[{"date":"1 April 2011","score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" I loved this movie. I adored it; I felt it was one of the more genuinely touching and real love stories that I had seen in a long, long time and even now, more than twenty-four hours since I saw it for the first, and I promise you, *not* last time, I am still haunted by its emotional power and how it drew me in with its passion. Inspired by a true story and starring a very real actor and a very real actress, At First Sight touched my heartstrings and yanked on them all the way through. It also contained a very humanistic touch apart from its romantic elements, one that I think everybody can appreciate in one way or another.As the movie opens, Amy Benic (Mira Sorvino) an overworked architect is essentially booted out of her office and sent to the winter land countryside resort on a vacation by her co-workers. During her stay there, she befriends a blind therapist (Val Kilmer) with whom she begins a slowly-developing romantic bond. Despite his condition, they grow closer to each other and become passionately devoted, up to and past a surgery that they hope can restore his eyesight.At First Sight is a fictionalized adaptation of Shirl and Barbara Jennings, a couple who passionately loved each other even though the former was completely blind. Their story was documented by Dr. Oliver Sacks. Adapted from his account by Steve Levitt and directed by Irwin Winkler, the movie becomes a powerfully dramatic love story that contains so much of that real-life passion from the people that inspired it.It is easy to criticize At First Sight for being too conventional, too derivative of other Hollywood love stories. But I don't think this picture falls under those categories and those type of films, such as Hope Floats. First of all, sometimes it's not about plot twists or breaking the mold. Sometimes, a movie can strike with just as much power (or more, as in this case) simply by utilizing those conventions and building upon them in a way that is fresh. And they do that here. The two central characters are very well-written, characterized as thinking, caring human beings who love and hunger for each other. A commendable move on the filmmakers' part was the casting. Instead of placing the typical romantic leads, who are more body than personality, they cast two very real performances. Gifted and good-looking as they are, Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino, I've always felt, were very real. They aren't merely putting on a convincing act, they transition something very real into their performances and you can sense that. And as a defining example, I want to cite the scene in here that I usually gripe about the sex scene. Whereas with most erotic scenes in movies, I tend to get the feeling that my time is being wasted, or that the director is losing faith in his own picture and using a cheap gimmick to stimulate my interest, I did not feel that here. There is a brief and very visceral erotic moment between Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino - and I know people are going to start laughing at this point - and I did not get a negative reaction because this scene was not lustful. I wasn't thinking about the sex, I wasn't even thinking about Ms Sorvino's body. I was thinking about the passion and the love that was emanating from this scene. Here comes the one that I'm sure will get the biggest laugh yet.I was not turned on; I was moved.That's the core of what I loved this movie. Unlike so many of those contrived excuses of love stories that I see in so many movies, I *believed* in the love between these two characters. I was convinced they were two people who adored each other. I believed in their love, I cared for their love, I feared for their love. But what also makes the movie so good is the way the subject matter of blindness is treated. I imagine that for some, seeing or merely knowing about the subject matter of this movie can be a comforting reminder that lack of eyesight is not lack of humanity. For me, it was a reminder of just how thankful I am to not only have my eyesight, but my health. These two very authentic emotional elements stirred a great passion in me as I watched the film and kept me in play clear to the end.Can I criticize anything in the movie? Well, yes, two short moments. One was a super-fast zoom upon Val Kilmer's eyes accompanied by a whooshing sound effect. The other was a jump cut montage of Ms Sorvino imitating emotions. These two scenes were a little out of place and seemed to be from other movies. But it's a two hour and nine minute movie and these two bits add up to, what, less than a minute? You do the math.At First Sight is a wonderful movie with a strong emotional chord. Mr. Kilmer and Ms Sorvino are absolutely wonderful, as are the underrated Kelly McGillis as the jealous, troubled sister, Bruce Davison as the optimistic surgeon, Nathan Lane as the unorthodox and deliberately comical vision therapist, and Steven Weber as the lascivious fellow architect. It's an incredibly touching love story that I'm telling you, I cannot be satisfied with after just a first sight. I'm going to need at least two more before I could possibly even come close to being too familiar with this genuine little jewel of a motion picture.

It is charming, witty and a lot of fun, and you can tell everybody involved with it had a ball. To be honest, I wasn't sure whether I would like this movie. I thought it would be a vehicle for Julie Andrews like Star! was and little more, and the story at first I wasn't sure about and I can't quite put my finger on why.I am so glad though that I saw it, because it was an absolute hoot and infinitely better than expected. This is so much more than a Julie Andrews vehicle, while it is not her best film it is one of her more enjoyable ones. As for Andrews she is wonderful. Here she does play an atypical role on the surface, looking at Mary Poppins and Sound of Music you would never guess Andrews would play a bloke. But she does play the role with wit and charm, and to be doubly sure she was comfortable she is even given some fun songs to show off her very angelic voice, she is especially impressive in the show-stopper that is Le Jazz Hot with very clever execution of the fiendishly difficult two-octave slide.That's not all. Andrews is supported by an equally impressive cast. James Garner is dashing and immensely likable as the heterosexual troubled by his attraction to Andrews' character. Robert Preston is also outrageously camp but in a good way- Shady Dame from Seville is hilarious-, while Lesley Ann Warren(very funny and very sexy), John Rhys Davies and especially Alex Karras give stellar supporting turns as well.The songs are just great, especially the moving Crazy World. The melodies are memorable and fun and the lyrics are deliciously witty, and I have to say the cast did great justice to those songs not just in the performances but in making them their own too. Just as good is the choreography, which manages to be sprightly and energetic. Blake Edwards also deserves a lot of credit for two things, one is his funny and witty script, the other is his affectionate and tender direction while never being too showy.The production values are top drawer, the sets and scenery are very elegant and pleasing on the eyes, the lighting is never dull and the costumes especially the drag costumes are colourful arrays.

I mean, everybody basically likes either watching or playing pool, since it's such an easy to understand and accessible, international sport, you don't have to train for constantly or think of any complicated tactics, unless you're being a professional of course. But yet pool just doesn't seem like the most likely or most exciting main element for a movie.But the movie is of course also being more than just that. At first sight it really seemed as if this was going to be the story of a pool hustler, who went straight and was going to make it big time into the sport but by the end I started to realize that this movie really wasn't being about that at all. Everything in the story that seemed like a distracting and slowed things done was in essence what the actual movie was being about. It's just basically a random slice of life, about an ordinary person, who is stuck in a situation and lifestyle, that he just can't change, without hurting those who care about him.But the movie still wouldn't had worked out as good, if it weren't for its fine acting performances. It's a movie with an impressive cast-list, of which Paul Newman, George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason especially impressive, with their superior performances. The movie even stars Jake Raging Bull LaMotta in it! But it seriously is also really thanks to its excellent dialog that the actors shine so brightly in this movie.It's a movie that impresses all the more once you are starting to pay more attention to its details. It for instance is a really beautiful shot movie, that features some really great set-ups. It's a movie that is really made for a wide screen. Lotss of times the movie is featuring 3 characters in one shot, of which one is sitting\/standing in the background, the other on in the front and to the right and the last one on the left and even closer to the camera. All are in perfect focus and everyone is doing their own thing and acting out their own thoughts and feelings. Really no wonder that this movie won an Oscar for its (black & white) cinematography.

It's just basically a random slice of life, about an ordinary person, who is stuck in a situation and lifestyle, that he just can't change, without hurting those who care about him.But the movie still wouldn't had worked out as good, if it weren't for its fine acting performances.

It just continues to pile up. It's a complex love story, to say the least, and aside from Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, there's not much of a cast here. It falls short in the supporting cast because they don't have much acting talent, and the cringe-worthy crying scene from Brad Pitt (near the beginning of the film) is something I can't stomach very well. Susannah's stupidity and heartlessness makes me despise her character and storyline, so much so that I can't love this movie.It's a good movie, but it's not great. Because of all the flaws, it's not a great film. But, because of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, we get a decent film with some pretty good acting despite the first crying scene of Pitt. The rest of the movie is a depressing spiral of death. It has a great soundtrack, composed by legendary James Horner and it really gives the final touch of sadness for the film.

I've got a few Cockney pals & I'm fascinated by their accent, slang & wit, but this is not Lock, Stock & Two Smoking, mate. Not even close.I first watched Nil by Mouth several years ago under the erroneous impression Gary Oldman acted in it; I disliked it & soon put it from my mind. Recently though, a friend talked me into seeing it again & I have to concur, it really is an intelligently conceived & superbly crafted film. It's totally & utterly real in every detail, from the mists of rage-blown spit during Ray's outbursts to the ambient pub noise & people talking over one another that semi-obscures the dialog. (English subtitles would have come in handy here.) But the very realism that makes this film so brilliant is what makes it so excruciating to watch.First-rate performances are turned in by Charlie Creed-Miles, whose Billie is so spot-on you never really notice the acting; by the ever-beguiling Steve Sweeney as Billie's geezer mate; & by Laila Morse as the quietly suffering mother of a junkie son & an abused daughter. But all of these are overshadowed by the extraordinary performances of Ray Winstone & Kathy Burke.Nil by Mouth is about family &#x97; & dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe it. Young Billie, who at first seems be shaping as the main character, serves more as a foil for the rest of the family than anything else. He leads the life of a junkie, scamming & scheming, begging & stealing, jones-ing & winding up in one jam after another. Predictable. Ray, on the other hand &#x97; in a tour-de-force portrayal by Ray Winstone &#x97; is so full of brooding violence barely held in check as to be totally unpredictable. We never learn what it is he does for a living, but we can make an educated guess that it's nothing on the up-&-up. The only good times Ray knows center on pubs & lap-dancers & even then he seems on the verge of rage half the time.Kathy Burke, in her quietly understated role as Ray's wife Val, is almost equally brilliant, drawing on hidden strength you never suspected she had after a horrific beating at Ray's hands. Perhaps the most moving scene in the film is when she starts dancing a bit at her grandmother's flat where she's recuperating. She dances clumsily, haltingly &#x97; clearly still in a lot of pain &#x97; but she embraces this life-affirming activity nonetheless, even assuaging the fears & anguish her gram feels for her by drawing her into the dance.Ray's chillingly restrained drug- & alcohol-induced psychopathy as he wakes Val from a sound sleep to interrogate her & his total savagery when he assaults her are outright terrifying. But his utter breakdown afterwards, the staggering lunacy of it, the verbal rehearsal to an empty flat of all his apologies & excuses, the glossing-over, the utter lack of remorse, his besotted attempts to woo her back over a phone he's too drunk to even hold on to... these add up to one of the best acting performances I've ever witnessed. His later revelations about his childhood as he sits drinking with his mate Mark leave you with a tinge of... not sympathy &#x97; you can't muster sympathy for an animal like that &#x97; but perhaps an inkling of insight into the tortured soul that makes him who he is.And this, I think, is the focus of the film, the unbroken chain of binge-drinking & father-to-son brutalization that breeds ever more of the same for all involved. In its realism, the only film I can compare it to is Martin Scorcese's Mean Streets, but Mean Streets never cut this deep.The ending is left open to interpretation. This isn't Hollywood; there never was a plot, nothing's neatly resolved, no comforting closure here. Is this a temporary truce or is it worse, a genuine rapprochement?

Well, despite his premature death he still has quite a lot of fans. With all due respect to the man, I'm not one of them. His best performance remains, for me, his fantastic turn as the man with no nose in the hilarious Dirty Work.Tommy Boy is, believe it or not, a kind of comedy riff on Hamlet. However, Shakespeare lovers may want to stay away from this one. The comedy begins as Tommy (Chris Farley) finally graduates after a ridiculously long time. He heads home to be with his father, big Tom (Brian Dennehy), and also meets his father's new bride (Bo Derek) and a troublemaker introduced as her son (Rob Lowe). All seems good for Tommy, not so good for Richard (David Spade), who has to act as an assistant to the buffoon when big Tom gives him an office and tries to get him learning the ropes of the family business. Richard has his work cut out for him when tragedy strikes and it's up to young Tommy to make sure the business stays solvent.Directed by Peter Segal, and with a decent script full of great barbs from Bonnie and Terry Turner, Tommy Boy could have been something very funny indeed. Instead, it relies too much on Farley's schtick, which can quickly become grating to those of us who aren't fans. His constant cries of son of a . . . and holy schnike! are extremely irritating and it's hard to see how the manic, stupid, childish character that he plays could ever win anyone over, let alone get to spend some quality time with Julie Warner (who plays Michelle, a co-worker and potential love interest). David Spade - now THAT guy is funny. His delivery of insulting one-liners is practically perfect and you understand his growing frustration as things get worse and worse for him. Dennehy is good enough, Bo Derek lends her beauty and Rob Lowe gets some laughs as his character goes through a number of mishaps. There's also an amusing small turn from Dan Aykroyd as Zalinsky, a big competitor who has offered to buy the business.It rattles along at a decent pace, keeps things relatively light and breezy and throws some good songs on the soundtrack (the moments with Farley and Spade singing together as they drive across the country are, I must say, actually pretty damn funny) but the central character just isn't likable enough to carry the whole thing. Dumb can be funny but the sweetness or innocence at the centre has to be played just right or it doesn't work. In Dumb & Dumber, for example, we had the two leads who never once considered how they appeared to others with their childish exuberance and juvenile antics. Here in Tommy Boy we get the occasional moment clumsily shoe-horned in there to show that Tommy has feelings too. It just doesn't work, somehow, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film and fans of Farley can easily add a point or two.

To be exact we are watching Joe Eszterhas's masturbatory fantasies\/wet dream. It's a little awkward. The story is actually interesting, I thought, even though many people only care about the massive amounts of TnA.

Showgirls has been notoriously panned by critics since it's release. In my eyes, all it is is a glossy, big budget exploitation film. It's a porno with a storyline, movie stars, and a purpose.The plot Nomi Malone (Berkley) is hitchhiking in Nevada and after she gets robbed of all her belongings she meets Molly (Ravera). Molly is nice enough to let Nomi live with her for a while till she gets her life on track. With the help of Molly, Nomi gets a job at a sleazy strip club called Cheetah's Topless Club.

If not totally insane, the story is undeniably either ridiculous, ludicrous, hilarious or risible. Perhaps the word I'm looking for is laughable. I'm not saying it isn't entertaining. It is that also.It is an American Western partly written by an Italian director, Sergio Leone, who shot it in Spain. He invented a new cinematic genre, by linking the maniacal overstatement of Italian grand opera with the Spanish picaresque tradition, as he himself has indicated. Picaro is a Spanish word for rogue or rascal, and the picaresque novel is usually satirical, depicting, in realistic and often humorous detail, the adventures of roguish heroes of low social class who live by their wits in a corrupt society. The viewer is asked to believe that two picaros, Clint and Eli, can make good money, if not a steady living, claiming bounty rewards for Eli's sins (which include playing cards with a marked deck), and then having Clint shoot through the rope which is hanging Eli, from some considerable distance. Eli then fortunately stays sitting on his conveniently placed horse which gallops away. Pull the other one; it's got bells on.For a detailed exposition of the plot, and the different putative locations, see the FAQ, which is required reading if some sense is to be made of the narrative, as filmed. This is of little help when actually watching, however.Two of the weirdest scenes occur at the very beginning, and at the very end. The opening starts with one of Leone's trademark facial closeups, of a peculiarly evil-looking individual. A little further on Eli bursts through a window. Difficult to tell why, since he leaves about three gunmen dead on the floor of the room which he has just left. He was apparently in the middle of gnawing his dinner.Some way into the movie we leave Spain, which has been doubling for Mexico, and enter what looks like the Sahara desert. I was expecting at least a camel, or possibly Omar Sharif, to materialize out of the sand. But no, instead we get a driverless coach and six, full of dead and dying soldiers, coming out of nowhere like a bat from hell --- had we wandered into Hammer Films territory? Skip to the end, where our two heroes, Clint and Eli, now find themselves in what has been called a Mexican standoff with evil-eyed Lee van Cleef. Difficult to know why he hadn't been shot a long time earlier, since he didn't appear to have any valuable information about where the buried treasure was, like the other two. Anyway, he sure gets shot now in an amazingly pointless and prolonged three-cornered duel, which takes place in a uniquely circular cemetery, specially designed for the standoff.Leone is fond of scenes where a man is shown to be terrified by suspension from a rope round his neck. This turns up four times in this movie, and once more in his far greater masterpiece, OUATITW. This film (GBU) is much inferior, but you can't say it isn't entertaining. Clint is cool, and the rest of it is comical, and brutal. Look out for Cpl Wallace. Eli takes his gun into his bath with him. Never saw that in a Western before.

Overall, lame and unfunny and makes a waste of a good cast, as far as the movies of 1996 go it is not as abysmal as Ed and Bio Dome but it is among the worst. 1\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"1 April 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Excalibur is like no other film about the Arthurian legend. It makes a concerted attempt to present every aspect of that legend - even the magical and mythic parts of it - as if they were not so much factual as real life. In the same way that Star Wars gave science fiction a veneer of real life dirt and grime, wear and tear, so Excalibur presented the sword in the stone, the lady in the lake and so on, as if one could see such things in their awful magnificence simply by walking to the end of the road, where one would find the beautiful mythic woods one sees in the film.This is a remarkable looking film, and visually does its subject proud. Casting and performances are all good, although Nicol Williamson's Merlin affects a most peculiar accent - a kind of mixture between Gaelic, comedy Jew, and Spike Milligan. The storytelling is occasionally a little too leisurely, and personally I felt that the Grail quest was not a necessary part of the story and could usefully have been omitted.But if you've never seen it, this is definitely one to catch. You won't ever see anything else like it.
