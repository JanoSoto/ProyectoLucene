I saw Chinatown many years ago and so it was an interesting experience to re-visit the old classic. Set in, what appears to be, 1930's Los Angeles during a heat wave, private detective J.J. Gittes makes a living investigating adultery cases.One day, a Mrs Evelyn Mulwray walks into Mr Gittes office and hires him to investigate he husband Hollis. She believes he is having an affair and wants evidence. Gittes and his associates get right on the case. Mr Mulwray is followed as he goes about his work as Chief Engineer of the city's water department. There is a meeting about building a new dam to bring more water to the city that Mulwray is against. He also spends time inspecting dry river beds and finishes up spending most of the night on a beach where a large amount of water is dumped very late in the evening. Eventually he is caught out with a young blonde woman and the evidence, in the form of photographs, is obtained. The following day the story is all over the newspapers and Mr Gittes is confronted by the real Mrs Mulwray and her lawyer. Everybody wants to talk to Mr Mulwray but he seems to have disappeared. He is later found dead in a reservoir with salt water in his lungs. Mr Gittes now has another mystery to solve, one involving corruption the city's water department, Evelyn Mulwray and her rich father, Noah Cross.This is a classic movie, no special effects or fancy techniques, just the skill of the director and the art of the actors to convey the story. It's the little things I noticed that made this film a stand out for me, the setting of pocket watches to find out what time Mr Mulwray left the beach or the smashing of a tail-light to make a car easier to follow at night. Great performances from all of the main cast, special mentions go to the immense Jack Nicholson as J.J.Gittes, the fabulous Faye Dunaway as Evelyn Mulwray and the great John Huston as Noah Cross.It's a very slow paced film that, for me, got a little bit too pedestrian towards the middle. The storytelling was spot on and the cinematography and dialogue were great. Over all it's a really compelling detective story with quite a few twists and turns in it. There's quite a different ending that you may not expect. It may have scored higher if it hadn't fallen a bit flat in the middle, but it's most definitely recommended.My score 8.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Having recently watched Mr Polanski's The Ghost Writer (2010), I decided to look back at one of his earlier works.

Today many of us look at horror movies from that decade as cheesy, over analyzing technical elements, the acting, and the plot. Most of us still over analyze films to this day, but keep in mind that this is only a movie, whose main purpose is to entertain its audience. Which I believe Wes Craven's film achieves its purpose.The film overall was great with a clever concept and a simple, but eerie storyline. I had no problem with the acting in this film, or the dialogue which to me came across as passable to very believable.I felt that John Saxon (Lt. Thompson), Heather Langenkamp (Nancy Thompson), Amanda Wyss (Tina Gray), and Johnny Depp (Glen Lantz)all delivered solid and convincing performances. Jsu Garcia (Rod Lane) delivered a mediocre to a little above mediocre performance in my opinion, lacking emotional depth and intensity in some scenes. Although with all due respect to Jsu Garcia, he didn't have a lot of scene time to develop his character and make him more three dimensional. Ronee Blakley (Marge Thompson) was convincing in her role as the over protective and overbearing, alcoholic, smoke inducing mother who made me chuckle a couple of times. The rest of the supporting cast does a good job with what they are given.As far as special effects and stunts go, sure there are a few goof ups where you can clearly notice what isn't meant to be noticed by viewers, but to me the effect is still there.I thought the climax was great and escalated nicely from the beginning of the film right up until the end. My only complaint with this film is the final scene of this film, which is entirely left ambiguous, only for sequels to try and explain what happened after.Unfortunately Wes Craven's original ending was scrapped because it wasn't deemed fit for the film. The original ending would also have made it hard for a sequel to come into play...even though Wes Craven had a concept for a sequel which was rejected and was later used for the storyline of Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Although the ending might have been a huge let down for some audience members, as the director would have chosen the it was all just a dream technique, to me it would have been far more superior and would have been looked at as more than just a horror movie. Mainly because the concept of someone creating a monster in their own dream is clever, and the idea that she has to conquer the monster that she created in order for her to wake up from her dream is also an interesting concept. Also, having the car simply driving away with the children skipping to the jump rope song would have been highly effective, because it would have been more of a statement stating that although you may have overcome this bad dream, it is only a matter of time before you have your next nightmare, and that you will never be able to actually get rid of bad dreams. To me this is a lot creepier then the ending they decided to go with.On another note Nancy's final dialogue with Freddy makes no sense to the scene that follows, which is why it is entirely left up to the audience to decide whether it is just another one of Nancy's dreams, or her mother's dream. Either way the film finished on a weaker note because of it.Even though the ending is entirely ambiguous, and somewhat confusing, I feel that if they had gone with the original ending people would still have been scratching their heads as Nancy would have had so many dream within a dream sequences. Therefore in the end result it doesn't really matter because someone will still be scratching their head by the end credits.Overall Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street is a great horror movie that should be regarded as mindless entertainment, sure to haunt your memories and give you nightmares for years to come. But if not the film itself, the music score will be sure get under your skin.****1\/2 Stars Out Of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street is undoubtedly a classic for the horror genre that will haunt the minds of its audience members for a long time.Although it may not haunt the minds of many viewers today, back in 1984 this movie scared a lot of its viewing audience.

However, following a firefight with a guerrilla base, it becomes clear that some unseen and very nasty presence is stalking them. Can they survive this mysterious threat ?If there was an award for most ripped-off short story, Richard Connell's 1924 classic The Most Dangerous Game \/ The Hounds Of Zaroff would be near the top of my list. To give you an idea, not only was this not the only 1987 movie of it, it wasn't even the only 1987 sci-fi variation of it (the other being the cheekily good fun Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity). The idea of human prey lends itself so well to so many different genres that it's constantly reused either as the whole story (Run For The Sun, Surviving The Game) or major subplots within it (High Noon, First Blood, just about any serial killer \/ slasher film you can name). This big-budget version, by brothers Jim and John Thomas, turns the big game hunter into an alien who collects human skulls and wants Big Arnie's for his trophy room. Talented director McTiernan serves up a solid action-packed thriller as the grunts struggle through the three stages of the story - dawning realisation of their predicament, increasing panic as the scary monster starts taking them down, and retaliatory resolve to outsmart and outmanoeuvre it. There's also a nice little allegory going on here; the better-equipped marines cheerfully blow the hell out of the rebel hideout with mortars, grenades and a minigun and then congratulate each other, only to subsequently come a cropper against the Predator's invisibility suit, thermal imaging sensors and space-age laser rifle. McTiernan carefully keeps the tension racked and makes expert use of the dense Mexican jungle locations, turning the movie into a violent game of hide-and-seek - the whole story can be summed up by Duke's throwaway line, I see you ... . Alan Silvestri's larger-than-life score pumps away at you all the time and the monster is terrific; the Greenberg Brothers' chameleon visual effects, Stan Winston's lizard suit and some rather nifty sound effects all combining to create a supercool creature. The movie has a big weak point for me though, and that's the performances \/ characters, all of whom are paid-up members of the Macho Man Society; you know a film hasn't quite worked when you're rooting for a psychotic reptile from outer space. Arnie is okay, Carrillo has one interesting speech and Duke gets some good moments but that's about it - the best performance is the physical one by the late Hall as the monster. Still, a lot of fun though - just don't think about it too much. Followed by a direct sequel in 1990, then a couple of franchise films later on (the AVP series). For a better Schwarzenegger \/ McTiernan collaboration, check out their much-maligned amazing \/ funny 1993 flick Last Action Hero (scripted by Shane Black, who here plays the doomed grunt with the bad jokes).

Talented director McTiernan serves up a solid action-packed thriller as the grunts struggle through the three stages of the story - dawning realisation of their predicament, increasing panic as the scary monster starts taking them down, and retaliatory resolve to outsmart and outmanoeuvre it. There's also a nice little allegory going on here; the better-equipped marines cheerfully blow the hell out of the rebel hideout with mortars, grenades and a minigun and then congratulate each other, only to subsequently come a cropper against the Predator's invisibility suit, thermal imaging sensors and space-age laser rifle. McTiernan carefully keeps the tension racked and makes expert use of the dense Mexican jungle locations, turning the movie into a violent game of hide-and-seek - the whole story can be summed up by Duke's throwaway line, I see you ... . Alan Silvestri's larger-than-life score pumps away at you all the time and the monster is terrific; the Greenberg Brothers' chameleon visual effects, Stan Winston's lizard suit and some rather nifty sound effects all combining to create a supercool creature. The movie has a big weak point for me though, and that's the performances \/ characters, all of whom are paid-up members of the Macho Man Society; you know a film hasn't quite worked when you're rooting for a psychotic reptile from outer space. Arnie is okay, Carrillo has one interesting speech and Duke gets some good moments but that's about it - the best performance is the physical one by the late Hall as the monster. Still, a lot of fun though - just don't think about it too much. Followed by a direct sequel in 1990, then a couple of franchise films later on (the AVP series). For a better Schwarzenegger \/ McTiernan collaboration, check out their much-maligned amazing \/ funny 1993 flick Last Action Hero (scripted by Shane Black, who here plays the doomed grunt with the bad jokes).

However, following a firefight with a guerrilla base, it becomes clear that some unseen and very nasty presence is stalking them. Can they survive this mysterious threat ?If there was an award for most ripped-off short story, Richard Connell's 1924 classic The Most Dangerous Game \/ The Hounds Of Zaroff would be near the top of my list. To give you an idea, not only was this not the only 1987 movie of it, it wasn't even the only 1987 sci-fi variation of it (the other being the cheekily good fun Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity).

At over two hours long it didn't feel slow at all, in fact it moves along at a great pace & there's plenty of action & incident.The story isn't the only area where Waterworld is a Mad Max 2 rip-off as the costumes & rusty beat up look of the production design are very similar in appearance & tone. The action scenes offer plenty of bang for your money with huge explosions & some great stunts & there's even an underwater city scene although why the Mariner would have a home made diving bell since he can breathe underwater is another question.

There are 2 great premises here that are almost completely unrelated that are just squashed together into 1 not-so-good film. We have the hilarious slapstick comedy of covering up the death of an elderly babysitter, and a woman trying to find a way to save the company she works for (which is a movie that I personally wouldn't have cared for, but probably would've made a great chick flick), both of which could've easily carried themselves over an hour and a half each.Instead, all we get is a half-hour of comedy and an hour of boring Yuppie-ville Corporate America, with the plot of the first half-hour poking it's head every so often, mercilessly trying to remind us that we're supposed to be watching a comedy. But just as quickly as those every-so-often's come up, they disappear back into the void.And they should've done away with the 'no money, gotta get a job' plot device, as that was pretty much what killed the rest of this film. They could've developed a lot more comedy just out of them say... having a party and trashing the house, or relatives come looking for the babysitter, or mother comes home early, or from the fact that they should've just called an ambulance in the first place seeing as how the babysitter really did die of natural causes and they wouldn't have been in any trouble anyway, or any number of possible plot devices that could've been so much funnier than Christina Applegate parading around in Yuppie-land. And as for that part of the film being it's own movie, this section has a lot more detail than the first half. Just add a bit more character development to the supporting cast, and bam, you got that film.The acting is overall fairly decent though. Christina Applegate is definitely convincing as both the valley girl and the yuppie. Keith Coogan as Kenny and the hilarious pranks that him and his gang pull are sadly underused in my opinion, although his transformation from stoner slacker to Julia Child-obsessed chef throughout the film is one of the best parts of the film. Josh Charles (whom everybody would remember as anchor Dan Rydell from the show Sports Night) as the boyfriend Bryan does a fairly decent job here as well. Eda Reiss Merin as the elderly babysitter had me scared stiff. The actress also was sadly underused before the character's untimely death. I mean, come on. The title of the movie is based on this character. Had that been it's own movie (forsaking the Corporate America bit, as I suggested earlier), they could've developed the character a lot more. Maybe have her dole out some worse embarrassments and harsher punishments to the children before her death.Most of the actors in the latter part of the film were pretty stiff. The actress who played Carolyn should've been replaced, as it seemed that she read her lines like a wannabe actress in a poorly written commercial. I was however surprised to see David Duchovny (long before his triumphs on The X-Files & Californication) with the worst hair cut the 80's had to offer, and stiff as a board in the acting department.So basically that's it. 2 good premises, but one overall lousy film.

There are 2 great premises here that are almost completely unrelated that are just squashed together into 1 not-so-good film. We have the hilarious slapstick comedy of covering up the death of an elderly babysitter, and a woman trying to find a way to save the company she works for (which is a movie that I personally wouldn't have cared for, but probably would've made a great chick flick), both of which could've easily carried themselves over an hour and a half each.Instead, all we get is a half-hour of comedy and an hour of boring Yuppie-ville Corporate America, with the plot of the first half-hour poking it's head every so often, mercilessly trying to remind us that we're supposed to be watching a comedy. But just as quickly as those every-so-often's come up, they disappear back into the void.And they should've done away with the 'no money, gotta get a job' plot device, as that was pretty much what killed the rest of this film. They could've developed a lot more comedy just out of them say... having a party and trashing the house, or relatives come looking for the babysitter, or mother comes home early, or from the fact that they should've just called an ambulance in the first place seeing as how the babysitter really did die of natural causes and they wouldn't have been in any trouble anyway, or any number of possible plot devices that could've been so much funnier than Christina Applegate parading around in Yuppie-land. And as for that part of the film being it's own movie, this section has a lot more detail than the first half. Just add a bit more character development to the supporting cast, and bam, you got that film.The acting is overall fairly decent though.

But owing to the fact that they could not acquire the rights to the infamous and iconic novel, they changed certain details, including the names of the characters and the setting, and the result was a movie that turned out to be different from the novel in certain elements, but nevertheless retained the its soul. Nosferatu was made by F.W. Murnau, one of the greatest directors of the silent era. With this movie, he flaunts his skills in terrorizing his audience with the atmospheric build-up of tension. The film is an archetypical horror falling under the umbrella of German Expressionism, finding its route in the iconic 'Dr. Caligari's Cabinet.' Some scholars contend that the film is an expression of the jarring experience of World War I, which took a toll on the people of Germany. Modern audiences may not find the movie very exciting or 'scary,' being desensitized by the gore and the violence of contemporary horrors and slasher films. However, Nosferatu does not rely on gore or shock to begin with; its horror is derived from the aforementioned atmospheric build-up of tension. Throughout the film, there is a foreboding sense of doom and lingering chaos that finally erupts in the climax. This film reminds me of Roman Polanski's classic horror film 'Rosemary's Baby' because of its portrayal of horror through psychological rather than visual means. That's not to say that Count Orlok (the counterpart to Bam Stroker's Count Dracula) isn't scary looking. In closing, I would like to say this don't watch this movie if you are looking to get thrilled, because you are more likely to come out underwhelmed. However, if you like classic silent movies, or are interested in exploring the roots of psychological horror, this is a movie you should definitely not want to miss.

So, when a former student (Matt Dillon) wins an Oscar for portraying a gay soldier and makes his speech, he thanks his teacher for being a positive influence and outs him, thinking from outward appearances that he's gay. The only problem is that Kevin isn't gay, or so Kevin thinks. He's engaged to Joan Cusack. Such is the premise of this so-called comedy. (There's a lot of Kevin's character that I'm not going into, with all that is implied about his history and his present supposed wedding.) I say so-called because it's not very funny (I mean, it is funny, but not VERY funny), despite the presence of some great talent with the likes of Kevin and Joan with Debbie Reynolds, Bob Newhart and Tom Selleck. I would guess it's probably the most popular or mainstream film made in the 80s and 90s that centers on homosexuality, and that's probably because of its lame approach to a different lifestyle. It's not a bad film, but I can see how some of both heterosexuals and homosexuals would be put off and\/or offended by its treatment of the subject matter. Especially, in the manner of how several people at the end come out. It seems to take lightly a very delicate subject.Having gone politically correct and addressed the awkwardness of it, I will now point the positives of it, which is Cusack, Cusack, and Cusack! She received a deserved Oscar nomination for her work here; she's practically the whole show. In fact, she does steal the film away from Kevin and turns out to be the most real thing about the whole movie. The film's charm relies on Joan and its cute feel to captivate the viewers. Joan does, but the film, while it seems relatively innocuous at the time, leaves the viewer cold and feeling a little manipulated.But, of course, it's up to you. Can all enjoy this film?

I thought about poor Shirley MacLaine who tried to commit suicide and eventually found love with Jack Lemmon, but both faced an uncertain future albeit with each other.Shirley and the other of MacMurray's victims should have seen this film and taken a lesson from Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton who start as strangers and end up as allies and who find a way to get even with Dabney Coleman for using and abusing his employees.All three women are different, different in real life and playing different types of characters in the film and at the beginning not really liking each other because they don't know each other. Tomlin is the efficient office manger who makes Coleman look good because he takes credit for her work. Fonda is a new employee who had to go back to work because her husband left her. And the beautiful and curvaceous Parton is Coleman's secretary who Coleman is trying to jump her form and the folks in the office think he already has.But eventually these women make common cause and what they do to Coleman is an inspiration to working women everywhere.As good as these women are the film would go nowhere without Dabney Coleman who makes a specialty of playing men you love to hate whether in comedy or drama.

It is the magnum opus of one of the great auteurs of world cinema, Federico Fellini. Fellini is one of those film-makers whose artistic vision is breath-taking and awe-inspiring, and in this film, that very fact shines all the way through. Almost every shot in the film is like a work of art. Despite all the greatness oozing out of the film, truth be told, I do not enjoy watching 8 ½ at all, even though I am fully aware of, and appreciate, its greatness.Another very revered film-maker who is often compared to Fellini because of his deep artistic vision is Ingmar Bergman. Personally, I can relate to a Bergman film with much more ease, and to me, Bergman is much more poignant and touching. However, as a craftsman, Fellini, I believe, is superior to almost any filmmaker who has ever made a movie. The problem, however, is that I am unable to relate to Fellini's films. In 8 ½, for example, there isn't a single character that I can relate to, or sympathize with, in any way, shape, or form. I guess appreciating a movie like 8 ½ requires a level of maturity that only comes with age, and so, I don't see myself liking this movie any time soon. However, as a student of film, especially film craftsmanship, this movie is the bible. There are some unforgettable moments in the film, like the beginning claustrophobia scene, or the majestic harem scene, or especially the brilliant, almost surrealistic, ending sequence. The score of Nino Rota reminds you of circus-music, and makes a poignant statement life, after all, is a circus. I cannot decide what score to award this movie, so I am going to refrain from doing that at all. My last advice watch it for intellectual stimulation rather than entertainment.

It is a story of human despair and loneliness told with a good measure of comedy; as such, it can be seen as a spin-off of the black comedy, which usually deals with more morbid issues such as death. Although Chungking Express dwells on human despair, there is always a lingering feeling of hopefulness. When you see a down-trodden person, there are three ways to go about you could either walk past the person with an air of apathy, you could kick him while he is down, or you could wrap your arms around him and hoist him up; this film is the kind of film that sympathizes with the characters and attempt to hoist them up. It shows the audience that sadness and desolation are natural parts of life, but what one must always strive to do is look forward with optimism.The direction of the movie is excellent. The camera works in such a way that it feels as though you, an audience member, is right in on the action, standing beside the characters as an observer; as such, the movie has a deep, subjective feel to it. The movie is jarring at times, but that adds to that subjective experience. There are various points where the movie jumps ahead in timeline in very quick succession, giving the audience the feeling of the fleeting nature of time. The movie does not spoon-feed you, rather, it asks you to think and to feel. The acting feels very natural, almost improvisational, and it is required for a movie such as this. Wong Kar Wai, one of the auteurs of world cinema, has made many great movies since, but to this day, Chungking Express stands out as his best, and one of the best movies, in my opinion, of all time.
