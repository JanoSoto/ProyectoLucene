First, there's the acting. Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, and Isabella Rossellini are outstanding, as always.  But it's Meryl Streep's unforgettable, deliciously evil performance as a vain, aging actress that really stands out.  She has many wonderful moments (so many, in fact, that I can't list or choose them--you'll have to see the film to understand) So what if she's been nominated for an Oscar 12 times all ready?  She deserved a nod for this role too.  She brought so many subtleties to her role that no other actress would have thought of and created, in my opinion, one of the greatest screen *itches since Bette Davis' Margot Channing in All About Eve.  Second is the almost flawless direction of Robert Zemeckis.  His vision turned what could have been a ridiculous, mudane comedy, into an intelligently executed satire full of unforgettable images.  Third, is the script.  This has got to be one of the most original stories brought to the screen in years.  Some of the dialogue is cheesy, and I'm sure it looked horrid on paper, but the stars' razor-sharp wit and timing and Zemeckis' style  compensate for that entirely. Fourth, is the special effects which garnered the film an Oscar--'nuff said.  All of these elements, combined with Alan Silvestri's cynical underscoring, make this film a rare and brilliant treat.  Yeah, it's silly--but it's supposed to be!!! It's only the films that aren't meant to be silly that come off as crap when they appear absurd.  Almost no one will agree with what I'm about to say, but I think this film will eventually find it's way into the Classics section of video stores.  Hey, when Bringing Up Baby came out in 1938, it was considered trash--now it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time.

Neve Campbell got incredibly lucky with Scream so you can't really say she has Hollywood figured out yet and Bette Midler is a miracle, she really is.

If I didn't know that she acts on screen, I would say that she is like this in real life, a miserable bitch that tries to belittle everyone else, but hey, those are just the characters that she plays... aren't they?  And as for Casey Affleck and William Finchter, well they are still wet behind the ears when it comes to the game, so we can forgive them for being in trash like this.Drowning Mona starts off with Bette Midler getting into a car and driving over the edge of a cliff into the lake.  We then meet the usual suspects and we are left to make our minds up as to who killed Mona Dearly.  We then meet Mona through a series of flashbacks and we realize that she is the nastiest woman on the face of this planet.  She is mean because she is mean, maybe she is mad at being born, I'm not sure but she is always bitter.  So seeing her dead is not that big of a deal and if the film would have ended right there after we find out how much of a bitch she was, then I would have felt better than I did at the conclusion of the film.So now we meet her husband, her idiot son, the town slut, the town police chief, his daughter and her fiancee, the butch female mechanic, the three stupid small town deputees, a bar tender and two sex craved part time characters and a guy that fishes.  You then put all of them into situations that don't make any sense what so ever, and no one really cares about.  You have wheel of fortune sex fetishes, dead dogs that are run over with the lawn mower, a hand that is missing because of stupidity, a town that all drives Yugos and a slew of other ridiculous and ( here's the capper ) unfunny elements that don't add up to anything.  There are elements of this in the Coen's world like in Fargo and Raising Arizona, but they are at least funny to compliment the bizaare.  There is really nothing funny about this film.

But instead of having us understand this woman by at least writing a good scene with her, we get a scene that looks like it was written by someone in grade 7 drama class, and that is not cynicism ( which I've been accused of from time to time ) that is the honest truth.  I was embarassed to see how it went down.  And to see how it all folds out, how the film ends, is a travesty.  There are so many things to complain about in this film, but I am going to stop there.

All revel in telling culturally specific stories that reflect universal human experiences that are resonant across all time and place. But as I sat there, freshest on my mind was David Lynch's `The Straight Story.' Both Lynch and Zhang take us on a small journey that reflects a world's worth of living. Both show us that harrowing experience and heroism, seemingly small scale in their films, can be writ in large and commanding script across the lives of ordinary people.Shi Xiangsheng's script is a rural fable based on his own story set in remote China, Hebei - the dry high plains, an undoubtedly stiffening existence. It's shot as beautifully as any of Zhang's films - he's a deft colorist, one of the great painterly directors in cinema (see `Ju Dou' and `Raise the Red Lantern'). The children are crimson-cheeked with complexions warmed and toasted by the unfiltered sun - but they will surely, eventually become worn and parched like their elders, Teacher Gao and Mayor Tian. We see an honest poverty here in great detail. The film's camerawork lets every detail seep into us, allowing us to feel the film's atmospherics and making us thirst in its arid heat and dust. (When the 26 children share 2 cans of warm Coca Cola after a long and hard day, we, too, want to get in line for our sip.)Thirteen-year-old Wei Minxhi is dragged along by Mayor Tian to the village' s ramshackle one-room schoolhouse to meet Teacher Gao. She is to become the school's substitute teacher for one month while Gao leaves to tend to his ailing mother. He can't in good conscience leave this child to shepherd his children but he is without a choice - it's the kind of hard rationalism that is part of everyday life here. Before leaving, he counsels her sternly and provisions her with only a ragged lesson book and one stick (and only one stick) of chalk for every day he will be gone. He shows her the narrow bed in the adjoining room that she will share with 3 boarding students.Teacher Gao is an old man who has suffered a lot of dedicated and dictated poverty in order to improve the lot of his village's children. We come to know his commitment to his work even at this stage of his life when he warns her that conditions are hard in this village and that the vicissitudes of life weigh very heavily on the children here. When he says he has already lost 10 students you know he has felt the loss of every single one. He commands her to keep the body of his school together and that when he returns, he wants to see every one of his students present - and not one less.`Not One Less' is about young Teacher Wei's struggle to meet his simple challenge. We see immediately that she has more reluctance than skill or gumption for this task. But in a culture that expects obedience, she has no recourse. And nowhere else to go. She is more like a sullen older sister than a teacher. And because they are children, the students begin to test her a little. They aren't bratty kids, just rambunctious and resistant to the discipline of schoolwork. She hasn't a clue about how to make them work, so she just writes the lesson on the board and posts herself against the door, barring any escape. Her handwriting is neat and orderly but as the film progresses, we come to see that Teacher Wei is only a little more schooled than her charges.The great thing about `Not One Less' is its unstinting perspective on the innocence and naiveté that only a child lives in. Teacher Wei and these children are completely guileless, without a window on the wide world, and have none of the knowledge or calculation for the simplest complexities of modern life. The film's crisis is that the class troublemaker, eleven-year-old bumpkin Zhang Huike, leaves unannounced for the city so he can earn money for his destitute family. Wei feels the absolute fear of her failure to keep her pledge and is desperate to go and find young Zhang. Figuring out how to get to the city to find him - for her and these children, it might as well be a search for the Holy Grail. It seems as fraught with myth and legend. Yet she, in her naiveté, is undaunted. Many schemes are attempted and when each fails, she just begins walking, having no idea how far it is or how long it will take her or what lies ahead when she gets there. She just knows she must find him.Her journey is the quest of her young life just as Alvin Straight's is the culminating quest of his life. It is a defining act for both. There are no earth-shattering twists of plot to keep from you. It is the unfolding of a redemptive story, a boldly honest portrait of a world away from our experience and a young girl's attempt to navigate it with all her will and perseverance and naiveté - and only that - to sustain her. In the end, we feel we have been somewhere we've never been before and, perhaps, learned something that we had long forgotten. It is the singular power of cinema to transport us this way, to jack us directly into a net of experience we can feel so deeply in our hearts.

All revel in telling culturally specific stories that reflect universal human experiences that are resonant across all time and place. But as I sat there, freshest on my mind was David Lynch's `The Straight Story.' Both Lynch and Zhang take us on a small journey that reflects a world's worth of living. Both show us that harrowing experience and heroism, seemingly small scale in their films, can be writ in large and commanding script across the lives of ordinary people.Shi Xiangsheng's script is a rural fable based on his own story set in remote China, Hebei - the dry high plains, an undoubtedly stiffening existence. It's shot as beautifully as any of Zhang's films - he's a deft colorist, one of the great painterly directors in cinema (see `Ju Dou' and `Raise the Red Lantern').

The slow walk up to the bartender to give him a richly deserved smack in the jaw...the rigid, almost military walk he makes to the townpeople who all abandon him (even his new bride does that; a shot in the back doesn't take out the earlier sting of the initial rejection to me)...the final look of contempt on his face just before he tosses the tin star that an hour and a half before the people he just saved wanted him to give up to avoid trouble.Considering how ungrateful and cowardly these people are, why did he do it? Because when push comes to shove, like a lot of other men before and after him, Marshall Will Kane just can't do anything else. It goes against their grain to just bow their heads for the executioner's sword or run from an enemy, no matter how bad the odds.

So when I went to the cinema today I didn't expect much even though I really like Lasse Hallström's films; especially Mitt liv som hund\/My Life as a Dog. There's something very special about Hallström's tone and mode and even though The Cider House Rules is more Hollywood than his earlier films (only natural since most of his films are Swedish) I still felt what I usually feel when watching a Hallström film quietly entertained, if you see what I mean.Michael Caine was brilliant, I hope he wins the Academy Award this year.
