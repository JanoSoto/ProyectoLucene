Rumors are circulating that the school is the secret coven of the great witch Helena Markos. As girls from the school die off violently one by one, this rumor seems more and more plausible.Although only one Argento film is listed in the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films (Deep Red), Suspiria is the one widely considered his classic. After seeing it, I'm not the least surprised (until now, I was only familiar with his new material -- Jennifer and Pelts). The rich colors of this film, the surreality of it and the moving soundtrack (with a theme more haunting than even Jaws). While the film is now dated, anyone who doesn't mind a film with lower picture quality should enjoy this movie.The tagline reads, The Only Thing More Terrifying Than The Last 12 Minutes Of This Film Are The First 92. I'm not really sure what that's supposed to mean -- they are implying the end is boring compared to the rest of the film? Actually, the whole movie is quite good. Some parts are slower, and there is a lot of character development, but this is by no means a bad thing. When the murders happen, they really happen -- with the first girl being dragged through a window, stabbed repeatedly, and then hung after she was already quite dead.Udo Kier makes a cameo here, though his part is much smaller than I would have liked (I barely was able to see his dazzling blue eyes). The lead actress (Jessica Harper, I think her name is) was amazing, but everyone else was just ordinary. Yet, this worked well... I wasn't distracted by stars and really got into the film itself.Seeing a Dario Argento film is especially pleasant after recently watching Lucio Fulci's City of the Living Dead. With all due respect to Fulci, the Italian horror master is Argento. Fulci drags, his film quality is atrocious, and although he loves gore as much as anyone, doesn't deliver the way Argento does. I really look forward to watching Argento's Inferno in the near future.I am recommending this film. You have gore, a good plot, a great soundtrack... and it's a classic you really ought to be familiar with if you're a horror fan. If you enjoyed Lucky McGee's recent film The Woods, I think you'll enjoy this. The movies are very different but have some similar central plot themes. I love both films quite a little bit, though in a different way. Pick this one up.

First, it was quite frank about sexuality, babies and their excreta, hints of barely-sublimated father-daughter incest, and nursing mothers for 1962, when the infamous Code still governed what could and couldn't be said about the human body in a mainstream commercial Hollywood film.But these things occur only in passing. What is also noteworthy is the performances, marvelous universally, but especially by Jack Lemmon. Previously he had been a comedic actor, or a somewhat buffoonish one in a serious film (The Apartment). Here he plays Joe Clay, aspiring PR man on his way down due to booze, but still loving his wife and child and looking to stay sober, if only for them. And then there's Jack Klugman the gravel-voiced character actor is most familiar to us as Felix Unger's slob of a roommate in the '70s sitcom The Odd Couple, or perhaps as a forensic medical examiner in Quincy. Here he has to play the part of an A.A. sponsor, who could have been all starch and humorlessness. But his Jim Hungerford is a three-dimensional character, a recovering alcoholic himself with rough edges, who confronts Joe Clay with the deadly abyss he's rushing toward without either sugar-coating or moralizing.The film is also remarkable for its concluding scene. We are given no easy resolution, no guarantee of permanent happiness for Joe and Kirsten, whom we've come to care about and who clearly deeply love each other. I defy anyone to be unmoved by the final encounter between the spouses.Many have mentioned The Lost Weekend, certainly a notable film for its time (1945), but I believe the strongest movie about the effects of addiction on interpersonal relationships, aside from Days of Wine and Roses, is The Panic In Needle Park (1971) about two NY heroin addicts who at several points must choose between their love for one another and their love for smack.

I had first read about the legendary Titanic when I was about 10 years old, but I had no idea just how horrible the real disaster has been until reading Walter Lord's 'A Night to Remember' and seeing the 1959 B & W movie based on that book. When Dr. Robert Ballard found the Titanic's resting place in 1985 the world's interest was re-opened in the story, and Cameron's massive undertaking to retell the story of that fatal night in April 1912 was a success on any scale.I was mostly interested in the historical aspects of the story, and was not disappointed. Cameron's research into the ship's design, the passenger list (especially 1st-class), the costumes, right down to the last detail on the 1st-class china, is minute. It was SO close to the historical accuracy as detailed by Walter Lord (and later by Robert Ballard) that one could have easily believed they were actually there.Cameron's use of a love story featuring people at opposite ends of the spectrum (Rose, the dignified 1st-class girl and Jack, the impoverished steerage passenger) makes for an interesting element in the story. Though the story focused largely on their own experiences I don't think it detracted from the movie's historical accuracy. We often see Rose & Cal Hockley interacting with such real-life passengers as J.J. Astor, Ben Guggenheim, Molly Brown & the Countess of Rothes. It also focused well on Jack's experiences in steerage which were probably similar to those of many steerage-class passengers, who often found themselves trapped below decks in a ship that was rapidly filling with water.Some of the more interesting historical elements were cut & later released on the deluxe DVD edition; one shows Capt. Smith calling for the boats to standby close to the ship and Q.M. Hitchens (in Molly Brown's boat) ignoring the order. Also missing was the well-known scene of Macy's Department Store owners Isidor & Ida Strauss, which showed Mrs. Strauss insisting on remaining with her husband right until the end. (They are seen while 'Nearer My God to Thee' is playing, in their cabin as water rushes in on the floor.) Another missing scene which was understandably cut showed little Cora Caldwell (Jack's dance partner in steerage) and her family trapped by a locked gate with water rising behind them.Jack's ultimate fate was that of most steerage passengers; he died of hypothermia well before the arrival of the only rescue ship. Rose only survived because she managed to improvise a life raft on a floating piece of the Grand Staircase. She could have become one more of the small number of 1st-class women & children who did not survive (the only others were Mrs. Strauss, Mrs. H.J. Allison and her little daughter, Lorraine).Depending on how one wants to see it, this movie is either a grand love story against a backdrop of imminent doom, or a historically accurate movie with a love story as the background. Either way, Jim Cameron's masterpiece will long stand as one of movie history's greatest achievements. It could have been a colossal flop, but because so much planning had gone into it to make it as historically accurate as well as creating a story people would want to follow, it has succeeded beyond even Cameron's expectations.

It's not boring at all, yet it just sits there, neutral to me.David Caruso doesn't stand out at all, but the absolutely stunningly beautiful Linda Fiorentino, who gave the performance of a lifetime in The Last Seduction, gives a different but still very secretive and naturally elusive character. I like her character because she's seen objectively by the writer, the way her type of personality is always seen. Rarely does anyone truly come to know someone like her. Fiorentino very deeply projects her very inward character. Chazz Palminteri matches her as a very extroverted fireball of cockiness. This is all well and good, but they are carrying a movie smaller than them.One of Friedkin's car chases is a panicky ride down the hill of a San Francisco street in a car with a severed brake line. This falls short of any action sequence Friedkin has ever done in the twenty years he'd been working before this film. It's filmed wrong. It's not exciting the way it should be. The second car chase of the film, wherein Caruso is desperately tailing a mysterious and murderous black car, is a very stressful little set piece, and keeps the audience's attention better than it was before.You see, I think where the problem lies is in the writing. Joe Eszterhas's Jade is a mystery about a brutal murder, blackmail of a threatening senator, a circle of long-time friendship between the cop, a lawyer, and the lawyer's wife, a Japanese symbol, and how everyone has more to hide. Where does everything really tie in? Yes, the story leaves no real loose ends, but why doesn't it feel like it's come together tightly? Jade has no true focus on any of the themes just listed.

According to one of the extras on this DVD, King thought of the basic outline of the story as he was carrying his son, who he had successfully stopped from running into traffic, back toward his home.This story is, quite literally, about death itself; the conflict between Louis (Dale Midkiff) and Rachel (Denise Crosby) over what, if anything their young daughter (Blaze\/Beau Bernthal) should be told about death; the ACTUAL death of the family cat, followed shortly by the son (adorable and born actor Miko Hughes). The question If you knew of a way to bring back the pets\/people you loved and lost, would you do it? For Louis, the answer, tragically it turns out, is YES. Early on in the film, his is cajoled into promising his daughter that nothing will happen to their cat, Church, although he knows the futility of promising her that nothing will happen to anyone, as this is ultimately beyond his or any human being's control. When the cat does indeed die by being run over by a truck, his is guided by Jud Crandall (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) to the Micmac burial ground, a place where dead animals - or people - who are buried will come back. Although the film makes no reference to this, the book mentions the wendigo, a spirit in Native American folklore that can possess a human and turn them into a cannibal - the implication being that perhaps it is a wendigo that is reanimating the bodies of people and animals that return after being buried on this ground. In any case, what comes back ain't the same, and it ain't pretty. In the case of Church, it doesn't seem to be THAT big of a deal; the kitty seems moodier, hisses a lot and, in one EEEEWWW scene, tosses the remains of a nicely mutilated mouse into the tub while Louis is in it. Yucky, but the cat isn't going to kill anyone. Meanwhile, Rachel has explained her hang-up about death to Louis, telling him the unpleasant story of her sister Zelda, who died of spinal meningitis - while a very young Rachel had been left alone with her. Rachel is quite literally haunted by her sister; haunted by guilt over having wished by the end that her sister would just die and end her own and everyone else's suffering. She admits to being frightened as a child that she would be accused of murdering her sister by people who knew her every thought and feeling. Scary stuff.But then, adorable toddler Gage is killed when he runs after his kite toward traffic, and his father is NOT able to stop him in time. There ensues, of course, deep grief, and a nasty fight between father-and-son-in-law, between whom there was never any love lost before Gage's death, at the funeral service. This scuffle, in film and book, leads to the little coffin being knocked down and, momentarily, jarred open, giving us a heartbreaking glimpse of a small boy's hand and funeral suit cuff.Shortly after the tragedy, Rachel and Ellie go to stay with Rachel's parents for a time, leaving Louis at home by himself (see where this is going?). Louis, perhaps inevitably, does bury his little son in the forbidden burial ground, and the results are far more horrific than before. Gage comes back, a killer still packaged in the body of a sweet little boy. His first victim, in one of the most genuinely frightening scenes, is old Jud (the shot of the knife slicing his heel is truly cringe-worthy). Louis, who has gone home exhausted and fallen asleep, wakes up to remember what he has done. Then, the phone rings. Louis hears his tiny son's voice again, asking him to come play. He goes, taking with him a vaccine he has prepared that can be used on any resurrected body to put it back to sleep. He gives this first to Church and it works. Next is Gage - but before a surprisingly believable fight between a grown man and a three-year-old boy, Louis discovers that Gage has already claimed TWO victims - Jud and RACHEL, who got to the house first and saw Gage just after imagining that she was being confronted with her long-dead sister, who warns her that she will never get out of bed again! Foolishly, Rachel rushes to embrace her boy, who says to her, I brought you something, Mommy . . . that something is a knife.Having long since been pushed beyond sanity, Louis administers another syringe of the drug to his little son, who does indeed go back to sleep . . . and buries his wife in the forbidden ground. What happens next is probably the biggest difference between book and film . . . but I've gone into enough detail. The book AND movie are recommended for all my fellow King fans, just don't read the book's ending at night before going to bed and trying to sleep (I made that mistake once).Cheers.

I had learned about the Bloomsbury artists so many years ago I had forgotten their place in history. To say that this story is odd is a gentle understatement. Carrington was someone you would more likely place in the hippie era of the 1960's rather than England of pre World War One. On the other hand, the bohemian artists in Europe had the luxury of acting out some pretty odd relationships; they had fine examples of large living in the previous century - think Lord Byron and a bit later Oscar Wilde and you'll understand.I ended up so smitten by this film that I bought a bio on Carrington and it was worth the effort because the film leaves out so much of what made up her psyche. I'd even argue that the film as good as it is can be confusing because we don't know why she is the woman she is. Carrington carried two distinct imbalanced relationships up to the moment she met Lytton Strachey. She loathed and hated her mother and adored and clung to her father. Electra complex, anyone? Leaving Freud aside (and there is a deep irony in this comment Lytton's brother became a well known Freudian analyst) Carrington was unprepared for the rush of emotions that Strachey caused in her heart. As an openly gay, brilliant intellectual and important writer, he would have been the last on her list of attractive men. But, love deals odd darts to the heart. After nearly clipping his beard off in his sleep as a planned retribution to his impulsive kiss, she paused, stared down at his placid face and fell madly and deeply in love. The rest of the movie completes their extremely odd relationship. The important fact is that she never lost any of the intense love for this gentle spirit. She accepted that Lyton was more interested in men, shared lovers with him, opened her heart to anything except separation from him. We can argue that she had transferred her father love to Strachey but of course it becomes a label that in the end will not satisfy the mystery of her heart. There is much to be said about this film. Emma Thompson completely embodied Carrington as totally as an actor can. Aside her was Jonathan Pryce who portrayed Strachey so perfectly that it left those who knew Strachey amazed. The ambiance and rapport between the main actors kept the passion of their evolving love always front and center. We get glimpses of Carrington's torment over Strachey but we never really know the ultimate motivations. What is so overwhelming about this film is that when Lyton finally succumbs the heart break to Carrington was too much for her to carry. It removed her will to live without him to love. I have rarely been so moved by a love affair like this. The music by Michael Nyman is so perfectly evocative of the waves of Carrington's love that the soundtrack seems completely meshed with the story. In the end, watching Carrington make her final choice we are as devastated as she was at her loss of Strachey. As a love story it is intense, very complicated and twisted, as a relationship between man and woman it is as odd as they come. In the end we decide that love at this level is a connection of heart and emotion and commitment that is blind to shape and form and opinions of others. It is a link that is mysterious but tangible. One can only weep in acknowledgment that if we had loved someone that deeply we too would have wanted the escape she chose. An astoundingly profound meditation on love. Phenomenal supporting actors. Superb but heart rending.

The film takes place in 1969, a time where many, including his character wife, Pearl, played by Diane Lane, had a child at a young age.

I do consider this to be the best film ever made about war. I do not look at this film being about the Vietnam War. I look at this film being about war (Period).I think this film is as excellent as it is for one good reason, showing the effects of war. True, we see the films where men are shaped by war, what events make them who they are, and how the events of war transform them. It is mainly about what the war has done to them. The Deer Hunter takes a bigger step back from that and shows the entire character transformation. It does not just show the transformation of a soldier, but also the transformation as a civilian. You spend a good 40 minutes in the Deer Hunter getting to know the main characters and getting a feel for their personalities. The first 40 minutes is about character development and almost getting an attachment to those characters. This makes their transformation more effective for the viewer and they almost feel for the character and what they are going through. Than those characters get thrown into war and you see the events that change them. The things they had to experience as a soldier. And than, most importantly, we see the changes in their characters after the war. And we do not just see the changes in the soldiers, we see the changes that their friends and lovers undergo as a result of the war. We are not just looking at one soldier, we are looking at a network of friends and how they are changed due to the war. Even those who did not go to war are still effected. And the fact all the characters are from a small town makes it that much more powerful. The Deer Hunter is a powerful film about how war effects everybody, not just the soldiers involved in it.The cast is terrific! Robert De Niro, John Cazale, John Savage, Meryll Streep, and Christopher Walken. Need I say more. Christopher Walken won an Oscar for best supporting actor in this film.

The movie itself is concerned with getting Holden and Hepburn together... it not only makes that point clear, it even says it in the dialog... twice.

Meanwhile, the movie goes on a tongue-in-cheek escapade through narrative conventions and winking asides to avant-garde cinema (especially New Wave, as, well, this came out in the time of New Wave), displaying a range of wit and resourcefulness that helps stretch the desire to see Holden and Hepburn kiss to, say, 130-odd pages? I think what makes this movie really fun is the self-conscious dialog in the movie-within-a-movie scenes, especially such lines as, You're only 3rd Policeman, you aren't even supposed to talk! and the constant (and yet never stale) repetition of the whole Phillipe-Maurice dichotomy. Most of what keeps the whole thing working and not devolving into too much self-consciousness (always a problem with metanarrative) is its pacing (not hectic, but definitely energetic) and its well-stated love of everything that its making fun of.This movie does seem to have fallen out of prominence.

Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable cool of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the coolest and hippest films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the freedom of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted boxer-thug performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character.Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of bravo-film-making. The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be sinners, yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the gourmet of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of lots of cream, lots of sugar.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"18 June 2007","score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a to-be classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable cool of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the coolest and hippest films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the freedom of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted boxer-thug performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character.Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original.

The stunning colours and action sequences used make this film stand out from his previous (and later) attempts at being Bond. His debut with Goldeneye gave a sour aftertaste as this, and The World Is Not Enough, are both more monochromatic in a sense. There is a more depressing aura to them. His role in Die Another Day was bizarre and focused on nothing more than CGI and refined camera shots which lose the gritty Bond charm that makes Tomorrow Never Dies so brilliant.The dialogue is great in this film as are the action sequences (especially with the remote controlled BMW and the motorbike sequence). These action sequences are quintessential Bond and do not just seem to be a vehicle to create 'action'. It is all done brilliantly. There are also a few funny moments, such as the scenes with Dr Kauffman and the film has a great musical score.I think the only thing missing from this film is the classic Bond girl. Of course, Teri Hatcher was a great choice but I felt her character was a little off, and almost created simply to fuel a little more anger towards the protagonist, who is classically clichéd. Michelle Yeoh was a relatively good choice for her role, but this new edge to the butt-kicking Bond girl also caused problems for me.Still, this is by far Brosnan's best Bond performance with an original and believable (well more believable than Die Another Day anyway) plot.

In other words, with a shoestring budget, the director and cinematographer were able to craft an atmospheric and creatively administered film with many striking visuals and touches. Wilde plays a police detective who is trying everything he can think of to bring down a fat cat mobster (Conte) who has assumed control of a major crime ring and who somehow always manages to weasel out of all of his misdeeds. Egging Wilde on to further effort is the fact that he has an affection for Conte's girl, the blonde and desolate Wallace, who wants out of the relationship, but feels that there's no other path open to her, aside from death. Wilde tries to pin various crimes on Conte while Conte stays one step ahead, often with the aid of his two hired guns Van Cleef and Holliman. Like many other big shots before and after him, Conte's world begins to unravel and a lot of people wind up paying the price. Wilde, who also produced this film (as he would virtually all of his after this) does a decent enough job acting-wise, though his role is far less colorful than Conte's. The part doesn't call for a great deal of dimension and he doesn't deliver a great deal of it. Conte, on the other hand, has a nice part with lots of nasty bits of dialogue and action. He stepped into it at the 11th hour after Jack Palance left and was able to assume the role easily. His reed thin and high-pitched voice is unusual for a heavy, but it just adds that much more texture to the part. His lines are spit out rapidly and he seems to be enjoying himself as he dominates the rest of the people on screen. Wallace is almost dream-like at times, with her platinum hair glistening and her moist eyes always threatening to close out of despair and depression. She's an unusual presence, but a generally captivating one for the most part. Donlevy has a good role as Conte's second-in-command, a bitter, somewhat dense tough guy who needs a hearing aid. His final scene is one of the most memorable in the picture. Stanton, as a girlfriend of Wilde's, shows more promise than her subsequent career bore out. Bit parts are filled by interesting and talented actors such as de Corsia and Hoyt. Two of the most talked about performances in the film belong to Van Cleef and Holliman. Though it's never flat-out indicated (nor could it be in 1955), their association can easily be read as more than platonic. They work and live together, share a bedroom, bicker like a married couple and yet clearly care about one another. At one point, Holliman, who has been holed up with Van Cleef for a few days, even says, I can't swallow any more salami!! It's a foggy, shadowy treat that suffers at times from banalities in the script (Will it hold up in court? and Can we make it stick? seem to turn up very often!) and occasional ripe performances such as Walker as a feigning mental patient, but more often is a tough, trim, biting little movie.
