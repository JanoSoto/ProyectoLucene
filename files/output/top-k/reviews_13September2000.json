In a series of flashbacks Costner's character, the aging all-star pitcher, reminisces over the past 5 years, particularly in his relationship with Kelly Preston's character. In the process, about 2\/3 through the game he realizes that he has a perfect game going. In 120 years of baseball, only 18 perfect games have been pitched. So, the drama mounts as we see whether he will succeed, or, as he did in Tin Cup, hit it in the lake on #18.If you generally like Costner, like I do, then you will like this movie. The writing is very good, and unlike many modern action movies, this one does a lot of character development. One memorable line - No matter what happens during the next 5 minutes, I want you to know my heart lept when you showed up at my door. My heart lept in my chest.As you find out from the DVD extras, real professional baseball players and real major league umpires were used to film the game. For 30 days in Yankee Stadium, just after the season ended, they filmed the action. For that reason the ball play is very realistic, very game-like. Overall a very fine movie.

It is just so obvious from watching Endgame that they have no concept of what a good movie is. This is the kind of movie that you can just count the things that are wrong with it. First of all, there are five different stories thrown into an hour and twenty minute movie and naturally there's not enough time to go into detail about any of them. As a result, the movie is borderline incoherent. Some of the scenes are so incomprehensible that the footage explaining them had to have been left on the cutting room floor. The relationship between Duncan and Kate seems to have been thrown into the movie for no other reason than to make an opportunity for a sex scene. If you ask me, the movie would have been a lot better if they'd lost the chick and focused more on Duncan and Connor and Connor and Jacob Kell. And if someone felt that the movie couldn't do without a sex scene, then they could have just shown Duncan in bed with one of his floozies from the past. There is no explanation as to who the Watchers are or who Joe and Methos are so if you've never watched the tv series you won't know any of that. Joe and Methos seem to have been put into the movie merely for the sake of having them in there. Their characters are given no depth at all. One good thing that I can say about the movie is that the acting is very good. Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert are both excellent. I didn't used to think that Christopher Lambert was much of an actor, but I thought that he was quite good in this movie. I also found Bruce Payne's portrayal of Jacob Kell very interesting to watch. The action scenes are very good. I CAN say that I thought that the movie was visually stunning, but overall I thought that it was poorly done and was a lame attempt on the part of Panzer and Davis to keep the Highlander franchise alive. I'd only recommend Endgame to die-hard fans of the tv series. I give it a 6 out of 10 only because the acting and fight scenes were good and also because there has to be somewhere lower to go for the last two sequels.

A performance was actually pulled from Christopher Lambert. A well thought out story was put together. The editing, cinematography, music were top notch. Adrian Paul was in GREAT form. The Villain Bruce Payne was pure evil as Jacob Kell without being a carbon copy of the HL1's (the great Clancy Brown)first Villain. Jacob Kell was Payne's own character.THE PROBLEM? I suggest this, go into this film and dismiss HL2 and HL3. Many critics have said that it contradicts the other films, its not consistent, and its true, but honestly fans, do you WANT to hold those films (Zeist? Katana? Kane?) dear to your heart? If you do then you will have a problem with this film that ignores all prior sequels.I looked at this film as a continuation to the TV series, which cleaned up a lot of the mess made by the previous films. This one really stands on its own, and I don't mean that in a planet Zeist sort of way. END GAME sets a standard for possible future films and doesn't write itself into a corner.The basic theme of the film, is not just making sure you're the good guy when you say there can be only one while being the only immortal left, until Mario Van Peebles comes around for the sequel. This film stays away from that, and really tells the story of revenge versus redemption and how it affects the relationship between immortals Conner MacLeod and Duncan MacLeod with their pasts catching up with them.Pleasant surprises are the return of Heather (Beatie Edney) and Sheila Gish as Rachel from the original film as well as familiar back grounds which reminded me of everything that was great about the original. Plus, a great montage devoted to one of the film's characters marks a great sense that the torch has been passed to Adrian Paul, leaving the series in good hands.There really doesn't need to be sequel to this film, but if there is I hope its in the hands of END GAME'S director Douglas Aarniokoski and writers Gillian Horvath and William Panzer.Good fun kids, a must see!

Unfortunately, `The Bachelor,' directed by Gary Sinyor, is not one of them.  Beginning with the voice-over narration of star Chris O'Donnell, which draws an inane analogy between young, single, American males and wild mustangs, and on through the rest of the contrivances of the lame story, right to the end, this movie is a disaster.  Right out of the gate, it breaks the first rule of successful comedy  Play it straight, and they will laugh.  O'Donnell reads the narrative in a lilting, sing-song manner that plays down to the audience; it implies, `This is funny, you can laugh now.'  Never mind that it isn't funny, that there's nothing at all in what he's saying that makes you want to laugh.  The intent, I believe, with this movie, was to make a romantic comedy; what they ended up with is the most unromantic drivel you can possibly imagine.  When Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) asks his girlfriend of three years, Anne (Renee Zellweger), to marry him, she turns him down because his proposal is so crass; the worst ever made.  Ironically, it comes in one of the worst scenes possibly ever filmed.  Watching it takes you out of the story and almost makes you embarrassed for the actors.  The next day, Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves him over one hundred million dollars, provided he is married by 605 p.m. (the time he was born) on his thirtieth birthday, which happens to be in `Twenty-seven hours and change.'  Since the girl he loves has given him the gate (and rightfully so, because this guy is a real jerk) he spends the rest of the movie contacting old girlfriends, trying to find one who is willing to marry him.  And for the audience, it makes for nothing more than one long, make that LONG, endurance test.   \tO'Donnell brings nothing to the character of Jimmie; he is merely boring and tiresome.  Talk about a less than sympathetic character.  Renee Zellweger, whose career has been on a roll since `Jerry MaGuire' goes into a tailspin here.  She does her best with what she has to work with, but it's not enough.  That there's no chemistry between Anne and Jimmie is not her fault; O'Donnell is just so unappealing in this role, he couldn't make sparks with a flint.  The talented supporting cast, which includes Hal Holbrook (O'Dell), Ed Asner (Gluckman), James Cromwell (Priest), Artie Lange (Marco) and Marley Shelton (Natalie) is wasted here, as well.  Mariah Carey makes a brief, inauspicious appearance as one of Jimmie's former girlfriends, Ilana, in a scene better for all concerned had it wound up on the cutting room floor.  The single high point (if you can call it that) amid all of this dreck, is the scene in which Brooke Shields turns in a notable performance as Buckley, another of Jimmie's girlfriends.  She plays her with an aloofness that actually makes her endearing; and to find that in the midst of this film is a minor triumph.  To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a bad movie.  There's not a laugh to be had, and even the attempted slapstick and sight gags fall short, which proves that nothing can save a project that begins with a screenplay as acerbic and obtuse as this one.  Personally, I refuse to walk out on even the worst movies, or to even turn off a video without sticking it out to the bitter end; it's like a code I live by.

The talented supporting cast, which includes Hal Holbrook (O'Dell), Ed Asner (Gluckman), James Cromwell (Priest), Artie Lange (Marco) and Marley Shelton (Natalie) is wasted here, as well.  Mariah Carey makes a brief, inauspicious appearance as one of Jimmie's former girlfriends, Ilana, in a scene better for all concerned had it wound up on the cutting room floor.  The single high point (if you can call it that) amid all of this dreck, is the scene in which Brooke Shields turns in a notable performance as Buckley, another of Jimmie's girlfriends.  She plays her with an aloofness that actually makes her endearing; and to find that in the midst of this film is a minor triumph.  To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a bad movie.  There's not a laugh to be had, and even the attempted slapstick and sight gags fall short, which proves that nothing can save a project that begins with a screenplay as acerbic and obtuse as this one.  Personally, I refuse to walk out on even the worst movies, or to even turn off a video without sticking it out to the bitter end; it's like a code I live by.  With this film, though, I must confess, I honestly came as close as I ever have to breaking my own rule.  I rate this one 2\/10.

This movie is a hell of a lot more cerebral than it is a mindless simple action movie, with two comedic (at least their backgrounds) antiheros. And that's where the trailer for this movie fails to do it justice or deliver or represent accurately what the movie is about to potential viewers.

But what they end up becoming are players to the situation, the situation  becomes the center of attention and not the principals. I guess a better preview for this movie would be to show all 8 charaters involved, briefly show how they are involved and show a little conversation (because the film is 85-90% dialogue and not mostly shooting) and change the title (I knew some marketing genius came up with that one to sell the movie!).

In the most beautiful moment in this concert movie (shot just a few months ago on digital video), Spike Lee recreates the Coney-Island-snapshot sequence from HE GOT GAME using real Kings of Comedy audience members--a pudgy couple in matching Hilfiger, grannies with towering beehives, bespectacled hicks. The cinematographer, Maleek Khan, photographs black skin with loving nuance. (See NURSE BETTY for contrast, where Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman are turned into near-literal tar babies.) And clearly Lee has an affection for the cornpone standup of the Kings. The moment you can feel is nearest and dearest to him comes when the MC, Steve Harvey, assails rap music and extols the virtues of the Al Wilson\/Luther\/Teddy Pendergrass era. These chitlin-circuit gagmeisters are a throwback to another era--an era before Def Comedy Jam, before the concept of Russell Simmons. Even when their bits sprinkle the F word, they're still clean.The material runs together (white people are like this and black people are like that; music ain't what it used to be; black women got a lot of rules) but the performers save it.

All my SINGIN' IN THE RAIN prejudices aside, I was very pleasantly surprised.Cecil B.

Unfortunately when people sit down in the theater, as they start watching it, they're going to start wondering what's so funny about it. They may feel tricked in fact, as fifteen minutes into it, they get to watch one of the more gruesome movie killings in recent memory. This is not a warning against seeing the film, but simply a word of caution. By revealing this, I'm not as much spoiling a surprise as I am averting an ambush.The scene is gruesome, but in no way gratuitous it may be the film's most important and symbolic moment. Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger in the performance of the year so far), a waitress in a small Kansas town is married to an inhuman monster, Del (Neil LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart), who happens to be a used car salesman. She's obsessed with a soap opera called A Reason To Love (or just `Reason,' as its many fans refer to it). Her birthday comes and goes and Del forgets, not surprisingly. Betty is so unaware of the sad state of her life that she's slowly withdrawing into the world of her soap opera, allowing her unconscious contempt for Del to manifest itself in an imaginary love affair with Reason's star, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). That night she suddenly finds herself witnessing the bloody killing of her husband, even as she's immersed in the world of her TV show.Sometimes you'll be so into a movie or TV show that it takes a moment to readjust to reality when it's over. What if during a commercial you happened to look out the window and witnessed, say, a bad car crash in the street in front of your home. For just a split second, you'd wish your life were the TV show (depending on the show) and that the crash had been on TV. Well, Betty's moment lasts for much longer. You can't help but feel deeply for this character. Her mind has thrown up a wall of protection against the trauma she's sustained, so we can feel truly proud of her when she leaves a loving note to Del that she's leaving him and hits the road to re-unite with her ex-fiancee, Dr. David Ravell. The moment is both funny and sad. As is the whole film. Betty's delusional state creates some great moments. Your instinct is to laugh, but then you hold back, almost out of courtesy. Oh my god, that poor woman, is the thought you're most likely to have. Zellweger's performance will stick with you. She unleashes enough facial expressions in this one film to fill a film career. Morgan Freeman, playing Charlie, one of Del's killers (his associate is played by Chris Rock), gives maybe his best performance since Shawshank. His fascination with Betty, which turns into romantic fantasies, also creates some great moments. Either laugh or feel pity your choice. Charlie's story gets you thinking about people's perceptions of each other. In a way, Betty is his David Ravell. She's his fantasy and he makes her what he wants her to be. She symbolizes the emptiness in his life. Charlie's dream Betty is who Betty herself wants to be. Charlie's brutal actions throw her into the state she's in, but in a way they also free her. There is so much beauty here I could go on and on.Not that this is perfection in filmmaking by any means. It's not as good as LaBute's last film, Your Friends and Neighbors, which I thought was the best film of 1998. Most of Betty's drawbacks come from the writing. Too much of the plot relies on people's stupidity and gullibility. Then again, maybe it's intentional and Del Sizemore was being proven right (see it and you'll know what I'm talking about).It's too bad Nurse Betty must be pigeonholed as a comedy. I think I would rather have gone to this film thinking it was a thriller and then found it surprisingly touching and funny. Makes a film like this a marketer's nightmare.

The moment is both funny and sad. As is the whole film. Betty's delusional state creates some great moments. Your instinct is to laugh, but then you hold back, almost out of courtesy. Oh my god, that poor woman, is the thought you're most likely to have. Zellweger's performance will stick with you. She unleashes enough facial expressions in this one film to fill a film career. Morgan Freeman, playing Charlie, one of Del's killers (his associate is played by Chris Rock), gives maybe his best performance since Shawshank. His fascination with Betty, which turns into romantic fantasies, also creates some great moments. Either laugh or feel pity your choice. Charlie's story gets you thinking about people's perceptions of each other. In a way, Betty is his David Ravell. She's his fantasy and he makes her what he wants her to be. She symbolizes the emptiness in his life. Charlie's dream Betty is who Betty herself wants to be. Charlie's brutal actions throw her into the state she's in, but in a way they also free her. There is so much beauty here I could go on and on.Not that this is perfection in filmmaking by any means. It's not as good as LaBute's last film, Your Friends and Neighbors, which I thought was the best film of 1998. Most of Betty's drawbacks come from the writing. Too much of the plot relies on people's stupidity and gullibility. Then again, maybe it's intentional and Del Sizemore was being proven right (see it and you'll know what I'm talking about).It's too bad Nurse Betty must be pigeonholed as a comedy. I think I would rather have gone to this film thinking it was a thriller and then found it surprisingly touching and funny. Makes a film like this a marketer's nightmare. But in a weak film year like 2000 has been, it's a film fan's dream.Grade B  ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 September 2000","score":"","review":"  Nurse Betty is being promoted as a comedy. Unfortunately when people sit down in the theater, as they start watching it, they're going to start wondering what's so funny about it. They may feel tricked in fact, as fifteen minutes into it, they get to watch one of the more gruesome movie killings in recent memory. This is not a warning against seeing the film, but simply a word of caution. By revealing this, I'm not as much spoiling a surprise as I am averting an ambush.The scene is gruesome, but in no way gratuitous it may be the film's most important and symbolic moment. Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger in the performance of the year so far), a waitress in a small Kansas town is married to an inhuman monster, Del (Neil LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart), who happens to be a used car salesman. She's obsessed with a soap opera called A Reason To Love (or just `Reason,' as its many fans refer to it). Her birthday comes and goes and Del forgets, not surprisingly. Betty is so unaware of the sad state of her life that she's slowly withdrawing into the world of her soap opera, allowing her unconscious contempt for Del to manifest itself in an imaginary love affair with Reason's star, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). That night she suddenly finds herself witnessing the bloody killing of her husband, even as she's immersed in the world of her TV show.Sometimes you'll be so into a movie or TV show that it takes a moment to readjust to reality when it's over. What if during a commercial you happened to look out the window and witnessed, say, a bad car crash in the street in front of your home. For just a split second, you'd wish your life were the TV show (depending on the show) and that the crash had been on TV. Well, Betty's moment lasts for much longer. You can't help but feel deeply for this character. Her mind has thrown up a wall of protection against the trauma she's sustained, so we can feel truly proud of her when she leaves a loving note to Del that she's leaving him and hits the road to re-unite with her ex-fiancee, Dr. David Ravell.

Hahaha...that's what they tell ya anyway. Danny Devito's opening voiceover sets the mood for the one of the moodiest and best film noirs ever released from the dream factory that is Hollywood. I first heard about L.A. Confidential, appropiately enough, from looking at the ad for it on the back of a tabloid. While I'd not heard of Ellroy prior to this film's release, I was shocked to find out that one of his first novels, Blood on the Moon, served as the basis for one of the most foul-mouthed, brutal, and, to my mind, underrated films on the market, Cop. No matter; my subsequent reading of Ellroy's work proves to me that the man is at his best by using the known facts of history as a prybar for showing the rot underneath the veneer.Curtis Hanson remarked, in a documentary about the film, that as he read the book and was introduced to the three main guys (Bud White, Jack Vincenes, and Edmond Exley), he found that he didn't like them. That would seem to parallel my own reactions to them. Bud White scared the hell out of me. Jack Vincenes, for all his smooth charm, disgusted me. Ed Exley, with his wimpy exterior, reminded me a little too much of the kid I used to be. Every one of these cops are corrupt to various extents. But all that changes with the Nightowl Massacre.At roughly the halfway point of the film, when the whole business of the Nightowl killings have been resolved, all three of these guys come to the exact same conclusion this isn't what it's supposed to be all about. It winds up putting them on a collision course for the real culprits behind the crime and for two of these guys, the price of defiance turns out to be astronomical.What fascinated me the most about this film was it's use of actual history, be it Mickey Cohen, Johnny Stompanato, Lana Turner, the opening night of Worlds Collide, or the beginning of the construction of the Santa Monica Boulevard. These bits of historical grounding act as a wall that the story bounces off of like a racquet ball. Like Chinatown, Hanson and Helgelund (and, of course, Ellroy before them) make no bones about the fact that the official histories of 1950's L.A. are just sanitized versions of the real thing. Unlike Chinatown, however, the movie doesn't end on a note of hopelessness, though not in the traditional justice has been served wrap-up, either.It struck me, especially considering Hanson's comments on the naturalistic lighting scheme employed by Dante Spinotti, that this piece could almost be considered anti-noir. By that, I mean, it uses the noir conventions that date back to Hollywood's Golden Age, but in a way that sets a somewhat different tone. It's not hopelessness, as I've pointed out, but it's not the uplifting feel-good kind of mood, either. It is its own thing. It will be interesting to see if a movie that follows that sort of pattern is made within the next few years.
