[{"date":"30 June 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Star Wars tries to get serious. I wanted to give this a higher rating but it's just too hollywood adventure for me to take it too seriously. Like in the previous installment, the fun factor is still high. But a jedi knight would hate this film because as yoda says jedi has no need for excitement or adventure. Well the yoda scenes were a good intro to zen buddhism for those who want more of that kind of stuff. The sword fighting has improved. I just cant help but feel that the characters evolve a little too quickly (or the story is not told with proper pacing). Luke pretty much just left his desert planet and he's already fighting Vader. And Leia tells Han that she loves him when just previously they were at each others claws (we could've at least had a sex scene to unleash that tension). And what's with the whole rebellion vs evil emperor thing? Why are we never told what makes them so evil and what the rebels are really fighting for? Because of the lack of proper story here, this film is meant for dimwitted consumers who need a few hours of escape from their boring lives. I used to love this movie as a kid, lets see how it goes with the last installment which i'll watch within the next few days.
