Horrible editing, syncronization of the voices, and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been.All in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large PASS.

With this film, we couldn't do either since it was so dull. The cover is a bit misleading, and the movie told no story whatsoever.  There's a lot of irrelevant, boring dialogue and even when it sticks to the plot, nothing enhances it or helps it grow. There isn't enough suspense for it to be considered a horror film.  The basic story follows a family vacationing in the wintry mountains who bump into irate hunter Otis.  After the family gets settled, the little boy, Miles, has strange visions and meets a mysterious Native American.  This is where you learn the conflicting information about the Wendigo.  Is it good, is it bad? What does it want? You'll never know.  Maybe this is to help you make your own opinion, but the movie doesn't even give you enough criteria to base one on! If you do decide to rent this (they should be paying you to rent it), and feel gypped by the movie, you may try looking at the director's interview to learn more about the Wendigo.  Well, you'll be disappointed there too.  Toothless Larry Fessenden stands in front of a graffiti wall on a city street to share all his knowledge which turns out to be very little.  He'll speak of hearing his teacher tell the story of the dreaded Wendigo when he was in third grade, and that it haunted him ever since.  He doesn't divulge the actual story because he conveniently forgets.  Nice supporting back story there, buddy.  You can't even remember what inspired you to make this stupid movie? The only, ONLY good thing about this movie was the Wendigo itself. They put in a lot of effort and detail to make the Wendigo lifelike.  However, you only get to see that in the 'making of' DVD extra.  In the actual movie, the lighting is dark or the shots are too quick for you to appreciate it.  Obviously, lighting issues are for atmosphere but it didn't seem to make sense to give that much full body detail to the creature if we weren't gonna see all of it. My advice is to skip over this one unless you enjoy being confused or laughing at the beginning of the Searching for the Wendigo extra.

The king trusted the wrong sons and they were going to screw him.  Then they did.  Then all the people the king screwed over the years screwed him too.  Unlike some movie fans, I get no satisfaction knowing what's going to happen next in every flipping scene of a film.   I like surprises.  There weren't any.Part of the reason for this was the pacing.  It does not make me a shallow California moron to get bored when a movie drags.  I can dig silence.  I can dig long shots of clouds and scenery.  But there has to be tension of some kind.  There has to be something going on in the story to make me wonder what will happen next.And honestly, I think I watched the same stuntman fall off the same horse twenty times in a row, just from different angles.Somebody wrote that these were the best battle scenes he'd ever seen.

Will Smith's performance was very solid, yet I never was able to shake the feeling that on screen it was Will Smith playing Muhammad Ali and not simply Muhammad Ali.  Perhaps that is through no fault of his.  He truly does a great impression of the fighter.  The script is again decent, centering on several facets of the star's life that go beyond the sports pages. However, overall the whole project has a rather distant feel. The viewer rarely is truly captivated by what is occurring. Michael Mann's characteristic documentary-esque filming style works well in parts, but services to alienate the viewer in others.  Yes, it feels as though you are almost watching a documentary in many cases, as if the viewer is a bystander to the circumstances at hand, but this is a work of drama, not a documentary. I wish someone had told Mann to stop shaking the camera and shifting to view Ali between the standard stock of blurred reporters for a few seconds and do a more typically dramatic shot. With Heat and The Insider, Mann managed to pull off this style successfully. In Ali he does not. In many cases conversations begin to rise but then only dissipate before anything really gripping has been said. Simply put, this film could have used a few more motivational speeches along the lines of a Rocky film. Perhaps it wouldn't have been as accurate, but it would have serviced a more dramatic story, at least one where the viewer really felt involved. Ali goes through two wives in the film and in neither case do they even serve to get very angry with him. Voices begin to rise and then either the woman or Ali leaves the room. The scene ends without any heavy emotion other than stern faces being shown. He's divorced a few minutes later.  The fight scenes also have a lack of emotion.  The film style is interesting and visually stimulating, but it could have used a few `it's over Rock!' lines here and there to punctuate things.Mann's standard use of music again fails in many cases here. Whereas in historical films like Forrest Gump period music is used to punctuate a dramatic score, in Ali it is almost the sole backing track of the film. There is scarcely any musical score involved. When it is used, it often seems like it was just pieced together from leftovers to provide ambience. In a few key dramatic scenes, the pop ditties being played (although sometimes fitting lyrically) really end up being a distraction. The death of Malcolm X is a prime example.  Ali's close friend has just been killed and you're just waiting for a rising orchestral number (however cliche and standard it may be, that's what you're looking for), but instead you get a period song that, at this point in the film, is beginning to sound like half a dozen others before it. In several cases Mann's musical style does work (Ali's jog through the streets of Zaire being an example, the closing number another) but the technique fails overall.I've mostly criticized this film, which should not be the only viewpoint, because cinematically it is a fine work. There doesn't need to be another Ali film made, as this will service his legacy nicely. It has flaws, but I point out these flaws taking for granted just how good much of it is. The banter between Ali and Howard Cosell (Jon Voight, who completely disappears into this role) is classic, and work by Jaime Foxx and Mario Van Peebles (as Malcolm X) is solid as well. Michael Mann knows how to handle a film and I would rather watch a sub-par outing from him than most of what Hollywood produces any day.  He's just done better.

Being a horror film buff, I am not scared that easily, but this movie scared the crap out of me.  Not so much as the far superior Jaws did to me or hell, the entire population of the world, but Deep Blue Sea still had it's fair share of thrills and shocks.The thrills start the second Thomas Jane's character is swimming with a large tiger shark trying to get a license plate out of its mouth (nod to Jaws, perhaps?).  The rest of the movie is equally as gripping, just like other Renny Harlin movies (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), we have a disaster situation in a hostile environment with lethal bad guys trying to kill the innocent.

I saw this in the theater and it literally had me on the edge of my seat...a rarity for me. Did it have a profound effect in scaring me to go back into the water?

To my joy, I saw that this movie was playing on PBS on TV!  I had heard that this was a bad movie, but I found it hard to believe, because after all, it was a David O. Selznick film, the same guy that did Gone with the Wind.  How bad could it be?Boy, was it bad!  The storyline was bad, the characters were practically all one dimensional, and all the main actors did their best to chew up the scenery!  This is the movie they should show to drama students on how NOT to act!I had a great time time watching this film.

I think they should of stopped making Chucky movies after the 2nd one. The 3rd and the Bride of Chucky were a disgrace. It will be interesting to see if they do come out with a new movie because they didn't kill him as bad as in his other movies, you know being burnt, being shot apart and his heart shot. Or like in the 2nd one where he had his head explode and in the 3rd one being chopped up in a fan. The bride of chucky he got shot multiple times which is nowhere near as bad as the other movies. Alex Vincent played the perfect role as Andy Barcley. I'm surprised they didn't use someone like Maculey Culkin or Elijah Wood but Alex worked out very well.

Instead of PG-13ing it and making it look hokey, James Cameron decided to make it as lifelike as could be, and it really did look lifelike. The effects on Schwarzenegger when he was half-human, half-cyborg looked very real, and would be considered impressive by today's standards.

I know I should've seen it earlier, but I missed it every time it was on TV. A Perfect World, with Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood tells the story of the fugitive convict Butch Haynes, who escapes with his partner Terry Pugh from the Huntsville prison in 1963. On their flight, they kidnap the young 8-year-old-boy Phillip Perry, and continue their race across Texas. As Pugh tries to abuse Phillip, Butch kills him.  While Texas Ranger Chief Red Garnett (Eastwood) hunts them, the two discover similar bonds, and Butch really comes to like young Phillip. The boy himself overcomes his suspicion and accepts Butch as a kind of older brother, or even stronger, as the compensation for his father, whom he never knew. As the hunt continues, Butch tells Phillip about his life, and his wish to find his own father on Alaska, where he would like to live in peace and dignity. They make certain stops, steal three different cars, and survive confrontations with the local cops. The movie deals not only with this flight of a criminal, but also strongly with the issues of fathers and sons. That's what put this movie for me above the usual road movie. It goes deep, deals with exhaustion, love, hopelessness, and pure human emotions. The climax of the movie is unexpected. Butch and Phillip stay on a farm, when the situation gets out of control. The farmer beats his young son, and Butch attacks him, even threatens to kill him. That's what causes Phillip to raise the gun against Butch, and even shoots him in the stomach.Garnett reaches the place. Butch stumbles out of the farm and follows Phillip, who sought for refuge on a big tree. Police forces surround them, snipers get into positions. But Phillip is not willing to leave Butch, though he would have let him go to his mom, who also arrived at the scenery. He runs back to the wounded Butch and hugs him. There you can see the love and sympathy the boy feels for the criminal. I was caught in high attention, unable to move. How would the movie end? Criminologist Sally Gerber is with Garnett, and both of them know, really know Butch, Garnett even knows him from his childhood in Amarillo on. They try to solve the situation peacefully. But when Phillip and Butch move towards Garnett, hand in hand, Butch stumbles again, and tries to give the photograph of Alaska, which his father sent him, to Phillip. The sniper, an arrogant FBI agent, supposes Butch would draw a gun and fires a shot into the chest of the man. He dies, Phillip kneeing on his side, taking the photo and eventually, his mom draws him away from Butch. Garnett is angry. He wanted to save the guy, for he knew the good heart of Haynes. The dramatic ending is impressive. Eastwood made a perfect job both as actor and director, and T.J. Lowther's performance as young Phillip is simply great and convincing. One of Costner's best as well, a road movie with funny dialogues, a thrilling background story, moving emotions, brilliant acting performances, some brutal and unexpected scenes, a great setting in Texas around 1963, and an indeed amazing climax at the end, which makes the movie a dramatic masterpiece.Feel free to respond and to share your thoughts, you can write me if you want.Best greetings to all imdb.com users from Austria!
