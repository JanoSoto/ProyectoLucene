However, the calmness of the household is broken when Jekyll starts to stay out all night, he then says he will be collaborating with an assistant named Mr. Edward Hyde (John Malkovich) on his experiments & he should be treated as they treat him. Reilly meets Mr. Hyde who turns out to be a bit of a bad lad, meanwhile she has secret affections for her master Dr. Jekyll & soon realises they are both one & the same person...Directed by Stephen Frears I will openly admit right here & now that Mary Reilly bored me stiff, I honestly wanted to switch it off & go to sleep but in the fairness of this comment I decided to endure the final 40 minutes. The script by Christopher Hampton was based on the novel of the same name by Valerie Martin which itself obviously took inspiration from the Robert Louis Stevenson novel The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, who was it exactly that thought telling the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the perspective of his housemaid was a good idea? No offence but it sounds lame just thinking about it & sure enough the finished film is total crap that I personally found ways to hate it on many levels. From the absolute tedium of it all to the snails pace, to the awful romance between the main character's & the slushy sentimental drama to the fact it's one of the most boring films I've seen. I didn't like anyone in it, I didn't like the way the makers have taken a decent horror themed story & turned it into some horrible tedious romance & the lack of any horror or scares just sinks it without trace as far as I'm concerned. By the way did I mention it was boring?Director Frears does alright, to give the film credit where it deserves it the production design & look of it are fabulous. This would give any period Hammer Horror flick a good run for it's money, then again I suppose you can stage a film like this when you have nearly 50 million dollars as your budget. Apparently Tim Burton was set to direct this but decided to make Ed Wood (1994) instead, he might have actually injected some horror & mystery into the plot while still retaining the Gothic romance just like he did with his excellent Sleepy Hollow (1999). There's no real horror or scares in Mary Reilly, it has a nice fog enshrouded look but little else. Animal lovers beware, there are shots of eels being killed & skinned, being the old romantic that he is Mr. Hyde takes Mary to a slaughter house & again there are various animal carcasses strung up being skinned & gutted along with various organs in buckets & strewn across the floor. A man is also killed with the end of his walking cane in the films most violent scene.I am amazed this had a budget of near $50,000,000, it doesn't look like it although it's undeniably well staged & made. According to the IMDb Roberts got paid $10,000,000 for this, well she's terrible in it & her accent is awful. Shot on location in London, Scotland & in Pinewood studios. Generally speaking though there's a great cast here including Malkovich, George Cole, Kathy Staff, Michael Gombon & Glenn Close as the owner of a London whore house. At the 1997 Razzie Awards Mary Reilly was nominated for two, Julia Roberts as worst actress which she should have won & Stephen Frears as worst director which considering the film looks alright is maybe a bit harsh.Mary Reilly is in my opinion a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that, when I watch a film I want to be entertained & not bored out of my skull & that's just the way it is.

The story is from a novel by celebrated sci-fi mainstays William F. Nolan (Trilogy of Terror) and George Clayton Johnson (Twilight Zone, Star Trek) and at least some of the ideas from the book seem to be present here, because the film represents old-school sci-fi of the golden age variety, the kind of thing that wouldn't be out of place in the pages of Galaxy or Astounding SF. It's a dystopia story that shows signs of its lineage from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World &#150; Logan 5 (Michael York) is a cop in a domed city where everything sexual and physical is available for the taking, with a catch &#150; at the age of 30 each person has to go to a weird arena where they undergo a ceremony designed to potentially reincarnate them as a new life form. Logan's job is to hunt down people who become runners and attempt to flee the city to Sanctuary instead of going through the ritual. After being sent on a mission to destroy Sanctuary by the city's authoritarian central computer (shades of Godard's Alphaville and Lucas' THX-1138), Logan begins to suspect that his life might not be as perfect as it seems.The early parts of the film are very striking, the best in the film. I liked how we first met Logan 5 and his friend Francis (Richard Jordan) in a kind of sterile maternity ward &#150; clearly despite his protests Logan has some interest in the concept of posterity and reproduction. We see how he and his friends hunt the runners in a decidedly sadistic way, and how casual sex is available at the push of a button. Then we see the people whose time is up don weird masks and robes and float to the ceiling in the ritual &#150; very striking compositions here, although the way the scene was edited together with the crowd's cheers made it seem as if they're at a gladiator event cheering for people's deaths instead of religious supplicants at a ritual, as they are intended. Also I'm not completely sure if Logan was supposed to come off as quite as much of a fascist as he does here, with his gleeful face and blithe attitude about sex&#133; but then again maybe he is. There's definitely a more complex character arc than you would see in most sci-fi\/action movies these days. I liked how the relationship with Jessica (Jenny Agutter) was explored as a counterpoint to his friendship with Francis as he moves towards a greater understanding of his situation and, perhaps, the human condition. Peter Ustinov acts as the spokesman of the human race in the role of Old Man, who Logan and Jessica meet in a ruined District of Columbia that reminds any semi-alert viewer of Planet of the Apes. I didn't like how his character was written, quite a bit too obvious and kind of annoyingly meandering. In fact the script in general was not very strong, although the actors did the best they could with what they were given. The story as a whole starts to get bogged down just after the scene with Box where it's revealed that there really is no Sanctuary. This finally confirms for Logan, also, that the computer that runs the domed city is not infallible.As far as the effects, this is the subject of much debate concerning the film. I have mixed feelings about the use of miniatures in the film; it's a beautiful set and I get a kick just out of looking at it, but even considering 1976 effects there are problems with the set that could have been solved with a bit more thinking. For example it's an extremely bad idea to integrate water with your miniatures as they have done here since water immediately betrays the differences in scale. If they were going to use water at the very least they should have made sure that the water was completely placid because any wave action will ruin the shot. The Box as stated above was just a horrible costume\/animatronic, although the idea is still good enough to carry the scene IMHO. However some of the effects in Logan's Run are definitely state-of-the-art for the mid 70s, particularly the use of video effects in scenes like the ritual and when Logan and Jessica are going up in the elevator to the upper levels (just before they reach Box). Also the matte work in the film was all excellent top of the line stuff. The sets are mostly very interesting architectural works from around the Dallas\/Fort Worth area that are dressed up with bizarre objects like the giant silver hand with a red crystal in the center of the palm.This is a kind of sci-fi film that you really don't see any more &#150; with plenty of action and sexuality to distract the eye and plenty of ideas to chew on as well. What's interesting about the film from a philosophical standpoint is how blind Logan and the others are to the ramifications of the situation. That's why his speech to the people in the plaza couldn't sway them; like Logan they had to see the outside and the Old Man for themselves. And none of them have any idea about the negative effects of aging, which is quite charming. I think the overall idea is to poke holes in the idea (which had great currency in the late 60s when the source novel was written) that youth culture and free love could save humanity from all of its problems. This could have been a painful pedantic film if the film-makers hadn't had the good taste to never verbalize this film but to simply let the audience soak up the realization.

The story as a whole starts to get bogged down just after the scene with Box where it's revealed that there really is no Sanctuary. This finally confirms for Logan, also, that the computer that runs the domed city is not infallible.As far as the effects, this is the subject of much debate concerning the film. I have mixed feelings about the use of miniatures in the film; it's a beautiful set and I get a kick just out of looking at it, but even considering 1976 effects there are problems with the set that could have been solved with a bit more thinking. For example it's an extremely bad idea to integrate water with your miniatures as they have done here since water immediately betrays the differences in scale. If they were going to use water at the very least they should have made sure that the water was completely placid because any wave action will ruin the shot. The Box as stated above was just a horrible costume\/animatronic, although the idea is still good enough to carry the scene IMHO. However some of the effects in Logan's Run are definitely state-of-the-art for the mid 70s, particularly the use of video effects in scenes like the ritual and when Logan and Jessica are going up in the elevator to the upper levels (just before they reach Box). Also the matte work in the film was all excellent top of the line stuff. The sets are mostly very interesting architectural works from around the Dallas\/Fort Worth area that are dressed up with bizarre objects like the giant silver hand with a red crystal in the center of the palm.This is a kind of sci-fi film that you really don't see any more &#150; with plenty of action and sexuality to distract the eye and plenty of ideas to chew on as well. What's interesting about the film from a philosophical standpoint is how blind Logan and the others are to the ramifications of the situation. That's why his speech to the people in the plaza couldn't sway them; like Logan they had to see the outside and the Old Man for themselves. And none of them have any idea about the negative effects of aging, which is quite charming. I think the overall idea is to poke holes in the idea (which had great currency in the late 60s when the source novel was written) that youth culture and free love could save humanity from all of its problems. This could have been a painful pedantic film if the film-makers hadn't had the good taste to never verbalize this film but to simply let the audience soak up the realization. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 November 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Yes, some of the effects (especially the robot Box, whose arms look like conventional heating ducts) are extremely dated &#150; but everything about the film is ambitious including those effects. The story is from a novel by celebrated sci-fi mainstays William F. Nolan (Trilogy of Terror) and George Clayton Johnson (Twilight Zone, Star Trek) and at least some of the ideas from the book seem to be present here, because the film represents old-school sci-fi of the golden age variety, the kind of thing that wouldn't be out of place in the pages of Galaxy or Astounding SF. It's a dystopia story that shows signs of its lineage from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World &#150; Logan 5 (Michael York) is a cop in a domed city where everything sexual and physical is available for the taking, with a catch &#150; at the age of 30 each person has to go to a weird arena where they undergo a ceremony designed to potentially reincarnate them as a new life form. Logan's job is to hunt down people who become runners and attempt to flee the city to Sanctuary instead of going through the ritual. After being sent on a mission to destroy Sanctuary by the city's authoritarian central computer (shades of Godard's Alphaville and Lucas' THX-1138), Logan begins to suspect that his life might not be as perfect as it seems.The early parts of the film are very striking, the best in the film. I liked how we first met Logan 5 and his friend Francis (Richard Jordan) in a kind of sterile maternity ward &#150; clearly despite his protests Logan has some interest in the concept of posterity and reproduction. We see how he and his friends hunt the runners in a decidedly sadistic way, and how casual sex is available at the push of a button. Then we see the people whose time is up don weird masks and robes and float to the ceiling in the ritual &#150; very striking compositions here, although the way the scene was edited together with the crowd's cheers made it seem as if they're at a gladiator event cheering for people's deaths instead of religious supplicants at a ritual, as they are intended. Also I'm not completely sure if Logan was supposed to come off as quite as much of a fascist as he does here, with his gleeful face and blithe attitude about sex&#133; but then again maybe he is. There's definitely a more complex character arc than you would see in most sci-fi\/action movies these days. I liked how the relationship with Jessica (Jenny Agutter) was explored as a counterpoint to his friendship with Francis as he moves towards a greater understanding of his situation and, perhaps, the human condition. Peter Ustinov acts as the spokesman of the human race in the role of Old Man, who Logan and Jessica meet in a ruined District of Columbia that reminds any semi-alert viewer of Planet of the Apes.

Instead of a Freddy Krueger or a Michael Myers we have Michael Keaton as a psychotic tenant who makes life hell for his landlords Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine. Knowing every legal loophole in the book, his weapons of choice are restraining orders and civil suits, not butcher knives and chainsaws. Driving them to increasingly desperate measures to evict him, Keaton dreams up new and more sadistic methods to torment them.I've always thought Pacific Heights is rather underrated. It's got a mite more intelligence than you'd expect from Hollywood's hijacked psycho-stalker genre. John Schlesinger directs it all with confidence, but then he's an old hand in this area. And Michael Keaton is wonderfully malevolent. His presence makes the entire movie. I've always enjoyed the course the film takes us on. Even if it occasionally gets into some muddy areas along the way, Pacific Heights is compelling to the very end.Modine and Griffith play Drake Goodman and Patty Palmer. A young and naive yuppie couple, they renovate a Victorian house in San Francisco. Truthfully, the house is more than they can afford, but can (barely) make ends meet by renting out two downstairs apartments. One to a nice Japanese couple. And the other to businessman Carter Hayes (Keaton).Hayes moves in without permission, or even a down payment. He locks himself in, not paying any rent. He has a roommate, who hammers away to all hours of the night. He changes the locks. Breeds cockroaches. Drives away the other tenants. And because no money is coming in, Drake and Patty's legal status is becoming all the more shakier. As is they're relationship.Pacific Heights is a film that comes with a certain appeal when looked at closely enough. The idea of a tenant being able to have more power than a landlord is scary stuff. I didn't always believe some of the stunts the film pulls. Unleashing hordes of cockroaches is perhaps going a little too far. Even for a psycho-thriller. Even a tenant who knows how to manipulate the law for his own purposes would have to face culpability sometime.And yet at the same time, Pacific Heights is a constant source of fascination. Hayes leads Drake and Patty through a wonderfully complex legal minefield. Its surprisingly the film's threats of foreclosure and mounting bills that are more effective than its outright sinister approaches.This is a criminally overlooked performance on Michael Keaton's resume. In fact he's always been an actor long overdue recognition. Hot off the success of Batman, Keaton plunges right into the role of Carter Hayes with pure, unadulterated relish. Even though Hayes' motivations are never exactly made clear, its Keaton's performance that sells the character.This is a man with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He apparently comes from a broken home. Shut out of the family fortune. Disowned. So now he takes a perverse pleasure in destroying the lives of those happier than his. Keaton is a powerful presence. All the more remarkable considering he spends most of the film behind closed doors.Whenever Keaton is around, you sit up and pay attention. But I can't really say the same for Modine and Griffith. Modine is annoying the way he stupidly plays into Hayes' hands time and again.And as for Griffith, she only really comes into her own towards the end. Melanie Griffith once showed signs of being a promising actress in the 80s. Witness her superb performance in Working Girl. But over the years her star has paled, and now she's nothing more than another face in the crowd.But towards the end, we finally see something of the promise she showed in Working Girl. She exacts a little revenge on Hayes by playing him at his own game. She tracks him down to a swanky hotel, has his bank account frozen, and charges hundreds of dollars worth of room service to his credit card. That's the Melanie I remember.But elsewhere, every shred of enjoyment to be had comes courtesy of Keaton. There is something wonderfully poetic to Pacific Heights at times. Not to mention unnerving. Like when Hayes calmly provokes Drake into beating the crap out of him, because the stress of all this causes a pregnant Patty to suffer a miscarriage. And best of all, Drake is legally restrained from entering his own home. Because of Hayes' presence there.The climax is pretty good too. That's the point when Schlesinger (and Keaton) forgets about being courteous, and launches into all out psycho mode. Complete with nail-guns and spikes.Pacific Heights is maddeningly vague at times about where its going to go next. But I think its a worthwhile film, and well worthy of reevaluation. Also look out for a fine turn from the underrated Laurie Metcalf as Drake and Patty's attorney. She lights up the screen just as much as Keaton does.

And when the camera is focused on Emily in the New York based soap opera, a director inquires of the cameraman I'd like to make her (Hoffman in drag) a little more attractive; how far can you pull back? To which the cameraman responds in a deadpan tone How do you feel about Cleveland?A number of fine performances include Jessica Lange, Charles Durning, and Bill Murray. The film's production design, costumes, and color cinematography are all quite acceptable.I guess in its day the film's subject matter was novel. Certainly, the film was wildly popular, then. But times have changed. The underlying premise has not aged well. Despite some really fine acting and credible production values, Tootsie is very much a product of a gone-bye-bye entertainment era.

I don't know a lot of people who don't know how it ends.I will tell the story as best as I can since I don't have it at home (it's sad, I know) We begin at a very cold planet where Luke goes out and is missing. Many people want to give up searching for him. Meanwhile, Luke gets kidnapped by the 1980's version of an alien Abominable Snowman. After escaping the monster and killing it (I think), Luke goes out into the blizzard and sees Obi-Wan's spirit in the distance, telling him to go to Yoda on the planet Dagobah, and continue training. Han Solo finds him, about to freeze to death, and rescues him. Back at the base, they treat him and he makes a full recovery. Later on in the movie, the evil guys come to the planet and attack using those AT-AT walkers. The big battle begins and of course, the good guys win. What did you expect? On Dagobah, a little green man meets with Luke and R2D2. He is revealed to be Yoda. What I find cool is that Frank Oz has done the voice of Yoda for all of the Star Wars movies. You can tell that it's him in the Return of the Jedi because when he says When 900 years old you reach, looking good you will not be he sounds like Fozzie from the Muppets. Luke starts his training.Skipping a bit, the gang meets Lando Calrissian, the former owner of the Millennium Falcon. They all try to evade the Empire, but they realized that they've been tricked by Lando, who says that he had to join the bad guys to keep them from invading the city they're in. Luke is lured by his friends to the Empire and Darth Vader.Getting close to the intense part of the movie, they take Luke, Leia, and Han to a new place. Han gets frozen in carbonite. You'll see him like this in the next movie. When everyone leaves except for Luke and Darth Vader, the battle of all battles commences.As their fight ensues, they reach an area where if you fall, that is almost certainly your doom. Darth traps Luke and chops his lightsaber along with his right arm and they both fall down. Luke tells Darth that he killed his father.And then, the big twist............ are you ready? Here it is. After Luke says that here is what Darth saysNo, Luke. I am your father. In my opinion, best twist they made back then. Naturally, Luke denies this. Darth offers Luke to join the Dark Side, but instead, like any crazy fool, he jumps. He calls to Leia, using the Force (foreshadowing? Maybe...) and he gets rescued. They look for Han, and the movie ends.How was that? Make your pick on which of the original ones was the best. I don't care, really. George Lucas is awesome. The movies are awesome.

I don't know a lot of people who don't know how it ends.I will tell the story as best as I can since I don't have it at home (it's sad, I know) We begin at a very cold planet where Luke goes out and is missing. Many people want to give up searching for him. Meanwhile, Luke gets kidnapped by the 1980's version of an alien Abominable Snowman. After escaping the monster and killing it (I think), Luke goes out into the blizzard and sees Obi-Wan's spirit in the distance, telling him to go to Yoda on the planet Dagobah, and continue training. Han Solo finds him, about to freeze to death, and rescues him. Back at the base, they treat him and he makes a full recovery. Later on in the movie, the evil guys come to the planet and attack using those AT-AT walkers. The big battle begins and of course, the good guys win. What did you expect? On Dagobah, a little green man meets with Luke and R2D2. He is revealed to be Yoda. What I find cool is that Frank Oz has done the voice of Yoda for all of the Star Wars movies. You can tell that it's him in the Return of the Jedi because when he says When 900 years old you reach, looking good you will not be he sounds like Fozzie from the Muppets. Luke starts his training.Skipping a bit, the gang meets Lando Calrissian, the former owner of the Millennium Falcon. They all try to evade the Empire, but they realized that they've been tricked by Lando, who says that he had to join the bad guys to keep them from invading the city they're in. Luke is lured by his friends to the Empire and Darth Vader.Getting close to the intense part of the movie, they take Luke, Leia, and Han to a new place. Han gets frozen in carbonite. You'll see him like this in the next movie. When everyone leaves except for Luke and Darth Vader, the battle of all battles commences.As their fight ensues, they reach an area where if you fall, that is almost certainly your doom. Darth traps Luke and chops his lightsaber along with his right arm and they both fall down. Luke tells Darth that he killed his father.And then, the big twist............ are you ready? Here it is. After Luke says that here is what Darth saysNo, Luke. I am your father. In my opinion, best twist they made back then. Naturally, Luke denies this. Darth offers Luke to join the Dark Side, but instead, like any crazy fool, he jumps. He calls to Leia, using the Force (foreshadowing? Maybe...) and he gets rescued. They look for Han, and the movie ends.How was that? Make your pick on which of the original ones was the best. I don't care, really. George Lucas is awesome. The movies are awesome. Watch and you won't be disappointed.

At least it's a story about a distinctively American phenomena - gold prospecting in the late 1800s - not the 57th contemporary take on Romeo and Juliet, rehashing the same supposedly timeless subjects again and again. In fact, it's a delightfully homegrown story, and its tongue in cheek awareness of its own make it up as you go ethic is wholly part of the movies charm. And what's not universal about striking out on your own in the company of kindred spirits met along the way? The music is downright terrific, there's not a bad tune in the bunch. I'm particularly fond of Hand me down that can of beans as performed by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (it doesn't appear on any of their albums). Wandrin' Star and I Talk to the Trees are so catchy that even Lee Marvin's croaking and Clint Eastwood's warbling, respectively, can't muck 'em up. The big hit of course is Maria (mar-eye-ah), but from the rousing opening opening theme (Where am I going, I don't know. When will I get there, I ain't certain. What will I do, I ain't equipped to say. But, who gives a damn I'm on my way! ) it's clear that the film is carried along by quite a different sort of manic-depressive momentum. From The first thing you know to Ben's wedding day to Four Cabin Walls to The Best things in life are dirty to No-name city the plot just rollicks along. Maybe I've been working in Silicon Valley too long, but anyone I know who's been here for a while thinks this is a great flick.

You won't be able to forget the imagery, the catchy storyline, and the unforgettable performances by Ed Norton and Bradd Pitt.Poor Jack has not been having a good life. He has had a busy year, he is an insomniac, he goes to several anonymous meetings just to keep himself busy. Every meeting he attends, a beautiful woman named Marla always follows him. She even attends the testicular cancer one (LMAO!).While on a flight home from a business trip, Jack meats a man named Tyler Durden. Tyler is a soap salesman, and after poor old Jack finds out his home has been blown up, he goes to live with Tyler in an old abandoned house. Soon, Jack and Tyler create their own club called Fight Club, an underground club where people can hold fights.Soon, the project becomes controversial and turns into something called Project Mayhem, a club planned by Tyler, where every night, each member causes destruction and chaos. It's only a matter of time before Jack becomes confused, and things spiral out of control.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw this back in January, and I thought it was gonna be the same old fight movie, but it's not! I couldn't believe what I was missing. I didn't know how amazing it was going to be! Plus, there's a HUGE twist at the end, that will shock you like no other, and leave you breathless! So if you like movies like this, this is a total must have.

However, having just re-watched the theatrical release (for the first time in years), I was amazed to see some glaringly obvious errors in continuity.After reading a few of the more in-depth comments about the film on IMDb, I am now aware that the originally released cut was something of a 'Frankenstein's monster' a mixture of footage shot by director Richard Donner and his eventual replacement, Richard Lester. But even despite its narrative glitches&#151;the unfortunate result of studio meddling&#151; it still manages to be a pretty fun superhero film.Christopher Reeve returns as the Man of Steel&#151;faster than a speeding bullet and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound&#151;and, once again, he must save the Earth from danger, which this time comes in the form of three super-villains each possessing the same powers as himself. He also has to come to terms with the fact that, sometimes, being a superhero ain't that great in order to spend his life with the woman he loves (Lois Lane, played by Margot Kidder), he must give up his powers.The action in this film is great starting with an exciting set-piece atop the Eiffel tower and culminating in a terrific showdown between Superman and his three evil counterparts (played by Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran). Superman II provides more genuine excitement than half-a-dozen modern superhero films, proving that good ideas are far more important than jaw-dropping CGI.It is only when scenes from Donner's vision obviously jar with Lester's footage that the film stumbles there are quite a few inconsistencies in the plot, and when things aren't explained very well (such as how Superman actually gets his powers back), I tend to get a bit antsy. A lot of viewers seem to have a big problem with Lester's more comedic approach; I don't mind this too much, as I find that it suits the comic-book style (I think a lot of films based on comics take themselves far too seriously).I am interested to see Donner's cut of the film, which has recently been released on DVD; the general consensus seems to be that it is the better version. Until then, I am content with the cut that I currently own. It's lightweight entertainment, and certainly a lot better than Superman Returns.
