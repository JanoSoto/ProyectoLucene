So that pretty much discounts anything they have to say. If you've never been through it yourself, who are you to say who can and cannot do it? Moving on...I thought this enjoyable, Demi Moore is very convincing as she buffed herself up for this role and is pretty amazing to watch doing those one-armed push-ups and sit-ups. The hard work she put into getting into shape really shows, and I commend her for it.Viggo Mortenson reminded me of a Drill Sergeant I had, the way he had an underlying humor but was still tough as nails. Mortenson was also very fit, though kind of skinny, but he also did a rather good job. I was especially happy to see the way he thought of Jordan as just one of the team, as shown when he makes one trainee pay for leaving her behind.Anne Bancroft is wonderfully evil. That's pretty much all there is to say. She epitomizes what a corrupt politician is.Now, onto the subject of Jordan's sex change. I disagree with those who say the movie should not have called for her to shave her head. I realize her motivation for doing it seemed to be so she would fit in better, but for practical reasons, she should've shaved it anyway. It was laughable to see her going through PT and having her long flowing down her shoulders. Having one strand out of my bun would've warranted me a good 50 push-ups...this is SEAL training, it wouldn't be tolerated. So I think shaving her head was a good thing to put in.It does seem she loses a lot of her femininity throughout the movie, but while it may not be a good thing, it's a realistic thing. How many women could go through what she went through but come out still as a girly girl who wears cute dresses and has her hair nice and long? ZERO. In order to really become a team, she became one of them. It happens even in today's military.I'm no expert on SEALS training, but there are some things I find rather odd.(1) This free time they have to go in and shower quietly by themselves! At BCT, there were 15 girls in a shower and we had 5 minutes to get done and get back in formation. My training was nowhere NEAR what the SEALS go through, so I doubt they'd have any easier time.(2) The time Jordan had to work out on her own. For one thing, where'd she get all that time anyway? And another, the human body NEEDS TO SLEEP. She would be too exhausted to push herself so far in the few moments she had off. Stress fractures and severe fatigue would most certainly set in.Those are my only real complaints, everything is--as far as I know--rather well-displayed. The live fire exercises brought back a couple memories of my own, as well as running around with a boat over their heads (though in my case it was a log). Like I said though, I'm not a SEAL, so if one comes up to me and tells me the movie was completely wrong...I'll believe them! Now for the big question...could women be SEALS? Or even in combat at all? I don't know about SEALS, I just don't have enough information to say...their training is very secretive, you don't know anything till you're there. So the only people who would know if women could make it or not are--well, no one.Now in combat, yes, they can. And they should. But with that responsibility, comes more pressure. If women were to be allowed in the infantry, then they should meet the same standards as the men, not have them lowered so it's easier. That includes a 25 mile ruck march, and all the PT standards in the test. You want to be one of the best, you have to earn it. It's not impossible. I've seen women who run faster and do more push-ups than a lot of guys, I'm one of them.It's been proved time and time again that women can function in combat, so that's not a valid argument. But a big problem that comes up (and is mentioned in the movie) is that men will automatically try to save the woman. I agree. But do I think women should be punished because of that? No. Just because some (I emphasize SOME) men can't deal with it doesn't mean the military should discriminate against women, it just means those men shouldn't be in the combat either. A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's, and it's old-fashioned and ridiculous that some men still hold to a different view than that.Well, there's my review. All in all, I think the movie was good, so I gave it a 6, it's definitely worth seeing...if you go into it with an open mind and don't listen to those who don't know what they're talking about.

","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"3 January 2007","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm perfectly willing to allow Clint Eastwood his pronouncement of ambiguity regarding the character of 'The Stranger', and have read with interest the many opinions offered in the reviews and threads on this site. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times over the years, but today it was with the express intent of crystallizing my opinion. As I've felt all along, the character of The Stranger is indeed a mortal man, the brother of the slain town marshal Jim Duncan, and I'll get into that in a minute.Let's keep in mind that Eastwood himself has had quite some time to reflect on his direction and portrayal in the film, and the subject of a ghostly apparition had time to take hold of viewer consciousness. The film itself has added to the controversy, at least twice via statements made by hotel owner Lewis Belding (Ted Hartley). The first time occurs right after he supervises the evacuation of his hotel, remarking disparagingly to the Preacher (Robert Donner) - ...they're emptyin' my whole hotel, throwing out paying guests right into the street just to make room for our new guardian angel. Later, when addressing Lago's citizens at a town meeting right after the dinner scene with The Stranger and Callie - ...couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago. So right there you have the seeds planted for both an avenging angel and a demon bent on revenge.There IS a real mystery to the film, but it's not the identity of 'The Stranger'. To fully understand, it's important to view the movie in it's unedited form via tape or DVD. Watching High Plains Drifter on TV, even a cable channel leaves too much out, particularly in the way of dialog, and especially regarding the character of Callie (Marianna Hill) and her relationship to the people in the town.The movie offers two flashback scenes, the first by 'The Stranger' only about twenty minutes into the story, the second by Mordecai (Billy Curtis), again shortly after the evacuation of the hotel guests. In both flashbacks, one is able to recognize every citizen of Lago that we already know by name, EXCEPT ONE. About midway in each scene, a character is shown entering from, and then retreating back into the shadows, with half of a bearded face visible. It's the face of The Stranger. The reason Eastwood's character can recall with clarity what occurred on the night Marshal Duncan was killed is because he was there. The mystery then becomes why he was powerless at the time to intervene on his brother's behalf. Presumably he wasn't a citizen of Lago, or he would be recognized, so there must have been another reason for him to be there. Visiting his brother, certainly, but for reasons unknown and unexplored, 'The Stranger' did not become involved at the time of his brother's death.The one person who had an inkling to The Strangers' identity I feel, was Sarah Belding, making reference to the dead marshal in an unmarked grave. But The Stranger wasn't biting, he intended to remain anonymous, a position he affirmed when he first checked into Belding's hotel and didn't register. Sure he could have used a phony name, but then some of the mystique he was attempting to establish would have been compromised.I'm quite intrigued reading some of the threads maintaining certainty regarding The Stranger being a 'spirit' citing reactions the character has, as if one could actually know how a spirit would go about his business. But since we're playing that game, I'd offer two reasons why he couldn't be a spirit or a demon. On the ride into town, The Stranger's reflection is shown on one of the store front windows as he goes past. Then in the first bar scene, The Stranger's arm casts a shadow on the wall as he takes his beer. Granted, most of my spirit and demon lore has come from other movies and popular literature, but I believe that both of those occurrences aren't possible with beings from the other side. What REALLY intrigues me now is if Eastwood was clever enough to consciously plant those things in the film to keep everyone and his brother (no pun there) guessing. Oh, and one last thing - if The Stranger really WAS a ghost, then who's ghost was the horse he rode in on?When I first entered a rating for this film on IMDb, I gave it a strong '8' as one of the upper echelon film Westerns, right up there with High Noon, Shane, and Eastwood's own Unforgiven. However now, after having so much fun watching and re-watching the movie, and reading some of the great discussion on this site, that has to warrant at least two bonus points, I'm re-establishing my rating as a '10'.One last thing - if you're interested in hearing Clint Eastwood himself describe who\/what the character of The Stranger represents, head over to his website at http\/\/www.clinteastwood.net\/welcome2.htmlFollow the links to the movie, and then click on the audio icon for High Plains Drifter.

Once again Harvey Keitel is the doomed figure, a man with such a self-destructive impulse that it'll lead him to nowhere decent. But this time he's not a cop on completely the edge of society and self, but a movie director who is making a film with such high-intensity, raw emotional drama that it would make John Cassavetes wince. The main actors in Eddie's movie (Keitel) are Sara (Madonna) and Francis (James Russo) become victim to that old tune of art imitating life, or vice versa (as the chicken came from the egg and back again sort of thing) that starts to make the film within Dangerous Game a very volatile situation. All the while Eddie's demands on his actors involve spiritual death via drugs and alcohol and mutual decay towards one another, an abusive relationship where the sexual games have gone sour and all that's left is remorse and contempt depending on the beat. Soon this seeps out for real, as Francis can't distinguish from acting or reality, and a rape scene within the movie becomes all too real on the set. And, of course, this leads further for Eddie's own path of horror.Unlike Ferrara's previous film, this time Keitel's character doesn't have that possibility for redemption- in Hollywood, in search of the most brutally honest picture, Eddie Israel won't stop until he practically gets what he's got bottled up inside right onto screen, no matter what it does to his actors whom he professes to enjoy and be friendly with (and with Sara more-so). He indulges in drink and more importantly women via the movie business, while still keeping up appearances with his wife (Nancy Ferrara) and little boy. So with this lack of Eddie meeting towards any kind of possible sign of hope- and keep in mind the Herzog clip from Burden of Dreams- it's almost despair for despair's sake. And watching the scenes being filmed by the actors(The Mother of the Mirrors), though not totally awful, I'm reminded of the old Gene Siskel line about the actors eating lunch being more interesting than the movie itself. Still with these flaws noticed, not to mention a very strange ending that leaves off the character's in some kind of demise either real or filmic (maybe it's the point), it's still a good film, or rather a film that defies its own experimental boundaries to be always fascinating, if only to a film buff like myself.I liked individual scenes very much, like one where Keitel's character directs Madonna's Sara into delivering lines to the camera believably by insulting her as a 'commercial whore', to which she finally gives him what he wants (it's something that is sometimes mentioned among directors or other actors trying to get believable turns by the other actor), or in seeing the a very understated scene where Keitel and Madonna do a slow dance out by a pool and he sings a soft tune. I also loved the scene involving Keitel and Ferrara (how she's related to the director I don't know) when he reveals to her his major transgressions as she has returned home for her father's funeral (just casting her, too, is wise in showing someone very believable as a person in Hollywood's good & normal side). What helps too is the willingness of the principle actors to just give it their all, as if they'd kill to get what they're doing right for the director, murky script and all. Truth be told, I found this to be a real high point for Madonna as an actress, not playing some easier part to play like in Desperately Seeking Susan or League of Their Own, but having to actually tap into her more decadent side that she loved (at the time) to make as a part of her media image. Russo, too, is good here, if maybe almost dangerously one-note as a man so intense and method that he threatens the whole production.Finally, there's Keitel, who never ceases to amaze me with what he can do even in moments when the material gives him little to do but to look off in a scene with a stare or expression of inner-hell. Actually, that's one of the things he's probably perfected since the 1970s. He has moments where he bends his demanding exterior, and there's tenderness to be found within the self-destructiveness in Eddie. The only problem then lies with Keitel lacking a means to really channel this into something leading somewhere- by the end his character doesn't know what he'll do with the film, or how to finish it, and this sort of abrupt ending leaves the actors as well as the film in the cold. But as a film about film-making, I've seen worse, and I might even like it more if I catch it late one night on cable (definitely *that* kind of movie).

I bought it for my wife a few years ago and we have watched it several times now. It's one of her faves. I think I can make reasonably critical remarks because I've been over the same territory so much. Let's get the criticism out of the way from the beginning. I have two main objections. One, this is a woman's movie that is unapologetically pro-female and seriously anti-male in character. When the men aren't being portrayed as egotistical, selfish, and cruel, they are annoying or clueless. It gets a bit tiresome. In fact, one is surprised that a couple of them make the cut over the long haul because these ladies don't think much of men, in general, that is, unless they are completely domesticated and worshipful. Second is Oliver Stone's unrelenting attack upon the viewer's emotional homeostasis. He comes at you again and again, dragging an emotional response out of you over and over without significant letup. In so doing, he goes over the top a bit, but most of the feeling generated is honest and genuinely acted. One definitely gets the sense that the Chinese (or at least this group of them) are very sentimental people, which doesn't quite jibe with their rather stern and inscrutable image in the world at large. One of my favorite scenes was the one at the beauty parlor between Auntie Lindo and her daughter Waverly, where Waverly confesses that even a look from her mother used to make her cry herself to sleep. Lindo's reaction to this otherwise troubling info was a simple, Now you have made me happy. Then there's the scene in the kitchen after the dinner party between June and her Mom (who sad to say wasn't long for this world). That's where she tells June that for her she has, only hope, assuring her that, I see you. Both of these scenes are very touching. The finale, where June arrives in China to see her long lost half-sisters is a real tear-jerker, as well. Some of the scenes in this movie were rather troubling, however. At the top of the list would have to be the young Ying Ying's sacrifice of her infant son to get back at her selfish and cruel husband. He certainly deserved to be hurt, but to take it out on the baby boy? That I couldn't forgive her for. The same woman, in middle age, was understandably critical of her daughter's unbelievably cheap and pompous husband, but for her to judge him so harshly after the terrible thing she had done in her youth was hypocritical. An interesting sidelight is that this actress was the same young lady who played Leat, the beautiful native girl in the movie South Pacific.Speaking of that, this flick was an exploration of the natural beauty of oriental women. Which one of them was the most alluring? It was quite a contest. I'd say the two most beautiful women in the cast (at least of the older generation) were the young Ying Ying and An Mei's mother, the lovely woman whom we first saw wearing a fashionable hat, who became a fourth wife and didn't know her worth, and finally who committed suicide for her daughter's sake. Less for their absolute beauty than their special appeal was Lindo's mother in China and June's mother in America. Among the daughters, it was a tossup. Probably either Waverly or Lena was the most attractive, but June had a sensuous quality and certainly gave them a run for the money. Rose, although somewhat less beautiful, was also appealing. You can't go wrong with Joy Luck Club if you appreciate the beauty of Chinese women. Just make sure you have something absorbent handy when you sit down to watch because you're going to need it.

On the contrary, feelings get in the way of any intelligent response. Or in others words feelings modulate intelligent responses. Up to the point of blocking any intelligent response. For example if you are in the path of a car that is speeding toward you, the intelligent response would be to get out of the way. But if you get scared (a feeling) you may get frozen, thus fear would block your intelligent response and may get you killed. So as you can see feelings are somewhat opposed to intelligent responses in the sense that feeling can make that the response would be not as intelligent as they should be. And that is true for every feeling you may think of love, hate, fear, you name it. How many times you have seen a guy making a fool of himself because he's in love? The examples are endless.

Artificial Intelligence deals with a hosts of search methods, computer methods, who allows computers to exhibit intelligent responses to an usually changing environment.

The industry nowadays uses a lot of robotics elements than can perform their task without a hint of intelligence. There are task however, where some sort of intelligence is required. But we will get to that later. There have always been some confusion about what intelligence is. I am not sure scientifics have reached a definition which encompasses all the requirements. But of one thing I am sure feelings are not part of any of these definitions. You can be a perfectly intelligent being without have any feelings. On the contrary, feelings get in the way of any intelligent response. Or in others words feelings modulate intelligent responses. Up to the point of blocking any intelligent response. For example if you are in the path of a car that is speeding toward you, the intelligent response would be to get out of the way. But if you get scared (a feeling) you may get frozen, thus fear would block your intelligent response and may get you killed. So as you can see feelings are somewhat opposed to intelligent responses in the sense that feeling can make that the response would be not as intelligent as they should be. And that is true for every feeling you may think of love, hate, fear, you name it. How many times you have seen a guy making a fool of himself because he's in love? The examples are endless. So if you have read up to this point you may be getting the picture and may be starting to understand the big fiasco this movie is. This movie is about making a robot that behaves like a human. That's not Artificial Intelligence. That's an Artificial Human Being manufacturing. I wonder what good one may find on making artificial human beings when it is too easy --and enjoyable-- to make them the usual way. But that's just another story. So what's Artificial Intelligence and when it is needed? Artificial Intelligence deals with a hosts of search methods, computer methods, who allows computers to exhibit intelligent responses to an usually changing environment. Also to act as experts on fields such as --but not limited to-- medicine and complex equipment repairment. Optical Character recognition, game playing, natural language understanding are the main areas where Artificial Intelligence is applied. When a robot is working in an environment when Artificial Intelligence is needed --such as in shape recognition -- then a computer is attached to the robot in order to make the needed calculations.

So a true improvement is introduced into his life-style when he gets crashed into by a horny Hunter, who wastes no time in masturbating to her unsuspecting victim, while they both bleed. However, the victim, Spader, soon learns to appreciate the not-oft recognized sexual qualities of metal and steel, and joins Hunter and her deranged car-freaks in an odyssey of self-exploration (not to mention self-mutilation). Then there is his perpetually horny girlfriend, Deborah K.U.; this woman thinks with her vagina all the time - to the point where her brain is in a constant comatose state (hence her slow and pointless utterances). She is so horny that even an (intentional) accident can't put her off sex; this happens at the end, when Spader goes at it like a bunny, but not before asking her are you alright. Oh, why not...

This is major competition for Sisters. Major. The list of things this film's dumb director expected to get away with is truly staggeringly long. So, without further ado, let's go through the list of absurdities, illogicalities, and other cretinisms 1) How did Harry Connick, Jr. know that Weaver would go to the toilet after the speech (where she just happened to be the only one using it at that time) and why was there no explanation as to why she had police escort? 2) It was utterly predictable - from the very beginning - that both Mulroney and Weaver's gay assistant would be dead by the end of the film, 3) The mass murderer is once again a walking movie cliché he knows everything anyone will do at any given time anyplace; he is not only a scientist, he is also a top computer expert, a top breaking-into-houses expert (with full Pink Panther gear), a top actor, a top murderer, knows all there is to know about equipment of any kind, and, of course, he knows all about the infamous mass murderers that he copies - where did he find the time to learn all this? He'd have to be at least 200 years old to know all this. A team of twenty people would be needed to carry out all that he did to such fine, perfect detail. The bad guy is a genius - fine; however, that shouldn't make him a god. But in this silly film he is no less than that, 4) When Hunter puts a bullet through him at the end, does he drop to the floor? No he just stands there, slowly turns around and grins (not again!). Excuse me? The guy's been shot at close range he should fall to the ground, possibly showing some pain, 5) The actor playing the villain is far too weak to be taking on a role of this kind; his pitiful imitations of Jack Nicholson and co. are irritating (I'm mostly referring to his cartoon-like grin, which tortures the poor viewer to no end - and not because he is an insane killer, but because it's bad acting). Kevin Spacey did wonders with his similar character in Seven (sure, he was also directed by a top director), 6) Hunter shoots the Chinese, than the Chinese shoots Mulroney an unnecessary (and unconvincingly directed) twist that takes Mulroney out of the (main) story through a meaningless sub-sub-plot, or was Amiel (who the hell is this guy?) trying to involve us into the uninteresting sub-plot concerning Hunter's ex-boyfriend? I am talking about the scene coming soon after Mulroney's death when Patton does the crying bit (yes, the crying bit when I wasn't sure if he was faking it or if he meant it - bad direction should have been obvious), 7) Are we really supposed to swallow the premise concerning Connick, Jr. giving orders to his disciples while in jail? 8) The scene in which Weaver looks through the keyhole and sees two cops only to find out she's been duped is possibly the dumbest scene in the film (and competition is tough in this department), 9) the feminism and some heavy PC, at the beginning, were irritating, 10) Hunter's boss tells her to stay away from Weaver; another movie cliché, of the main cop's boss hindering the investigation through sheer illogicality, and so on...I'll say it again, although I've said it a million times I can tolerate a certain amount of clichés and absurdities, but when the fine line between acceptable nonsense and unacceptable nonsense gets crossed, that's when I start to spew poison at a movie.As amazing as it sounds - considering how much I already spat at it - the film has some plus points; the scene in which the main villain sends Weaver a visual message through the Internet is quite effective; the dialogues are generally okay and the same goes for &#150; some of - the acting. The film's first half is quite good and very interesting, but at a certain point the uninspired stupidity of the director and the writer takes over and from then on there was only total disbelief am I really watching something THIS dumb? is this level of idiocy possible in a film?

This is major competition for Sisters. Major. The list of things this film's dumb director expected to get away with is truly staggeringly long. So, without further ado, let's go through the list of absurdities, illogicalities, and other cretinisms 1) How did Harry Connick, Jr. know that Weaver would go to the toilet after the speech (where she just happened to be the only one using it at that time) and why was there no explanation as to why she had police escort? 2) It was utterly predictable - from the very beginning - that both Mulroney and Weaver's gay assistant would be dead by the end of the film, 3) The mass murderer is once again a walking movie cliché he knows everything anyone will do at any given time anyplace; he is not only a scientist, he is also a top computer expert, a top breaking-into-houses expert (with full Pink Panther gear), a top actor, a top murderer, knows all there is to know about equipment of any kind, and, of course, he knows all about the infamous mass murderers that he copies - where did he find the time to learn all this? He'd have to be at least 200 years old to know all this. A team of twenty people would be needed to carry out all that he did to such fine, perfect detail. The bad guy is a genius - fine; however, that shouldn't make him a god. But in this silly film he is no less than that, 4) When Hunter puts a bullet through him at the end, does he drop to the floor? No he just stands there, slowly turns around and grins (not again!). Excuse me? The guy's been shot at close range he should fall to the ground, possibly showing some pain, 5) The actor playing the villain is far too weak to be taking on a role of this kind; his pitiful imitations of Jack Nicholson and co. are irritating (I'm mostly referring to his cartoon-like grin, which tortures the poor viewer to no end - and not because he is an insane killer, but because it's bad acting).

I have read the other comments posted about this movie so I will try to be original.First of all, I have been to Chicago and there are freeways everywhere! Even after they got off of the freeway they could have found one of many to get out of the bad side of town. A possible goof, when they leave Franks house it is broad daylight then in the next shot with them driving on the highway it is dark. One may think that they had a bit of a drive to get to downtown Chicago, but later Frank says that they are only 10 minutes from home. The fight scene on the highway It's that both, the man and the woman in the truck are saying fu*k you to Ray, but when they began to get out and fight the woman just sat in the truck and simply said leave him alone. She barely even looked back. As they are driving through town (before hitting the kid) they pass several well lit streets, they continue down the dark road. After hitting the guy with the RV (even though Ray is a dipstick) they should have listened to him and got the hell out of there, especially when the gang jerks the kids out and starts arguing with him. Instead they keep looking out the back window to see what is going to happen to him. Duhh!! Fast forwarding to the end of the movie (since I don't have time to decipher the entire thing) it was odd when Frank was going into the office of the supermarket (after killing Fallon) and the police officer barges in with gun drawn and tells him to freeze. Frank tells him that his friend and brother are upstairs bleeding to death, and the cop stands his ground. All of the sudden another officer who wasn't even in the room and couldn't have possibly heard Frank, comes in and says it's alright, he's telling the truth! Then all of the sudden the first officer lowers his gun and they go running out of the office. Come on, I am a Cincinnati Police Officer and there would be more to it than that!!

It's more than just a Horror movie; it's a terrifying visual experience covered with tension, a creepy atmosphere, beautiful gore, and a chilling score.Suspiria is the perfect mix of elements in order to create a memorable Horror movie. The atmosphere is unsettling and always creepy. There's a feeling of uncertainty and fear throughout the movie that truly makes you feel part of the experience. Many reviewers have mentioned the relevance of the colorful art direction of the movie. I just want to mention that the fore-mentioned art techniques are visually stunning and give a special vibe for the movie. The colors play important roles for the most important events, and helps the viewer understand some situations. I agree that this is among the most beautiful Horror movies ever made; talking about visuals. The perfect combination between colors and dark is brilliant.There's also room for beautiful gore. The first murder sequence is amazing because it's creative, surreal, and very violent. You don't expect a maniac to crash the window and slaughter poor Pat. The reset of the movie has minimal but great gore. The death scenes are overall impressive and are featured through spectacular camera angles. For example, Daniel's death scene is memorable because before the gore happens, visuals take an important role in the scene when the devil's statue makes an appearance and then suddenly disappears before the dog attack. It's a chilling and scary scene. Also, the chilling ending deserves some special recognition for it's rich directing techniques, the great use of colors, and mainly because the high fear factor. The threatening dialogs of the Black Queen, the dead girl who comes to life (who in my opinion inspired the possessed woman from Evil Dead II), the witch's silhouette, the great gore, the make-up... My respects. It's truly one of the most creepy endings in Horror movies history. Argento knows perfectly how to display terror. So there you go, you have a visually stunning Horror movie. It's a visual experience in terror like none other. Believe the hype. The score also plays an important factor in the movie. The chilling music (probably inspired by The Exorcist) and the background taunting from the witch is simply memorable. My only problem with Suspiria are the over the top characters in some scenes that only demonstrate that Argento has preferences over theater acting. For example, the scene where Olga and Sara insult each other looked truly cheesy and didn't go with the movie's atmosphere. Also, Pat's cheap acting in the opening sequence, as another example. I am aware of the script changes that weren't made in order to make the girls look older but still. Also, Daniel's acting was over the top when it wasn't necessary. For some moments it looked like Argento's movie was taking a cheesy direction. I'm glad it didn't. Also, some scenes feature stupid actions from the lead characters. Sometimes Argento does not pay close attention to behavior reality and he isn't able to give it to his characters. But that's just my point of view. Jessica Harper delivers a great performance filled with dramatism and fear. She's great in her role and a delight to watch. The cast is overall very good with veteran actors and actresses and some amateurs. The plot is very simple and easy to follow and that's what makes you care about the main character. Argento is a specialist in displaying hints that lead to important events in his movies. I mean, some scenes seem to be insignificant for the plot but suddenly take special relevance for important scenes in order to take the story to a new level. Also, some minimal details shown in the movie should be taken in consideration because most of them may have relevance to the plot. The plot is very simple and easy to follow but the sub-plots, hints, and bits of strangeness makes it delightfully complicated in a positive way. The story goes likes this  a beautiful ballet dancer from USA named Suzy moves to a prestigious and snobby academy in Germany in order to complete a three years course. From the very beginning she experiences strange situations involving the mature women who run the academy; that includes the sub-director, and the house-mistress.

A bit harsh perhaps.This is not so much about Stone playing mind-games on the perpetually-horny Douglas so much as it is about Esterhaz's script playing mind-games with the viewer. An extremely convoluted plot; this level of complexity is more often found in political thrillers than in regular cops'n'robbers ones. I'll give credit to Esterhaz for creating a very interesting, original story, but the man isn't undeservedly known for writing illogical scripts. Clearly, his priority is to generate suspense and as many plot twists as possible - no complaints there; those things are always welcome. However, he does this at the expense of the logic; there are so many coincidences, contradictions, and just general far-fetchedness that even a hairless 14mm kangaroo fetus can figure out that various facts do not add up. By the last quarter of the movie all the (more relevant) evidence points to Tripplehorn as the killer. But, Esterhaz being a thrills-at-the-expense-of-logic seeker that he is, made that predictable last-minute thriller-movie twist Stone has an ice pick lying beneath her bed, while she has sex with Douglas in the movie's last scene. What does this mean? It implies that Stone is the killer. (Unless that was a complete coincidence; the ice-pick somehow slid from the kitchen and landed under the bed. Or, perhaps, she placed the ice-pick there knowing that she can play mind-games with the audience as well. Am I being stupid? Not any more than this plot.) However, Tripplehorny had too many motives, too dubious a past, was too emotionally involved - in short far too suspicious - not to be the killer. And the very coincidence of her being in the building when Douglas killed her shakes away the last iota of doubt about her guilt. Yet, Tripplehorny and Stone cannot both be killers. Or can they...? Esterhaz never suggests this, but the only logical explanation, one which would at least tie up some loose ends, would be the following Tripplehorn and Stone were in it together from the very beginning, just for kicks. I know; it sounds ridiculous, and entails additional illogicalities. But it would at least explain how the hell Stone had all that information about Douglas which he himself at one point said only Tripplehorny had knowledge of, or access to. This is never explained. Since the bald, I.A. dead cop wasn't the one who sold the info to Stone (nor could he have - he didn't know the intimate details which only Tripplehorn knew) it must have been Tripplehorn; this is a fact. But if she interacted with Stone then nothing makes any sense. It's a no-win (no-logic) situation. There is also the minor detail of both Stone and Tripplehorn having extremely questionable pasts, with dead bodies lying all around them; this would implicate both.There is absolutely no point in going further into the complexity of illogical errors which Esterhaz undoubtedly commits. He wanted to entertain, and succeeded.

A bit harsh perhaps.This is not so much about Stone playing mind-games on the perpetually-horny Douglas so much as it is about Esterhaz's script playing mind-games with the viewer. An extremely convoluted plot; this level of complexity is more often found in political thrillers than in regular cops'n'robbers ones. I'll give credit to Esterhaz for creating a very interesting, original story, but the man isn't undeservedly known for writing illogical scripts. Clearly, his priority is to generate suspense and as many plot twists as possible - no complaints there; those things are always welcome. However, he does this at the expense of the logic; there are so many coincidences, contradictions, and just general far-fetchedness that even a hairless 14mm kangaroo fetus can figure out that various facts do not add up. By the last quarter of the movie all the (more relevant) evidence points to Tripplehorn as the killer. But, Esterhaz being a thrills-at-the-expense-of-logic seeker that he is, made that predictable last-minute thriller-movie twist Stone has an ice pick lying beneath her bed, while she has sex with Douglas in the movie's last scene. What does this mean? It implies that Stone is the killer. (Unless that was a complete coincidence; the ice-pick somehow slid from the kitchen and landed under the bed. Or, perhaps, she placed the ice-pick there knowing that she can play mind-games with the audience as well. Am I being stupid? Not any more than this plot.) However, Tripplehorny had too many motives, too dubious a past, was too emotionally involved - in short far too suspicious - not to be the killer. And the very coincidence of her being in the building when Douglas killed her shakes away the last iota of doubt about her guilt. Yet, Tripplehorny and Stone cannot both be killers. Or can they...? Esterhaz never suggests this, but the only logical explanation, one which would at least tie up some loose ends, would be the following Tripplehorn and Stone were in it together from the very beginning, just for kicks. I know; it sounds ridiculous, and entails additional illogicalities. But it would at least explain how the hell Stone had all that information about Douglas which he himself at one point said only Tripplehorny had knowledge of, or access to. This is never explained. Since the bald, I.A. dead cop wasn't the one who sold the info to Stone (nor could he have - he didn't know the intimate details which only Tripplehorn knew) it must have been Tripplehorn; this is a fact. But if she interacted with Stone then nothing makes any sense. It's a no-win (no-logic) situation. There is also the minor detail of both Stone and Tripplehorn having extremely questionable pasts, with dead bodies lying all around them; this would implicate both.There is absolutely no point in going further into the complexity of illogical errors which Esterhaz undoubtedly commits.

Spielberg has chosen to relate the horrors of the Holocaust through the biographical story of businessman Oskar Schindler. Schindler was an opportunist who decided to exploit the Jews affected by Hitler's final solution and utilize them in his factory. As he witnessed first-hand the repercussions of the Holocaust, he gradually began to take active efforts to save the 1100 Jews in his employ by literally buying their lives. Spielberg's stark black-and-white photography enhances the realism of the film and he directs the material with a refreshing no-frills approach. Spielberg is usually known to be a very sentimental director and what is astonishing about his work for much of the film is how cool and unsentimental it is. This is not an insult, the approach works wonders. He let's the tension and the terror of what unfolds speak for itself without embellishing with tired Hollywood clichés and intrusions. Liam Neeson's performance as Schindler is nuanced, enigmatic and entrancing. He is a person that one never truly gets to know, but his evolution from unconcerned businessman to one who in a sweaty frenzy tries to beat the clock to remember all of the names of his employees in order to save their lives is amazing acting. Spielberg and Neeson never try to turn Schindler into a saint and we get a warts-and-all central character. Ralph Fiennes is also astounding as the thoroughly amoral Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley contributes one of his finest restrained performances as foreman Itzhak Stern. I also found Embeth Davidtz moving in the peripheral role of Helen Hirsch, a young Jewish woman who becomes the beleaguered object of affection for both Goeth and Schindler. The film is required viewing for anyone interested in history, the Holocaust or simply masterful film-making. In fact, the only thing that prevents me from ranking the film at its highest level is its conclusion. Spielberg in his latter years seems to have a problem with providing satisfying codas to his films &#150; the more serious ones provide the greater difficulties. Schindler's List is no exception and I believe that he panders in the final few moments and fails to accept the intelligence of his audience for processing what went before. He has just crafted a perfect account of the events and torn our hearts out in the process &#150; viewers are fully able to comprehend the depth of the accomplishments of Schindler. However, Spielberg seems to feel we need a refresher course. He adds a totally unneeded closing where the real surviving Schindler Jews and their offspring march side-by-side across the screen (all the better to marvel over their numbers) and pay tribute at Schindler's grave. While I must say I was mildly interested in seeing the modern-day equivalents of some of the characters I had just seen on screen, it was like a subtle, insightful film suddenly brandishing a sledgehammer and adopting a totally different approach to make its point. Still, just in case any is still slow on Schindler's accomplishments as a savior, Spielberg then literally types it out for us to remind us exactly how many were saved and how many offspring from future generations have been saved by Schindler's selfless efforts. I really found this drawn-out and needless climax to shatter the mood generated by the earlier portions of the film and it prevents me from rating this a masterpiece.

(The US DVD is part of a black collection called Soul Cinema).Personally, I love blaxploitation movies for their brazen, unsubtle approach and mostly poor production values, but I can also understand why they do not interest a lot of people. Therein lies the tragedy of this great movie, as it bears very little resemblance to blaxploitation other than the fact that it has black people in it. It's pretty low budget, but it's a far cry from the clumsy and mindless tones of Bucktown, the gratuitous titillation of Coffy or the pounding social vengeance of Black Caesar. Even the better received titles like Shaft are unfair comparisons to this. This is no cheap thrill, this is very finely crafted and brilliantly acted piece of cinema.Across 110th Street is really one third cop character piece, one third Mafia crime\/revenge thriller, and one third (black) social drama. This could've been a very clumsy affair but is pulled off extraordinarily well by virtue of having a fantastic script, restrained (almost detached) direction and brilliant performances by a perfectly cast group of very talented actors. I won't single them out, I will simply say that this film boasts one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen.Not wanting to give too much away, the story involves three men from Harlem who steal $300,000 from the mob and spend the rest of the film evading both them and the police investigating the robbery. As if the engaging (if somewhat unoriginal by today's standards) story weren't enough, the real power of this movie is in its ability to evoke the bleak, grim and depressing world in which the story takes place. There is an anger and cynicism just beneath the surface of this movie which is held back so painfully that it will literally leave you numb for days. Every character here is ugly, hopeless, sad and resigned, save for the gangsters, but this is never overplayed. The angst never really gets out, and it stays with you long after the credits role.In my opinion, post-classical Hollywood was American cinema's finest hour. There's a reason it's known as Hollywood's second golden age. What, for me, gives it the edge is that film-makers were suddenly not afraid to present the underbelly of American life - the other side of the American Dream - through real characters that were far from the ideal, wholesome heroes we were used to.It's interesting that many of the comments here draw so much attention to the violence in this movie. While it is fairly strong, it's hardly abundant and it's never over the top or the least bit gratuitous. The best word to sum this film up, for me at least, is subtle. The subtlety and the almost indifferent way the film is presented allow it to really penetrate and get under the skin.

This is no cheap thrill, this is very finely crafted and brilliantly acted piece of cinema.Across 110th Street is really one third cop character piece, one third Mafia crime\/revenge thriller, and one third (black) social drama. This could've been a very clumsy affair but is pulled off extraordinarily well by virtue of having a fantastic script, restrained (almost detached) direction and brilliant performances by a perfectly cast group of very talented actors. I won't single them out, I will simply say that this film boasts one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen.Not wanting to give too much away, the story involves three men from Harlem who steal $300,000 from the mob and spend the rest of the film evading both them and the police investigating the robbery. As if the engaging (if somewhat unoriginal by today's standards) story weren't enough, the real power of this movie is in its ability to evoke the bleak, grim and depressing world in which the story takes place. There is an anger and cynicism just beneath the surface of this movie which is held back so painfully that it will literally leave you numb for days. Every character here is ugly, hopeless, sad and resigned, save for the gangsters, but this is never overplayed. The angst never really gets out, and it stays with you long after the credits role.In my opinion, post-classical Hollywood was American cinema's finest hour. There's a reason it's known as Hollywood's second golden age. What, for me, gives it the edge is that film-makers were suddenly not afraid to present the underbelly of American life - the other side of the American Dream - through real characters that were far from the ideal, wholesome heroes we were used to.It's interesting that many of the comments here draw so much attention to the violence in this movie. While it is fairly strong, it's hardly abundant and it's never over the top or the least bit gratuitous. The best word to sum this film up, for me at least, is subtle. The subtlety and the almost indifferent way the film is presented allow it to really penetrate and get under the skin. There is a very precise and cynical sense of reality, which not only makes the film totally engrossing and believable but also makes it all the more moving as a consequence.

If you like cinema and movies (any kind) don't waste your time. It's just a show off of modified cars and a plot as shallow as the piece of paper it's written on. If you like cars, chases, and scantly clad women (which don't make a good movie at all), then this is for you. Shallow acting. Silly lines. Loud soundtrack. Lousy camera movements. Plastic characters. Flat performances. Amazingly predictable story line. Empty script... Finally I felt myself pushed into adding this line just to fill the minimum. There is really very little that can be added to this movie. And it's quite difficult to find word that define the rage any serious movie-lover feels at seeing this junk being released. As if one sin wasn't enough, they actually made two sequels. This proofs that the minds of the studio bosses and the minds of the teenagers (which are the only ones that can enjoy such a trash) are one and the same. Really the movie does not deserve more. 1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2007","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw this movie because my brother recommended it.
