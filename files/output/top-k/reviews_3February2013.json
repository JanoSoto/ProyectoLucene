In every shot, one can see texture, whether it is in the landscape of a bedroom or a hotel room, or the structure of a man or woman's face. The cinematography is dark and gloomy. The story, as you likely know, as you have either seen the film, or have read the IMDb summary, is about Claus von Bulow, who has been accused of attempting to murder his wife twice, both times sending her into a coma, the first coma which lasts only a few hours, the second which lasted until 2008 and turned Sunny Bulow into a vegetable. The story is, as all good stories are, so multilayered that it seems to evolve as time goes along. Unlike most films made nowadays, and indeed most stories told in history, it is not linear and obvious. The story threatens to go in any direction at any time. All of the characters seem human, balancing on the line of their own soul and being, reaching out toward other people or retracting into themselves. The Main characters are Claus Von Bulow, Sunny Bulow, and Alan Dershowitz. They are each played by great actors. The film is expertly directed and represents each of these characters separate lives. The viewer sees each character as sympathetic but realizes at certain points throughout the film that the characters may have reached a turning point and made a bad choice or perverted their hearts goodness and done wrong towards another. The film has a lot of subtext. Though the characters do come out and state what they are thinking at various points, for the most part the film shows, not tells. Although all the actors do good jobs in this film, the crown must be placed on the head of Jeremy Irons, one of the greatest actors in history. Irons is often mocked for being very dense and inanimated, I personally think this is because most film watchers are used to actors who are less subtle and less skilled than Irons. His subtlety is extraordinary. This performance may be the most subtle in film history. The performance is mysterious and dark, unexpressibly creepy, but also sympathetic. At one point int he film(don't worry, this isn't a spoiler),Claus von Bulow leans slightly forward in a car, with his head almost completely in shadow and responds to Alan Dershowitz claim You are a strange man, with the words You have no idea. Irons is just brilliant. His performance must be seen. The film as a whole explores many theme, favoring emotion and thematic depth over bare bones plot. One of the more interesting themes is the idea that every moment is in the now, and so every human being is freshly born every minute and so they must be forgiven for wrong things they have done in the past. Another theme is the idea that no one truly knows another person, that all people have secrets, hidden characteristics and emotions that are hidden even to themselves as well as to other people. This is the theme I fell that this patient film expresses best. It is well paced and allows you to feel every scene before moving on to the next. The film also explores the importance of humor and the need for humor in humanity. This provides great unexpected moments throughout the film. This is one of my favorite films in history. It is so patient in the camera-work and performances. It feels like more than an interpretation. It feels like a reality or at least a possibility. This is a rare achievement. It is an uncategorizable experience, a great work of art, and a film of astonishing depth. It is one of the few that reaches the true depth of the soul. it does not only confirm something that other films have told us. It twists and turns, until the viewer and the film and the characters are all one. An excellent film.

French New Wave they called it. And what did I think of 'Breathless' fifty years on after viewing the anniversary DVD. Well, I'm not sure which I found funnier, reading the other comments eulogising over Jean-Luc Godard or the movie itself. This exaggerated snapshot of Parisian sub-culture circa 1959 simply does qualify as a 'Great Film'. Great films are like great music. You would not say Tchaikovsky's Pathetique was a great symphony for 1893 it is a great symphony this or any other year. Gone with the Wind and All Quiet on the Western Front are great films because they are as watchable now as they were when first produced. I have watched both 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg' and 'Un Homme et une Femme' in the last six months.Both films are of the same decade as Breathless but survive much better. Suffice to say that Breathless may have wooed them in 1960 but it wouldn't today.Each generation has produced films which seemed chic and fashionable on opening but which quickly become nothing more than clichés for the period in which they were produced. They became nostalgic and amusing reminders of a seemingly more innocent age. It is however worth watching this film for no other reason than seeing Jean Seberg. She is mesmerising.I remember falling in love with that beautiful face and she even made bobbysocks seem cool! How tragic it is that she died so young. Yes, this film is a collector's item but I'm not sure it's necessarily for the right reasons. I can't profess to being a Godard devotee. In my opinion he's over-hyped but people continue to go into intellectual overdrive to express their admiration of his style. Anyone though who can produce a blockbuster on a shoestring budget does deserve some respect. He would seem to be a director that is above criticism and that is is ridiculous.

An engaging story that combines edge-of-your-seat excitement, stunning conceived stunts and sight gags, spectacular set pieces, touching sentiment, and a rousing finale (Steven D. Greydanus); imaginative masterpiece (Tim Dirks); a production where one inspiration builds into another; (Roger Ebert). Yes, the Great Stone Face, the nickname that Buster Keaton was known under, still proves that his occupation was truly a comedian and an acrobat of exceptional talent.However, before Roger Ebert stated memorably We don't laugh at Keaton, but identify with him, Keaton's great achievement had gone through true storms of doubts and irritations where both film scholars and the audiences were undergoing a 'catharsis of perception growths.' The infantile Love, Locomotives and Laughs (posters); the unjust flop (Variety); bizarre opinion of fun is not exactly plentiful (New York Times); aimless neither straight comedy nor an altogether thrilling drama (The Los Angeles Times), similarly to the story's hero Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton), needed a harsh test of getting ready to 'be lined' among the worthy ones...productions deserving the label 'classic.' But before I outline some facts about the movie, let me highlight one important reason for the above, the period the movie was filmed in.Although THE GENERAL is now considered one of the best films ever made (arguably the best film by Buster Keaton and the best silent comedy), it is not freed from the very period it was shot in. That is the whole background that does not work so powerfully elsewhere as here. The silent era not only saw its decline in the later 1920s but also achieved a very specific point of cinema's progress. The films combined various elements to amuse and entertain its audiences from the great love stories (and love idols, of course) on screen to action. Where did this action get a better shape if not in A RACE, A CHASE. Yes, the pioneer of that racing tension appeared to be Fred Niblo's BEN HUR, the most colossal silent movie of the time; however, the most authentic, appealing and absorbing for Americans appeared to be, at the time,...train chase. That is what we find in THE GENERAL in an outstanding manner (as Tim Dirks observes that Keaton's production is undoubtedly the best train film ever made).Based on a story THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE by William Pittenger, the movie shows the times of Civil War from an absolutely different perspective deprived of great drama but supplied with challenging adventure (Greydanus observes that as an authentic period feel). In that historical context as well as cinematic challenge, Keaton's film depicts the two train chases (the title General and Texas). Keaton and Bruckman take creative liberties with the literary source as well as people's imagination about the Civil War. The true focus of the movie is its hero, a Southern railway engineer (unlike the character in the book, which makes for the 'united' perception of American nation) who has only two loves in his life - the engine and the southern belle Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Once he is deprived of these two loves (when, actually, the symbolic union and harmony are in jeopardy), he is determined to recapture them. In the most unpredictable, creative, desperate, stunning moments with tension and comic reliefs, viewers experience the greatest adventures of the silent era. How can it be that love may ever be conquered in, most presumably, the happy ending for our hero and his 'heroines'? Tim Dirks points out that THE GENERAL displays marvelous technical and structural perfection, playful comic inventiveness and realistic romance as well as fluid athleticism on the part of Keaton. Perhaps, those features are noticeable in more of his comedies but hardly is there any other of his films where they go in pairs so effectively and memorably as here. From the very first moments when Johnny visits his beloved Annabelle and the Fort Sumter tidings interrupt the peaceful and silent future visions to the climactic river gorge sequence, the viewer is involved in a symphony of emotions. Sometimes, Keaton shocks us with his composure in the center of chaos (Roger Ebert), sometimes, he provides sentimental feelings as a character who is truly in love, sometimes, he makes us laugh in the most ingenious manner with no 'out-of-date' ingredient resulting in laughable reactions.While the most spectacular sequence is the climactic end of chase with Texas falling into the gorge, the funniest sequence appears to be the 'hiding under the table' among the Northerners (where Annabelle is kept as 'a hostage'). Not only is it marked by the creative idea of an iris shot preferred by master of early spectacles D.W. Griffith (Roger Ebert nicely observes that aspect in his review) but also the emotional element of the whole sequence. It draws right parallels between the character's desperate situation and the viewers' comic reliefs (reliefs from tension, not drama).The final note must be made of the brilliant new music score by Robert Israel, Joe Hisaishi and their crew so finely incorporated into the scenes. That score made a tremendous impression on me when I was lucky to see it on the big screen recently.Keaton's supreme silent adventure and comic achievement stands out as a gem of cinema. With reference to Roger Ebert's words, THE GENERAL, like Buster Keaton, appears like a silent visitor to modern expectations of viewers and still holds power to amuse and entertain them in the most unpredictable manner.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"3 February 2013","score":"","review":" Nowadays, when one encounters some film scholars' opinions on this film, the majority occur highly enthusiastic. An engaging story that combines edge-of-your-seat excitement, stunning conceived stunts and sight gags, spectacular set pieces, touching sentiment, and a rousing finale (Steven D. Greydanus); imaginative masterpiece (Tim Dirks); a production where one inspiration builds into another; (Roger Ebert). Yes, the Great Stone Face, the nickname that Buster Keaton was known under, still proves that his occupation was truly a comedian and an acrobat of exceptional talent.However, before Roger Ebert stated memorably We don't laugh at Keaton, but identify with him, Keaton's great achievement had gone through true storms of doubts and irritations where both film scholars and the audiences were undergoing a 'catharsis of perception growths.' The infantile Love, Locomotives and Laughs (posters); the unjust flop (Variety); bizarre opinion of fun is not exactly plentiful (New York Times); aimless neither straight comedy nor an altogether thrilling drama (The Los Angeles Times), similarly to the story's hero Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton), needed a harsh test of getting ready to 'be lined' among the worthy ones...productions deserving the label 'classic.' But before I outline some facts about the movie, let me highlight one important reason for the above, the period the movie was filmed in.Although THE GENERAL is now considered one of the best films ever made (arguably the best film by Buster Keaton and the best silent comedy), it is not freed from the very period it was shot in. That is the whole background that does not work so powerfully elsewhere as here. The silent era not only saw its decline in the later 1920s but also achieved a very specific point of cinema's progress. The films combined various elements to amuse and entertain its audiences from the great love stories (and love idols, of course) on screen to action. Where did this action get a better shape if not in A RACE, A CHASE. Yes, the pioneer of that racing tension appeared to be Fred Niblo's BEN HUR, the most colossal silent movie of the time; however, the most authentic, appealing and absorbing for Americans appeared to be, at the time,...train chase. That is what we find in THE GENERAL in an outstanding manner (as Tim Dirks observes that Keaton's production is undoubtedly the best train film ever made).Based on a story THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE by William Pittenger, the movie shows the times of Civil War from an absolutely different perspective deprived of great drama but supplied with challenging adventure (Greydanus observes that as an authentic period feel). In that historical context as well as cinematic challenge, Keaton's film depicts the two train chases (the title General and Texas). Keaton and Bruckman take creative liberties with the literary source as well as people's imagination about the Civil War. The true focus of the movie is its hero, a Southern railway engineer (unlike the character in the book, which makes for the 'united' perception of American nation) who has only two loves in his life - the engine and the southern belle Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). Once he is deprived of these two loves (when, actually, the symbolic union and harmony are in jeopardy), he is determined to recapture them. In the most unpredictable, creative, desperate, stunning moments with tension and comic reliefs, viewers experience the greatest adventures of the silent era. How can it be that love may ever be conquered in, most presumably, the happy ending for our hero and his 'heroines'? Tim Dirks points out that THE GENERAL displays marvelous technical and structural perfection, playful comic inventiveness and realistic romance as well as fluid athleticism on the part of Keaton. Perhaps, those features are noticeable in more of his comedies but hardly is there any other of his films where they go in pairs so effectively and memorably as here. From the very first moments when Johnny visits his beloved Annabelle and the Fort Sumter tidings interrupt the peaceful and silent future visions to the climactic river gorge sequence, the viewer is involved in a symphony of emotions. Sometimes, Keaton shocks us with his composure in the center of chaos (Roger Ebert), sometimes, he provides sentimental feelings as a character who is truly in love, sometimes, he makes us laugh in the most ingenious manner with no 'out-of-date' ingredient resulting in laughable reactions.While the most spectacular sequence is the climactic end of chase with Texas falling into the gorge, the funniest sequence appears to be the 'hiding under the table' among the Northerners (where Annabelle is kept as 'a hostage').

But there is another film based on LOTR, an animated film in fact, that follows the adventures of Frodo and the Fellowship depicted in the first two volumes of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy. It's Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings film from 1978, and if you are a LOTR fanatic (even a semi fanatic like I am), this is one you surely have to check out. As I stated before, this film is based upon the first two books in J.R.R. Tolkien's LOTR trilogy of books, The Fellowship of the Rings and The Two Towers. Unlike the Rankin Bass version of The Hobbit (released a year before), the animation is done in the style of rotoscoping and in several scenes, the animation looks so realistic and contemporary, you forget you are watching animation and think you are watching live action instead. It's very well shaded, vivid, and the colors and atmosphere of each scene really set the mood and suck you into the world of Middle Earth. I just love how magical and innovative the entire film feels. I like to think that this is what Disney's LOTR would've be like had it been made. It has that kind of power that rips you right out of your own reality and puts you right in the crowd along with Frodo, Samwise, Aragorn, Legolas, etc. Speaking of the characters, the voice acting of each classic Middle Earthling is fantastic. Some might argue that the voices are corny and really over the top (I'll admit, Sam and Gandalf are over the top at times) , but in my eyes, it really adds a lot of charm and humor when we need it most. John Hurt is breathtaking as Aragorn\/Strider, having that mighty prudence in his voice to really make you feel intimidated. Anthony Daniels, who you all know as C-3P0 from the Star Wars saga, really takes the cake when playing Legolas, the Elven archer, adding a touch of might and naivety to the character that we had never seen before. The actors they got to play the Hobbits also get an A+ in my book, and William Squire's Gandalf rivals that of Sir Ian McKellen's Gandalf in the Jackson films. Overall, Ralph Bakshi and his crew really prevailed with this adaptation of the legendary Tolkien tale, and although the film didn't do so hot when it was first released, it has gained a massive cult following throughout the years, so much so that it even got it's own Blu-Ray release in 2010. The action is good (for 70s standards), the voice acting is goofy, yet profound, and it really adds a bit of magic that has never been seen before in any other LOTR adaptations.

There are plenty of positives though. I personally did find the drama engrossing, true it isn't faithful from a historical standpoint, then again I can't think of any biopic of a musician or composer that didn't take some kind of liberty with the truth, but Farinelli is an emotionally-charged film and there was plenty of that. That is also true of the writing, which flows well and didn't feel jarring. The film looks spectacular, the costumes and sets are gorgeous to look at and is shot and directed beautifully. I have no faults with the music either, it is so good that my appreciation for early music further grew.

And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!!

To help with expenses, they take on two have-nots as passengers, played by Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis. Unfortunately, Pitt's character may be a sinister killer behind his good ol' boy mask.The film's presumably spelled Kalifornia because Kali is the Hindu goddess of death, which is a creative touch. In any event, this is an effective psychological road movie, shot in Georgia, Illinois and California.Brad Pitt really shows off his acting skills in this one because he is completely convincing as a backcountry psychopath (just as he's convincing as the noble Achilles in Troy).

As the trip progresses Duchovny's character becomes increasingly intrigued by Pitt's animalistic power while Forbes grows concerned of his dangerous potential. The film's also an interesting look at the differences between the middle class and the poor, the educated and the ignorant.There's not much else to say. If you're in the mood for a serious road flick that examines the nature of the killer instinct and more, be sure to check out Kalifornia.

I emphasise the word theory as the science behind the Golden Age of sci-fi was generally rather loopy, though the films were happy to make heroes of scientists. They were no more self-isolated lunatics cooking up destructive experiments or digging up corpses to make a monster, but wise, goateed intellectuals, or square-jawed protégées capable of saving humanity from any potential threats. Of course, the 1950's mainly gave us rubber-suited aliens or giant, mutated monsters, but there were a few directors and producers that were aiming to give the audience a more satisfying, thoughtful experience, such as Rudolph Mate's When Worlds Collide.After scientists discover that there are a pair of rogue planets hurtling towards Earth, pilot David Randall (Richard Derr) is given the task of delivering the information to New York for further research. When Dr. Cole Hendron (Larry Keating) confirms the fear, the news is brought to the attention of the United Nations, where they are laughed out as crackpots. It is believed that the first planet will pass so close to the Earth, it will cause devastating damage, only return from its orbit of the Sun to destroy Earth completely. With the help of Sydney Stanton (John Hoyt), who provides the funds, Hendron and his colleagues begin work on a spacecraft that will transport a small band of survivors to the second planet, which they believe is habitable and will remain on a stable orbit.Rather than giving us special-effects filled set-pieces or killer aliens, When Worlds Collide entirely focuses on humanity's reaction to potential catastrophe. The story is an obvious parable of Noah's Ark, with God venting his fury upon the Earth he saw as fallen into sin, and this theme comes to fruition near towards the end as a lottery-system is drafted to choose who stays and who goes, with the inevitable violent rebellion of those facing death. This harsh depiction of the human race was the most intriguing idea the film had, which makes it sad that the film-makers failed to capitalise on it, instead focuses on a dull love story between Randall, Hendron's daughter Joyce (Barbara Rush) and Dr. Tony Drake (Peter Hansen).The film was successful and went to be hugely influential in the genre, but it is held back from being anything great by some gaping plot-holes, lazy plot devices, and some erratic special effects. It took home to Academy Awards for Special Effects, but the new world reveal at the climax is a rather hastily painted backdrop, ruining any sense of wonder the ending may have provided. There is plenty of fun to be had with When Worlds Collide and gave many future writers and directors to think about, but producer George Pal funded better and more satisfying sci-fi in The War of the Worlds (1953) and The Time Machine (1960).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"3 February 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Though the great space race between America and the U.S.S.R. was still a number of years away, the fact that space travel was a real possibility fuelled audiences desire for sci-fi that was rooted in scientific theory.
