I had watched the movie, anticipating it to be the presentation of Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg's extraordinary novel. Instead, I was struck with grief to see the movie violate and humiliate the story. The movie takes everything that the novel had given us, throws it out of the window, and replaces that with a platter full of nonsensical comedy. Whereas the book was about a deep struggle for Andrew's rise to creativity, ambition and hope to achieve his humanity, the movie makes it... a romantic movie? And a bad one at that! At the last scene, Galatea even violates the 1st Law due to an order, and we all know that the 1st takes precedence over the 2nd Law.
