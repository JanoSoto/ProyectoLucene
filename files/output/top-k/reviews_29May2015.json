There's a segment of the 007 fan population that frowns on the Roger Moore era of films because of its notorious campiness. This, the twelfth film in the Eon series, is the exception to the role as what is arguably the only serious film in Moore's run. It might also be the most forgettable of the bunch, with only a handful of moments that come to mind after having not watched it in a while. I revisited the film again recently and came to remember that it's actually a pretty solid film. The film opens with a British ship going down in the Aegean Sea after an encounter with an old sea mine. The ship, while unassuming from the outside, was actually carrying an important bit of military hardware known as the ATAC (Automated Targeting Attack Communicator). This device allows British nuclear submarines to coordinate in the event of nuclear launch. The British have asked the Havelocks, a married couple and archaeologists skilled in underwater operations, to assist in finding the missing ATAC\/ship and they are soon assassinated for their efforts. James Bond is assigned to find the man who murdered the Havelocks and track down the ATAC unit before it can fall into the wrong hands. Meanwhile, the Russians have quite an interest in the ATAC, as it would allow them to turn England's own nuclear weapons against it.As this is a Bond film, it's probably best to break it down into the core elements of the series. First, the Bond woman Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet). Melina is one of the stronger Bond women of the series. She witnessed the murder of her parents and she's engaged on her own course of revenge, following the trail of criminals and murderers until she finds the man who ordered their deaths. Armed with a crossbow, her crossing paths with 007 on her vendetta was inevitable. She's focused on her girl and there are none of the usual flirtations between her and Bond. She's a beautiful woman and she's serviceable in the role as a woman bent on revenge but she's not the most emotive actress. Not here, at least. She can come across as dull and, as a result, forgettable amidst the sea of other Bond women, past and future, who left their mark on the series. I suppose you could consider the character of Bibi Dahl (Lynn- Holly Johnson) another Bond girl but her role in the film is nothing more than a means of exposition to introduce the evil henchman Erich Kriegler (John Wyman), a Russian Olympic athlete and another in a long line of tall, blonde, near silent killers in the film series. Bibi is an aspiring Olympic ice-skater sponsored by the film's villain and probably could have been cut from the film without losing anything important. Then again, we would have lost the film's only real moment of humor when she attempts to seduce Bond and he, recognizing their drastic (and uncomfortable) age difference, politely turns her down.The most interesting element of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is pulled from the Ian Fleming short story Risico. In the course of his investigation, Bond encounters a couple of smugglers and must determine which he can trust. The first is Aristotle Kristatos (Julian Glover). Bond is introduced to Kristatos through his Italian contact and Kristatos seems an honorable enough man at first. He warns Bond of his former colleague Milos Columbo (Topol), a bloodthirsty criminal known as the Dove. This bit of who can you trust is the a nice element that gives the film a more legitimate espionage vibe that we get in most of the Moore 007 films, even if it's only brief. The film's villain (whether it be Kristatos or Columbo&#x85;I won't specify in the event someone reading this hasn't seen the movie) is well done but there's nothing special about him to help him stand out against the likes of Kanaga, Scaramanga, or Max Zorin. There's nothing fanciful or absurd about him or his plan; it's all very grounded in reality. The same with the film. Expect little to no gadget action on 007's part. But it works. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY proves a Roger Moore 007 movie can still be entertaining without the goofiness. I'd even put above THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and MOONRAKER, perhaps even A VIEW TO A KILL. The locations are gorgeous, the action is great, and Moore brings his usual brand of charm. It's not the best of the Moore era but I don't think it's as weak as many people seem to remember.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY proves a Roger Moore 007 movie can still be entertaining without the goofiness. I'd even put above THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and MOONRAKER, perhaps even A VIEW TO A KILL. The locations are gorgeous, the action is great, and Moore brings his usual brand of charm. It's not the best of the Moore era but I don't think it's as weak as many people seem to remember.

Bilko (1996) Dir Jonathan Lynn \/ Cast Steve Martin, Glenn Headly, Phil Hartman, Dan Aykroyd, John Marshall Jones Here is a military comedy that should have viewers running out and renting superior types such as Stripes or Private Benjamin. Steve Martin plays Sgt. Ernie Bilko who allows his troops to gamble while authority is unaware of their actions. He is fun loving but his girlfriend longs for marriage so she gives him a month to commit himself before she pulls out and moves on. Trouble arises when Phil Hartman returns bent on revenge after a gambling loss. Seeing the opportunity he moves in on Bilko's girlfriend. While the film contains its share of funny moments the premise is not new and the structure is purely sitcom. Directed by Jonathan Lynn who achieved acclaim with My Cousin Vinny. Martin as Bilko wishes to be one of the crowd and avoid responsibility. Glenn Headly as his girlfriend is rendered the standard romantic who cannot rise above cardboard potential. Hartman makes a great foil for Martin's pratfalls but the ending fails due to actions that punish one factor but never highlights the wrong committed originally by the other. Dan Aykroyd is cast as a superior who looks the other way and the role should be worthy the comic's talent but sadly it is not. It never lacks in entertainment, which is what Bilko lives for but it also never elevates beyond conventions. Score 4 \/ 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2015","score":"","review":" Sgt.

It has a powerful plot concept that seems spliced together from other films. It begins in Vietnam 1968 where Tommy Lee Jones is rescued by Samuel L. Jackson. Central plot regards an attack on the American Embassy by snipers in an Arab city. Jackson orders retaliation when weapons appear among civilians resulting in the slaughter of women and children. Jackson is brought to trial and seeks Jones to represent him. There is nothing surprising about this recycled plot. Director William Friedkin does a skillful job at staging the civilian chaos but with The Exorcist and The French Connection he had tighter screenplays to back him up. Jackson and Jones have played these roles countless times and the drill is getting tiring. Jackson played this out in A Time to Kill and The Negotiator, and Jones seems poised to get people out of trouble. Guy Pearce is playing the typical opposing lawyer. Ben Kingsley is featured in the opening chaotic scenes but he seems merely typecast. This is a well made political thriller that is bombarded with familiarity.

Curtis falls for Marilyn Monroe while Lemmon becomes the centre of affection of an old lout who is at the resort that the band marks as their next stop. Clever and surprising with fantastic witty dialogue that ranks among Billy Wilder's greatest work, which includes Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina and Double Indemnity all of which arrive within different genres.

Confidential is a story about corruption, police brutality, trust and masculinity. The film follows three policemen who have different ways of solving cases. The first is Bud White played by Russell Crowe, who uses violence, the second is Ed Exley played by Guy Pearce who is diplomatic and runs to the point and thirdly we have Jack Vincennes played by Kevin Spacey, who is sleazy and likes to be in the spotlight. All three deliver great performances, however Vincennes character does begin to fade from the film during the second half. However Exley and Whitey both have completed character arcs and are well developed. After the fallout of an event at the start of the film, we can see the different paths Exley and White have taken however both seem to be on a collision course with each other, and as one of them gains a new piece of information, the other will go one step further. White's character is quite interesting, he has respect for women and protects them at all costs, not matter the consequences. To balance this, he is quite violent towards men, making his judgement somewhat clouded, Exley on the other hand believes in one thing and that is Justice, he is also the complete opposite to White, he uses his words before he uses his hands.The story is slow, but for a film just over two hours long, being slow is fine. The tone is well dark, and it provides irony, as L.A. in 1950's at least was advertised as the city where dreams come true and in L.A. Confidential we see the dark truth. For the most part the script is logical and lateral, however there are a few minor, and they really are minor, hiccups. For example,at a plot point in the film, a character gives another character an essential clue, however I found it silly that the former character who had been so careful up until this point would give away such an essential clue. Other than that the other problems are truly minor. Onto direction, Curtis Hanson manages to wrangle three worlds within one film, and to keep them separate would have been no easy task, and actually sustaining them would have been quite difficult indeed. The sets looked fantastic, they were all quite engrossing, which is always good. The costumes perfectly fit in with the time period and each character's costume was recognisable, and unlike Jurassic Park, the character's costumes were not Care-beared or in other words each character had a different coloured shirt. The cinematography was great and worked with the limitations of the film. Although the score was nominated for an Oscar, it just didn't fit for me.In conclusion, L.A.

Carpenter had a very tiny budget; slightly more than he had with HALLOWEEN. Look what he did with it? The sets and the script are the stars here along with a great cast. Van Cleef, Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton and the Carpenter regular Donald Plescence who steals the movie. The scene where he machine guns the Duke, reciting back the slogan Duke made him memorize is why Carpenter used him so much in his movies. The film is dark, depressing and creepy. Russell gives a great performance not even pretending to be partly heroic with nothing but contempt for all of 'the establishment.' The scenes in the city are cleverly shot to conceal the fact that they were in a lousy part of St. Louis. Snake is not depicted as a kung fu expert like he would be today. He makes plenty of mistakes, like going down Broadway, and barely escapes. He often has to be bailed out by other people like Maggie, Brain's squeeze and Carpenter's real life girlfriend. She is much better here than in THE FOG where she is on screen too much. Her acting was always a bit shaky. The tyrannical, lying government does not seem too far off from where we are today. Ironically, while made in the late 70s this movie has aged very well and seems more prescient today then when it was released. The film itself is well acted, moves quickly, and is dark, depressing and brooding. Snake is no hero nor does he want to be. Snake was really the template that Riddick was based on. He is not invincible like Riddick yet this is an improvement. Snake is much more realistic less of a cartoon figure. Watch for Ernest Borgnine in a very small role; he was always such a great actor and he captures every scene he is in. If you really want to appreciate what a gem this is watch the big budget overblown awful sequel ESCAPE FROM LA. It shows that money is no guarantor of quality; ironically, Carpenter's smallest movies were the best HALLOWEEN, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THEY LIVE. It is a great film; one of his very best.
