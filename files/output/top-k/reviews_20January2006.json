For me, the 70's mean the real birth of rock music and at the same time, the decade with the best music so far. So for that only, I was thrilled when I heard mentioned names like Led Zeppelin, Humble Pie, Iggy Pop, The Doors and so on... A great character is Vic, the greatest Led Zeppelin fan. And a great idea is to have him say They're here! Led Zeppelin are in this hotel!. It gives a feeling of authenticity hard to get by other means.The facts and lifestyle depicted are the exact copy of what we think about the 70's now, but I'm sure that those that lived through that period will find some slight exaggerations here and there.The script is definitely a great one, and my personal opinion is that the movie itself is not up to it.The cinematography sometimes gives a feeling of sloppiness, but that could well be intended that way. The concert scene really looks like a 70's rock concert shot with the 70's cinematographic means. I'm not into it, but I'm not saying that this approach is not a good one.Unlike most people, I found the acting performances of the lead characters not very good. Kate Hudson is not a good actress, and this shows once again. Her character has a very strong depiction and some great lines, but she's not up to it.Same goes for Billy Crudup, starring here as Russell Hammond, the guitarist and lead performer of the band which the movie talks about, Stillwater (a made up name). The whole plot is wrapped around his character, and Billy Crudup made me believe he can't carry on with it.But there are really some really good performances of the supporting cast. William Miller, the kid whose eyes we're witnessing the action with, is embodied in an absolutely fantastic manner. Phlip Seymour Hoffman as the never-accomplished journalist, Jason Lee as the lead singer of the band and Noah Taylor as band's first manager are all great, despite their small roles.As a conclusion, I liked the movie, but mainly because I like 70's music. I don't think its success is deserved.

I was 9 years old when the film was released by 20th Century-Fox, and I can clearly recall being figuratively glued to the TV screen whenever the trailer was shown. Likewise, I would turn up the radio when ad spots for the film came on. I also scanned the newspapers and would Ooooh! and Aaaaah! over the print ads. I truly think I drove my family insane - or, they thought ME insane - for my obsession with this film, even before it was released! In short, my older brother took me to see it here in Toronto in 1972 - and I was HOOKED, and continue to be so. I remember leaving the theatre literally shaking from the experience.I cannot explain my illogical yet very real attachment to this film. HOW many times did I play 'TPA' in our family swimming pool? HOW many times did I drive my mom insane by flipping over the couch and knocking over the dining room chairs while creating my own capsize experience? LOL. Great memories. That said, I loved the art direction and the whole 'feel' of the film - you truly felt as if you were on-board the S.S. Poseidon. Incidentally, this film, after 'Alien', has the BEST tag line ever - Hell, Upside Down.John Williams score for the film - classic, haunting. The music is so sea adventure! William Creber's art design - Superlative. Special effects - Still hold up. This was BEFORE friggin computer generation. THIS is the REAL McCoy, folks. Kurt Russell? Richard Dreyfus?....and the rest who - will someone please tell me WHO the HELL these people are - please. Mr. Petersen, with all due respect, the whole success and longevity the original Irwin Allen film enjoys is MAINLY BECAUSE of the all-star, stellar (including Stella - *wink*) cast! Not only just 'stars' - this cast contained ACTORS and ACTRESSES. Also, in my opinion, another reason the 1972 version is still spellbinding is because of the awesome (and manually created) special effects. The computer generated crap is just that - crap. Give me Linda Rogo - Mike, I saw a young officer on deck the other day - and he looked pretty DAMN familiar - even with his clothes on! *Stella Stevens (Who has also played a NUN in Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows - ROCKS! Give me Mike Rogo - Do you know what it means to be invited to sit at the Captain's table - on New Years Eve? I'll tell ya what that means - it means the whole idea of those women looking down on ya is a lot of bull! *Ernest Borgnine RULES! Give me Reverend Scott - Pray to that part of God within you - and that part of God will be fighting with you - all the way. *Gene Hackman is IT! Give me Belle Rosen - No. When we get to Israel, we're staying put. Just think - our grandson is 2 years old already, and talking - we've never even seen him. *Rest in peace, Shelley Winters. You had a lot of guts, lady - a lot of guts. Give me Mannie Rosen - He runs on time, like a train - ahh, you and trains! (Can someone explain WHAT the hell this man was talking about here?

Give me Susan Shelby - That's heavy, Robin - r e a l heavy. - NOTE Pammie, LOVED your fire engine red hot pants and great legs!

music attached to the scene however short its appearance equaled a position that was more interesting than its duration allowed for,however it did not seem to have been meant to provide much more than

many weaknesses to this pictures underpinning and the presence or for that matter the place that law enforcement should represent is terribly lacking and without a face,it is without a heart.There is such compelling evidence that any real detective work would of uncovered Carl Bruner and Willy Lopez and perhaps required both Federal as well as International Law concerns with the revealing of the person on the other end of the phone.But this picture seems to have drawn a conclusion about something else and it is something else that it wants to showcase.Molly like Carl does much to deny the existence of the heart and soul of the picture by not allowing for some far fetched idea about the supra natural but it seems is won over by perhaps the pictures lead Female in Oda Mae Brown.The character of Oda Mae Brown has the ability to communicate with the dead and it is the place that Sam Wheat finds a kindred soul and a receiver if you will for his cries from the world beyond that allow this picture some leeway.Indeed both Sam Wheat and Oda Mae Brown are critical to love and justice even unto the end of time.Both of these performances are very good and should provide real entertainment.Molly is not as suggested a full bodied presence though indeed the appearances suggest otherwise but that is neither here nor there as Molly does not believe and as such has a more difficult time determining just how that kind of information became the property of some foreign body in this character Oda Mae Brown.She eventually seems to have been won over but not before the very soul of the picture rises having been provided with the truth so that the heart and life being required now leaves this world behind and is allowed to rest in peace.The end of the picture is very

furtherance of the supra natural conceit showcased through out the picture.Why conceit?Because that is where the answers are not here in this world but in the supra natural and though it is the supra

bank symbolizes.The counter to Sam Wheat is not so easy to pigeon hole as both Molly Jensen and Carl Bruner are very much on the same side as both seek to deny the existence of perhaps a soul but just as important to deny Sam Wheat a life.This though is not customary in the consideration of Molly but there is nothing in her characterization that would suggest to me that they not only knew each other but truly loved each other as well.I felt we were not looking at the real thing but the mere suggestion which is as it is a mere suggestion.It is a critical perception to understand that there is cause as to why nothing that can be suggested is believed in either.The Law as to these events is so uncaring and unbelieving that they sought out the truth to kill more so than to be convinced otherwise that there is a truth of any sort to be gained.The only truth the law recognizes is the law and the law needs to get its way.What does that mean?It means that there are many weaknesses to this pictures underpinning and the presence or for that matter the place that law enforcement should represent is terribly lacking and without a face,it is without a heart.There is such compelling evidence that any real detective work would of uncovered Carl Bruner and Willy Lopez and perhaps required both Federal as well as International Law concerns with the revealing of the person on the other end of the phone.But this picture seems to have drawn a conclusion about something else and it is something else that it wants to showcase.Molly like Carl does much to deny the existence of the heart and soul of the picture by not allowing for some far fetched idea about the supra natural but it seems is won over by perhaps the pictures lead Female in Oda Mae Brown.The character of Oda Mae Brown has the ability to communicate with the dead and it is the place that Sam Wheat finds a kindred soul and a receiver if you will for his cries from the world beyond that allow this picture some leeway.Indeed both Sam Wheat and Oda Mae Brown are critical to love and justice even unto the end of time.Both of these performances are very good and should provide real entertainment.Molly is not as suggested a full bodied presence though indeed the appearances suggest otherwise but that is neither here nor there as Molly does not believe and as such has a more difficult time determining just how that kind of information became the property of some foreign body in this character Oda Mae Brown.She eventually seems to have been won over but not before the very soul of the picture rises having been provided with the truth so that the heart and life being required now leaves this world behind and is allowed to rest in peace.The end of the picture is very good,it is if you will a truly emotional parting and an ascension that is believed in.A degree of success is achieved through this if you will miracle however it is very lovely and very charming and well worth the viewing pleasure of the audience.The darkness that awaits all who heed not to repent will befall them as they did to the Willy Lopez and Carl Bruner character.There deaths in the picture occur with a chilling fearful acknowledgment of the designs of the darkness and the results that it provides for.It is a true admission when Carl gets it in the end and like a moment in time does not believe that the end of time has come for this particular criminal.This is where the picture does provide some interest and it is in its attempt to a moral underpinning that allow for the furtherance of the supra natural conceit showcased through out the picture.Why conceit?Because that is where the answers are not here in this world but in the supra natural and though it is the supra natural,the underpinning is of a world that we do not possess the natural ability to know which only through some sort of miracle we will ever have just that kind of ability.

Sigourney Weaver is just so memorable. Please don't forget that the brilliance of this movie launched a whole quadrology. That itself is a testament to this first one Alien. The second one Aliens directed by James Cameroon is an epic in itself but much of the foundation was (perhaps inadvertently) laid by Ridley Scott in this movie. Please note another side effect was that female heroes were used by Hollywood after this movie in very big productions.Each shot, each scene and sequences build up the film in a fantastic manner that is old school but still so difficult to achieve. It is like Da Vinchi's painting. It is old school style. But still difficult to do. Story is about the crew of a mining ship who end up with an alien while answering an SOS call. Alien not as in an illegal immigrant (er.. this is not a political movie about borders and immigration...) Alien as in the most scary creature ever devised. Truly alien.

This is very impressive considering cartoons such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama have all been running in the same era as well. When it was announced that a film was being made, I couldn't wait and thankfully wasn't disappointed in any way.Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Pam Brady really go to great lengths to offend as many people as possible in this film which is of course making an ironic point considering the film is about a war over censorship issues. People who get caught up in moral dilemmas regarding South Park but they are morons who miss the point. South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut and the TV series has always observed issues and ridiculed them in an extremely funny way. People getting offended at South Park simply prove the writers' point. What is so brilliant about this film is it is like one big episode of the TV show and Trey Parker definitely went to great lengths to achieve this. As with Parker and Stone's first feature length film, Cannibal The Musical, South Park BLU is a musical which adds another dimension to the film and Trey Parker writes very witty lyrics. Possibly the cleverest aspect of this film is that the Terrence and Phillip movie that kicks off the plot is in fact a metaphor of the South Park movie itself.South Park is full of hilarious characters. Sadly characters such as Butters are not used in this film but the four main characters and the adult characters are all fantastic. Cartman for instance, is one of the funniest characters there has ever been. His hypocrisy makes him such a standout character and his desire to offend as much as possible means that memorable quotes always come from his mouth. Mr Garrison is an extremely morally wrong character which, as he is a teacher, makes another very funny character. Parker and Stone's voice talents go to great use and further proves how multi talented they are as film makers.One of the best things about this film is how it mocks the US Army. The racism shown by the army General, for example, is very funny because the film is not mocking blacks in anyway but making fun of racists and their stupidity. Also the USO show allows for more moments of hilarity and does a great job of making idiots out of all the army grunts. The war is almost prophetic considering the war against Iraq which happened some years after the film was made. Parker and Stone obviously read in to political situations very well when writing the film.Extremely funny and very witty, South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut benefits from being a cartoon because it gets away with so much more than it would have done with real people. The crude humour is immature but it works so well with South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done a terrific job with this film and deserve all the praise the film received.

Whilst The Fly is not a surreal like Eraserhead or Naked Lunch, it has its surreal moments and definitely crosses the boundaries in to shock cinema. Cronenberg is a director who has an obvious fascination with the grotesque there are not many more grotesque images than some shown here. The make up used on Jeff Goldblum is brilliant and changes very subtly during Brundle's transformation from man to Brundlefly. To witness the final stages of Brundlefly is particularly disturbing and Geena Davis' reactions mirror exactly how I felt when watching with disbelief. The visuals in this film, although slightly over the top, are fantastic and will never be forgotten. Cronenberg is fantastic as a director because rather than being concerned with making the film accessible, he cares more for making a good film and projecting his vision.As well as being highly imaginative and impressive visually, The Fly has a great plot. The relationship between Goldblum and Davis is very touching and romantic. The relationship is written very effectively due to it being exaggerated to the point that the audience are prepared to believe that this woman will still love a genetically mutating man. The main plot of an inventor creating 'telepods' that accidentally become gene fusers gives the film its Sci-Fi element and the way Goldblum's character transforms after he goes through is very commendable. Whilst not the most thought provoking of plots, The Fly is intelligently written and does well to both entertain and shock.Goldblum does fantastically in making the leap from an eccentric, somewhat childlike scientist to a mutant going crazy. He is perfect for this role in appearance, by voice and by him mannerisms. Jeff Goldblum makes Seth Brundle a unique character and definitely should be the role Goldblum is most proud of playing. Geena Davis is a great actress and does very well in this performance. Her ability at showing shock and disgust is very good but it is the more subtle parts involving her and Goldblum's character development where she really shines.The dark mood of the film is greatly reflected by the atmosphere in the film. Most of the settings are very dark and there are not many characters in the film, helping the audience to focus on Goldblum and Davis. Howard Shore's score is extremely dramatic, slightly cliché but very well done. Cronenberg is an expert at creating moods and contrast. The contrast of a wonderful romance against all the grotesque imagery is very effective as it brings an element of reality to the film. There is also a sense of abruptness to the film; the abrupt ending reflects how quickly the fly's genes fused with Brundle's body. It is the subtle themes that really make this film standout.A classic Sci-Fi Horror, The Fly is a great film and stands proud with many science fiction films of the 80s. The eighties is often mocked as a cultural phenomenon but with regards to this specific genre, the eighties was an immensely important decade. The Fly, along with Terminator, Aliens and The Thing went to great lengths to revolutionise the genre. Cronenberg does a fantastic job with this film. Of all of his more mainstream films, The Fly is his best effort yet.

As much as I love Johnny Depp I have to disagree with him about all the wonderful things he says about the late Ed Wood. Ed Wood is only a charismatic man on a journey to fulfill his dreams of being a great director, when he's being portrayed by Johnny Depp. If you want a real glimpse to the mind of Ed Wood skip over the Plan 9's and the Brides of the Atoms and go watch one of his REAL stinkers like The Sinister Urge with its plot worthy of any Lifetime movie that'll leave you dumbfounded and half asleep. That's not genius.This movie, on a the master list of bad movies doesn't even make the top 10 of my list. Being that it wasn't really that bad.

I had heard about this movie a lot from reading stuff on the internet, always coming across it when I was reading about something else, so curious as I am, I decided to watch it. I wasn't ready at all to see what I saw in this movie, but it's like a horrific car wreck, or a guy streaking, you just can't look away. By the time the movie was over I felt sick to my stomach, and I couldn't stop thinking about how horrible it was. But I found, the more I thought about the movie and the more I read about it, I had grown a liking to it.I had become so fascinated with it, I went out and bought the book and read that, which was difficult because of the language, and it took a while to figure out what some of the words were referring to, but when I finished I was in love with the book.The movie and the book are very close, with the few adjustments due to time constraints in a movie. The ending to the movie though, kind of disappointed me because the book was much more to my liking. In the end of the book, Alex ends up going back to his old ways, but now him being an adult he finds everything he use to do very juvenile, and then he decides maybe he should get a real job, find a girl and settle down. In the end of the book, he's grown out of his old ways, and I really like that aspect, and it would have been good to show in the movie.A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant movie- it's colorful AND dark, comical AND horrific. Watch this movie with an open mind, and if you ever get the chance, read the book because it's more thrilling if you have the two mediums working together. A Clockwork Orange is my favorite movie and book and I recommend it to everyone- that is, if they are in a time of their life where they can handle it.

Typically working with common genres, Soavi infuses his own stylish take on horror films which is a welcome change over many of the dull, derivative knock-offs that are usually done. Soavi did the same thing with DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE (another great film...) where he took the zombie genre and stood it on it's head, taking common themes and elements and transforming them into something new and refreshing. Although STAGE FRIGHT isn't a unique film in terms of the slasher genre, Soavi makes it more fun and interesting with his own unique twists...The story is about an escaped mental patient who terrorizes a dance troupe who are locked in their rehearsal studio. Being that this is a slasher film at least partly in the classical sense, the members of the troupe are knocked off one-by-one in pretty original fashion.One of the main strengths in STAGE FRIGHT are Soavi's obviously intelligent and competent direction. The film has pretty high production value, and the uncut DVD is transferred beautifully. My main gripe is in the sound level settings, where a good bit of the dialog is very quiet, and then when music plays it's exponentially louder than the dialog tracks. Not a big deal, but I had to constantly adjust the volume to hear the dialog during the dialog scenes, and then turn it down so that I didn't blow my ears out during scenes that had music. Speaking of the music, the score is typical early 80's Italian, with weird rock\/synth instrumentals that sound like a weird, watered-down Billy Idol song. Not my favorite choice as far as scores go, but not a big deal either, and pretty typical of Italian horror films of that era. The plot in STAGE FRIGHT also had some decent twists, and the gore, although not extremely heavy, is far better than your average U.S.theatrical release.

It is the unlikely 1962 masterpiece Carnival of Souls which philosophically fleshes out the premise of Twilight Zone's The Hitch Hiker episode (January 1960). The one where Inger Stevens (as Nan Adams) plays a young woman driving cross country who keeps passing the same man standing by the side of the road. Its masterpiece quality was unlikely because it was the low budget first feature film of Herk Harvey (a director of educational short films), using actors with little acting for the camera experience, and with a story structure adapted to fit sets and locations to which Harvey had free access.One of these locations was an organ factory. This not only dictated the film's unique and beautiful score but it suggested a profession for the main character (Mary Henry), a church organist. With this they really got lucky because it brings in many disturbing religious images and undertones. A church organist seemingly possessed by her instrument, as her playing alternates between the spiritual and the profane, deeply disturbs her wrapped-too-tight minister who would have benefited from Pollyanna's advice about the rejoicing texts. The organ factory also serves nicely for a Carol Reed-type angular shot with the huge organ pipes in the foreground and the diminutive figure of Hilligoss far below. This early shot sets the existential tone for what will follow. Finally, there is the moment when she is alone on the highway and her radio will only pick up organ music.The other location is the abandoned Saltair Pavilion outside Salt Lake City. Much of the story takes place here as Mary Henry is mysteriously drawn to the place. Watch for this shot of her in front of a promotional poster for the Pavilion, on the poster is a look-alike blonde with the same hairstyle. Since the late 19th century, Saltair had been a family swimming\/recreational facility built out into the Great Salt Lake. The huge pavilion looks like a strange cross between an Eastern Orthodox church and an Arabian Nights palace. The falling lake level doomed the swimming feature but the place operated as an amusement park until abandoned five years before the filming of Carnival of Souls. At the time of filming the actual pealing paint, broken glass, collapsed staircases, and general disorder made for a better location than even the best production designer could have constructed. It also works well from a language of film symbolic perspective as Mary is shown walking through an unnatural circular passage, which reinforces other subtle off-kilter elements that occur throughout the film.While much of the film's texture was the happy result of the low budget necessity of using these available locations, the casting of Hilligoss worked out even better. Probably cast because she was the most beautiful actress available for the price, Harvey hit a home run because she brings exactly the right sterile and distanced qualities that the film needs in its main character. Hilligoss might have been an acting-for-the-camera novice but she had extensive stage experience. Harvey was able to get an extraordinary nonverbal performance from her, unexpectedly taking the film deep into the concept of human alienation. Much like The Incredible Shinking Man, with its existential theme of separation from society, Carnival of Souls also transcends its genre and explores the isolation of someone who feels they no longer belong. And like TISM, the resolution is the realization that loss of identity is freedom, that the infinite and the infinitesimal are the same, that you are not alone because you are a part of something bigger.The two occasions where Mary Henry suddenly becomes invisible to everyone are much more vivid because Hilligoss is so beautiful. Unlike a person of average appearance, an especially beautiful woman walking down the street is used to drawing stares from virtually everyone. For such a person the phenomenon of sudden invisibility would be far more jarring than for those who are used to not being noticed in the passing crowd.For budget reasons, egg white was used on the faces of the dead cast members, including Harvey himself who plays Mary's recurring apparition. This has an especially eerie effect with black and white film and would be adopted a few years later by George Romero for Night of the Living Dead.Educational film veteran Frances Feist plays Mary's cherubic landlady and John Linden plays her slimy (on the make) neighbor. Both are excellent, and the disjointed and stilted acting style of their scenes with Hilligoss will remind many viewers of David Lynch's Eraserhead.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
