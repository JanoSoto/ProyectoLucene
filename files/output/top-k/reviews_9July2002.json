Well, you can count me firmly in the loved it camp!Ever since I first read these books in the '70s I have hoped that someone would make them into movies.

The animated version was mediocre at best, but this one is breathtaking!

I would dare say that it is even the best film of any type that I have seen.Why?  If you are one of those who don't get it, I can't offer anything to convince you.  Let's just say that this movie brings to life the incredible world that J.R.R. Tolkein created in a way that transcends simple fantasy. The characters and places are believable as real rather than mere creations of a fairy tale world. The story has more substance than the comic book style of the Star Wars series.   The action is gripping.  The visual effects are stunning.  There is genuine emotion, from joy to despair.  The acting is flawless.

The first time I saw it, I was in a theater that was completely packed.  Nobody got up during its three hour length.  There was no whispering or other signs of inattention.

I thought maybe they'd called to apologise.'  At the time, I thought this was just another self-deprecating joke.  And I'm sure it was.  But having seen the film, I'm starting to think he had a point, or at least, as much of a point as anyone who complains about being snubbed at the Oscars ever has.In three of the categories which are ludicrously called &#145;technical' - art direction, cinematography costume design - Allen's picture had as much right to be included among the nominees as half of those that WERE included; it also had an original screenplay that had far more going for it than that of Amelie or Monster's Ball and it was at the very least above the AVERAGE quality of the films competing for the Best Picture award.Really - it's one of Allen's better films, and I don't see how anyone could reasonably think otherwise.  The early, pure comedies which some people supposedly still long for (Take the Money and Run, Sleeper) weren't actually any funnier; the obvious classics (like Manhattan) weren't better structured, or cleverer, or more pointed.  (Granted, Manhattan, Zelig et al. had a divine spark which isn't, perhaps, to be found here, but you can't expect to be zapped by a divine spark every day of the week.)  It's an old-time romantic comedy, set in the 1940s, which could ONLY be set in the 1940s (and Allen has a magic touch when it comes to 20th Century period pieces; don't ask me to explain it), in which several clichés - a contrived and unlikely plot involving (in this instance) hypnotism, a male lead decades older than the female lead, an odd couple who start by loathing each other and end up in love - are explained, given surprising depth, and pressed into serving new functions.  When Briggs and Fitzgerald are arbitrarily HYPNOTISED into falling in love, it's like a comment on the absurdity of the way love strikes in romantic comedies ... but the story never fails to work perfectly when taken straight, too.  All of Allen's implied second-order comments serve, in the end, to enrich the first-order story.  It's as if he decided to show us that fiction crafted to debunk the conventions of other works of fiction CAN actually be good in its own right, when it's done by a true artist rather than some wanker with a theoretical axe to grind.  The result The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is diverting, pleasurable, and satisfying as not one film in a hundred succeeds in being.Place this alongside Sweet and Lowdown and you'll wonder how the rumour that Woody Allen's powers are declining ever got started.  I blame the modern addiction to novelty.  Allen has been making movies for a while now, and even though his films today are no more derivative than they've ever been (less so, in fact), a Woody Allen picture is no longer a new KIND of thing.  The same people who would argue that Haydn's 102nd symphony couldn't possibly be as good as his 80th because the latter happened to have been written and performed first (and there are people who WOULD argue this, the instant it became fashionable to do so), will tell you that Curse of the Jade Scorpion is clearly inferior to, say, The Purple Rose of Cairo, because it's in the same style and vein, and was made later.  Put like that, the view sounds silly.  And indeed it is.

(Granted, Manhattan, Zelig et al. had a divine spark which isn't, perhaps, to be found here, but you can't expect to be zapped by a divine spark every day of the week.)  It's an old-time romantic comedy, set in the 1940s, which could ONLY be set in the 1940s (and Allen has a magic touch when it comes to 20th Century period pieces; don't ask me to explain it), in which several clichés - a contrived and unlikely plot involving (in this instance) hypnotism, a male lead decades older than the female lead, an odd couple who start by loathing each other and end up in love - are explained, given surprising depth, and pressed into serving new functions.  When Briggs and Fitzgerald are arbitrarily HYPNOTISED into falling in love, it's like a comment on the absurdity of the way love strikes in romantic comedies ... but the story never fails to work perfectly when taken straight, too.  All of Allen's implied second-order comments serve, in the end, to enrich the first-order story.  It's as if he decided to show us that fiction crafted to debunk the conventions of other works of fiction CAN actually be good in its own right, when it's done by a true artist rather than some wanker with a theoretical axe to grind.  The result The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is diverting, pleasurable, and satisfying as not one film in a hundred succeeds in being.Place this alongside Sweet and Lowdown and you'll wonder how the rumour that Woody Allen's powers are declining ever got started.  I blame the modern addiction to novelty.  Allen has been making movies for a while now, and even though his films today are no more derivative than they've ever been (less so, in fact), a Woody Allen picture is no longer a new KIND of thing.  The same people who would argue that Haydn's 102nd symphony couldn't possibly be as good as his 80th because the latter happened to have been written and performed first (and there are people who WOULD argue this, the instant it became fashionable to do so), will tell you that Curse of the Jade Scorpion is clearly inferior to, say, The Purple Rose of Cairo, because it's in the same style and vein, and was made later.

Minority Report on paper should be a truly great film. Spielberg directing Tom Cruise in a story based on a Phillip K Dick story. With such a weight of expectation to live up to, I am pleased to say this is not a disappointment. This is movie making at its best, a magnificent movie that's imaginative, exciting and provoking. It simply put is a classic, it'll take a few years, I suspect, until people view it as a classic, ala Blade Runner, but this is certainly one of the best movies I have seen and is in my top ten for sure.Firstly the story. The film is set in 2054 when a special pre-crime division of the police is set up in Washington. This is where three `gifted' individuals known as pre-cogs have psychic visions of crimes that are going to happen. The pre-crime unit lead by John Anderton (Cruise) are given the names of the victims, perpetrators and when it will happen, and it is down to them to analyse the visions to work out where. They then have to set out to stop the murder before it will happen. They have been successful, not one murder in six years, and now there is a chance the technologies used in Washington will go national. Anyway enter Colin Farrells as detective Ed Witter, he is investigating how they run and is put in charge. He seems to be scheming. Anyway this system is apparently perfect. John swears by it and believes in the system completely until he discovers that he has been seen by the pre-cogs murdering someone. He has 36 hours to find out who and why, whilst running from his colleagues. On ensues some great action, and your typically good twists and turns in this sort of thriller.Spielbergs direction as you would expect is masterful and exemplary, definitely a lesson in how to direct for any aspiring film makers. Visually this film is amazing, great cinematography and the special effects are great. They help the film along rather than swamp the film unlike say Star Wars episode 1 and 2 where they were far too reliant on their CGI and didn't bother on the script. This gets the blend right. Top of the range effects and a brilliant script. The film is darker than his usual films and is chilling at times. People sensitive about their eyes may cringe on occasion.Tom Cruise is excellent. He is a great actor and on the evidence of this and the Mission Impossibles a great action star. He does his own stunts and not just that but very impressive stunts and that adds to his action scenes to more of a degree than any other Hollywood star. His performance is very good as the man on the run and also a grieving father who lost is son 6 years previously, a main reason why he joined pre-crime to stop it happening to anyone else. Also good is Max Von Sydow, as the creator of Pre- Crime and Tom Cruises boss. The rest of the cast are very good, especially Collin Farrell as Ed Witter, who is after Anderton. Finally Samantha Morton who is also superb as the Pre- Cog Agatha who is the most important of them. She is very good, and really draws the audience in.Overall this film is superb, there is the odd continuity error that you expect in any film, such as how come Cruise can still use his eyes in the scanners to enter the Police building. Surely if he is wanted for murder they would ensure he can't enter their building and steal Agatha. Anyway its a minor quibble seeing as how the rest of the film is so excellent with some devilishly good twists. 10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2002","score":"","review":"  It has been highly anticipated to say the least.

Here there is plenty of spectacle, in the form of Spielberg's Washington of 2054 (owing something to Fritz Lang's `Metropolis') but we something else besides, a serious philosophical question, as well as plenty of action, intelligent dialogue and some good performances from Tom Cruise, Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton. Even the supporting cast are stronger than average. There's a lot to take in; it's a real Christmas dinner of a movie, and you wonder sometimes if Spielberg hasn't overloaded his viewers.At least he doesn't insult their intelligence. It is to a large extent a chase movie but there's also some suspense as to what the chase is all about. The storyline of the film is a genuine examination of the ethics of acting on information about the future. The `pre-cogs' who foresee future murders are kept in conditions no ethicist would accept, but, assuming such an ability exists, there is a very interesting question Should society intervene even when a future murderer has no present intention of committing the crime? In some limited circumstances people with a strong propensity to commit certain sexual offences and people who suffer mental delusions which make them likely serious offenders are kept in preventive custody but usually they have got there because of earlier criminal acts.  In Spielberg's 2054 the only sanction for a future crime is `containment' (suspended animation) for an indefinite period. As most of the murders are not premediated, and hence not likely to carry the death penalty, it seems you might be better off to kill somebody outside the jurisdiction and then do the jail term.  The larger issue, I guess, is have we free will, or are our lives pre-determined? There is an easy answer to that; if our lives are pre-determined we don't know what our future holds, so we might as well proceed on the basis that we have free will and therefore are responsible for what we do. We cannot be responsible for what we might or might not do. The Department of Future Crime works to a high order of probability (far higher that could ever be achieved in any future reality but even it can make mistakes -hence `minority reports'). Even so, why should it protect potential killers against their own impulses? Isn't that a matter for individual responsibility? As for the victims, some contribute through their conduct to their own demise eg where a battered spouse rises up against her (usually) tormentor. How do we deal with the narrow legal lines between murder, manslaughter and justifiable homicide? The justice system operates with the wisdom of hindsight and a Dept of Future Crime, in its anxiety to prevent a murder, may act without regard to all the matters which must be considered for a just result.Still, a superior effort.

","genre":"Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"9 July 2002","score":"","review":"  The resources put into Hollywood blockbusters are truly staggering; it's not just the money, but the skill as well, especially into one like this, with its polished special effects, virtuoso stunts and huge sets. `Gladiator' and `Titanic' may have been flawed as drama, but we filmgoers sure got a visual spectacle. Here there is plenty of spectacle, in the form of Spielberg's Washington of 2054 (owing something to Fritz Lang's `Metropolis') but we something else besides, a serious philosophical question, as well as plenty of action, intelligent dialogue and some good performances from Tom Cruise, Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton. Even the supporting cast are stronger than average. There's a lot to take in; it's a real Christmas dinner of a movie, and you wonder sometimes if Spielberg hasn't overloaded his viewers.At least he doesn't insult their intelligence. It is to a large extent a chase movie but there's also some suspense as to what the chase is all about. The storyline of the film is a genuine examination of the ethics of acting on information about the future. The `pre-cogs' who foresee future murders are kept in conditions no ethicist would accept, but, assuming such an ability exists, there is a very interesting question Should society intervene even when a future murderer has no present intention of committing the crime? In some limited circumstances people with a strong propensity to commit certain sexual offences and people who suffer mental delusions which make them likely serious offenders are kept in preventive custody but usually they have got there because of earlier criminal acts.  In Spielberg's 2054 the only sanction for a future crime is `containment' (suspended animation) for an indefinite period. As most of the murders are not premediated, and hence not likely to carry the death penalty, it seems you might be better off to kill somebody outside the jurisdiction and then do the jail term.  The larger issue, I guess, is have we free will, or are our lives pre-determined? There is an easy answer to that; if our lives are pre-determined we don't know what our future holds, so we might as well proceed on the basis that we have free will and therefore are responsible for what we do. We cannot be responsible for what we might or might not do. The Department of Future Crime works to a high order of probability (far higher that could ever be achieved in any future reality but even it can make mistakes -hence `minority reports'). Even so, why should it protect potential killers against their own impulses? Isn't that a matter for individual responsibility?

I pity you for seeing little joy in beautiful story told, astounding visuals, awesome sound and effects, rich little details, the amount of love went into the work, the bond between the characters, or the film medium being used as a portal for another world -- the world of the imagination.I've read book 1 of the series (i will save the others for after the series ends), the fellowship of the ring, and i appreciate the layers and details that went into the book. I like finding out more about the characters that the film may not have  gone too much into due to the limit of time; if everything was kept, it would not be a manageable film, but more like a tv series, and would be much more boring. You have to realize that the film medium is different than the written world. The book is much slower than the film. There was no constant rush of adrenaline. The sense of danger is not as dense as it is in the film. Film embraces the senses, in particular, the visual one. Vision is known to have a great physical influence on the body's state. With the books, you make do with your imagination, which may or may not give as vivid a picture as what your eyes would give.The film is tighter and to the point. It does not go off into little stories that are marginally related to the quest, such as the story of Tom Bombadil. The changes made in the film is most welcome so far; an example would be changes to the Arwen role. ***SPOILER***The scene in which she rode the horse that carried Frodo to Rivendell was most thrilling***END SPOILER***. This change is better than the book's original version, as the book is seriously in need of more variety than white blond boys. The choice may be somewhat political (the changes, i think, may not even be enough to turn the film into a politically correct film --> it needs not be, in my opinion), but it's also an artistic move. It does not take away from the film, but accentuates, reinterprets a character that was originally used as an ornament. Now that, my friends, is a true work of art, an interpretation and not imitation of the original works. However, the film does follow the book quite closely, so that you still recognize the events that happen in the book. In fact, a few lines are lifted straight from the book, which serve to satisfy fans of the works like me.Having seen the film without reading the book ahead of time, i was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I loved everything about it, as it is very close to getting a perfect 10 from me. In my humble opinion though, its white-male centeredness may alienate quite a few people (though there really isn't a good reason why they should be, other than making the unrepresented people feeling a little bummed out because this wonderful Middle Earth does not have people who look like them). My chief complaint is its lack of true variety (if this was based on human characteristics) in a supposedly varied and complex world of Middle Earth (where everyone is white, be he is hobbit or elves or men). The other minor complaint is its cheesiness in a couple of scenes ***MAJOR SPOILER- DO NOT READ IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN IT*** Gandalf's and Boromir's deaths. They are a little bit too dramatic for my taste.In closing, this is quite an imaginative collaboration between Peter Jackson and the belated J.R. Tolkien.

Stanely Kubrick is ruthless in grabbing every frame, every scene, and every cue to keep hammering on the nerves of the audience. Not even a single moment is wasted on humor or sentiment. Stanley Kubrick is sincere in his aim to scare and scare he really does.The plot is simple. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) has to spend 5 months alone with his wife and young kid in a hotel in the lofty heights of Colarado.He has the job of looking after the place when it is closed for the winter. The hotel was built on an ancient Indian burial site and the previous caretaker went completely insane and after butchering his wife and two daughters, he put a shotgun to his mouth and shot himself.This is one movie, which is extremely beautiful, yet scary at the same time. Kubrick's genius can be seen in almost every frame of the movie. The opening scenes, extremely beautiful give a wide panoramic view of the mountains, yet focus on a small subject like a lone car motoring along the mountains. This somehow manages to create a very lonely, eerie atmosphere. The hotel is extremely luxurious, brightly lit but is also very odd and eerie. Kubrick manages this by walls that are painted white and very eccentric carpets having intricate designs, which somehow offsets the balance of the place. White walls with orange carpets having a very zig zag design seem very odd. So is the feature of every room in the hotel. The kitchen also has the same kind of effect having a combination of white and pale green walls. Every room in the hotel has a luxurious yet distinctively uneasy appearance.Kubrick just takes this and makes a movie that completely leaves you exhausted after 2 and half hours. Jack Nicholson is fantastic. Shelley Duvall although at first glance is seen miscast comes into her own in displaying the helplessness and hysteria in having to cope with her husbands insanity. The movie is a roller coaster hitting at the viewers nerves at every instant and works its way to the finale, which just leaves you a little flustered. Stanely Kubrick although explaining very detail leaves a few unanswered questions, which will be talked about as long as the movie is watched.Altogether, 'The Shining' is one of the most scariest movie out there.....

The opening scenes, extremely beautiful give a wide panoramic view of the mountains, yet focus on a small subject like a lone car motoring along the mountains. This somehow manages to create a very lonely, eerie atmosphere. The hotel is extremely luxurious, brightly lit but is also very odd and eerie. Kubrick manages this by walls that are painted white and very eccentric carpets having intricate designs, which somehow offsets the balance of the place. White walls with orange carpets having a very zig zag design seem very odd. So is the feature of every room in the hotel. The kitchen also has the same kind of effect having a combination of white and pale green walls. Every room in the hotel has a luxurious yet distinctively uneasy appearance.Kubrick just takes this and makes a movie that completely leaves you exhausted after 2 and half hours. Jack Nicholson is fantastic. Shelley Duvall although at first glance is seen miscast comes into her own in displaying the helplessness and hysteria in having to cope with her husbands insanity. The movie is a roller coaster hitting at the viewers nerves at every instant and works its way to the finale, which just leaves you a little flustered. Stanely Kubrick although explaining very detail leaves a few unanswered questions, which will be talked about as long as the movie is watched.Altogether, 'The Shining' is one of the most scariest movie out there.....  ","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"9 July 2002","score":"","review":"  The Shining is unrelenting in its effort to scare the living daylights out of its audience. Stanely Kubrick is ruthless in grabbing every frame, every scene, and every cue to keep hammering on the nerves of the audience. Not even a single moment is wasted on humor or sentiment. Stanley Kubrick is sincere in his aim to scare and scare he really does.The plot is simple. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) has to spend 5 months alone with his wife and young kid in a hotel in the lofty heights of Colarado.He has the job of looking after the place when it is closed for the winter.

Here are Byron and his girl friend Camille, Shelley and his wife, or rather his girl friend, and Dr. Polidori. All come together on a haunted evening and agree to dream up ghost stories. Poor Polidori tried, but his effort stank. Byron put in a bit more effort and talent and incorporated it into the introduction into a later, longer work. Or was that Shelley? I get them mixed up. The most important thing to come out of that summer was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus. Well, it's understandable. It was a time when science was flexing its technological muscles during the industrial revolution, and theology was coming under rational scrutiny, which is always bad for theology. Within a few years there would be a virtual revolution underway. Andrew Dickson White's The Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom, Madame Blavatsky, a kind of séance movement, in which lots of celebrities joined, including Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle and Houdini's widow. The question at the time wasn't so much, What can science do? as, What can science NOT do? It is utterly fascinating to wonder what went on during that summer. Lord Byron was a manic-depressive (vide Touched With Fire by Kay R. Jameson). Shelly was effete and almost a semi-mystic. Camille, I don't know anything about. Mary Shelley was the daughter of William Godwin, who had been inspired by the French revolution to write Enquiry Concerning Social Justice in 1793. He was kind of a pre-Marxist and believed the world was moving towards a perfect condition in which government would be unnecessary. (He got most of his notions from the Marquis de Condorcet who, ironically, was hiding from the revolutionary extremists who wanted to cut off his head for advocating such counter-revolutionary ideas as the abolition of the death penalty.)It's a terrific situation, and Ken Russel, through an excess of self indulgence, doesn't get the job done. What we see is at the same time boring, shocking, and irrelevant. I won't go on about this. The acting is okay, but everything else except the sets and photography are dismissible. The party guests drink wine laced with laudanum, an opiate, and then have horrifying hallucinations. When was the last time an opiate user experienced anything but pleasant, imaginative reveries and transient euphoria? Russel has people crawling around in the mud, eating rats, doing the vampire thing (how did that sneak in?), arguing and fighting with each other, and not having a good time at all. Jeeze, I'd never go to a party like that. (Been to too many already.) Natasha Richardson looks good and acts good, as always. I don't know why, with her talent, she didn't move farther up the ladder. Perhaps it's because she is merely attractive instead of drop-dead gorgeous thanks to fabulously expensive dentists. She put in a turn on one of those Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series that was truly memorable. Sands looks properly wimpy as Shelley, a monstrously talented poet with colossal legs of clay. Nobody seems to know much about Camille, so it's okay that she looks like one of those black-and-blue Tijuana hookers with slightly jellied flesh. Actually I wouldn't mind biting her throat with my incisors myself. But, all seriousness aside, this is a ghastly movie. It's not fun at all. Boiled down, it's hardly a narrative, but rather a succession of increasingly revolting images -- of cockroaches, blood, rats. A bit of orgiastic sex might have saved it, but there's very little of that. I can't imagine to whom this movie is designed to appeal. What does the word depraved mean?
