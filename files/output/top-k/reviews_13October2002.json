But being a great lover of Northam and Ehle's work, and having a trusted fellow movie lover tell me recently, You will love this movie, I went.Not having read the book, I really had no expectations. I am convinced that this is the best way to see a film, because I found Possession to be one of the most intelligent, well made films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.Much has been made of Aaron Eckhardt's boorishness and the lack of chemistry between he and Gwyneth Paltrow (who seems to suffer from an inordinate amount of backlash recently). I found, to the contrary, that their chemistry was real and palpable. Eckhardt's Roland reminded me of more than a few fellows I knew in my 20s - hardscrabble, practical,with a thick shell, but an incurable romantic at the core. The reviewer who didn't get why Roland was off women missed the exchange between he and Maude in Yorkshire, in which he made reference to a past romantic situation that was extremely painful for him. Roland's professed loner status was simply armor, and I thought Eckhardt did a fine job of letting that armor slip bit by bit, as he grew to care for Paltrow's Maude.  The dialogue between Roland and Maude was realistic to me, and you can sense the frustration each had with not having been born in the simpler time of their idols, the Victorian poets. Aren't we modern, comments Maude wryly to Roland, but you can see she wishes they weren't.The segue between past and present was seamless, although I think the movie might have done well with more of each - another 10-15 minutes or so total running time might have really fleshed out the characters of the two Victorian poets, in particular.My only quibble was that the movie didn't end with one last view of the modern day couple, to bring us back to the present. But the ending scene was touching, nevertheless.Don't go to this film expecting a cinematic translation of a book, and be willing to go where the characters take you. You will be pleasantly surprised and rewarded with a lyrical, intelligent movie that isn't afraid to tackle the ugly side of intellectualism head on, and doesn't shy away from cultural realities (yes, upper class British people really do view us as somewhat barbaric, believe me), but does it in a wry, humorous and even affectionate way.I will happily wait for this one to come out on DVD.

Oh, and there were few as ghoulish as the spooky cover of Death Ship, which I vividly remember recreating with pencil sketches in my schoolbooks. We rented it and I have VERY vague recollections of it not being very good but I never got round to see it as an adult. When the video certification act came to pass in 1984, Death Ship (rated X) was removed from the shelves, never to be released again in the UK. Which brings us to the present day - after all these years, I finally score a copy by chance, excitedly bring it home and, with a set belief in my mind that it's going to be a huge disappointment and a rubbish movie, I line up the alcoholic anathestic and push the tape into the cringing VCR... To my surprise, Death Ship turns out to be a winner! In fact, I'd file it quite high up in my Lost Gems folder - quite why this one has been resigned to the Dustbin of History and the Golden Turkey awards is beyond me. I was greatly impressed!The plot is reasonably simple but inarguably bizarre. In the opening scenes, a luxury cruise ship packed with holidaymakers collides with some kind of ghastly black vessel in the middle of the ocean. The cruiser sinks, killing almost everyone on board. There are only about eight survivors who sit floating in a lifeboat, waiting for someone to come and rescue them... Unfortunately the only sign of life for miles is this horrific looking black ship that's just lingering ominously in the ocean. The cruiser's curmudgeonly Captain (George Kennedy) is becoming increasingly ill, having nearly drowned, so the group of survivors decide that they will have to board the evil looking vessel in order to get food, drink and shelter. It doesn't take long to find that the ship is completely deserted and, although no one can rationalise how or why, it seems to be running itself! Worse still, we start to see through a series of unusual events (ie people being hit over the head with flying objects, doors locking folks in spooky old rooms) that the ship appears to want its new passengers offboard as soon as possible.It's all quite Twilight Zone to begin with but as the film moves along, it gets increasingly horrific and frenzied, hurtling towards a (quite literally) crushing climax. The film is shot mostly onboard the ship and it's a wonderfully unpleasant set. From the moment they first board and get covered with oil and grease, you can virtually smell the rust on the ancient machinery and, as it develops, the stench of putrefaction. Oh, and THE SMELL OF FEAR (oh c'mon, it's a George Kennedy movie, I had to make at least one Naked Gun joke!)... Seriously though, it's clearly low budget, but I really enjoyed the rough and raw directorial style - the darkness and the frequent use of shaky, hand-held camera angles and really lend it an air of madness and menace. I felt the energy of the direction coupled with such genuinely ugly and sinister set pieces combined to create a very unique atmosphere that is, from start to finish, thoroughly unpleasant. There are certain scenes, mostly in the chaotic second half, which just make your skin crawl - the murder scenes aren't particularly *gory* as such, but they're shot in such a feverish manner as to prove really quite unsettling indeed. When the real identity of the ship is finally revealed and we discover what befell of the 'crew', it's an almighty suckerpunch and, again, the use of maniacal camera-work and some utterly disgusting sets just add to the overall effect.As I said before, I can't understand why Death Ship gets such a bad rap. As a haunted house movie, it's one of the better ones I've seen - on top of the rabid direction and deathlike atmosphere, we even have some real quality actors in this one (Kennedy is particularly menacing as the cruiser Captain whom the death ship begins to drive slowly mad) *AND* a cracking script to boot. The storyline moves at just the right pace (the first half builds up creepily and then the second one is a breakneck descent into the inferno) and it's unusual enough to make Death Ship an extremely memorable horror movie. I'd give this one an easy 8 out of 10 on the Horror-O-Meter. If you can find a copy, it's well worth seeing!

I felt the energy of the direction coupled with such genuinely ugly and sinister set pieces combined to create a very unique atmosphere that is, from start to finish, thoroughly unpleasant. There are certain scenes, mostly in the chaotic second half, which just make your skin crawl - the murder scenes aren't particularly *gory* as such, but they're shot in such a feverish manner as to prove really quite unsettling indeed. When the real identity of the ship is finally revealed and we discover what befell of the 'crew', it's an almighty suckerpunch and, again, the use of maniacal camera-work and some utterly disgusting sets just add to the overall effect.As I said before, I can't understand why Death Ship gets such a bad rap. As a haunted house movie, it's one of the better ones I've seen - on top of the rabid direction and deathlike atmosphere, we even have some real quality actors in this one (Kennedy is particularly menacing as the cruiser Captain whom the death ship begins to drive slowly mad) *AND* a cracking script to boot. The storyline moves at just the right pace (the first half builds up creepily and then the second one is a breakneck descent into the inferno) and it's unusual enough to make Death Ship an extremely memorable horror movie. I'd give this one an easy 8 out of 10 on the Horror-O-Meter. If you can find a copy, it's well worth seeing!

Oh, and there were few as ghoulish as the spooky cover of Death Ship, which I vividly remember recreating with pencil sketches in my schoolbooks. We rented it and I have VERY vague recollections of it not being very good but I never got round to see it as an adult. When the video certification act came to pass in 1984, Death Ship (rated X) was removed from the shelves, never to be released again in the UK. Which brings us to the present day - after all these years, I finally score a copy by chance, excitedly bring it home and, with a set belief in my mind that it's going to be a huge disappointment and a rubbish movie, I line up the alcoholic anathestic and push the tape into the cringing VCR... To my surprise, Death Ship turns out to be a winner! In fact, I'd file it quite high up in my Lost Gems folder - quite why this one has been resigned to the Dustbin of History and the Golden Turkey awards is beyond me. I was greatly impressed!The plot is reasonably simple but inarguably bizarre. In the opening scenes, a luxury cruise ship packed with holidaymakers collides with some kind of ghastly black vessel in the middle of the ocean. The cruiser sinks, killing almost everyone on board. There are only about eight survivors who sit floating in a lifeboat, waiting for someone to come and rescue them... Unfortunately the only sign of life for miles is this horrific looking black ship that's just lingering ominously in the ocean. The cruiser's curmudgeonly Captain (George Kennedy) is becoming increasingly ill, having nearly drowned, so the group of survivors decide that they will have to board the evil looking vessel in order to get food, drink and shelter. It doesn't take long to find that the ship is completely deserted and, although no one can rationalise how or why, it seems to be running itself! Worse still, we start to see through a series of unusual events (ie people being hit over the head with flying objects, doors locking folks in spooky old rooms) that the ship appears to want its new passengers offboard as soon as possible.It's all quite Twilight Zone to begin with but as the film moves along, it gets increasingly horrific and frenzied, hurtling towards a (quite literally) crushing climax. The film is shot mostly onboard the ship and it's a wonderfully unpleasant set. From the moment they first board and get covered with oil and grease, you can virtually smell the rust on the ancient machinery and, as it develops, the stench of putrefaction. Oh, and THE SMELL OF FEAR (oh c'mon, it's a George Kennedy movie, I had to make at least one Naked Gun joke!)...

I must say, I had mixed reviews before I watched this movie, b\\c Hollywood, well, has a way of screwing up epic stories by concentrating on certain elements instead of plot, character development and acting.  Throughout the movie, I was just waiting for a bad scene, corny actor, ambiguous plot thread to ruin it all...I am very pleased to say that this is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I have not read the book, but I knew the plot prior to seeing this which intrigued me in the first place. What can I say about this film?  It is one of those rare gems that GRIPS you from the very beginning and never lets go.  The acting is top notch, with my boy Guy Pearce giving an outstanding performance as the lead villan, and Jim Caviezel giving a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the misfortuned hero.  The direction flows very nicely...there are plenty of action scenes and essential plot\/dialogue scenes that all flow so nicely together...there aren't any scenes that drag on or are too short (save for the end, which I will get to later).  I've read reviews that bash this film for not staying 'true to the novel'.  Well, from what I've read about the book, I don't think it is possible to cram all of the plot twists and adventures into a slightly over 2 hour movie.  Besides, the movie, despite some changes due to artistic license (and in the dvd segment of the screenwriter changing the book, compared to the book and movie versions, the changes really improve the story) is very true to the book from those I have talked to who have read it.  You can't help but cheer on Edmond throughout the film, since I know everyone can relate to this through some perverse fantasy at one time or another.  You know he's going to exact revenge in the end, but getting there is all the excitement.  The only worry one would have is if the filmmakers are going to get it right or not...in an epic story like this one, screwing up one scene can ruin the entire movie, and trust me, I was waiting for that one scene to happen the entire time I was watching it and it never happened.  I must say, that I was gripped, and on the edge of my seat, even laughing out loud in joy during some of Dantes' triumphs, especially the immortal line he gives to Villefort towards the end. ***MINOR SPOILERS*** The only thing that griped me a bit was the end.  Don't get me wrong, the end is very good and very very satisfying (a rarity in a movie these days), its just I'd like to have seen a little more of the characters' new lives flesh out a little more, so we can truly revel in Edmond's newfound happiness and newfound peace.  It just kinda ends like something you'd see on the Hallmark channel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little of a disapointment.  But, that is a minor gripe...I still found myself smiling at the end and relieved that there wasn't a tragic ending.  ***END OF SPOILERS***What else can I say?  This movie is great, simply put it is a masterpiece in filmmaking.  This one will definitely get you cheering out of your seat.  It has a wonderful romantic story in addition to a grit your teeth\/guilty pleasure tale of revenge and vengeance.

I hope to see more Halloween's and Friday the 13th's in the near future they waited too long to make this! 7\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"}]
