Initially, when I saw The Insider for the first time, I thought it was going to be strictly about Wigand and the obstacles that he had to overcome to reveal the truth about the tobacco industry. Instead, The Insider concerns former CBS-TV producer Lowell Bergman's reputation as an honest man. Everything starts out with Bergman receiving a box of documents about the burn rate of cigarettes involved in fires that kill people who go to sleep with lighted cigarettes. Bergman peruses the documents, but he doesn't understand them so he searches for somebody who can explain to him what the documents mean. He crosses paths with a tobacco industry executive, Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe of Romper Stomper), who has just been fired from a company because he suffers a crisis of conscience. Wigand's former employers threaten to cut all his severance package unless he inks more confidential documents. Ultimately, he refuses to concede to Thomas Sandefur's demands. Not only does Wigand lose his comfortable house but also he eventually loses his wife. Meanwhile, Bergman assures Wigand that he has his best interests at heart and he won't betray him. CBS News is set to broadcast a segment on its television magazine news program 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer of Triple Cross) questioning him about the truth about nicotine and its hazards. The Big Tobacco companies swing into action and feed scandalous material to The Wall Street Journal when they are slapping restraining orders on Wigand. Interestingly enough, the state of Mississippi and Attorney General Mike Moore (Mike Moore) with Richard Scruggs depose Wigand. Just when things are looking good, CBS-TV gets a case of cold feet and runs their story without Wigand's interview. Bergman becomes a whistle blower in his own company and talks to a New York Timesnewspaper reporter about the scandal while at the same time he convinces The Wall Street Journal not to publish an expose about Wigand that is made up with half-truths and contradictions. In the end, CBS-TV broadcasts the Wigand interview, but Bergman quits because he knows that he cannot be honest in the future with other prospective news makers. Mann and scenarist Eric Roth deliver both barrels of a double-barreled shotgun indictment that is memorable and damning. The tobacco industry almost got away with scaring not just a whistle blower but also a national news organization. Al Pacino is wonderful as Bergman, and Russell Crowe convinces us that he is the man under the microscope who had everything to lose except his conscientiousness. People who boast about America as a bastion of freedom and journalism as an objective industry free of bias should watch this film and think about what it means. Audiences that crave action and entertainment may find this sizzling expose boring because little in the way of gripping or suspenseful action transpires during its two hour plus running time. Nevertheless, as a whistle blower saga, The Insider is insightful stuff that should be watched. Mann's film received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.

Huston and Truman Capote ultimately tinkered with the screenplay together, a pair of self-indulgent jokesters, and however inspired, their efforts put together an offbeat little gem with a storyline that entertains at every complicated plot twist. It's a wacky story about a group of con artists each to a one demonstrating various levels of cunning and idiocy. Meeting up together in the scenic isolation of some southern Italian port town, they're all obsessed with getting to some unnamed country in British East Africa where they plan to grab for themselves a monopoly in uranium deposits. This crew consists of Billy Dannreuther and his wife Maria played by Humphrey Bogart and Gina Lollabrigida. Dannreuther is the seasoned soldier of fortune type, a wanderer of the world always looking for ways to make a million. Bogart, a consummate professional, would never put in a lazy performance but here he shows little enthusiasm and just looks weary and impatient. This, however, actually serves well for the character, Dannreuther being a man who's seen it all and takes nothing for granted. His Italian wife all bosoms, curves and pouty lips is an Anglophile obsessed with all things English from tea in the afternoon to a hunger for the rolling lawns of titled English estates. The couple are in uneasy league with a quartet of ne'er-do-wells, the key members being Peterson, played by Robert Morley, Ivor Barnard as Major Jack Ross, a loony homicidal fascist who believes Hitler and Mussolini had the right idea, and Peter Lorre as Julius O'Hara. O'Hara, so obviously a brand of O'Hara that Ireland never saw, pridefully expresses that O'Hara is a very respectable surname in Chile. He counteracts Dannreuther's frustration with the complications of their scheme by emphasizing what every con man needs to keep in the forefront To seem trustworthy is no more important than to be trustworthy. Time has not been kind to Peter Lorre who only age 49 in this movie looks significantly older since his appearance in Huston's 1941 The Maltese Falcon twelve years previous. We get a blonde Jennifer Jones of all things, apparently an effort to give her the vibes of the blonde noir babe practiced at duplicity. She's Gwendolen Chelm married to a stock-character British male, a member of the prissy, tight-laced breed, humorless and outwardly dull-witted. Chelm breaks into crisis mode when he finds he didn't pack his hot water bottle. The group of disreputables are waylaid on some North African shoreline after their African bound boat sinks, and taken in for interrogation and detention by horseback marauding Arabs and their leader. These turn out to be not a tribe of terrorists in the modern sense but terrifyingly stupid and intimidating. After Gwendolen rambles on in protest over their detainment, the chief of this band simply points out that In my country a female may at least know her words are not heard. He may not care what a woman has to say but he certainly is interested in what they look like. It turns out he suffers from a swooning obsession with actress Rita Hayworth, his dream girl whom he'd like to add to is harem. Whichever one of this crew scores the riches at the end of the game doesn't really matter. It's a winner for the viewer.

The other iconic (human) character in the film is obsessive movie director Carl Denham, played with gusto by Robert Armstrong. Bruce Cabot plays the heroic leading man like nobody's business. This is the best role of his long career. Character actor Frank Reicher doesn't get enough props but his Captain Englehorn is a cool customer. Directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B.

Willis O'Brien's special effects are appreciated, though all too often the praise for them comes with backhanded compliments and qualifying remarks such as great for its time. Well, what time was it supposed to be great for -- the year 2058? The sets, the props, the matte backgrounds are all top notch. Max Steiner's legendary score is perfect. Drama, humor, romance, action, fantasy, horror -- it's a film with a little bit of everything. Historically, artistically, and technically its value can't be overstated.

Both were low-budget efforts done out of love and both immediately and irrevocably changed the way we think about horror. In a similar way, Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, although not quite in the same league as the aforementioned films, nevertheless was born in similar low-budget circumstances and was able to transcend these financial limits with sheer creativity and craft. And in doing so, created such a furore upon its release and spawning such a robust legacy that it can rightly said to be considered a classic.However, having given such high praise, it remains to be said that the movie cuts an unusual figure among other classic horror movies (low-budget or otherwise) in being possessed of a definite self-awareness in its employment of horror clichés that have led some to consider the film a parody and not to be taken seriously - a kind of horror version of This is Spinal Tap. Chief among these is, well, the whole plot a group of young people head out to a remote cabin where they find an ancient book which they shouldn't read from but do and allow demons to come into this reality and wreck havoc. This kind of plot barely cut it back in the day, let alone these days (even though it was remade, quite well in my opinion, in 2013). And yet, despite an undeniable campy quality (with patchy-at-best acting augmenting the thinnest of plots), when it unleashes itself it can create a lurking sense of claustrophobic dread more penetrating than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), demons which pose a genuine threat in their sheer malevolence, gore that would make Lucio Fulci blush, and a very real sense of hopelessness.So, even though the film has its camp flourishes (like the ridiculous and equally horrifying Tree Rape scene) and knowing nods and what-not, it seems that the distanced self-awareness that The Evil dead demonstrates is the very thing that allows the film to venture into the realms of excess with its gore and nihilism that allow it to ultimately stand above the tropes and genre conventions it employs. As such, being so bleak and such a gore high watermark, it's no surprise that the movie wound up on the list of official Video Nasties drawn up in the 80s; a list designed to remove from circulation movies which were considered morally corrupting.

Chief among these is, well, the whole plot a group of young people head out to a remote cabin where they find an ancient book which they shouldn't read from but do and allow demons to come into this reality and wreck havoc. This kind of plot barely cut it back in the day, let alone these days (even though it was remade, quite well in my opinion, in 2013). And yet, despite an undeniable campy quality (with patchy-at-best acting augmenting the thinnest of plots), when it unleashes itself it can create a lurking sense of claustrophobic dread more penetrating than The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), demons which pose a genuine threat in their sheer malevolence, gore that would make Lucio Fulci blush, and a very real sense of hopelessness.So, even though the film has its camp flourishes (like the ridiculous and equally horrifying Tree Rape scene) and knowing nods and what-not, it seems that the distanced self-awareness that The Evil dead demonstrates is the very thing that allows the film to venture into the realms of excess with its gore and nihilism that allow it to ultimately stand above the tropes and genre conventions it employs. As such, being so bleak and such a gore high watermark, it's no surprise that the movie wound up on the list of official Video Nasties drawn up in the 80s; a list designed to remove from circulation movies which were considered morally corrupting. To be honest, a lot of the movies on the list haven't aged well and one wonders what all the fuss is about, but with The Evil Dead, while morally corrupting may be pushing it (especially given the depths of recent movies The Human Centipede (2009) and A Serbian Film (2011), it still retains its ability to creep you out, make you squirm, and damn well entertain you.

All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster\/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster\/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best.

Claire teams up with Charlie Grimes (Freeman) to navigate through the military justice system in attempts to clear Tom, all while dealing with the deaths of key eyewitnesses.Like Kiss the Girls, this movie is full of mystery and tension that will captivate an audience and keep the movie's pace going strong despite its simple and predictable plot. Freeman is a calm yet dynamic actor, which is perfect in his role as he teams up once again with Judd, who herself gave an energetic and dramatic performance in her attorney role. Jim Caviezel gave a strong and mysterious performance as the accused Tom, whose unknown background will leave the audience guessing.With some good suspense and tension, it's a worthy courtroom drama for a popcorn movie night.Grade B- ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, after starring in 1997's Kiss the Girls, reunite in this story about powerful attorney Claire Kubik (Judd), who finds her husband Tom Kubik (Jim Caviezel) arrested for the murder of Latin American villagers while he was in the Marines, with the name of Sgt.

He becomes a highly Mutant Superhero, avenging the victims of bullies, wherever he can find them.Some of the Avenger's antics are Psychopathic...the violence and brutality is stunning, while at the same time comical. For comparison, think Return Of The Living Dead. Some of the settings include toxic waste dumps - horrible pollution, under a New Jersey skyline - which I found hilarious, having lived in that area in the 1960s and early 70s (and, the pollution back then WAS incredible). The Avenger has a romantic interest - a very shapely young blind woman, providing some comic relief. I don't care what anyone else says, about the high level of Cheesiness of this movie....I think it is an absolute Riot. Obviously, it's not a movie to be taken seriously.

West Side Story is a film that I never tire of seeing over and over again, especially on a great big, wide movie screen, in a real movie theatre, with the lights down low! It always feels fresh and new, like I'm seeing it for the very first time, and I always notice at least one or two things in each viewing that I didn't notice in the last. West Side Story is truly a classic that never grows old. While most classic films (even classic films that I've liked well enough to see more than once.) are somewhat dated and frayed around the edges, West Side Story has withstood the test of time fantastically! The MGM quote Unlike other classics, West Side Story grows younger is so true!
