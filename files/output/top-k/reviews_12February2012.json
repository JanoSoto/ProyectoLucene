And I assure you, I won't waste too much time on one of the worst characters in film history. That's already an established fact. So, in lieu of beating a dead Gungan, I'll tell a brief storyA Long Time Ago in a City Not Too Far Away, I originally saw Episode I and a couple of weeks later, my dad had time for his first viewing so I took him.

Beyond Lil Annie's annoyance &#x96; and believe me, he would be the number one Star Wuss if not for Jar Jar, there's further bad dialogue, acting and the pacing is atrocious. If the 45-minute Pod Race &#x96; that's ONE SCENE &#x96; isn't bad enough, the movie moves as slow as the famous words at the beginning. Its clear Georgie Boy had a 30 minute story to tell and stretched it past two hours.

If you can wade through Naboo and Queen Amidala's cut lip and laughable voice, you'll be greeted with the fantastic, duel lightsabering Darth Maul &#x96; the one stand out character that you'll cheer for, even if he's on the Dark Side. His fighting two Jed-Is along with a mildly entertaining space battle is worth waiting for. That is, if you can ignore the other things happening at that time, such as Lil Annie's constant need to FORCE a headache on the movie-goer or the battle of the Gungans &#x96; because, YES, any time they're on screen, spitting or not, they're absolutely maddening.Lest I forget, it's in Barely 3-D now in theatres. Don't waste your time. The 3-D adds ZERO to this experience. But, don't worry. Episode II is a huge improvement as is III over II. And so on&#x85;It will get better.

His behavior is reminiscent of the old Amos and Andy radio and TV Shows of the 1950s. The young boy Anikan Skywalker is played by cherubic Jake Lloyd. If this kid's job was to look cute and have no emotions, then he should get an Oscar. He's pretty much a doll baby with a nice coif. I suspect the actor was selected so as not to steal any scenes from Neeson. Mission accomplished. Even the other children in the movie are incredibly bad actors. I have no idea what the criteria were for choosing these kids &#x96; they would have been better as CGI.SPOILER ALERTThe movie plods along with scene after scene of political intrigue.

They hearken back to the days of swashbuckling stories of the 50's.The climax is a four-way battle scene on Naboo that seems to be created to appeal to three different audiences. On the ground, the Gungans are fighting a sea of robot warriors. In the sky, fighter pilots are attacking a huge battle station in a scene that makes Red Tails look like a cocktail party.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"12 February 2012","score":"","review":" It's now an accepted fact that the first Star Wars is regarded as one of the most, or amongst some communities, the most successful movie of all time both in terms of critical acclaim and box office gross. Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.There's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. To describe it in short though, Darth Vader is desperately after Luke Skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. In an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia as bait. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by Obi-Wan Kenobe's voice through the mystical Force must travel to Dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a Jedi Knight in order to confront the evil lord Darth Vader.Once again, all the elements that made the original Star Wars a success abound in the sequel. There's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous Star Wars opening musical piece. Lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor Irvin Kershner. A professor at the University of Cinema Sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. The presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. Amongst all, the character of Han Solo as a dependable scoundrel is what really stands out; Ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what Solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction. His sequences with Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia are amongst the high points of the movie and are brilliantly played out. We also see Mark Hamill as a now slightly more mature Luke Skywalker as he journeys to Dagobah to learn the ways of a true Jedi from the strangely voiced Yoda. And of course there's the inseparable duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 who are actually forced to stay apart from each other for a major portion of this movie. As much as I can admit to not being able to understand anything R2 says, I have inexplicably grown to like his presence immensely in Star Wars.The film features visual effects and action on a scale that's almost twice as big as its predecessor (the budget only confirms this). Spending $32 million on a movie in 1980 would not have been regarded as a wise decision but thank goodness that Lucas decided to go for it or we might not have been able to witness space battles on such a huge scale. The battle on the ice planet at the start of the movie is brilliantly staged and a behind the scenes documentary sheds some light on how some of these miraculous shots were achieved. What's really great about the action is that unlike the heavily edited action sequences of present films wherein the average shot just lasts for about 2-3 seconds, shots in Star Wars last longer making the action very comprehensible and easy to follow. Its easy to see the strategies being adopted by each side while fighting as opposed to units just being brought down by random shots fired by people \/ creatures obscured by the miss-mash editing. And the best sequence of the movie comes towards the end in an epic battle between Luke and Darth Vader that literally will send your pulse racing. Even more exciting is the battle's infamous outcome which I shall not reveal.Movies like The Empire Strikes Back come only once in a while. Perhaps, every decade must have only a few of these movies present. Fans would obviously come up with a few nitpicks here and there but as far as my opinion goes, this movie is perfect in every aesthetic and area of film-making I'm ever aware of. Now that this movie has set such high standards for the Star Wars saga, I wonder where the next movies will take me.

Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.There's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. To describe it in short though, Darth Vader is desperately after Luke Skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. In an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia as bait. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by Obi-Wan Kenobe's voice through the mystical Force must travel to Dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a Jedi Knight in order to confront the evil lord Darth Vader.Once again, all the elements that made the original Star Wars a success abound in the sequel. There's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous Star Wars opening musical piece. Lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor Irvin Kershner. A professor at the University of Cinema Sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. The presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. Amongst all, the character of Han Solo as a dependable scoundrel is what really stands out; Ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what Solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction.

Their faults are numerous and have been the butt of many jokes in shows such as 'Family Guy'. Lucas' success was creating a fully immersive universe full of iconic characters that allow us to escape reality. So when he announced that the prequels were being made, excitement was off the scale. I remember sitting waiting for the curtain to go up for 'The Phantom Menace' when it was released in 1999 and bursting with expectation. Then I remember the crushing disappointment that followed as the horror unfolded on screen. Back to 2012. 'The Phantom Menace' is re-released in 3D. Do I A) Remember how bad it is and avoid? Or B) Part with some hard earned cash to make George a little bit richer? Those who went for 'B' give yourselves a gold star. From the start, boredom reigns supreme. The introductory scrolling text is about taxation of trade routes and a blockade by 'The Trade Federation'. Who needs Rebel Alliances or Galactic Empires when you can base a plot around trade disputes! Much of the film is bogged down in tedious political plots and manoeuvring. What action there is centres around the Jedi Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as they battle the Droid army of the Trade Federation. Unlike Storm Troopers, the Droids make terrible bad guys. Sure, Storm Troopers are pretty useless but the Droids make them look like the S.A.S. Not only do the standard Battle Droids look like Games Workshop rejects but they offer all the resistance of a wet paper bag. You never feel they're a genuine threat. Their limited dialogue is meant to be humorous but instead makes them seem completely stupid. Why would somebody design an army of robots, spend billions on constructing it only to make them as effective as 'The Three Stooges'? Darth Maul, the Dark Jedi who takes on the heroes, finally brings some credibility to proceedings but it is too little too late. He is the only colour in a mire of drab characters. Unfortunately the other stand out is Jar Jar Binks. So much bile and hatred has been written about him over the years (and rightly so), that all I'll say is 'Worst movie decision ever'. Anakin Skywalker (A.K.A. a young Darth Vader) falls into the category of 'annoying movie brat'. His infatuation with the teenage Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), which is central to the plot of the prequels, is messed up as the age gap between them is so great. Oh, and get this. Anakin Skywalker built C3 P0. To provide more of a link with the original trilogy, Lucas decides to provide us with the back stories of not only C3 P0 but R2 D2 as well. This truly jumps the shark. We also get more explanation about The Force. Jedi can harness it due to having a high count of midi-chlorians in their blood &#x96; microscopic organisms that allow them to connect with the force. The higher their midi-chlorian count; the stronger the Jedi. So instead of being a mystical field of energy that unites all living things, a metaphysical and ubiquitous power, The Force is reduced to the status of a virus. How were the Jedi wiped out? Someone prescribed them Tamiflu. Ridiculousness reaches new levels when we learn that Anakin Skywalker was 'immaculately conceived' by the midi-chlorians. By now fans are starting to get seriously hacked off. Another noteworthy happening is during the underwater journey from Gungan City to save Queen Amidala (who was apparently elected to server her people, surely a first for royalty) from the Trade Federation invasion. Qui Gon and Obi Wan's craft is caught by a giant predator, only to be saved when the attacker is snapped up by a bigger creature. Five minutes or so later, exactly the same thing happens again. I'm not kidding, it's like the film was made by a five year old; 'Again Daddy, do it again'. Dialogue is horrendous throughout, especially that given to Trade Federation characters. We know Lucas can't write dialogue worth toffee from the earlier Star Wars movies, but he hits a new low here. Even Liam Neeson can't make bring it to life, which is saying something. Acting is equally cringe worthy. The CGI characters give the same level of performance as the humans. 'The Phantom Menace' reveals George Lucas as the hack who got lucky he really is. If he'd released this instead of 'A New Hope' back in 1978 the franchise would have sunk without a trace. Of course, then we'd have to believe that he had all six movies mapped out from the beginning, which I don't. How could he have got things so wrong? Possibly because nobody at the studio says 'No' to him. All his ideas are assumed to be guaranteed money spinners and are green-lighted automatically. There's so much fiction set in the Star Wars universe; both published and fan. It would have been so easy to get a writer or two with the knowledge and love of the series to construct a decent plot. Unfortunately Lucas is given God-like control over proceedings. He might as well have urinated on the fans whilst stealing their wallets. Re-releasing 'The Phantom Menace' in 3D can only be seen as a cynical ploy to increase his personal fortune.

I have the Blu Ray but never once put it in my machine.I just wanted to know, is it really that bad? No, it isn't, it's visually stunning, and Maul is one of the most iconic villains this side of Hans Gruber, but when it comes to direction and acting, the film just loses it's way.People dog on Lloyd for 'bad' performance, the kid was ten for crying out loud, and wasn't really that bad.You want to see the bad acting in this? see Macgregor, who just spends the duration of the film doing a really bad impression of Alec Guiness, and Portman, why is it whenever she is wearing make-up, she has to do a really silly voice.Neeson, knows what he is making and walks around with a swagger, acting cool and basically telling Obi-Wan to chill out.So all in all, it's not a good story, the narrative is awful, as is a lot of the acting, but it's visually stunning.

In fact I did not laugh once during Spy Hard.Flying High, or Airport as it is known in America, is not the case. In fact I found that Flying High is quite witty and very funny. There are a few things that seemed too stupid, such as the comments that Johnny makes in the flight tower at the end, but the humour generally is quite consistent, and funny.The thing about Johnny is that he does not really seem to fit in with the flow of the movie. The style of Flying High is that it is farce, namely the actors are dead serious while really bizarre things are going on around them. The actors will say funny things yet be dead serious about it as if it is a natural part of life. This is what makes Hot Shots such an impressive movie because Charlie Sheen is so serious in that movie. Johnny though does not seem to fit into the mould instead he is a silly character that says silly things and is never really serious about it.Leslie Neilson, who plays the doctor, on the other hand is quite serious. He is not trying to be funny in this movie, and as such he is. The interaction between the pilots in the plane is cool. In fact Flying High has numerous word plays, Captain Oveur, and Roger the co-pilot. Then there is my favourite line printed below. Along with the word plays, which are very clever, there is also slapstick, which never really impresses me, and more blatant sexual humour, which I don't really like.The cast is quite well know as well Leslie Neilson, Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack.

Neilson is still making comedies, which I refuse to see, I don't know where Bridges is, and Stack, the last time I saw him, was hosting America's Most Wanted.Flying High is actually quite a good movie.

In fact I have watched this film so many times that not only do I know it back to front, but I can even quote some of the lines (which is a challenge for me, has my memory does not like holding useless information such as lines from a movie, however I will quote Shakespeare, sometimes).Anyway this movie is modeled on Lord of the Rings, and in a sense I see it as an attempt to move towards what was to become the Lord of the Rings epic. It was never going to be easy to make a movie out of Lord of the Rings (and attempts had been made before Peter Jackson, and they had inevitably failed), but this film did help the industry move towards that end, and indeed it did succeed twelve years later.Willow is about a Nelwyn (like the Hobbits) who discovers a baby in a nearby river. When the baby is found, attack dogs suddenly descend upon the village, and it is determined that the baby cannot stay. Willow, however, is a poor farmer struggling to pay his bills, and is tormented by the big man around town, Mr Burglecutt. He desires to become a sorcerer, but is mocked and ridiculed by his peers (with the exception of the wise man, who sees potential, but does not believe Willow is yet ready).Anyhow, off Willow goes on an adventure, and while the others decided that they do not want to go out into the wide world, Willow realises that he has been given responsibility for the baby (and it was magnificent how the baby was handled, particularly since the baby is supposed to have a mind of a mature adult) and must see the quest through to the end. The quest is obviously, allegorically, about how Willow comes on his own, and not only must he take care of the baby, he has the role of the sorcerer thrust upon him.This is a kids film, and it is seen in the middle when Willow is alone with the two faeries (some say that they are really annoying, though not as annoying as Jar-Jar Binks), the baby, and something that I think is a raccoon. To me this scene outlined the idea of the Children's film, though we as adults loved it as well, which is why I have not only owned copies of this film on DVD but on video as well. I simply could not get enough of it. However, it is funny that when the Lord of the Rings appeared, while I did enjoy them, I did not enjoy it anywhere near as much as I did this film.

The late 80s and early 90s had been suspiciously devoid of any such movie. And then, all of sudden, a bunch of them came along at once. The English Patient sees such a grand romance with the elusive themes and complex structuring more often encountered in the art house.It is not, however, dull or pretentious, possessing a directness and humanity that makes us feel somehow involved. Director Anthony Minghella does not attempt to dazzle us with any form of technical wizardry. His style is simple, thoughtful, with few camera movements. At certain times he places us right within the action, such as at the beginning of the first flashback, where the camera occupies the space of an imaginary extra person as the team discuss their expedition (this is a trick classic master Frank Capra also used, by the way). At other times, particularly in the 1945 scenes at the monastery, his camera looks down upon things, but the sense at these times is not one of cold detachment, but one of giving the characters some space and freedom at moments of high emotion, as when they bring the bedridden Count out in the rain.The English Patient has practically an ensemble cast, with players of many different temperaments contributing something, and no-one quite seeming to be in a lead role. Although she won her awards as a supporting actress, Juliette Binoche provides perhaps the strongest presence throughout the movie. Her character is bereaved several times, and it's admirable how she manages to make the emotion seem genuine even in repetition. Together with Naveen Andrews and Kevin Whately she forms a warm, likable trio that viewers are instantly able to connect with. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, the lovers of the primary story, are a sharp contrast. While both are physically very beautiful, there is a stiffness and formality about them both which, despite some wonderful efforts (Fiennes's drunk act is priceless), they never quite break out of enough to make their passion seem truly alive.But perhaps this is part of the point. The English Patient is after all a picture of shifting tones. The scenes of 1945 depict a time for healing, mourning and rebuilding, and as such the only times where real human feeling is allowed to flow. Perhaps it is right that the dead romance of the past should be portrayed with a loftiness as of some ancient legend.

The English Patient sees such a grand romance with the elusive themes and complex structuring more often encountered in the art house.It is not, however, dull or pretentious, possessing a directness and humanity that makes us feel somehow involved. Director Anthony Minghella does not attempt to dazzle us with any form of technical wizardry. His style is simple, thoughtful, with few camera movements. At certain times he places us right within the action, such as at the beginning of the first flashback, where the camera occupies the space of an imaginary extra person as the team discuss their expedition (this is a trick classic master Frank Capra also used, by the way). At other times, particularly in the 1945 scenes at the monastery, his camera looks down upon things, but the sense at these times is not one of cold detachment, but one of giving the characters some space and freedom at moments of high emotion, as when they bring the bedridden Count out in the rain.The English Patient has practically an ensemble cast, with players of many different temperaments contributing something, and no-one quite seeming to be in a lead role. Although she won her awards as a supporting actress, Juliette Binoche provides perhaps the strongest presence throughout the movie. Her character is bereaved several times, and it's admirable how she manages to make the emotion seem genuine even in repetition. Together with Naveen Andrews and Kevin Whately she forms a warm, likable trio that viewers are instantly able to connect with. Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas, the lovers of the primary story, are a sharp contrast. While both are physically very beautiful, there is a stiffness and formality about them both which, despite some wonderful efforts (Fiennes's drunk act is priceless), they never quite break out of enough to make their passion seem truly alive.But perhaps this is part of the point. The English Patient is after all a picture of shifting tones. The scenes of 1945 depict a time for healing, mourning and rebuilding, and as such the only times where real human feeling is allowed to flow.

Hunter S. Thompson generally does not write books that could easily be translated into movies, in particular this one, however if there is one person that can pull it off, it is Terry Gilliam.This movie is about two guys, one of them a journalist, the other, well, I have absolutely no idea who the other guy is, though he keeps on referring to himself at his Attorney, who go on a drug fuelled binge to Las Vegas. The subtitle of the book is 'an exploration into the dark side of the American Dream' however that is not their intention when they go there. It seems that Raoul is supposed to cover a sporting event, and then a DA's Conference on drugs, but instead they spend a bulk of their time travelling around Las Vegas in a drug induced haze.Much of the film is narrated by Raoul, namely the thoughts that are racing through his head as he wonders around the city. He scams a couple of hotels, runs up huge bills, and then disappears. By the end of the movie you get the impression that they simply trashed everything that they could conceivably trash in Las Vegas, and though it is suggested that they were rushed out of town, it does not seem that that actually happened.My favourite part of the film was when they get into the hotel and forced into the bar to wait for their room to be made up. Raoul then starts freaking out, as he sees the carpet begin to swirm, and the crowd in the bar turn into monstrous creatures, and has to be carried out by his attorney. Later it is his attorney's turn to freak out and have to be carried back into his room. This, as Hunter refers, is known as 'The Fear'. I guess people who have never done drugs would not understand what he means by the fear (and I certainly didn't when I first read this book), and it can be difficult to describe as it is a drug-fuelled emotion that rises up into your head and clouds your perception. The clearest explanation would be that you know that you are on drugs (and generally most drugs that I know of do not generally give an outward appearance, in the same way that alcohol does, like slurred speech and lack of balance) and then you begin to fear that everybody else does as well, and that they are all looking at you suspiciously. You begin to believe that you can read their minds, and that they are all looking at you in a disapproving manner, and all of the sudden you want to get out of there because they are going to do bad things to you and you cannot fight back.The Fear is not rational, in fact it is completely irrational. You may have not attracted anybody's attention, but once the fear strikes, you believe that you have. It is the paranoia that everybody speaks about when it comes to drugs. There is no fear when you drink alcohol, in fact alcohol tends to fuel your confidence, rather than force you into a corner to hide, that is what The Fear does. As I have said, The Fear is something that people who have not done drugs would not understand, however it tends to be the psychedelic drugs, such as Marijuana and LSD, that bring about The Fear, not stimulates (cocaine and ecstasy) or depressants (such as heroine).This is a really good movie, and it does indeed, as the author suggests, an exploration into the dark side of the American Dream. As the movie progresses, Raoul begins to contemplate the American Dream. Unfortunately he did not cover the race, and when he attended to DA's conference, he was so wacked out of drugs that The Fear caught him as well, particularly when the 'Drugs are bad' film clips were shown. This is an incredibly funny movie, though I suspect that it will not be everybody's taste.

It came out during a unique period in American history, right after the fall of the USSR and the First Gulf War but during a painful Recession. In some ways the US was riding high, but at the same time it was the captive of its own painful vulnerabilities and imperfections. That is the story of Unforgiven, transmuted to the Old West.A tough man and his companions embark on a journey to right some wrongs. Along the way, we learn something about the man, but we don't get his full measure until the very end. What we learn turns everything upside down and leads to a very satisfying conclusion. This simple tale fits into the pure-Americana mold of True Grit and The Searchers. If you haven't seen those two films, you should before you see this one. Unforgiven unmistakably walks in their giant footprints.The key to this film, I believe, is to learn exactly what Clint Eastwood's character, Bill Munny, stands for. At first we don't know what is special about him, or why anyone would approach him for help. He is just a simple farmer, and not a very successful one at that. But he is taken by a story of a prostitute who was unnecessarily and cruelly disfigured in a town called 'Big Whiskey.' While a bounty is involved, it's as insignificant to the quest as the payment in True Grit. There are much larger issues at stake. There is an underlying air of chivalry that comes straight out of True Grit a wronged woman demands justice, vengeance is required, and the worthiness of those involved is irrelevant. Munny thus hooks up with an inexperienced young partner (an obvious commentary on the Glen Campbell role in True Grit) and his reliable old comrade Ned (Morgan Freeman) and off they go.Gene Hackman is Little Bill, a pompous windbag of a sheriff who rules Big Whiskey with the proverbial iron fist. He is riding high, and delights in not just beating his victims, but degrading them. Richard Harris (English Bob), a phony dime store novel hero, unwisely ventures into town accompanied, improbably, by his very own biographer (Saul Rubinek). Little Bill finds him fascinating but brings English Bob down to earth quickly. It is the rough and tumble old West where only raw power counts, and Little Bill has it.Perceptive and clever despite his own faults, Little Bill knows there are hired guns out to kill him. He captures and interrogates Ned, then kills him. When Munny is told this, he at first appears to simply accept it as something that happens in their line of work. Watch, however, his reaction change when he is told that Little Bill put Ned's corpse on display with a big sign saying This is What Happens to Assassins Around Here. That reaction, one of the most dramatic in any Clint role, sets in motion the climax of the film. We also learn at this point that Munny himself is not, can never be, and cannot consider himself better than anyone else. That fact is important because it shows the source of his humbleness, the demons that haunt him and why he is driven to drink. His character is not the issue here, though, only what it impels him to do.Right after the 2001 terrorist attacks, I was riding in an airport van back to a hotel after being grounded. Rumors were rife, but everyone knew the world trade center was gone. Nobody knew what to say, but a fellow in the back said simply, Someone's gonna pay for this. Exactly.It is not giving anything away to say that when Munny and Little Bill finally meet, there is a brief but epic exchange. I don't deserve to die like this, Little Bill says. 'Deserve's got nothing to do with it, Munny replies. The whole meaning of the Munny character and, indeed, the film is encapsulated in that one line, in the same way that, say, A Few Good Men comes down to You can't handle the truth. Little Bill is pleading his case, as a member in good standing of the community. He thinks his entire life's work should be taken into account before he is sentenced for what both of them know are unpardonable crimes. Munny unhesitatingly rejects that defense out of hand while acknowledging his own fallibility. Little Bill unfortunately had broken a tacit code of tough men you may kill people that you must, but you don't take pleasure in their humiliation. A whore must not be deprived of the only thing she could be proud of, a harmless visitor should not be unnecessarily disgraced, a dead but honorable foe should not be publicly mocked. There shall be no mitigating factors whatsoever when you cross that line.So, you have America, with all its flaws and weaknesses, finally kicking Saddam Hussein out of his intended conquest, Kuwait, and Gorbachev finally tearing down that wall as Reagan demanded. Bill Munny, vile murderer and failure, rights some simple wrongs, and that is all anyone can do. As he rides out of town, you feel as if something greater than a man is present. It is not Munny riding that horse, but the eternal Avenger of honor and decency in the most humble of human forms. His final words temporarily bring the world back into simple balance.

He captures and interrogates Ned, then kills him. When Munny is told this, he at first appears to simply accept it as something that happens in their line of work. Watch, however, his reaction change when he is told that Little Bill put Ned's corpse on display with a big sign saying This is What Happens to Assassins Around Here. That reaction, one of the most dramatic in any Clint role, sets in motion the climax of the film. We also learn at this point that Munny himself is not, can never be, and cannot consider himself better than anyone else. That fact is important because it shows the source of his humbleness, the demons that haunt him and why he is driven to drink. His character is not the issue here, though, only what it impels him to do.Right after the 2001 terrorist attacks, I was riding in an airport van back to a hotel after being grounded. Rumors were rife, but everyone knew the world trade center was gone. Nobody knew what to say, but a fellow in the back said simply, Someone's gonna pay for this. Exactly.It is not giving anything away to say that when Munny and Little Bill finally meet, there is a brief but epic exchange. I don't deserve to die like this, Little Bill says. 'Deserve's got nothing to do with it, Munny replies. The whole meaning of the Munny character and, indeed, the film is encapsulated in that one line, in the same way that, say, A Few Good Men comes down to You can't handle the truth. Little Bill is pleading his case, as a member in good standing of the community. He thinks his entire life's work should be taken into account before he is sentenced for what both of them know are unpardonable crimes. Munny unhesitatingly rejects that defense out of hand while acknowledging his own fallibility. Little Bill unfortunately had broken a tacit code of tough men you may kill people that you must, but you don't take pleasure in their humiliation. A whore must not be deprived of the only thing she could be proud of, a harmless visitor should not be unnecessarily disgraced, a dead but honorable foe should not be publicly mocked. There shall be no mitigating factors whatsoever when you cross that line.So, you have America, with all its flaws and weaknesses, finally kicking Saddam Hussein out of his intended conquest, Kuwait, and Gorbachev finally tearing down that wall as Reagan demanded. Bill Munny, vile murderer and failure, rights some simple wrongs, and that is all anyone can do. As he rides out of town, you feel as if something greater than a man is present. It is not Munny riding that horse, but the eternal Avenger of honor and decency in the most humble of human forms. His final words temporarily bring the world back into simple balance. And, in this vale of tears, sometimes that's the best you can hope for.

I think is was because of the prostitute incident at the time of this movie that put me off it. In fact, the prostitute incident put a number of people I knew off of Hugh Grant. Personally I don't think that it was the media's business about whether Hugh Grant was caught with a prostitute, and more so the pressure put on his girlfriend at the time to forgive him.This movie is about four weddings and a funeral. In fact, there is only one scene in the movie that is not set at a wedding or the funeral. As one can tell by the title the movie is about marriage, but the conclusion that it comes to I inevitably disagree with. The movie is based around a group of friends who are always going to weddings. In fact, it is the time of life when everybody is getting married. Charles (Hugh Grant) always sleeps in and as such is always late to weddings. That is until his own when all of his friends make damn sure that he gets up in time.The movie explores death and marriage, and at one point - the low point - the conclusion is that not everybody is going to get married. This is true as Charles concludes, after he called a wedding off because he did not really want to marry Duck Face - Henrietta, that marriage was not for him - yet he still wanted the companionship of a girl. My opinion here is not that marriage was not for him, but rather that he is so scared to make a commitment to a woman that he would rather have a relationship that he can call off easily.The funeral is of a very cheerful chap who dies at the third wedding. This chap is the oldest and commands his friends to find a partner. He dies and they come to see that not everybody is going to get married. This is not true to the movie because, as one can expect, everybody ends up happily ever after.The thing the people I know did not appreciate about this movie was the ending where they say that they can have a perfect marriage relationship without getting married. This I do not really agree with because marriage involves commitments and promises, and if you are not willing to make these promises to the person, then you should not either consider marrying this person, or living with the person as if you were married.

Well it would be unfair to say that nothing happened at all, but I don't think that it's possible to make draw out a completely passionless affair for two hours and not feel an ounce of boredom. The Piano for me was a bit like the Citizen Kane effect. People say how it's absolutely amazing and full of thoughtful symbols but I must be blind because I can never see them. Apart from the in-your-face haunting imagery at the end.The Piano just felt completely dull and bland for the most part. Very little happens in the way of plot, basically an obnoxious mute woman moves to a barren island to be arranged to be married to Henry Bell (Sam Neill) and she brings her beloved piano with her on a little canoe (as if). Whilst their the stubborn Henry Bell refuses to let Holly hunter bring her lovely piano because it's too big and so the man off Sister Act some how comes to take it (weird actor choice). Annoyed she goes over to his little hut and asks for it back. He makes a bargain with her, she has to come over their and play it for every black key whilst he does increasingly more perverted things to her. Anyway they end up having an affair, Henry bell finds out, chops off her finger and she goes off the island.Character development is sparse, and as you can tell, the plot is annoyingly thin to make a full two hours out of. The affair is also completely unconvincing. Why would a seemingly posh lady have it off with a rough native from Sister Act? The affair is also completely passionless. There is literally zero chemistry between them and so it's hard to care about them. It also doesn't help that Ada is such an unlikably angry character, who you can't help but dislike. The man from Sister Act is also entirely unlikable because he's just a complete pervert. Henry bell's the most interesting character, but he's also not likable. And as for the girl! My god she's annoying with her pathetic Scottish accent and wailing cries. I know she's only a little girl but, that doesn't stop her from being annoying.However, The Piano is nicely shot for the most part, and it did show marvellous potential towards the end when Henry Bell goes mad and chops off Holl Hunter's finger. The last shot is also quite creepy and haunting. But, it's a difficult path getting there. It's two hours but it felt more like two and a half! The performances are OK but they're no one you're bound to fall in love with. The Piano was a dull and sometimes painfully boring film. I think that it spends too much time doting around with symbols rather than giving us some substance to back up the symbols (I'm thinking Black Swan). Save yourself the time and watch the French & Saunders version.

Well it would be unfair to say that nothing happened at all, but I don't think that it's possible to make draw out a completely passionless affair for two hours and not feel an ounce of boredom. The Piano for me was a bit like the Citizen Kane effect. People say how it's absolutely amazing and full of thoughtful symbols but I must be blind because I can never see them. Apart from the in-your-face haunting imagery at the end.The Piano just felt completely dull and bland for the most part. Very little happens in the way of plot, basically an obnoxious mute woman moves to a barren island to be arranged to be married to Henry Bell (Sam Neill) and she brings her beloved piano with her on a little canoe (as if). Whilst their the stubborn Henry Bell refuses to let Holly hunter bring her lovely piano because it's too big and so the man off Sister Act some how comes to take it (weird actor choice). Annoyed she goes over to his little hut and asks for it back. He makes a bargain with her, she has to come over their and play it for every black key whilst he does increasingly more perverted things to her. Anyway they end up having an affair, Henry bell finds out, chops off her finger and she goes off the island.Character development is sparse, and as you can tell, the plot is annoyingly thin to make a full two hours out of. The affair is also completely unconvincing. Why would a seemingly posh lady have it off with a rough native from Sister Act? The affair is also completely passionless. There is literally zero chemistry between them and so it's hard to care about them. It also doesn't help that Ada is such an unlikably angry character, who you can't help but dislike. The man from Sister Act is also entirely unlikable because he's just a complete pervert. Henry bell's the most interesting character, but he's also not likable. And as for the girl! My god she's annoying with her pathetic Scottish accent and wailing cries.
