[{"date":"14 November 2003","score":"","review":"  Pecker, with it's bizarre setting and even weirder characters, appears to be the most original film since Benny & Joon (1993). John Waters is acclaimed for his strangness. I've never seen any of his other work, but I suddenly must rent all his work.The cast is enviable. Several comedies along the same lines would have done well to have such a cast. Christina Ricci, one of my all time favorites, does a wonderful job as an obsessive owner of a Baltimore laundry. And I'm used to seeing Edward Furlong in dramatic films like American History X and Animal Factory. Even in Detroit Rock City, he played a very straight character. His acting abilities have never been impressive, but he did excellent here.The story itself is adorable. It's almost unspeakably strange and beyond weird straight into deformed and abnormal. But you can't help laughing hysterically all the way through it. I give this film 8 out of 10. It should have been a bit longer, and I didn't really enjoy the strippers, but other than that, it's a wonderful film.
