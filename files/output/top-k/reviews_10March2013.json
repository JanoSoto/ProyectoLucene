[{"date":"10 March 2013","score":"","review":" Mindless fluff about an art house auctioneer who wants to marry a teacher -- whose father just happens to be a made man. You can guess where this will be going. What this oft-told tale has going for it is Hugh Grant's fumbling but resolute character who tries desperately not to get sucked into the nether world of gangsters and their illicit affairs. James Caan as his prospective father in law plays a role he has played before and since. Jeanne Tripplehorn is the fetching love interest, and virtually the entire cast of The Sopranos shows up in supporting roles. The first half has plenty of low-key humor. The second half goes on a bit too long and feels strained as the plot struggles toward a family-friendly resolution. Released in 1999, it has a slightly dated feel now. Shot in NYC, which is a plus.
