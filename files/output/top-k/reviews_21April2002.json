There isn't nearly enough dialogue; the romance between Mathayus and Cassandra feels almost painfully-forced.Aside from that, the plot is predictable and overdone, the women are nearly all helpless idiots who race around shrieking and being generally useless, and a great many of the Action Hero Battle Comments are truly uninspired--some might say, cheesy.The Scorpion King, however, isn't necessarily a bad movie.

Speculation amongst wrestling and movie fans raged, as both wondered whether the film would be a hit or a flop, and whether Johnson was willing to take a page from wrestling icon Hulk Hogan's book and risk putting out a bad film for the chance of becoming a legitimate star in the wrestling and movie world.  It turns out he is following more along the lines of Rowdy Roddy Piper, starring in a movie that is nowhere near as bad as Hogan's films, but entertaining enough for all the wrong reasons to earn the title of cult classic.Johnson's role in The Mummy Returns did not require him to speak.  In retrospect, this is the best thing they could do for that role, as it left the character with a shred of credibility.  As Mathayus (the man who would be the Scorpion King), Johnson blatantly overacts, treating the entire film as if he were simply cutting a long WWF promo.  It's a legitimate shock that he doesn't burst out an It doesn't matter! or If you smel-l-l-l-l-l-l what Mathayus is cookin'! during the course of the film.  As it is, there are surprisingly few wrestling moves and only a few subtle references to The Rock's WWF character.  However, given that this film, like The Mummy Returns, credits him as The Rock and seems to be aiming toward attracting an audience of wrestling fans, it is puzzling and interesting that there weren't more obvious references.To make up for the lack of wrestling moves, the film promises and delivers nothing but action! The paper-thin plot has its share of holes, but it doesn't matter (no pun intended) when the film is 90% action.  Long stretches of the film are devoted to non-stop violence, Johnson against all comers, with barely a scratch against him.  This type of invincible hero destroys mobs of foes with the bat of an eyelash style action has never been realistic or appealing, especially in a non-gory (due to the film's PG-13 rating) context, but if anyone is to make it look believable, it's Johnson.  Those who bought tickets solely to see The Rock whip some candy ass! will not be disappointed.  To those who were hoping for something more, there's always the inevitable sequel (especially given the most obvious plot hole of The Scorpion King being a villain in The Mummy Returns and a hero in this film).Perhaps it would be easier to take the film seriously if it wasn't so cheesy and unintentionally funny.  Vast amounts of CGI are thankfully spared, but the CGI ants and snakes that do make appearances are plastic-like in appearance, unrealistically shiny, and nowhere near convincing.  As if that alone weren't bad enough, what does Johnson do? Squash the ants with his chin.  Though a little tongue-in-cheek, the majority of sequences such as these are presented seriously, which makes them all the more funny.  Ironically, the scenes that are played for laughs, such as those with comic relief, are for the most part not funny.  Also, in true cult fashion, one of the film's biggest draws is an attractive female lead.  In this case, said lead is Kelly Hu, who actually gives the best performance of the movie (not that anyone really noticed due to her wearing of the skimpiest outfit in the movie).This film has all the elements (lots of meaningless violence, a popular celebrity making a total fool of himself with a poor performance, thin plot, unintentional humor, and a sexy lead) to be a cult classic, and on this level it's very enjoyable.  Although the film was by all means terrible, and the worst I have seen all year, it's a decent stepping stone for Johnson to have a legitimate acting career some day (or, more likely, a semi-legitimate career in the fashion of another wrestler turned actor, Rowdy Roddy Piper), and had parts that were enjoyable.  It's definitely not a film worth $9 though, wait for it to come out on video, then get a party together and laugh at it.

Rafe seems to just be in love with America and one girl, Evelyn played by Kate, she's a nurse who helps Ben get back to health after a certain mishap with his nose. They have a romance, but when it comes time for Rafe to choose between his country and his love, which does he pick? You just guess. But when an accident happens in England where Rafe is, they assume him dead and send Eve the message of his death. She and Danny then become real close through this lose and you guess it! They get down and dirty! Rafe comes back though expecting everything to be the same as before. Shock! Eve is pregnant with Danny's baby; but that's the least of their problems when the evil Japenese are thinking about bombing an unexpecting army base, Pearl Harbor.The movie then just turns into nothing but action and makes the audience forget that this was real. I didn't feel a connection between Ben and Josh. If could actors just look more like they hate each other or didn't enjoy working together. Kate has a good performance, but unfortunately is not supported well by the other actors. The Japenese are made out to be total villains, even though what they did was wrong, but the movie might as well just should made them into those villains from the old James Bond flicks.

Surely this was Terry Gilliam's most nightmarish turn as a director.  The film is based on  the adventures of Baron Munchausen, a fictional hero who was based on an actual person by the same name, known as the greatest liar in the world.  In this film we find that all of his claims are true, that he really does get caught up in strange adventures such as visiting the moon, flying on a cannonball (two actually), capturing the hearts of the worlds (and heaven's) most beautiful women, all accomplished with the greatest ease.  The story centers on the relationship between the aging Munchausen and a 10 year-old girl who believes all of his stories;  the girl is the best thing in the film, but John Neville, a famous stage actor, simply does not pull off a convincing character as the Baron (his first appearance in film), possibly because what would work on the stage simply doesn't work on film.  His warbly voice as the 80 year old Baron is too stagy, and I didn't feel a real connection between him and the little girl, which is essential to caring about his character.  Otherwise he just comes across as a cold, self-centered character, which I'm sure was not Gilliam's attempt.  Neville looks great as the Baron, but he simply looked liked a theatrical character as the Baron, not a real man caught up in his own dramatics and myths.Eric Idle as the world's fastest man (and one of the Baron's amazing friends) is simply wasted in the film, and none of his sequences are really funny; his character is simply not given enough funny things to do, and some of his antics are actually painful to watch.  Visually, the film is stunning, but strangely choppy in places.  After reading the book about its production and the constant interference Gilliam had to contend with, it becomes understandable.  In a desperate attempt to control over-runs, the studio kept demanding more and more cuts to the film.   Well worth watching, however, as some of the shots are unbelievable and must have been stunning on the big screen.  Read the book also, however; you will gain a greater appreciation for what a nightmare this movie really was to make, including bizarre stories concerning drugged tigers escaping the set, bets concerning who was going to the first to sleep with the then 17 year-old virgin Uma Thurman, deranged producers not concerned with trivialities like paying actors and crew, Italian scam artists ripping off the production right and left, explosives experts using far too much gunpowder (almost blowing up a horse), etc., that make Baron Munchausen seem tame by comparison.

Normally this is just a metaphor.  But in this case something very like torture is involved.

Its a good thing Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Award, I felt that Ethan Hawke should have won the Best Supporting Actor Award. He did an outstanding job. No matter what anyone else says, I think he should have gotten the award instead of Jim Broadbent. PLOT (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) It's the first day on the job for Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). And what he wants more than anything is put put crooks and cops behind bars....not become one. But that is going to be tougher than anything he's ever faced before, because his parter for the day is narcotics veteran Alonzo Harris, a cop who turns out to be dirtier than the thugs he puts away. All of the actors in this movie were good. The supporting cast includes Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr.Dre, Peter Greene, Cliff Curtis and much more. If you like movies with Denzel Washington because he is such a nice person and such a good actor, then stay away! You will hate him in this movie. But you will be able to relate to Ethan Hawke in many ways. If you like strong brutal violence and lots of language throughout movies, then this one is for you. You will find it interesting as Alonzo and Jake cruise the streets looking for trouble...and find it where ever they go. This is a knockout action film. A great suspense one, and a factual drama. So, I really don't know how to catigorize it. As an Drama Action Thriller? I don't know. All I know is that this is one heck of a movie and that I like it a lot. See it if you are a fan of strong violence. There's plenty of that to go around. TRAINING DAY 5\/5.
