[{"date":"20 September 2005","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Supernova is set aboard the 'Emergency Medical Rescue Vessel Nightingale' where Captain A.J. Marley (Robert Forster) likes to watch Tom & Jerry cartoons, ex-military co-pilot Nick Vanzant (James Spader) is the typical 'macho loose cannon\/hero' character, engineer Benjamin Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz) likes to play chess & chat with the on-board computer named Sweetie (Vanessa Marshall, voice), Doctor Kaela Evers (Angela Bassett) is the authoritative type while medical assistant's Yerzy Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips) & Danika Lund (Robin Tunney) like to have zero gravity sex, with each other obviously. Out of the blue they receive an emergency distress call from a supposedly abandoned mining planet called 'Titan 37', when they get there the gravitational pull of the planet damages the Nightingale & results in the loss of fuel. A small spacecraft from the surface of Titan 37 docks with the Nightingale containing a man named Troy Larson (the IMDb is wrong as Peter Facinelli plays Troy not Karl). The spacecraft also contains a strange unidentifiable object, an object that turns out could wipe out the entire universe which Troy wants & which Troy will kill for...Well, where do I start with Supernova? First of all I think it's fair to point out that Supernova, originally to be known as 'Dead Star', apparently had a very troubled production history, originally to be directed by Geoffrey Wright he quit after the usual differences with the studio, the project was then passed onto Walter Hill who obviously shot things his way which the studio wasn't happy about so Hill disowned the film & the first trailer went out with the director credited as Alan Smithee (a name any director would use who wanted to take their name off the finished film) but that name was scrapped & the director is listed as Thomas Lee, but it doesn't end there as Jack Sholder & Francis Ford Coppola were brought in to make the film more commercial I would imagine although the extent of their involvement is unclear as to whether it was just re-editing the film or indeed re-shooting certain scenes, maybe we'll never really know for sure & don't go expecting a director's commentary on the DVD anytime soon! Add to this to the fact that Supernova was shelved by it's studio for quite a while & it's somewhat surprising that I didn't think it was too bad. The script by David C. Wilson plays a lot like Alien (1979) to start with, the lonely isolated crew on-board a spacecraft receiving a distress signal & discovering some sort of alien menace but towards it's climax it turns into a bit of a cat & mouse thriller. As a whole while it's a little patchy, uneven & unfocused there are some decent ideas here that could have made for a pretty good Sci-Fi thriller if not for the production problems. I have to say it feels like two different sets of director's & editors worked on it but two perfectly competent ones. One area where I must praise Supernova are it's special effects, while not as flashy as many films the CGI here is excellent & truly some of the most impressive I've ever seen. With a supposed budget of $60,000,000 technically Supernova has a very odd look throughout, the entire film seems shot in blue hues & tones, peoples eyes are lit differently to the rest of their features in many, many scenes & for some bizarre reason there are lots of shaky hand held camera jerky type shots when on-board the Nightingale but outside when full CGI is used the camera is rock steady & wobble free which also gave Supernova a disjointed uneven feel to me. The acting is OK but not much character background is given for them to work with & a special mention goes to Cruz as the token comic relief black guy who is just plain annoying & puts in a poor performance. Basically Supernova obviously suffered badly because of it's production problems although I can't say I think it's a really bad film it's certainly an uneven & sporadic one that entertains & interests on occasion while it bores & confuses on others. Slightly below average but I think it's worth watching if your a Sci-Fi fan, others should wait to see it on TV for free rather than spend hard earned cash on it, a real curiosity.
