But that was a difficult decision for me.  Do I rate the film based on what it is worth in the scope of film or do I rate it based on what the film accomplished in it's day and age?  Because this film is still quite cardboard when it comes to acting and as some other people noted in here, this is really just a four hour episode of The Young and the Restless.  But then I also had to realize how the film made me feel.  And I did get through all 3 hours and 52 minutes of it, and that is an accomplishment in itself.  The first time I saw Citizen Kane, I fell asleep, the second time I saw Citizen Kane I wanted to smash the T.V. But Gone With The Wind is quite good, for this day and age or for the 30's or 40's.  I generally don't like older classic films because I just find that they are too one dimensional.  They don't have an edge to them and they are very synthetic.  Gone With The Wind does fall into that category in some ways, but in other ways it is brilliant.To think that this film is 61 years old is quite remarkable.  It must have been quite the achievement back in the day.  The colour in this film was amazing as well as the cinematography, the landscape, the fire and yes even some of the acting.  I found Clark Gable to be fascinating to watch and I realized the the film was much more enjoyable when he was in the picture. That is not to say that Vivien Leigh was not good, she was, but I just found Rhett Butler's character to be very charming, engaging and suave.  I also liked his carefree attitude.  He always bounced back from whatever was troubling him and he never let Scarlett get him down, until the very end.Scarlett on the other hand was the most annoying character I have ever seen in any film.  Vivien Leigh played her brilliantly and if that is what the script called for, a winy bitch that has no idea what life is really about, then Leigh nailed it perfectly.  But I must say that she got to me after a while.  When she constantly opted for Ashley instead of other men even after her and Melanie became good friends, I wanted her to die.  I was hoping the Yankees would capture her and torture her.  She was spoiled and nasty and people say that she went on some journey to discover who she was and such but she was the same at the end as she was in the beginning.  And that is why the famous line, Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn is so appropriate.  Someone finally told her off and it was about time.  She had been handed everything to her ( except Ashley ) and she didn't appreciate any of it.  I do think this was one of the great performances of the era.Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel were also great.  Melanie was the backbone of the film and Mammie was just a joy to watch.  She made me laugh and I think she is one of the few characters from the old films that would still sound real and genuine today.  Both were a pleasure to watch.GWTW has it's place in history and I guess it deserves it.  Still I don't think this is one of the best films ever made although it is entertaining. I can only imagine how this must have delighted audiences back in the 30's and 40's though.I really didn't want to see this film for the longest time.  I have been disappointed with some of the other so called classics and I was not looking forward to sitting through another, especially at 4 hours in length.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It captivated me and kept me entertained and that is what is missing from many of the 30's 40's and 50's films, entertainment. Gone With The Wind doesn't disappoint.8 out of 10.

Anyway...First of all, great cast, of actors who all did awesome jobs. Frank Darabot seems to work magically with actors in his films.(even though he only has done two, but it's still all good) His actors never seems to be confused of what they are playing and they seem totally absorbed. Great pace of the film. I like films where it's not just cut and cut and cut and next scene.

It has many of the same elements, to be sure, but M-I serves up confections, and here is something more interesting.Imagine an intelligent screenwriter's first choice whose story is this and what form must the telling take as a result? This is Carrington's story. She was an introspective painter who never exhibited -- thus we have a meditative, rather longish development. But you'll note that this is not just to revel in any lushness. What's done here is that each scene is a sequence of many small shots, each exquisitely framed, but shown less long than one can absorb. This is how Carrington would see the narrative, and it is a rather clever approach to centering it in her eye, if you can center down and read the pictures.You also see her bias in many of the decisions related to the mechanics of the plot her appearance changes little in 17 years; her affairs are always seen, but those of Lytton are not; and we are denied fascinating details (her father's death, the famous gatherings of the intelligently eccentric Bloomsbury Group) that she would have considered unimportant.As the presentation is visual, Emma Thompson must dramatize physically, and so she does. Some of her character's most awkward moments have Emma in almost caricatured postures, much as one imagines one's self in retrospect as clumsy.The test of a film is whether it transports you to an unfamiliar place and embeds a strange experience that sticks. The emotional and sexual situation here is bizarre and unfamiliar, but if you just take it as a pretty, competent film with a story, it won't work. If you take is as a film about her world, from her world, there's an additional rewarding dimension.But go relaxed.

I had been awake for nearly 24 hours but needed to kill some time. I was only 17, not old enough to get into the 18-rated movie, and it scared the hell out of me.As we get older, fewer and fewer movies have the ability to scare us as we all get more savvy and jaded to the formulaic nature of most horror films. I don't know what it was about Wishmaster that spooked me so bad, but I've been a fan of the film ever since.On a technical level, Wishmaster suffers from shoddy production design and direction that is barely above that of a cheap daytime soap opera. The acting is mostly appalling (with the exception of Andrew Divoff, who ravages the role of the Djinn\/Demerest), and some of the dialogue is clunky. But, as a whole, the movie excels on pure energy alone. I mean, not only do you have more in-jokes than you can possibly count but even Jack the Ripper himself turns up before Lemmy sings hard rock over the closing credits.There's so much potential, imagination, and over-the-top carnage that the film just whizzes by. A lot of the potential isn't taken full advantage of (the 90 minute runtime keeps things to the bare minimum) but it sets up enough mythology to justify three sequels, the first sequel being the only decent one, however.The plot focuses on the Djinn, that's Wishmaster to you, and his efforts to take over the world. As you can see...it's pure hokum but it's the gory bits in between and the Djinn's wisecracking that make this movie worth the money. The Djinn will never be as infamous or as iconic as Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers etc, but that's not to say that he's not an utterly brilliant character. Divoff is absolutely perfect in the role. Even if all he did was real aloud from phone book he'd be mesmerizing.If you like gore, ghoulish make-up effects, and don't mind horror humor that feels like it was conjured up by a bunch of drunken frat boys, then you'll find plenty to like about Wishmaster.

I have seen it three times! I have read it three times! and so on. I mean ok if you like this great, I pity you and question your tastes, but why do people who love something feel they have to back it up by saying they did it 3 times? Once means tried maybe? A Second means it was neat I'll do it again? So three must mean HARDCORE!!! WOOOOOOOWHEE! Well whatever reasoning, I have never known pain like this pain. My friend and I winced at Mission to Mars (M2M for you clever trendy folk) so the wincing was increased ten fold during Battlefield Earth. Hey that could be BFE! I've been to BFE, my friend lived in BFE, it took 40 minutes to get there. It was a bad movie.

This really isn't a tear-jerker as such, it's just that the material and the way it is handled made me feel such affection for those girls struggling so hard to be whole. Set in New England in the sixties with Vietnam in the background and free love in the streets, this is a fine film with an excellent cast that tells an original story without mawkish sentimentality or any pandering to the politically correct. The psychotherapeutic industry is not indicted, nor is society held over the coals. Everything is individual and the faults and failures are individual faults and failures, and the ultimate redemption or lack there of is also individual.Winona Ryder gives a striking performance as 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen, writer to be who finds herself in a mental institution after a suicide attempt. Ryder, who has the expressive face of a silent film star, proves beyond any doubt that she is a gifted and tremendously hard working actress.Trickster Angelina Jolie is fascinating in her academy-award winning supporting role as a kind of femme bad boy. Whoopi Goldberg as a Nurse Ratched with a heart, anchors the film and brings strength and rationality to the lives of the girls. Vanessa Redgrave, elegant and wise as Dr. Wick, a shrink with compassion and intelligence, serves as a counterbalance to Jeffrey Tambor's incompetent Dr. Potts.Some have compared this to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) but this is an entirely different kind of movie. It has neither the range nor the outrageous humor of that great film. Director James Mangold, whose much admired Heavy (1995) showed what he can do, wisely attempts less here as he concentrates on the personal journey Susanna Kaysen takes to the brink of institutionalized insanity and back. He emphasizes how people can bond and show affection under dysfunctional circumstances, and how we can triumph over the darker aspects of our nature. In the final analysis, this is a heroic film and a tribute to those who rise above the demons in their souls.
