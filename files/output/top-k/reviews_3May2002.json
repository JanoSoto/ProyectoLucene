Leelee Sobieski and Trevor Morgan play two young kids who are sent to live with family friends after the untimely demise of their parents. Stellan Skarsgard plays Terry Glass, a man who seems all too normal, but has something to hide. THE GLASS HOUSE steals so many things from so many movies, I couldn't possibly name them all. The end of the film doesn't even qualify as suspense. The thing that really lets you know what type of movie you are watching is the setting. If it is dark out, you know that you are watching either a horror movie or a thriller. But the climax of this film takes place in broad daylight. And, predictably (and also unbelievably) the bad guy comes back from some disaster that no one else could have survived. It isn't good the way he actually does die. No suspense! NONE! This film was an okay one, but not very original anywhere. Something that is kind of like this would be DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE. Little originality and not very much suspense. I give this flick 3\/5.

Bat-Man?s parents being killed by the joker, Rogue being a teenager, Super-Man having ?Rebuilding The Great Wall of China vision? in ?Superman 4 The Quest for Peace?. Here in Spider-Man the major problems for me were having Spider-man grow spinnerets in his wrists instead of inventing web shooters, having him stick to the walls with tiny cilia on his hands instead of molecular bonding and having him bit by a genetically engineered spider not one that was bombarded with radiation. Don?t they know the song ?Is he strong? Listen Bud, he?s got radioactive blood!? There are a few other things I take issue with but all in all I thought it captured most of the experience nicely. I was worried that Spidey and the Goblin would not display any real signs of super strength like on every cartoon version of Spider-Man ever made where he seems to be significantly weaker than he is in the comics. Instead their battles were some of the best super human fights since ?Superman 2?. Anyway here?s my prediction for Spider-Man 2 or 3? Believing audiences won?t want to see the Green Goblin twice they are going to make Harry become Hobgoblin which would be stupid. Hopefully they won?t do this but instead they will do a mystery in which the audience thinks Harry is the Hobgoblin and then it turns out he isn?t and Hobgoblin is really Ned Leeds, or Jason Macandale or that other guy that he ended up being? that?s what they should do but they won?t? Harry will be Hobgoblin? you read it here first. Anyway despite my irrelevant predictions and stupid complaints it was still the greatest Marvel movie every made unless you count Eddie Murphy?s ?Coming to America? which was clearly the story of the Black Panther. I also like the subtle references to Robot-Master and Johnny Quest. I think I also saw Stan Lee in a crowd scene though I?m not sure? I think this calls for a second viewing.
