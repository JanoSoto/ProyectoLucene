And thus begins the journey of self discovery and standing up for yourself in this epic movie. Truth be told, this is not the most original movie when it comes to the story. A good guy gets into a problem, then a father figure appears who teaches him to deal with it. But the emotions it makes you feel are real and raw, and I guess, that's what matters at the end.

Now this is how you make a sequel! The Final Conflict does just about everything right in building on franchise tropes and expectations and growing them to a newer, grander narrative. Damien is in full command of his power here, and it's exciting to see him at the helm rather than the omnipotent hand of Satan. Of course, he still has his minions and another Rottweiler helps him do his bidding, but seeing Damien at the head of Thorn Industries and how he worked his rise to power makes for a thrilling way to move the story forward. Neill is perfectly cast, injecting a combination of winning charm and darker torment behind his suits and smiles. Jerry Goldsmith is back once more for the score, and like with the story, he expands on his earlier work to provide a fuller, more diverse piece. Some of those angelic compositions near the end are show stopping.Omen III centres itself on an epic story where there are plenty of consequences at stake. We knew all along that Damien would rise to power, but now that he's got it, we don't know whether he'll get his ultimate goal of taking over the world. He has colleague entanglements, as he must kill the child of his assistant to rid the world of Christ, he has romantic complications with Kate, at one point disturbingly raping her in a bid to show how pain can be beautiful, and he ultimately has to face off against God himself. There's a lot more dramatic material there than there ever was in the Final Destination-like crux of the original two films. The vendetta the seven kamikaze priests vow against Damien also really puts the anti-Christ at risk, wherein the first two films his safety was always assured. Writer Andrew Birkin (most famous for his Peter Pan writings, of which you can certainly see lost boys aspects here) does a wonderful job of putting it all out on the table(laying it all on the alter?) for one truly thrilling battle for the ages.Not only is the story as sound as ever, but horror fans are really going to like the viciousness of the deaths throughout. With the seven vigilante monks going after Damien, and Damien himself killing off many others who stand in his way, the body count here is quite high, and like with the first two films, the producers don't hold back in staging an elaborate death scene. Since this had the films of the slasher era to compete with, the brutality of the carnage has been upped once more, and some of the deaths are quiet unsettling. The most notable being when the ambassador ties tape around the door knobs in his office, linking it all to his shotgun trigger, so when his colleagues enter his brains get splattered all over the presidential crest. Another sees a woman burn her infant son with a hot iron, and we memorably see the charred remains of the baby's face. One more, still, is when the first priest tries to kill Damien at a TV station, slipping up from the rafters and being dangled and burned in plastic as he melts in pain. The effects work is quite accomplished (done by A Clockwork Orange makeup artist Freddie Williamson), matching the menace of the acts themselves. Even the events that aren't gory still have a sinister quality to them, like when Damien, after killing an adversary at a fox hunt, rubs what he says to be fox blood on the face of a boy in initiation. With that and that uncomfortable rape scene, The Final Conflict certainly doesn't play it safe like a Hollywood movie should.A riveting thriller, through and grue, The Final Conflict certainly lives up to its title and offers Damien a fabulous final send off. The scope is so much larger than the first two films, and more than just a thriller it ends up becoming some grand theological statement of our times. It's pretty ballsy for a horror sequel to depict Christ on screen, but this one goes one further and gives us an ending so grand and fitting that it looks cut from Ben-Hur. As far as horror sequels go, the Omen III is certainly upper echelon. It's a shame it ended when it was just starting to hit its stride, but then again, given what would follow with the ill-advised fourth film, maybe they did good and quit while they were ahead.

Now this is how you make a sequel! The Final Conflict does just about everything right in building on franchise tropes and expectations and growing them to a newer, grander narrative. Damien is in full command of his power here, and it's exciting to see him at the helm rather than the omnipotent hand of Satan. Of course, he still has his minions and another Rottweiler helps him do his bidding, but seeing Damien at the head of Thorn Industries and how he worked his rise to power makes for a thrilling way to move the story forward. Neill is perfectly cast, injecting a combination of winning charm and darker torment behind his suits and smiles. Jerry Goldsmith is back once more for the score, and like with the story, he expands on his earlier work to provide a fuller, more diverse piece. Some of those angelic compositions near the end are show stopping.Omen III centres itself on an epic story where there are plenty of consequences at stake. We knew all along that Damien would rise to power, but now that he's got it, we don't know whether he'll get his ultimate goal of taking over the world. He has colleague entanglements, as he must kill the child of his assistant to rid the world of Christ, he has romantic complications with Kate, at one point disturbingly raping her in a bid to show how pain can be beautiful, and he ultimately has to face off against God himself. There's a lot more dramatic material there than there ever was in the Final Destination-like crux of the original two films. The vendetta the seven kamikaze priests vow against Damien also really puts the anti-Christ at risk, wherein the first two films his safety was always assured. Writer Andrew Birkin (most famous for his Peter Pan writings, of which you can certainly see lost boys aspects here) does a wonderful job of putting it all out on the table(laying it all on the alter?) for one truly thrilling battle for the ages.Not only is the story as sound as ever, but horror fans are really going to like the viciousness of the deaths throughout. With the seven vigilante monks going after Damien, and Damien himself killing off many others who stand in his way, the body count here is quite high, and like with the first two films, the producers don't hold back in staging an elaborate death scene. Since this had the films of the slasher era to compete with, the brutality of the carnage has been upped once more, and some of the deaths are quiet unsettling. The most notable being when the ambassador ties tape around the door knobs in his office, linking it all to his shotgun trigger, so when his colleagues enter his brains get splattered all over the presidential crest. Another sees a woman burn her infant son with a hot iron, and we memorably see the charred remains of the baby's face. One more, still, is when the first priest tries to kill Damien at a TV station, slipping up from the rafters and being dangled and burned in plastic as he melts in pain. The effects work is quite accomplished (done by A Clockwork Orange makeup artist Freddie Williamson), matching the menace of the acts themselves. Even the events that aren't gory still have a sinister quality to them, like when Damien, after killing an adversary at a fox hunt, rubs what he says to be fox blood on the face of a boy in initiation. With that and that uncomfortable rape scene, The Final Conflict certainly doesn't play it safe like a Hollywood movie should.A riveting thriller, through and grue, The Final Conflict certainly lives up to its title and offers Damien a fabulous final send off.

It' definitely in my top twenty. In this movie, we see Marty McFly and Doc, great friends, despite the age difference. Doc is a scientist, and Doc is just his nickname, given to him by Marty. His real name is Dr. Emmett Brown. And he has just made a successful time traveling machine. A DeLorean to be specific. That's right, he made a time machine out of a cool looking and futuristic car. But when Marty is accidentally sent back thirty years into the past, to 1955, lots of bad stuff happens. He meets his mother, who accidentally starts falling for her own son, without realizing it. And since he has altered the space\/time continuum, he must get his parents to fall in love, otherwise, he's going to fade away. With the help of past Doc, he successfully gets his parents back together and gets home. And when he gets back to 1985, we find out that his life has been altered, for the better.

Lemon Nineteen Hundred.Or just plain simply 1900, his year of birth.To avoid problems with certain instances 1900 lived deep in the hull of the cruise ship, until the day Danny died.Then he suddenly disappears.Until he reappears one night,sitting behind a piano and playing it in a wonderful way.He'll become the most virtuoso fabulous pianist in the world who doesn't have the courage to set foot on shore.It's directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and is based on the monologue Novecento of the writer Alessandro Baricco.Overall,I thought there were three major chapters in this film.The first part can be described as Oliver Twist on The Titanic.The same atmosphere and guidance as in Titanic,but without an iceberg anywhere so the crossing to America was completed without a hitch and one could behold the Statue of Liberty after arrival. A kind of Walt Disney part where the first years of 1900 were told in an amusing way. The second part is the largest and most musical part. A series of musical interludes, including the piano duel against Jelly Roll,The man who invented jazz as people said,and 1900.Ennio Morricone provided the musical frame.So you know that this is a guarantee for masterful pieces of music.The third part is the most philosophical and tragicomic area.The attempt that Max is doing to get 1900 to leave the old cruise ship before it gets demolished.Three chapters which flow into each other fluently.In the beginning it alternates between the past and the present by means of flashbacks.An engaging,comical and touching film that continues to fascinate and amaze.Tim Roth,who I recently saw starring in Broken and also has an impressive resume on his name,takes care of the lead role as the adult 1900.I think he's a wonderful actor who just has an innate calmness, interspersed with a truly sad, melancholic posture and gaze.The childish amazement about everyday things and the otherworldliness are expressed by him in a simple,unaffected way.He seems like a humble, timid and kind person,until he uses a heartfelt asshole.A pianist who uses his emotions and the observed characteristics of people in his piano playing and only lives for his music. During a recording that was made by a music company,which would make him world famous and very rich,you can hear the tone and atmosphere of his piano performance slowly turn into a very intimate timbres merely by the appearance of a lovely lady.Even the deep philosophical reasoning in the end sounded acceptable, although 1900 didn't enjoy academic education.He gave a simplistic though rational explication about his state of mind and fear of the unknown.Pruitt Taylor Vince takes on the role of Max,the lone musician who is forced to sell his instrument.He wasn't really known to me.When I read his biography,he seemed to have made quite a furore in the years 80-90. He has won an Emmy for his role in Murder One.It looks as if he has been forgotten a bit and only played small parts in some other films.Probably those parts were so small that I can't even remember them.All in all I found him fitting for this part although there was sometimes a case of overacting and he wasn't really in sync with the rudderless ship during the storm as he was wobbling all over the place.This stormy scene was for me rather too dramatic and slapstick-like.Pretending to be seasick,swaying back and forth and doing the waltzing dance while sitting behind the piano.Although this film is appropriate for it,it still didn't become an overly grand Hollywood spectacle.It was sometimes overwhelming and impressive.The moment someone sees the Statue of Liberty and the whole ship starts waving with handkerchiefs and everybody is shouting out of intense joy (while the upper class sticks to a polite subdued applause) was the first goosebumps moment. After the umpteenth time however,despite the successful comedic approach in the end,it was a bit too much.Also the piano duel was a highlight where it was indisputable that 1900 played in such a way that it looked like he was playing with four hands (and the highlight of the smoldering cigarette of course).Yet at one time I had reached a saturation point.A superb duel and brilliant expressions,but still it was excessively long.But these tiny remarks don't outweigh the greatness of this film.

Once he went back to his formula way of making pictures, he became successful as evidenced in his next film, Strangers on a train. Under Capricorn was an experiment that failed. Every auteur genius is allowed one or two in their career. Kubrick, Spielberg, Wyler &#x96; they all had them. Hitch had them, too.

It's a fine film that is elevated by a mystery that evolves over the course of the film. But this film isn't the greatest romance I have seen, but it does have good marks for being entertaining. There were some awkward plot holes and the script was a little confusing at times. Also, the editing seemed to be a little off which interrupted the flow of the film at times. But the acting is great and combined with the interesting story, we have got ourselves a good movie.Jon Amiel's film is about a man named Jack Sommersby who has just arrived home after he was feared dead in the Civil War. His wife, Laurel seemed to be doing okay without him. When he returns, he seemed to undergo personal changes(for the better)and everyone seems happy about that. But once he is arrested for murder, his identity and his life now hangs in the balance.This film is well-acted. Richard Gere gives off a radiant performance as Jack Sommersby and he gave his character a neat balance of emotions. Jodie Foster was solid as Laurel and she had great chemistry with Gere. We also get some solid supporting characters by the rather hasty Bill Pullman and the underused James Earl Jones.Overall, Sommersby is a fairly decent romance and while it won't change romance cinema, it manages to be effective. Sometimes the film got confusing as it unexpectedly switches gears from a romance to a courtroom drama and so forth. But I was able to connect with the characters and their emotions of love and confusion as the film progresses. I loved the idea in what would happen if your lover would return with the same looks, but a different personality. It's an intriguing topic and the film tackles it pretty well.

Seltzer refused as he had no interest in writing sequels. Years later, Seltzer commented that had he written the story for the second Omen, he would have set it the day after the first movie, with Damien a child living in The White House. With Seltzer turning down Omen II, producer Harvey Bernhard duly outlined the story himself, and Stanley Mann was hired to write the screenplay.After Bernhard had finished writing the story outline and was given the green light to start the production, the first person he contacted was Jerry Goldsmith because of the composer's busy schedule. Bernhard also felt that Goldsmith's music for The Omen was the highest point of that movie, and that without Goldsmith's music, the sequel would not be successful. Goldsmith's Omen II score uses similar motifs to his original Omen score, but for the most part, Goldsmith avoided re-using the same musical cues. In fact, the first movie's famous Ave Satani theme is used only partially, just before the closing credits begin. Goldsmith composed a largely different main title theme for Omen II, albeit one that utilises Latin phrases as Ave Satani had done. Goldsmith's Omen II score allows eerie choral effects and unusual electronic sound designs to take precedence over the piano and Gothic chanting.Richard Donner, director of the first Omen movie, was not available to direct the second, as he was busy working on Superman. British film director Mike Hodges was hired to helm the movie. During production, the producers believed that Hodges' methods were too slow, and so they fired him and replaced him with Don Taylor, who had a reputation for finishing films on time and under budget. However, the few scenes Hodges directed (some of the footage at the factory and at the military academy, all of the early archaeology scenes, and the dinner where Aunt Marion shows her concern about Damien) remained in the completed film, for which Hodges retains a story credit. In recent interviews, Hodges has commented sanguinely on his experiences working on Omen II.Academy Award-winning veteran actor William Holden was the original choice to star as Robert Thorn in the first Omen, but turned it down as he did not want to star in a picture about the devil. Gregory Peck was selected as his replacement. The Omen went on to become a huge hit and Holden made sure he did not turn down the part of protagonist Richard Thorn in the sequel. Lee Grant, another Oscar-winner, was a fan of the first Omen and accepted enthusiastically the role of female protagonist-later-turncoat Ann Thorn.Ray Berwick (1914&#x96;1990) trained and handled the crows used for several scenes in the film. Live birds and a crow-puppet were used for the attack on photojournalist Joan Hart. Berwick also trained the avian actors in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963).This more-than-competent sequel to The Omen raises some interesting questions about the nature of free will can the Antichrist deny his birthright?

He lives a life of luxury and is waited on hand and foot. His father King Jaffe Joffer (James Earl Jones) has selected a bride for Akeem to marry and expects Akeem to marry this lady due to it being tradition in the kingdom of Zumunda. However, Akeem is very much against this tradition of 'forced' marriage and wants to marry a bride that he truly loves. With the approval of his father, Akeem along with family servant Semmi (Arsenio Hall) both head to New York for a 40 day period. King Jaffe sends Akeem to New York so that he can 'sow' his oats and then he expects him to come back and marry the woman that he's selected. However, Akeem is determined to find a princess of his own choosing.This is another in a long line of 'fish out of water' comedies so it was never going to win any prizes for originality. However, the way that Coming to America creates the humour is very funny. Akeem and Semmi both arriving at the airport and saying to each other 'don't make it obvious to people that we're rich' whilst wandering around with huge gold chains round their necks and whilst carrying about 20 suitcases, Akeem stepping out in the road and shouting 'Halt' to the Taxi Driver, the scene where Akeem is asked to mop the floor and starts pushing the mop bucket round the floor whilst the mop is still in the bucket. All these scenes were really funny, but what I liked about it is that a lot of the humour was quite subtle rather than being 'in your face' humour.One big plus with this film is the whole premise itself; Akeem could continue living the life of luxury and continue to be waited on hand and foot, but that's not the life that he wants. In order to find his ideal wife he's prepared to slum it out in a rough neighbourhood in New York, do manual labour. He's also looking for a woman with intelligence, but he also looks for a woman with morals. It also really helps that Akeem is such a likable guy - he's wealthy, but is still generous and isn't arrogant. He's also caring and is also a very moral person. I really liked his character and when I saw him in ordinary clothes when he's in New York I almost forgot that he was a prince. The fact that Akeem is looking for a woman with intelligence and morals means that the romance angle of this film is already far less shallow than the romance that you'll see in most rom-coms (which is one of the reasons I normally avoid rom-coms). The blossoming romance between Akeem and Lisa (Shari Headley) was both touching and convincing and it just gave me a really 'warm' feeling inside whenever they shared screen time together.Murphy puts in a good performance which is far more restrained than what we are used to seeing from him. Hall is also good and the chemistry between him and Murphy was excellent. James Earl Jones probably gave the best performance and it was a good choice to cast him in the role of King Joffer - his booming, deep and commanding voice helps to give him a real sense of authority. This film also features Samuel L Jackson in a minor role before he hit the big time. Murphy also experiments with taking on multiple characters himself which is something that he also did later in his career in The Nutty Professor. He's a talented actor and Coming to America was probably about the time when he started to reach the end of his peak. It's a shame that he doesn't seem to enjoy the same amount of success that he achieved in the 80's as he is a really good actor.Coming to America is a wonderful film that is funny and touching at the same time. It's a predictable film, but it's also a 'feel good' film which put a big smile on my face when it finished. Definitely worth checking out.SIDE NOTE; There is a scene in Coming to America which links back to Trading Places which is another of John Landis' films.

The blossoming romance between Akeem and Lisa (Shari Headley) was both touching and convincing and it just gave me a really 'warm' feeling inside whenever they shared screen time together.Murphy puts in a good performance which is far more restrained than what we are used to seeing from him. Hall is also good and the chemistry between him and Murphy was excellent. James Earl Jones probably gave the best performance and it was a good choice to cast him in the role of King Joffer - his booming, deep and commanding voice helps to give him a real sense of authority. This film also features Samuel L Jackson in a minor role before he hit the big time. Murphy also experiments with taking on multiple characters himself which is something that he also did later in his career in The Nutty Professor. He's a talented actor and Coming to America was probably about the time when he started to reach the end of his peak. It's a shame that he doesn't seem to enjoy the same amount of success that he achieved in the 80's as he is a really good actor.Coming to America is a wonderful film that is funny and touching at the same time. It's a predictable film, but it's also a 'feel good' film which put a big smile on my face when it finished. Definitely worth checking out.SIDE NOTE; There is a scene in Coming to America which links back to Trading Places which is another of John Landis' films. I won't say anymore than that, but I thought that this scene was really funny (although you'll need to have seen Trading Places to understand the joke).

I Saw What You Did was nearly Castle's last movie and it shows. The only two gimmicks left to the old carny was the warning on the poster for this snoozer This picture is about UXORCIDE!!. This is an obscure term for the murder of one's wife. Castle was out of ideas by now, no skeletons on a wire, no punishment poll, no ghost viewers. Only a forgotten term for murder...and Joan Crawford.ISWYD is a movie trapped in it's own time bubble, a look at the hijinks of teenage girls left alone with a telephone for fun and games. Once, telephones only made calls in or out, nothing more. Phone pranks have pretty much gone the way of high-button shoes and horse-drawn carriages. This look back at girls in 1965 is sweet, as well as irritating. Home-alone teens Libby and Kit amuse themselves by making dozens of stupid prank calls, along with prepubescent Tess, Libby's beyond annoying little sister. Using the tag line I saw what you did and I know who you are finally hits the jackpot when the two gals inadvertently reach a man who's just murdered his wife. Serious tomfoolery continues until the murderer reaches the girls (don't ask how, it's ludicrous) and lessons are learned.ISWYD is obviously dated and claustrophobic, being filmed entirely on sound stages at Universal. It has the cheap look and feel of a bad TV sitcom. The outdoor sets are painfully fake, and one wonders when Mr. Ed or Herman Munster will pop out of the canned fog. There's also a misplaced super perky soundtrack by the heinous Van Alexander who specialized in terrible TV themes and phony rock and roll. Don't expect tension when bad transistor radio beach party music underscores the action.Which now leads us to the two very sad things about this moldy oldie the murder of the wife (UXORCIDE!!!, remember?) and Joan Crawford. William Castle was the first to blatantly copy Psycho (1960) with his cross-dressing maniac in Homicidal (1961). ISWYD again wanders onto Hitchcock's lawn with the second shower murder of the 60s. This time, however, Castle stages the murder in reverse, where the victim is pulled into the shower and stabbed to death. Castle was really stretching things here. Now, Joan Crawford. Over 60 by this time, she was obviously finishing her contract work with Castle after the campy Strait-Jacket. Here, Joan is swamped by an enormous hairdo, all swoops and curls embellishing a beehive of gargantuan proportion. Joan is playing an extremely horny neighbor, who is having an affair with the shower murderer, played by John Ireland. Joan isn't in the movie for long, which is good. She appears to be drunk and unable to cope with the gigantic hairdo or the huge tacky necklace that's strangling her. Watching Joan purr and slink around Ireland is about as sexy as watching your grandma get her groove on. We are happy when Joan is killed and her hair deflates. Ireland just looks coarse, nervous, and wondering where his check is. ISWYD is frozen in cheap movie studio set Hell, and isn't worth revisiting unless you want your pleasant memory of this potboiler ruined. The available DVD is pretty pricey for a bare bones presentation if you seek it out. The only thing that could have saved this would have been Mr.Ed rescuing the two silly girls from John Ireland.

In the end, this is not suppose to be a hard gritty realistic portrait. It's a racial struggle where the characters are everyday people. There are no easy villains. Spike Lee taps into something more powerful than just a bunch of stereotypes. It's the Korean grocery story, the yuppie moving in, the old black resentments, the Italian holdouts, the Puerto Ricans, the young punks, the police, and the heat.

Mookie (Spike Lee) is Sal's delivery boy and finds himself in the center of the boiling racial tension. Tina (Rosie Perez) is his girlfriend. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) is Mookie's friend who is railing against everything. Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) watches over the neighborhood. Drunk Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) sweeps the sidewalk for a dollar everyday and tells Mookie To always do the Right Thing. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) carries around his loud boom box.This movie is most notable for bringing everyday race relations to the screen. Buggin' Out demanding to have black pictures in the pizzeria is one of those great scenes in American cinema. The biggest complaint is the lack of drugs. In the end, this is not suppose to be a hard gritty realistic portrait. It's a racial struggle where the characters are everyday people. There are no easy villains. Spike Lee taps into something more powerful than just a bunch of stereotypes. It's the Korean grocery story, the yuppie moving in, the old black resentments, the Italian holdouts, the Puerto Ricans, the young punks, the police, and the heat.
