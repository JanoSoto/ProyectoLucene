I feel bad for being so easily persuaded, but nevertheless this was a well made and I am to assume low budget film for Mr. Nolan. Very similar to his Momento editing back and forth, forth and back cutting style. I had to watch a few parts over again to understand, but once I did I was glad I watched it over. The acting is okay, the directing is simple. It is nicely shot in black and white, some of it seems over blown but maybe it was ny television. There is a very interesting score as well.

Not that it's the best movie of all time (sorry, Lawrence of Arabia gets that award from me), but I always highly recommend it because the core ideas are interesting, and the story is told in such a peaceful, respectful way.

First, this is a piece of cinema that CAN be called a movie, and therefore is more watchable than others. Second, it has a fine period score that works exceptionally well with the movie. I mean, they hired an orchestra, an actual orchestra, to play the score (although I have suspicions that they used stock cues for some scenes). Third, there was a studio involved. Although Mr. Wood used the same exterior countless times, he still had scenes inside a studio. And fourth, it's just plain fun to watch. You can make a game whoever finds the most flaws wins a coke.Of course, the so called plot is incredibly stupid, the dialogs are even more dumb, the script is often contradictory. But it's still one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. My favorite scene is where Bela Lugosi's stand-in walks forward a policeman, and later to the detective, the Colonel, the pilot and his wife, and they all just stand back very calmly when they see the zombie.Other gems include a flaming miniature UFO, stock battle footage inter-sped with scenes with the Colonel in a sky background, the boom mike shadow, stock footage of Bela Lugosi being used over and over and the final showdown.So, I'm sorry, I had to say it.

Yet these are not the only things causing distress on this blustery evening, marital strife and stress management issues are besetting some of the airports major players, all this when a madman with a bomb has boarded the flight to Rome!Based on the hugely successful novel written by Arthur Hayley, Airport is not only the trail blazer for the disaster genre, it's also a case study for star appeal over basic substance. Which all told makes for an interesting bed fellow. Yet as niggly as Airport is at times, and as dated as it so clearly is (but lets say period piece), the entertainment value and slick professionalism more than make it a hugely enjoyable piece of fluff. I mean come on, when Dean Martin is the Captain of your flight, you just know that this is a film to be enjoyed with a pinch of salt, this in spite of the multi threaded strands of character arcs that seam throughout the course of the picture.Not without tension, excitement and surprisingly deft moments of humour, (something the makers of Airplane would wonderfully exploit ten years later), Airport suffers mainly because it just doesn't have the time to cram in all of Haley's technical aspects from the book. We do get little tasters of just how pressurised the workers of a busy airport are, both with Dean Martin's Captain Demerest and Burt Lancaster's airport manager, Mel Bakersfield. But in the main the substance needed is glossed over in favour of a star cast mugging for all they are worth. That they are all duty bound to look good as they triumph is of course a given.

He plays Blondie (the Good), a sharp-shooter of debatable honor, iron will, and questionable motives. Leone also brings back Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (the Bad), a sadistic man who always keeps his promises &#150; as long as you pay him for it. Eli Wallach rounds out the trio as Tuco (the Ugly), a thief worried only about his own hide. The three men are held together by the wish to locate a stash of gold, its location imparted to them by a dying man. Alas, things are not so simple. The man whispers some of the information to Tuco, but only Blondie knows the true location. And so our thieves must overcome backstabbing and betrayal, as well as their mutual enemy of Angel Eyes, to reach the treasure.Sergio Leone creates a visual masterpiece. Not even Orson Welles can hold the audience in his hands the way Leone can. The cinematography and editing are perfectly in sync, working together to mold the audience as Leone sees fit. The famous Mexican standoff, with its rapid-fire cutting and incredibly close shots, is jaw dropping, forcing you to hold your breath. And of course, the film simply could not work without Ennio Morricone's incredible (I repeat, incredible) score. Even if you don't bother seeing the movie, look up The Ecstasy of Gold on YouTube. It will leave you speechless and blow your mind.After a disastrous experience with my first foray into Westerns (for the record, Shane is a horrific movie), I all but damned the entire genre to the pits of hell. But after repeatedly spying The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly atop film lists, I decided to give it a try. It had me on the edge of my seat, my eyes shining, my entire being entranced. In my opinion, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of the most spectacular movies ever made. Is it historically accurate? No. Is the plot nice and tight? Not really. But those are trivial matters in the face of what it is &#150; an incredible spaghetti western. And as far as I am concerned, it is one of the best movies ever made.

Leone also brings back Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (the Bad), a sadistic man who always keeps his promises &#150; as long as you pay him for it. Eli Wallach rounds out the trio as Tuco (the Ugly), a thief worried only about his own hide. The three men are held together by the wish to locate a stash of gold, its location imparted to them by a dying man. Alas, things are not so simple. The man whispers some of the information to Tuco, but only Blondie knows the true location. And so our thieves must overcome backstabbing and betrayal, as well as their mutual enemy of Angel Eyes, to reach the treasure.Sergio Leone creates a visual masterpiece. Not even Orson Welles can hold the audience in his hands the way Leone can. The cinematography and editing are perfectly in sync, working together to mold the audience as Leone sees fit. The famous Mexican standoff, with its rapid-fire cutting and incredibly close shots, is jaw dropping, forcing you to hold your breath. And of course, the film simply could not work without Ennio Morricone's incredible (I repeat, incredible) score. Even if you don't bother seeing the movie, look up The Ecstasy of Gold on YouTube. It will leave you speechless and blow your mind.After a disastrous experience with my first foray into Westerns (for the record, Shane is a horrific movie), I all but damned the entire genre to the pits of hell. But after repeatedly spying The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly atop film lists, I decided to give it a try. It had me on the edge of my seat, my eyes shining, my entire being entranced. In my opinion, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of the most spectacular movies ever made. Is it historically accurate? No. Is the plot nice and tight? Not really. But those are trivial matters in the face of what it is &#150; an incredible spaghetti western. And as far as I am concerned, it is one of the best movies ever made.

I loved the two naive ladies caught up in this violence but refusing to move mentally from their normal attitudes to life, while the nine men are funny and benefit from the nice touch of the captured guard in their midst. Kurosawa keeps it moving and does some exciting and sudden action sequences that will not impress those looking for wonderful choreography but they do work because they fit the pace and tone of the film.I was ignorant of Sanjûrô until recently and it was only chance that I rented it. It is a great Kurosawa film and demonstrates the accessibility and entertainment value that some of his more enjoyable films do so well. It is definitely worth seeing.

Many reviewers' favourite movie of all times bar none? Has the world gone quite mad? To me it's a highly forgettable movie. I'm not really addressing those lost souls who actually enjoyed this, to quote Bill Hicks, p. o. s. film, but to warn those impressionable souls who still haven't seen it beware! Beware this p. o. s. film!As for the plot, this movie falls roughly into two halves; in the first we follow a contingent of British soldiers in Japanese captivity in Burma during World War II (the one with the funny mustaches). When the dastardly Saito orders the officers to work alongside their regulars -- a breach of the Geneva Convention -- he is faced off by the impeccable colonel Nicholson. Eventually Saito gives in and the British soldiers build him a magnificent railway bridge.In the second half of the movie we follow an American soldier, Shears, who has managed to escape from Saito's jungle camp. Against his will he is sent back on a secret mission to blow up that very bridge.At the climax, two men are pitched against each other Nicholson, to whom the bridge is a symbol of his perseverance and supremacy, and the American, who has gone through hell and back to destroy it and do damage to the Japs.My major problem with the movie is that colonel Nicholson is obviously a complete idiot. His nemesis Saito may be an evil sadist, but at least he has a weak and human side as well. He is a pudgy little fellow who's been to art school, but now has to make do as a CO. My heart went out to him, whereas I fail to see how anyone can sympathise with the blimpish Nicholson.It's only after the bridge has been completed that a single officer mildly questions the wisdom of building the most magnificent bridge of all times for the Japanese, who are, after all, not exactly their allies. And I never saw what was so unethical about officers working alongside their troops in the first place.Apart from that, it's a pretty conventional, John-Wayne-style war movie. The enemy is inscrutable and evil, Asian women are almond-eyed, servile foxes, the soldiers are undyingly loyal and war is hell but fun (in a rough, it's-a-man's-world sort of way). The production is excellent but overall it's a very dated movie. I'm surprised how anyone would consider this a classic rather than just an old movie. Its only benefit is that it allowed director David Lean to make Lawrence Of Arabia.

Beware this p. o. s. film!As for the plot, this movie falls roughly into two halves; in the first we follow a contingent of British soldiers in Japanese captivity in Burma during World War II (the one with the funny mustaches).

There's reason for that. This one, however, can be deceptive It starts out good. The very opening? Magnificent.

After that, there are glimpses, ideas, and here and there, it almost gets to be great. Alas, the rest of it weighs down, and I'd say that the ending is tasteless beyond anything that was in the first. Subtlety seems to have been the initial victim in the onslaught of graphic death in this. Verhoeven gave us a satire, where the social commentary flowed much smoother... like honey, although (intentionally) bitter.

This takes the route that other movies that join a franchise in progress have, where the predecessor asked the audience to take something seriously It makes fun of it. While this goes for a cynicism similar to the real RoboCop film, and clearly does attempt to recreate the certain undefinable thing of it, it just never gets across the same bleakness. Some of the time, it seems to almost parody the original, and encourage us to lighten up with the visions of what may come, at other points it tries too hard at the dark tone, and becomes quite tough to swallow.

Although Hud is the title character, the film is best summed up by Homer when he says that the country is shaped by the men we admire, and it is this sentiment that makes Hud the subject of the piece even if he is not the main character in regards the surface level narrative. I have read reviews that criticised the film for Hud being hard to like &#150; as if he is somehow the hero that we are meant to be behind. I have read others that have discussed how Hud is relatable underneath his superficial behaviour and, while I'm not saying these writers are wrong, for me the film is not about anything that would be interpreted this way.For me the film is about an accidental battle for the very new, between the old school and the new school &#150; as represented by Lon, Homer and Hud respectively. This plays itself out across all interactions and takes the film to its logical if slightly depressing conclusions. This in itself is bigger than these three men, as it appeared to me to be a scathing commentary on a new generation within America &#150; one that would be quick to exploit the land for oil rather than live off it for, one that drinks to excess rather than for the taste, one that wants whatever woman is already taken rather than taking one woman. I'm not saying anything that you won't already know here, but just in case you miss this, the film gives us the foot & mouth disease scenario to further highlight the difference in approach between the old and the new. On this level the film is fascinating to watch as it gives a greater meaning to the destructive excesses of Hud and the film grips as a battle that none of the characters know they are having or really ever decided to have, it is just a change that is happening.The sense of stark differences is also captured in the excellently clear film of James Wong Howe; the black and white is sharp and the lighting powerful in creating clarity in each scene as well as producing some great washed out landscapes. Ritt works from this to get great performances out of his cast &#150; most noticeably from Newman. Although he has failed to some viewers, who did admire his character, to me Newman manages to keep Hud unsympathetic throughout while also making him someone who we are drawn to. He displays the arrogance of youth so well &#150; knowing that his body will never age or his looks fade and totally certain that the only thing that matters is himself. This character is in the script of course but Newman doesn't wear the words like clothes but is soaked in it, making his portrayal utterly convincing and real. He dominates the screen and accordingly the rest of the cast do not try and be such a big character. Douglas is wonderfully restrained as the figure of the older generation, not weak by any means but realistically lacking the outward passion of his younger rival. It is De Wilde that they are technically competing for and accordingly he has to play his character quite innocent and child-like. Some have criticised him for this and his character is a bit simplistic, but he deserves credit for playing it the way it had to be played. Patricia Neal is perhaps given a bit too much screen time as a character but she works as a lively character in the male household.Hud was shown recently for the same reason that it is mostly remembered &#150; a powerhouse performance from Newman. However the film is much more than that, being a scathing and compelling battle between the old and new generations which focuses on one household while also commenting on an entire country. That it mostly manages to achieve this without being pat or obvious is a feat in itself but that it manages to do it in a film that works on all levels is even more impressive.

While it is not as lavishly produced as Lawrence's (2007) I am Legend, nor as creepified as Ubaldo Ragona's Last Man on Earth, it is a nice example of a sci fi adventure film with a soul and a brain. Doctor Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) has survived an engineered plague which has wiped out most of the earth's human population. Neville developed a cure as the plague erupted, but was unable to get it into production due to a very unfortunate accident. He injected himself, and is now immune. Every night, he is hunted by vampire-like plague victims lead by the puritanical Luddite fanatic Matthias. Matthias and his followers view the plague as the salvation and rebirth of humanity and see their former lives as evil. Neville is the embodiment of everything they despise. Neville, in the meantime, is desperately pursuing survival and trying to re-create the cure. Then one day, Neville encounters a young black woman (Rosalind Cash) posing as a mannequin in a department store. Omega Man is not a sci-fi spectacular. There really are no special effects to speak of and the director, very appropriately, went to great lengths to make it clear that the story takes place today - not in some distant future. The film was made by a director whose career staple was 'made for TV' movies. Unsurprisingly, Omega Man is economically directed - and its thrift sometimes shows. The cinematography is effective, but some of the action scenes are unconvincingly shot. The cast is excellent - Cash and Heston are especially strong. Remarkably, Omega Man creates an abandoned Los Angeles in 1971 with no special effects - almost as effectively as I am Legend did in 2007. It is worth mentioning that I am Legend is estimated to have enjoyed a budget at least 10 times as great as Omega Man's.Omega Man is a good example of the semi-experimental tangents of late 1960s\/early 1970s Hollywood film-making. Influenced by the cold war, nuclear proliferation, Viet Nam, and the burgeoning Western counter-culture, films like 2001 A Space Oddyssey, Silent Running, Rollerball and Omega Man - and even the original Star Trek series - stand out as landmarks in the usually intellectually barren landscape of mainstream sci fi.

While it is not as lavishly produced as Lawrence's (2007) I am Legend, nor as creepified as Ubaldo Ragona's Last Man on Earth, it is a nice example of a sci fi adventure film with a soul and a brain. Doctor Robert Neville (Charlton Heston) has survived an engineered plague which has wiped out most of the earth's human population. Neville developed a cure as the plague erupted, but was unable to get it into production due to a very unfortunate accident. He injected himself, and is now immune. Every night, he is hunted by vampire-like plague victims lead by the puritanical Luddite fanatic Matthias. Matthias and his followers view the plague as the salvation and rebirth of humanity and see their former lives as evil. Neville is the embodiment of everything they despise. Neville, in the meantime, is desperately pursuing survival and trying to re-create the cure. Then one day, Neville encounters a young black woman (Rosalind Cash) posing as a mannequin in a department store. Omega Man is not a sci-fi spectacular. There really are no special effects to speak of and the director, very appropriately, went to great lengths to make it clear that the story takes place today - not in some distant future.
