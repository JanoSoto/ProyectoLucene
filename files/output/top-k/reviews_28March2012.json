It is a film that is often called the most inspirational and I hear it changed sci-fi movies for the better. Due to this I thought it was about time to sit down and watch it.Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop in Los Angeles in 2019. LA is now entirely futuristic, which back in 1982 you may have presumed it would be but today you will see how away from the mark it is. It is home to giant billboards advertising anything and everything. A dark, gloomy, and wet atmosphere heavily influenced by the Japanese, and above all flying cars. To be fair some of it was right on the money. Deckard is a cop known as a blade runner. A blade runner is a certain unit that hunts down replicants (artificial humans) that were created for off-world work. Every now and again replicants go missing and blade runners must stop them and retire them. Deckard is brought out of his own retirement to hunt down six replicants who have escaped and are on Earth searching for their maker in order to prolong their life. Due to replicants growing emotion over time, each has a life span of four years, however when these replicants realise this they head to meet their creator and keep themselves alive. Deckard must stop them before they get too far, unfortunately for him he meets one of these replicants and falls in love with her. Does he retire her?All of that is generally the back story and what you need to know to understand the basis of the film. Really the film is about Deckard hunting the replicants and falling in love. For those of you that have seen it you will understand what I am about to say, it isn't really about any of that. It is full of philosophical issues that will have you thinking after the film has finished. When this film was first released it wasn't well received and people have taken to it after numerous viewings and discussion. Believe me you must have to watch it more than once because I've seen it once and it is really dull. That may cause unrest with people but I have to say I didn't think much to it. I understand the philosophical views hidden deep but I don't see how that makes it a good movie. There is no real story. The themes could have still been explored with more going on but it was just a lot of sitting around and not doing much. It really wasn't what I was expecting. For starters the villain doesn't really show up till over an hour in, so far into it that I forgot there was even a bad guy. The love scenes didn't work as the characters weren't believable, I understand after reading discussions why that might be, but that isn't good for the average movie goer that wants to leave the cinema happy and finished with it. Not everyone likes to research into the movie. I can really see why it has taken time to be a cult film as it has given people time to put forward their theories which people will then relate to it on another viewing. I'm sorry but I don't get it.I can however understand why it has influenced so much. The visuals alone are stunning, and the fact it was made twenty years ago is not noticeable. If it was released in cinemas tomorrow you would not have known it was made two decades ago. The production design completely outshines any story within this film. I can also see the influence within the philosophical themes and how they have opened up many questions. Are replicants human if they believe they are? In the film they are implanted with memories to make them believe they are real, but are they real if their memories aren't actually theirs? I get that these questions are well explored, and I do like to see this in a film, but I was not hooked on the story. It never really drew me in and I was waiting for the action to kick off and it never did. It was so disappointing. It does have brilliant things about it but the entire outcome of the film is completely dull. Hopefully over time I may come to like it and understand it more. Maybe I don't like it because I don't get it and maybe that is the problem. I'm sure people will completely disagree with this but something more had to grab my attention and it didn't.The look of the film is the top draw of this movie. It looks absolutely fascinating, and I would say to watch it just to see how good it is. The acting is generally OK but nothing great. To be fair the characters were so dull that they had little to work with, although some are replicants so that could make sense. The love story is really forced and I never believed it. However there can be an explanation for all of this..... This could be a spoiler, but then again after watching it you'll realise it is not. Six replicants escape, we only ever meet five! Have a watch and you might understand why the movie is why it is.2 \/ 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"28 March 2012","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Blade Runner is a film I had grown up hearing so much about, but one that I had never actually watched.

You're going to enter the minds of some very twisted individuals with King and Lynch. When you watch a film that a director wrote and produced, you're usually entering their mind, it's almost like a portal into their world. Well Welcome to Eraserhead!! The genius with Lynch is, he's so brilliant that once in awhile he accidentally makes a completely abstract, surrealistic mess into something amazing, with those movies being, in my opinion, Wild at Heart, and Mulholland Drive. WaH and MD barely come together as being some sort of story and that they come together with a beginning and an end(Not a conventional beginning and end though, this is Lynch we're talking about here)in a Lynch film is amazing within itself. WaH and MD are brilliant movies! Blue Velvet, a little overrated in my opinion, but still very good. Then Great movies that are of the 'norm' that Lynch Directed and wrote(one of them) is The Elephant Man and The Straight Story. Two movies that kind of get Lynch out of himself for a moment, and prove his true genius as a filmmaker-not just his usual abstract stuff, but his true genius in what he knows in general as a filmmaker. I really wish Lynch would have shown more of his talent as he did with The Elephant Man and The Straight Story because he really is a great director, and if he would have gotten out of himself a little more and was more diverse in his career, I think he would have easily been one of the Top Ten Best Director's of all time. But be that as it may you get his usual stuff, the abstract stuff, which is Eraserhead and his other films which consists of about 75 percent of his career. To understand Eraserhead is like trying to understand Life. Nowadays, a director with this kind of film as Eraserhead, would be called an Abstract Artist where his or her Abstract Film would be shown in the Gallery of a Small Art Museum. Because really, it comes down to this old question, is Porn exploitation or art? Everyone will have an opinion on that one, most probably won't agree with the latter on that one. So the same question applies with Eraserhead. Is Eraserhead a film or just art or both? Art is subjective, film is subjective, Film can be Art, Art can be film, but I believe one can be objective very minimally with the two(Film and Art) and splitting the two like splitting an atom. Technically Eraserhead is a film, but really it's not a film, it's a piece of David Lynch, it's pure abstract art. I honestly liked Eraserhead, and in my opinion, as all of you may be asking the number one question, 'What the (Blank) was this 'film' about?'...Nothing! That's my opinion, Lynch likes to express himself through his films, he likes to push his limits and he doesn't ever care if anything makes sense or not,(the ending is hilarious and Eraserhead is pretty funny here and there, I would almost believe that Lynch would get a kick out of watching people laugh when they watch his zany, abstract films because I could imagine Lynch would get off on the fact that you're laughing because it makes no sense and Lynch is laughing because he watches you react to his work in that manner), so like i said, when one of his abstract films comes together into making any kind of sense at all like Mulholland Drive and Wild at Heart did, it's a real miracle, and probably very accidental on Lynch's part. You cannot deny Lynch's brilliance though, he's truly an amazing artist, and i just wish he would have shown more of his amazing gift as a director. With Eraserhead though, don't put too much thought into trying to figure it out, you won't, it's subjective remember ;) ","genre":null},{"date":"28 March 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Stephen King is to Novels as David Lynch is to Films.

With Eraserhead though, don't put too much thought into trying to figure it out, you won't, it's subjective remember ;) ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"28 March 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Fellowship of the Ring has absolutely everything a movie needs. First of all the cast and their performances were top notch. I was not disappointed at all. At first I was somewhat skeptical about Elijah Wood playing Frodo Baggins, and I was never too impressed with his acting ability to begin with. Now after seeing this film, I can't see any other actor portraying Frodo, other than young Elijah. I was very pleased by his performance, but very disappointed that he did not get an Oscar nomination. As for Viggo Mortenson playing the heroic Aragorn, I knew he would be great the moment I saw him in the trailer for the film months before it was released. He looked and breathed Aragorn, just as I imagined Aragorn would when I read the books years ago. Sean Bean was terrific as the brave, but weak -willed Boromir. And of course Sir Ian McKellan was perfect as Gandalf the Grey. In fact, he is Gandalf. Every time he was shown on screen, he stole the scene. I'm just upset he didn't win the Oscar. The rest of the cast was great as well. I was very happy with their performances.The scenery and cinematography is indeed flawless. After seeing this movie, I immediately wanted to visit New Zealand. It's as if New Zealand is Middle Earth. The art direction and costume design is extraordinarily detailed. Everything from the celestial buildings of the Elves in Rivendell, to the Celtic designs in the Dwarven armor, to the dark and Satanic vision of Sauron's fortress are truly awesome. The make-up and creature effects are the best I've ever seen. The Orcs aren't just stupid, mindless killing machines. They really are terrifying. The Black Riders were my favorite though. They stole the scene every time they were on. As for the visual and computer generated effects, you couldn't do any better. The demonic Balrog was amazing. It was definitely one of the movie's best parts. And of course, Peter Jackson's direction was top-notch. I was so pleased when I found out he was doing the film, and not some huge, big-time Hollywood filmmaker like Lucas, Spielberg or Cameron. Don't get me wrong, they are brilliant filmmakers, but they all tend to throw in something very cutesy for the little kids so the movie would be more commercial. I knew of course Jackson would never do that. The action sequences and battle scenes are very exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more. I felt it ended very well.Overall a perfect score for a perfect film.

It exceeded my personal expectations, and I have never read J. R. R. Tolkien's acclaimed trilogy, nor did I possess any prior knowledge of the stories ahead of time. The experience was open for many surprises, and boy did it bring some.The story, which I will do my best to explain, is set in Middle Earth, sixty years after the Dark Lord Sauron tried to conquer it by using the One Ring, which rules and binds the people together. At the time of the attempt to conquer the land, the ring was left in possession of Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who has now passed it on to his nephew, Frodo (Wood). Wizard Gandalf the Grey (McKellen) informs Frodo of Sauron's powerful forces and sends him and his friend Samwise (Astin) out of town so they can destroy the ring and prevent any abuse of power. Along the way, they pick up numerous friends and acquaintances, and together, they are off to destroy the ring. The wonderful ring of...Middle Earth.It may come as a surprise to some people that this is actually the third attempt to bring J. R. R. Tolkien's book to film. The first attempt was done in 1978 by Ralph Bakshi, while the second was a Television film called The Return of the King in 1980. It almost seemed The Lord of the Rings series was plagued of having inferior, slightly incompetent films and was unable to adapt to the big screen, until Peter Jackson blew everyone, including the Oscars, away with his star-studded, beautifully made adaptation of one of the world's most beloved series.Yes, The Lord of the Rings is a beauty. Mainly in its art direction, which is heavily detailed and breathtaking in appearance. Special effects run rampant in Jackson's film, and they are used as an enhancement tool rather than as a simple distraction. This wasn't long after The Matrix was released, so having the audience treated to a world-wind of special effects still wasn't very common in films. I have been told from many fans of Tolkien's work was that what made the novels work so well was (a) they were long and unexpected, almost seeming as if anything could happen, always leaving the reader in some essence of suspense and involvement and (b) were extremely vibrant, detailed, and descriptive. Atmospheres were always described intricately, suspense and peril were captured with a great sense of urgency and delight, and the characters were sweet, charming, and very, very developed.If I had to knock the epic for being one thing, it's that it seems from all the things I have read and been told about the novel, it's as if the film focuses a bit too much on action and swordplay. Still, there's enough buildup and dialog to keep one interested. The film may have a simple plot, but it evokes it as if it was a complex, never-ending journey through the sands of time.The performances are to die for. Sean Astin, a very underrated talent whom we saw in Encino Man and The Goonies, is all grown up and spunky here as Sam, the wisecracking admirable Hobbit, and Elijah Wood is capable and simply mesmerizing as Frodo. But the grand performance of the epic easily goes to Ian McKellen as the always intriguing and slightly ominous Wizard Gandalf. McKellen plays a wizard how I believe a real one would act. Witty, a tad clumsy, but very insightful and enriching every time he speaks, as well as providing much needed reassurance and optimism. It can be considered an unforgivable crime not to have awarded him the Best Supporting Actor award.And now, for the question of the hour; will I pursue the other two films? As of now, I don't plan on it. The Fellowship of the Ring was a marvelous excursion, but a protracted and extensive one, sometimes providing boredom. Fantasy has never been my cup of tea, as I have always preferred my films with a sense of realism, comedy, suspense, and characters. There are people who take the genre seriously and I can't blame them. We must treasure works of mythical art in the time of depressing and oppressive circumstances, and to the ones who get very involved with a franchise or series, I admire and envy you. It was just never my thing.But who knows? Perhaps one day I will complete the odyssey that is The Lord of the Rings. I told myself going in that this film had to be very, very immersing and reach untold levels of excitement and involvement for me to move on to two other films totaling in over six hours. It was very good, but not good enough for me to invest one fourth of a day in the rest of the material.Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, and Ian Holm.

That question is is it really the greatest film of all time? I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be overrated and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many best film lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about The Doughnut Godfather, where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse, we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"28 March 2012","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is is it really the greatest film of all time? I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be overrated and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many best film lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about The Doughnut Godfather, where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse, we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.Starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S.

And how David Lean got the guts to shoot a 4-hour long epic film in the desert, with no female role, no romance whatsoever, with more meditation than sheer action, to create one of the most glorious cinematic experiences is a miracle like only the magic of film-making can provide every once in a while, like Gone With the Wind or The Godfather.As said Roger Ebert in his most interesting review, Lawrence of Arabia is a masterstroke of genius in the way it went against all the movies' conventions for the sake of pure creation. To make his film, Lean had probably to visualize how photogenic would the immensity of the desert be, how a sunset in a red sky would amaze eyes, how the iconic entrance of Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali would challenge every viewer. And Ebert couldn't have been more accurate because while watching Lawrence of Arabia, I couldn't stop imagining the magical effect of these shots in the darkness of a movie theater, seeing this vague little strain in the middle of a mist turning into a thin silhouette until the figure of the black-clad Sheriff Ali emerges on the screen pure magic&#x85; Lean trusted both his minds and our eyes. See&#x85; it's impossible to dissociate Lawrence of Arabia from the sensational experience each frame conveys. And Lean, who had just directed another acclaimed Best Picture winner, The Bridge on the River Kwai, handles his material with much more confidence if it was ever needed. Think of the overture in the dark. Imagine yourself sitting in a movie theater and hearing the heart-pounding drums of Maurice Jarre before the violins let escape one of the most iconic movie themes.

This is why I want to develop the aspect that can easily get unnoticed in such a grandiose epic the script.In Lawrence of Arabia, the lines flow with the poetry of a Greek tale with some shadowy truths resonating when you put them in historical perspective. T.E. Lawrence was the man who guided the Arab Revolt against the Turkish colonization during World War I. In a way, he embodies this quote from the New Testament No prophet is accepted in his own country, he's not a prophet of course in the literal meaning of the word, but he ignited an extinguished flame, the flame of a pride, distancing himself from the decadence of the British Empire to embrace a romantic cause, romantic because lost. It's not an Englishman leading the Arabs; it's an outcast leading an outcast people. And pay attention, there is this incredible mix of madness and inspiring masochism in the eyes of this man who plays with fire without even minding the pain.O'Toole's eyes are pure and his face like graved in a vivid marble, as if he incarnated heroism in its most classical personification, he speaks the truth and acts according to it. In his first encounter with Sheriff Ali, he delivers an unforgettable and powerful rant So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe... so long will they be a little people, a silly people. Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are. These lines still resonate as true and it seems like the Arabs didn't learn from History, earning them one of the worst reputations in all the Western World (not everything is to be blamed on Arabs though, but that's not the point). You can tell in O'Toole's voice that he's sincere and this sincerity is displayed in the next crucial scene when he overtakes his roles and encourages Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) to fight. The scene features another powerful saying Great things have small beginnings. This very line echoes another of the film's many extraordinary moments.After having miraculously survived the crossing of the implacable Nefud desert, Lawrence rides his camel back to find a man lost in the Desert and he succeeds off-screen, leading to one of the greatest moments in the film when one of Lawrence's two servants rides his camel toward him, screaming under the triumphant core of Maurice Jarre. This exploits earns him the respect of the Arabs, a people that value bravery. Lawrence becomes 'Awrence, one of them, finally wearing his iconic white suit. His act showed how even the greatest conquest start with an act of brotherly love and solidarity, and the Arabs couldn't defeat the Turks, before defeating their own selfishness and dividing tribalism. The romanticism of the fight scenes and their exhilarating effect on Lawrence who dances his victory on a Turkish train and enjoys the madness of the war contrasts with the pessimism of the end, where the old politicians replace the young warriors.Men like Lawrence would only incarnate dreams, lost in the lies of political calculations, greed, profit and power, condemning the Arabs to fantasize over and over again on Cordoba and its two miles of lighting in the streets, when London was a village. It didn't last as much as Cordoba but Lawrence of Arabia represents a beautifully romantic parenthesis in Arab history that makes the rest of the Century extremely depressing.

Garner throughout his long and productive career has succeeded in doing what John Wayne could not--make consistently interesting films. The Americanization of Emily, Victor\/Victoria (helmed by Blake Edwards and co-starring Julie Andrews), The Thrill of it All, The Great Escape, Murphy's Romance, are all movies I love and have watched over and over again. Few actors have as consistently good body of work as Garner. Even in weaker films, such as The Children's Hour or or Grand Prix, Garner manages to hold them together. I don't know who came up with the inspired casting of Garner and Willis, but the results are just wonderful here. Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix solving a murder, romancing the ladies, using their brains and their charm to get them in and out of trouble can make for a very enjoyable movie. I was a huge fan of the first two seasons of Moonlighting and Willis must be given a huge amount of credit for the incredible chemistry he had with Cybill Shepherd. Willis has brought that charm to other roles such as Nobody's Fool and especially Bandits. That charm can turn to smirkiness that the critics so often jump on him about. His Tom Mix is one cool dude. Everyone's best friend, the guy you can always count on, Willis is adorable, rash and ready. He makes up his mind that Wyatt Earp is someone He can respect. He admires Earp's lived-in cool and he knows something is always going to happen around this legendary lawman. Willis even manages to pull off one outrageous western costume after another The hats are huge as mountain tops; the shirts are colorful, the chaps are as wide as Montana. It's a tribute to Willis' ability to sell the character of Tom Mix without being swamped by all the fabric he's hauling around. Garner's easy affability makes watching them a real pleasure. Mariel Hemingway and Kathleen Quinlan as their girls are also well cast. The biggest problem is the casting of Malcom McDowell as the dark and sinister film producer Alfie Alperin. On the surface, this is a part that McDowell could have phone in--creepy, controlling, violent, and threatening. But McDowell seems bored right from the start. There's no spark or real inspiration for this bad boy and Jennifer Edwards as his lame sister is equally miscast. All the bad guys are real clichés here. The final showdown between Earp, Mix and their McDowell's now completely unbelievable villain goes on too long and you know every step of the way before the film reveals the heavy handed plot. Henry Mancini's big western score is tuneful and memorable as any written by experts in the genre, and show off his huge versatility. Up the final denouement Garner and Willis make you remember why buddy pictures can be so much fun. I happen to love Blake Edwards films--always have. The best are just really, really good.

","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"28 March 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After the success of Saving Private Ryan in 1998, the war movie was rebranded from the moral fable of the Vietnam era to something that was essentially an exciting experience for its audience. Black Hawk Down was perhaps the most extreme example of that approach, a pure video-game movie that pares down all the camaraderie and humanising to just a handful of brief exchanges, and puts almost all its attention upon the actual business of killing each other.However Black Hawk Down differs from a lot of modern action pictures in its pacing, as orchestrated by director Ridley Scott. Eschewing the usual frenetic overkill, Scott takes a relatively relaxed approach. In the first Lord of the Rings movie, which was released the same week, the average shot length must be something like two seconds. In Black Hawk Down the average shot length is more like three to four seconds, and it makes all the difference. There is time to savour expressions and notice tiny details, making up for the lack of rounded characterisation earlier in the movie. Scott allows the interplay between the men to come out, not in the script, but in glances, grimaces and carefully-placed props. The earliest scenes are eerily calm, providing a moody build-up for the action that is to come.And it's all done with such grace and smoothness. The timing of shots is rhythmic and the images are beautiful. Scott and his cinematographer Slawomir Idziak create some extremely stylised colour schemes which evoke temperature as much as mood. When we move from Garrison's meeting with Atto (browns and yellows) to the hanger with his troops (blues) you can practically feel a whoomph of cool air hitting you. Add to this mix a musical soundtrack that dances from the power of contemporary and classic rock tracks to the haunting sounds of Denez Pringent and Lisa Gerrard. Black Hawk Down has an aesthetic quality rare in war movies.Although this isn't really a movie about deep performances, it's worth making a few points about casting, which seems to follow types rather than talents. For example, Tom Sizemore was then your go-to man for mean-faced sergeant characters. It seems unusual to cast Scotsmen Ewan MacGregor and Ewen Bremner as US soldiers, especially as MacGregor in particular can't really do the accent. However I think the fact that they are outsiders among the rest of the cast feeds into the impression they give of combat virgins.The trouble with Black Hawk Down is that it actually needs to be as visually sumptuous as it is. There isn't really much to go on here, dramatically; apart from a little chitchat in the first half hour, the whole movie is essentially one very long battle scene. When there are talky scenes, all we get is bland, one-dimensional dialogue &#x96; the usual trite A man's gotta do&#x85; stuff.

Black Hawk Down was perhaps the most extreme example of that approach, a pure video-game movie that pares down all the camaraderie and humanising to just a handful of brief exchanges, and puts almost all its attention upon the actual business of killing each other.However Black Hawk Down differs from a lot of modern action pictures in its pacing, as orchestrated by director Ridley Scott. Eschewing the usual frenetic overkill, Scott takes a relatively relaxed approach. In the first Lord of the Rings movie, which was released the same week, the average shot length must be something like two seconds. In Black Hawk Down the average shot length is more like three to four seconds, and it makes all the difference. There is time to savour expressions and notice tiny details, making up for the lack of rounded characterisation earlier in the movie. Scott allows the interplay between the men to come out, not in the script, but in glances, grimaces and carefully-placed props. The earliest scenes are eerily calm, providing a moody build-up for the action that is to come.And it's all done with such grace and smoothness. The timing of shots is rhythmic and the images are beautiful. Scott and his cinematographer Slawomir Idziak create some extremely stylised colour schemes which evoke temperature as much as mood. When we move from Garrison's meeting with Atto (browns and yellows) to the hanger with his troops (blues) you can practically feel a whoomph of cool air hitting you. Add to this mix a musical soundtrack that dances from the power of contemporary and classic rock tracks to the haunting sounds of Denez Pringent and Lisa Gerrard. Black Hawk Down has an aesthetic quality rare in war movies.Although this isn't really a movie about deep performances, it's worth making a few points about casting, which seems to follow types rather than talents. For example, Tom Sizemore was then your go-to man for mean-faced sergeant characters. It seems unusual to cast Scotsmen Ewan MacGregor and Ewen Bremner as US soldiers, especially as MacGregor in particular can't really do the accent. However I think the fact that they are outsiders among the rest of the cast feeds into the impression they give of combat virgins.The trouble with Black Hawk Down is that it actually needs to be as visually sumptuous as it is. There isn't really much to go on here, dramatically; apart from a little chitchat in the first half hour, the whole movie is essentially one very long battle scene. When there are talky scenes, all we get is bland, one-dimensional dialogue &#x96; the usual trite A man's gotta do&#x85; stuff.

A rebellion implies an oppressive system to rebel against, and the construction of a social conscience from that oppression. But in Rebel Without a Cause, there's no oppression other than a sort of peer pressure that makes everyone question his or her status in society. The film features three central characters played by actors who're not here anymore to provide any insights, but from what we know, they all have Family models' issues. Jim is explicit about his, his father lacks the authority that could have guided him to be a real man. In a moment that flirts with ridiculousness, his father wears an apron so laughable that I waited for Jim to take it off. Jim is his own guide because his old man can't. Jim can't count on his parents, Judy can't have the love she wants from her father, as for Plato, he doesn't have parents anymore.The race incident will provide more insights about Jim's existential problems. The unforgettable moment of the film where Buzz (Corey Allen) goes over the cliff is even sadder because it's pointless. Buzz was the most likely guy to befriend Jim, but he had to play his tough-guy part. Why? Why do we have to do this?' asks Jim, Buzz' reply echoes Marlon Brando's iconic answer to the What are you rebelling against? in The Wild One. Jim and his friends belong to a generation that was too young to fight in the War, that didn't have any standard for bravery and courage. One decade before, people fought and proved their value, all these kids in Rebel are the expression of anger toward a society that can't teach them proper values and is almost careless about them. One underrated scene highlights this aspect; I'm talking of the interesting moment in the planetarium when a very dark view on the end of the Earth is exposed to the kids, as if they needed more pessimism.The Earth will not be missed, no one will, and everything is centered on the present. How many times Jim hears that he'll forget about this or that in ten years, as if it mattered, and the resonance is even more tragic considering Dean's fate. This is what the heart-breaking argument with the parents concluding with Jim asking his father to stand up for him is the highlight of the film. Jim knows that he can't lie to himself and need to prove his real value. Chicken is the worst insult one could take for a generation that grew up under the shadow of the Greatest Generation, and as Stark says, it's all about honor, about proving something. It's interesting that the breakdown with his parents could have worked as a climactic scene, the part where he almost strangles his father is incredibly modern in its violence and really made my heart pound. But then oddly, the film takes another direction and focus on Plato's character. This is not to diminish the importance of his character, but Stark is such a bigger-than-life antihero that Plato's problem seemed to belong to another film and kind of added too much dramatic weight on a plot that was already captivating. Not to mention the romance with Natalie Wood that seemed a bit too forced for a film with such intelligence. I really enjoyed Rebel Without a Cause but the last act of the film didn't add much to whatever was shown before stood for. So to really appreciate the relevance and modernity of Rebel Without a Cause, the first act is enough, and the confrontations between Jim Stark and his parents are more powerful than any other with the gang.Take his spontaneous cry in the commissariat You're tearing me apart, shouted on his parents' incredulous faces. James Dean embodies something that no other movies could express, but that's not to say that the film succeeded in that, it's like the spirit of the film has been secretly kept by James Dean, and he played the role with an appealing immaturity that made his character, with his nasal voice, his mannerisms, and unforgettable look, one of the most defining of American Cinema. James Dean died one month before the film's release taking with him the secret beneath the character, and contributing to forge a real legend. As an alibi, I guess that maybe the iconic status of the film undermined any attempt to rationalize the message behind. And that's probably the 'deliberate' flaw of Nicholas Ray's film, it reminded me of Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider, and as a fitting coincidence, Hopper played in both of them. Both movies are great in their own way but we never know the underlined messages behind some scenes or the powerful statements it tries to communicate, yet it's totally impossible to deny their cultural significance, iconic status and impacts on audiences (the film was one of the first to be admitted in the National Film Registry in 1990). Maybe that's the secret of their appeal, they don't try to have a message but to show a slice of youth's life in a certain era, and convey the malaise endured by the most underestimated demographic category.

As soon as we hear these magic lyrics of the Oscar-winning When You Wish Upon a Star, we know we're embarked in a whole new dimension, a unique world that only the perseverance and creativity of Disney animators could have lead us to. It became Disney's most defining music, embodying all the values that Disney films stood for believing in dreams, believing in the ability to 'give life' to drawn characters. The making of the film plays like a poetic allegory, Disney studios ' animators are all little Gepetto's with the same craftsmanship and dedication to their work, and the blue Fairy tale is Walt Disney giving them lives and dreams, something enabling us to identify with them. I Dream, therefore I Am sounds like Disney's cogito.We instantly identify with Pinocchio for his dreams to be a real boy, to be a reason for his gentle father's pride. Yet the movie doesn't deal with this existentialist issue, the core of the action in Pinocchio &#x96;which on this level, remains one of the most thrilling animated adventures- is the temptation. Tasting jam, stealing, not going to school, lying, childhood is the most exposed moments to temptations, everything is new then everything looks pretty, and when the standard for kids is to obey to authoritarian figures who know the best for them, the most precious lesson in Pinocchio is not to obey for the sake of obedience but to follow his conscience, to differentiate between right or wrong. That's what being a real boy is about, being unselfish, trustful and brave, not being obedient. And that, my friends, is quite thought-provoking in the way it recognizes a right for children to exercise their free will, but not without a vital element.On that level, the character of Jiminy Cricket is a great invention because he embodies the necessity of a conscience, while most of the time; we can see Pinocchio making his own decisions without questioning Jiminy. Temptation is the ugly cousin of unconsciousness and remains a predominant figure in the movie, always incarnated by adult figures. This aspect conveys the perfect feeling of childhood, a period of our life when we're small and therefore most likely to follow the bigger ones, any adult is a potential parent, and while our parents are the ones who say 'no' or 'don't'. As kids, we're most eager to follow those who say 'yes' and 'do'. Foulfellow and Gideon, the fox and the mute cat are the intermediaries between Pinocchio and the two main villains of the film so even if the duo was meant to be a comic relief, I always found them scary in the way they tried to ruin Pinocchio's life twice.Naturally, as a film conveying a perfect lesson about life, trust, and temptation, it features two villains that had probably inspired many nightmares. From Stromboli and his scary lips, as the ruthless puppeteer who wants to make fortune with the only puppet without strings or the Coachman, the films echoes children's most inner fears being exploited, tortured and abused by ruthless adults. The image of Stromboli throwing Pinocchio in his cage or the close-up on the Coachman's devilish face, prove that Pinocchio is darker and more daring than it seems. And to those who associate Disney with cute little animals and singing flowers, I invite them to watch carefully the Pleasure Island sequence, and to see the cute Pinocchio smoking a cigar and drinking a beer with his buddy Lampwick. This sequence alone highlights the dangers of exercising free will without questioning good old conscience.And what follows is another demonstration of Disney's cinematic talent, when we see what happen to the poor boys that made 'jackasses' of themselves. The heart-breaking part when a little Alexander cries for his mommy is scary enough, but kids had to face the metamorphosis of Pinocchio's buddy, his face changing, and the voice of his Mommmma turning into hysterical braying and desperate glass breaking to measure the danger of making a fool of yourself. This scene alone is one of the most horrific of cinema's history and works as a magnificent symbolism, mirroring the calmer and most poetic moment when Pinocchio's lie makes his nose grow until it's as plain as a nose in your face. Disney has a unique talent to speak through simple images universal statements about childhood and coming of age, and I wonder how many kids thought twice before lying or acting 'jackasses'. The second intervention of the blue Fairy tale informs Pinocchio that his father is in the belly of Monstro, the whale, which leads to the climactic confrontation with the only villain of the film that would be defeated. The part where he swims to Monstro with Jiminy is magnificent and the escape is totally gripping thanks to the patient build-up that made us figure Monstro's reputation and the film's unique use of special effects. The whole film is a masterpiece of innovation and technical accomplishment, with so many zooms and close-up, dominating space and screen like only Disney could have done, the action sequences, the panoramic views on the village the animation of the Fairy tale, were so impressive that I can't count how many times I wondered what the film would have been like in the movie theater.But how many animated films now would show a kid drinking or smoking, turning into a donkey and not even being saved, Pinocchio is a film that dares to portray kids the way they sometimes do for the sake of intelligence, while 70 years later, for the sake of political correctness, kids have to endure sappy and moralizing educative cartoons. If only for a film like Pinocchio, Walt Disney is the greatest entertainer who ever lived, because one of the few that truly understood what being children meant.

Having said that, it's of course far from a bad or disappointing movie itself! I guess I was just simply expecting a different kind of movie. I expected something more dramatic and heartfelt but as it turned out, the movie is more straight-forward and formulaic for a western, all in the best sense of the word.It's indeed a movie about the closure of the wild west era and a bunch of aging outlaws coming to terms with this. They decide to do one more big score together, for the last time, which of course however gets them in a whole lot of trouble. It's however not a movie that also marks the end of a genre. The classic western genre was indeed nearing its end at the time but it continued to exists, pretty much till the early '70's. This is not a movie that looks back on the genre and pays tribute to the classics and all of its usual clichés and typical genre ingredients.No, it's simply being a good old fashioned western, on its own. It comes down to it that this is a typical men film. Tough guys, doing what they think is right and sticking together, no matter what. It are all themes that speak out to men all over the world, which also makes it easy for them to relate with its characters and all of their actions, as well as motivations.This all gets combined with an heavy, raw and violent Peckinpah style, which means you can expect plenty of shootouts and see plenty of people getting gunned down, violently. The movie really isn't holding back, which also results into one of the most memorable, action filled and violent final shootouts, you will ever see in any film.It's a movie that pretty much got done in an old fashioned genre style but still with a bit more kick into it as well. It above all things remains an action movie, that is fast paced and features lots of quick editing techniques in it. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for those who normally aren't really into the old fashioned sort of spaghetti westerns, of the '60's.And it still also really remains a movie about its characters and actors portraying them.

Just wasn't as wild about it and in love with it as I expected to be.8\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Western"},{"date":"28 March 2012","score":"","review":" Perhaps I should first mention that this movie wasn't the classic I expected it to be but I guess it just got a bit over-hyped to me, also by myself. This is a movie I have always wanted to see, for years now. I finally did so yesterday and was being left sort of disappointed that I wasn't as taken and in love with this movie as I expected to be. Having said that, it's of course far from a bad or disappointing movie itself! I guess I was just simply expecting a different kind of movie. I expected something more dramatic and heartfelt but as it turned out, the movie is more straight-forward and formulaic for a western, all in the best sense of the word.It's indeed a movie about the closure of the wild west era and a bunch of aging outlaws coming to terms with this. They decide to do one more big score together, for the last time, which of course however gets them in a whole lot of trouble. It's however not a movie that also marks the end of a genre. The classic western genre was indeed nearing its end at the time but it continued to exists, pretty much till the early '70's. This is not a movie that looks back on the genre and pays tribute to the classics and all of its usual clichés and typical genre ingredients.No, it's simply being a good old fashioned western, on its own. It comes down to it that this is a typical men film. Tough guys, doing what they think is right and sticking together, no matter what. It are all themes that speak out to men all over the world, which also makes it easy for them to relate with its characters and all of their actions, as well as motivations.This all gets combined with an heavy, raw and violent Peckinpah style, which means you can expect plenty of shootouts and see plenty of people getting gunned down, violently. The movie really isn't holding back, which also results into one of the most memorable, action filled and violent final shootouts, you will ever see in any film.It's a movie that pretty much got done in an old fashioned genre style but still with a bit more kick into it as well. It above all things remains an action movie, that is fast paced and features lots of quick editing techniques in it. It also makes this movie perfectly watchable for those who normally aren't really into the old fashioned sort of spaghetti westerns, of the '60's.And it still also really remains a movie about its characters and actors portraying them.

I have always been a fan of musicals and to me this movie is the greatest musical of the 20 century. The music and dance numbers are beyond amazing!! I am so glad that they actually used the actors actual singing voices instead of having the lipsync to other people sing. Nicole Kidman was amazing as Satine the gorgeous star courtesan of The Moulin Rouge. Nicole can sing very well, and she shows that off in this movie. Ewan McGregor did a great job as Christian the writer who falls in love with Satine. Ewan also has an amazing voice as well. Jim Broadbent perfect for the role of Zidler!! He fits this role so well. Richard Roxburgh did a pretty good job playing the obsessed Duke. John Leguizamo was I think the perfect choice for Toulouse-Lautrec, I cannot think of anyone else playing Toulouse in this movie, it just wouldn't be the same. Jacek Koman is HILARIOUS as the Unconcious Argentinian. I love the fact that Kylie Minogue had a cameo appearance in the movie as The Green Fairy. Sorry for me going on and on about the actors I just believe this was one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a movie. Baz Luhrman did an amazing job with this movie and he has such a brilliant mind that I totally admire him. He is a bad-@ss director.I love this whole movie and all of the songs and dance sequences so it's hard for me to pick a favorite but I think my favorite of the whole movie was Hindi Sad Diamonds. I love, love, love that sequence. I love the song and the choreography to the music was AMAZING!! Another one of my favorites is El Tango De Roxanne. Jacek Koman can sing well. I love the raspy sound of his voice.I also LOVE the costumes and makeup in this film. They did a wonderful job in keeping the clothing to the time period and they made the clothes look fantastic at the same time s well.This is an AMAZING movie. This is a great, tragic love story about two people falling in love yet they have to keep their love a secret from others. This is one of the best movies ever in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, WATCH IT!! If you love musicals and love stories, I am 100% guaranteed you'll love this movie like I do. You'll find yourself falling in love with the characters, the songs, the dances, and the story.Freedom, Beauty, Truth, and Love!!!!!!!!
