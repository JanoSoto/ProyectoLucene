[{"date":"1 January 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, maybe I don't hate it as much today as I did when I first saw it.When I learned they were making a modern day version of my favorite movie The Shop Around The Corner, (actually, I love the musical version with Judy Garland much better, titled In The Good Old Summertime), I was so happy.Then I saw it, and with the exception of the scene where Tom Hanks and Dave Chappell first see that Meg Ryan is his email pal, while she is waiting for him in a restaurant, the whole movie is completely different, and not for the better if you ask me.First of all, I would never, ever forgive anyone who shut down my mother's beloved shop, I don't care if he is Tom Hanks.Second, the movie doesn't have what I think is one of the best elements of both the original and the musical version, these were two ordinary people leading ordinary lives. The male character was a struggling salesman who works hard to impress his manager, a hard, but vulnerable man. And the woman was desperate to get a job for the holiday season and when the male refuses to give her a job, she goes right over his head and gets it from his boss, thus setting up a great rivalry between them. And while there was some rivalry between Tom and Meg's characters, there was no passion, or real sexual tension between them.This is a typical, Nora Ephron movie. Taking something that wasn't broke and making it worse.Too bad.

I absolutely love that movie. All the songs and dances are amazing. Kenny Ortega is a great director and I think he was perfect for directing this movie because he has a history in dance and theater.I also think the actors are great. my 2 favorite actors have to be Aaron Lohr who plays Mush Meyers and Max Casella who plays Racetrack Higgins. I like Mush Meyers because he is sweet and he has a nice body but I think he is sensitive about what Jack and David are doing but then he gets into it and he is a strong person in the strike. I like Racetrack Higgins because he is so funny. Max Casella is the best guy to play Racetrack Higgins. Every movie I watch with Max Casella in it I laugh really hard, even if it isn't funny because I think of his part in Newsies. So enough about that I just want to say that I absolutely love Newsies and i think it is always going to be my favorite movie. Yes some people say I'm obsessed with the Newsies but who cares, I know I am. I know every line, word, song, and dance move. It is sad but I don't care. I'm proud of my obsession over the Newsies and I don'y care what people say. I'm really glad Kenny Ortega decided to make this movie a musical because I think it is one of the best movies I have ever seem and I think it's the greatest musical i have ever seem. Believe me I have seen just about all the musicals and I think it is one of the best yet.

It is actually aged quite badly the difference between Kong and the trick shoots are so painfully obvious that it's pretty distracting, as you see this blueish tint in every trick scene. It's not even charming as it's in the original '33 version of the film.I just saw this film recently from the TV, and it was quite obvious that at least that version wasn't remastered and cleaned, as the picture quality resembled bad VHS tape copy. Actually, the film itself wouldn't be that bad, it's actually just average, as some people make it out to be, but it would take some image cleaning and remastering.One thing is pretty clear from the start Kong is a man in an ape suit. That wouldn't actually matter much, if the actor would even try to move like a gigantic ape, but he doesn't. instead he walks like a man in an ape suit and that pretty much succeeds in breaking up the illusion of a great ape.The plot line is almost the same as in the original white man go island, white girl gets caught by an ape, white man catches the ape. This time it's just an oil company looking for oil instead of filmmakers. The company want's Kong in their commercials. Jessica Lange play Dawn, the Kong's new love object and Jeff Bridges is Jack, the good guy trying to save her and in the end the ape. Acting is okay as such, a bit pompous and unintentionally funny in some places. It's just, that when you take out the dinosaurs the film isn't as exiting as the original.
