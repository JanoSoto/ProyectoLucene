Contray to popular belief the subject of UFOs is not all Science Fiction as many would have you believe as the title of the movie itself is based on Dr J.Allen Hynek's classification of UFO encounter, in this instance of those of the third kind in which beings are encountered. Dr Hynek himself appears for a brief instance along with the more present French investigator\/researcher Mr Vallee who in the film does a lot of psychic research with his subjects - well known and real researchers in the UFO field. Hynek himself whose original profession was that of an Astronomer was requested by the US Airforce during its investigation into UFOs to give possible Astonomical explanations to UFO cases and was scientific consultant to the highly controversial USAFs Project Blue Book that ran from 1947 to 1969 that examined the UFO subject. At first Hynek essentially treated UFOs as a lark as he put it with the famous swamp gas explanation for UFO events in Michigan USA during 1966. However over the years his attitude towards UFOs changed amid the growing pile of credible witnesses, evidence that was being recorded and observed by even those in the military and finally its global nature. Dr Hynek's book The UFO Report makes good reading for those in the public who want a fuller story on the UFO field that have seen this film. Spielberg manages however to weave together both the more creative and fictional themes of alien contact such as the climatic plot ending with the Alien Mothership and the personal adventures of Roy Neary to the lay person, all the way to the more intricate complexities of those that are more familiar with Ufology such as psychic and paranormal phenomena. It is the very essence of these varied scenes in the movie that many viewers and commentators of this film sense their fascination,fear,bewilderment and even entertainment that actually form much of the facets of UFO encounters and activity which is more based on fact than fiction. From the Radar Operators and Airliner Aircrew that encounter a UFO, to various individuals from all walks of life culture and profession on a global scale that encounter everything from strange lights to the multiple of Unidentified Flying Objects that swarm in and out before the Mothership arrives much like its actual real world UFO counterparts, like the small Alien beings that all bear an uncanny resemblance to what people over the ages have experienced and reported to this very day,to Nearys encounter at the Railway Crossing and even Alien abduction of the little boy from his mother combined with the strong undertones of psychic and mental telepathy on UFO witnesses that Spielberg uses to form the plot of the story gives this film its powerful and potent message on the subject of UFOs with more than a hint that Governments and their agencies particularly the Scientific community, where UFOs challenged so many cherished principles and foundations in the physical sciences have all not come clean with the subject of UFOs.Hynek clearly makes this point as he becomes a critic in favor of a real on going phenomena soon after he left Blue Book and in his latter work. As in real Ufology the task for us is to unravel the UFOs enigma - its meaning and purpose on the Human Race. However Close Encounters succeeds in making the public aware while at the same time being able to create a Human based drama that proved popular in what is in fact a very difficult and shaded field. The greatest problem so often in new fields is the mental barrier which forced so many including those that should know better to shrug off UFOs and just dismiss the subject altogether. The comprehension of the UFO arena became the grounds for its rejection. Close Encounters of the Third Kind does some justice to rectifying this situation despite it still being classed as Science Fiction. Spielberg even adds a little extra such as scenes of the recovered and lost Aircraft and Ships presumably from the Bermuda Triangle found in the Mongolian deserts such as the Avengers of Flight 19 whose crew we get to meet at the end along with many missing people over times gone by! Perhaps a reminder that the World still holds many mysteries. Spielberg manages to capture the publics imagination and curiosity in a way that no other UFO film has never quite matched and that is what counts. All in all one of Spielberg's best and a constant reminder that while we may not be alone real unknowns still exist in the universe around us. Weather you are curious, fascinated or even somewhat skeptical on such a subject as UFOs you are sure to be entertained as Speliberg has surely already managed with the public at large.

Therefore it's always going to be hard for anything else he's made to equal his debut. However, in How to Get Ahead in Advertising he comes mighty close.The reason why Robinson's second film fails to match Withnail & I is because at times it becomes too preachy. There are some great speeches in the film; some wonderful digs at consumerism, but occasionally it descends into uninteresting ranting. Yeah consumerism can turn us into unthinking automatons, and yeah big business is greedy, but you don't really need to point it out so blatantly. We already know this. The film works much better when illustrates the BS or when it jabs at it. It doesn't need to get on its soapbox.One of my favourite bits in the film is when Bagley (Richard E. Grant) &#150; a cocky advertising executive who suddenly loses his magic touch when he has to sell boil cream &#150; is listening to a bunch of idiots talking about a newspaper article. As a person who makes a living out of lying, he's appalled that they believe what the press tells them. They then begin to argue (there's a great bit when an Irish priest insists that a woman in a vice den had peanut butter smeared across her tits; it was in the paper so it must be true) and the conversation quickly turns to the boil cream that Bagley has become obsessed with. They're incurable, all of them. I know that and so does everybody else. Until they get one. Then the rules suddenly change. And then he has a dig at the priest. They want to believe something works. He knows that, which is why he gets a good look-in with the dying. It's a great scene; it's funny as hell and it also has a good point to make people consume less out of desire and more out of a desperate sort of hope, or even fear; they hope this product or that product will fill the hole in their lives. They hope it will be the answer to all their problems. And thankfully this scene refrains from the preaching that affects the latter stages. Instead it goes right for the jugular.But my favourite scene of all is the one with the psychiatrist &#150; Bagley has quit his job and developed a hideous boil of his own, one that talks to him and one that has a face. He's talking to the quack with a big bandage on his shoulder. He rants for a while about the way advertisers have ruined television, and then all of a sudden, after silence, the boil speaks. The way it's presented in the film, the boil (at first) has a separate voice to Bagley's. He's not portrayed as Gollum with a satanic pimple; he's not talking to himself. But at the same time you're never really sure whether you're seeing things from Bagley's perspective. He's gone totally crazy, so he may very well be the one saying all this crap. Plus the boil only speaks when Bagley's not looking the other person in the face. But what I love about the scene is the filth the boil speaks and Grant's reactions. His hysteria is hilarious (there's another magnificent bit of hysteria in the film &#150; when the boil first 'speaks', Bagley is so shocked that he runs to the kitchen, shaking and spazzing like he's got St Vitus' dance. Grant is amazing at working himself up into a lather). And then the boil asks Bagley to tell the shrink about his grandfather. My grandfather was caught molesting a wallaby in a private zoo in 1919. A wallaby? It may have been a kangaroo. I'm not sure. You mean sexually? I suppose so. He had his hand in its pouch. I haven't heard dialogue that funny in a long time.I also love the scene when Bagley is admitted to hospital to have the boil lanced. By now he's completely raving. He's going on and on about the evils of consumerism. So then the boil says, You commies don't half talk a lot of s***. Magnificent! It's the sort of argument a Daily Mail reader would give. Criticise capitalism and you must be a goddamned Red. However, I can see where the boil is coming from. There are certainly times when Robinson is too militant. Like I said before, he really doesn't need to stand so high on his soapbox. But at the same time the film makes some excellent points. It's just that the film works better when it does it through comedy rather than rhetoric.Another great scene, one that takes a poke at society's hypocrisy, is when Bagley argues with a feminist who thinks men should bleed. And I think you're a vegan who eats meat in secret. You see, she doesn't deny it. She's a vegan who eats meat in secret. I do not eat meat! But you'll eat fish, you'll eat fish until the cows come home. Fish is allowed! Of course, this enrages Bagley.But although hypocritical lefties get a kicking too, the film, early on, raises an interesting point. If you're anti-consumerism, how do you spread your message without advertising? It's a bit of a kick in the teeth, that.However, Robinson is smart enough to know that consumerism is here to stay. The film doesn't end with any hope. All we can look forward to is more advertising, more spending and more products. The world is one magnificent shop, indeed.

I haven't heard dialogue that funny in a long time.I also love the scene when Bagley is admitted to hospital to have the boil lanced. By now he's completely raving. He's going on and on about the evils of consumerism. So then the boil says, You commies don't half talk a lot of s***. Magnificent! It's the sort of argument a Daily Mail reader would give. Criticise capitalism and you must be a goddamned Red. However, I can see where the boil is coming from. There are certainly times when Robinson is too militant. Like I said before, he really doesn't need to stand so high on his soapbox. But at the same time the film makes some excellent points. It's just that the film works better when it does it through comedy rather than rhetoric.Another great scene, one that takes a poke at society's hypocrisy, is when Bagley argues with a feminist who thinks men should bleed. And I think you're a vegan who eats meat in secret. You see, she doesn't deny it. She's a vegan who eats meat in secret. I do not eat meat! But you'll eat fish, you'll eat fish until the cows come home. Fish is allowed! Of course, this enrages Bagley.But although hypocritical lefties get a kicking too, the film, early on, raises an interesting point. If you're anti-consumerism, how do you spread your message without advertising? It's a bit of a kick in the teeth, that.However, Robinson is smart enough to know that consumerism is here to stay. The film doesn't end with any hope. All we can look forward to is more advertising, more spending and more products. The world is one magnificent shop, indeed.

I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. You see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. You see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. Yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the escalating number of women and children dying in Iraq, I'm thinking, Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people?

They cause pollution, they're smelly, they make people crazy, and all they do is take you places. It's the same way that I hate sports, because I have driven a car before and there's only one thing I like about that - speeding. But I understand what a car represents to people, freedom. And when you hear a person criticize female drivers, it's not hard to see that some of what they mean for you to understand is women aren't as deserving of freedom as men drivers. If they didn't mean this, they would criticize men drivers as well. And we live in a society that is obsessed with material possessions, especially cars. So it's not too far-fetched that this is the same society that accepts glorified car-speeding as a sport. I grew up with it as something that interested the family. It never interested me. All these things come together for Disney's wonderful comedy- cars, racing, women, and glory. None of those things, if think about them, really spell out comedy. But this movie is all about surprises.The thing that elevates this movie above it's rather mundane subject is that feel-good nature Disney is signature for. And so there is a likability to everything that happens. It's sort of a safety system. You can tell it will be a movie where the balance will shift back and forth between the good and not-so-good (usually it's evil, but in a comedy the villains have to have comedic value as well, think of Thorndyke as you'd think of Captain Hook, basically), and even though this makes the movie a little predictable, it's okay because you know Disney always puts things right. The key is that they do it in a very inventive and fun way. By for instance, giving the car it's own distinct personality, and a real fiery disposition. So while all the villains have on their side is their wicked devices, the good guys have a supernaturally gifted car with a heart of gold. Thankfully, the film also gives them Tennessee, the hero's sidekick who isn't very skilled as a mechanic, but he does have a talent for welding, and a wisdom that comes from places we have to imagine he's actually been.The characters in the film are a sheer delight. Although as a hero, Jim Douglas is all too common, it's very difficult not to feel sympathy for him. He has to be a little hard-headed for plot's sake but the film doesn't treat him like an imbecile or a jerk, he's just a simple guy who makes a few mistakes in judgment - as most guys do, in life as well as the movies. The movie doesn't assume he's automatically more interesting than his friends just because he's male, which makes it all the more refreshing that his love interest Carole is smart, skilled as a mechanic, beautiful, and at the same time a great assistant in helping Jim build up his confidence as well as help him win the race by tending just as much to the car's upkeep as both her fellow riders. The dialog of the film is impeccable, especially the Tennessee character's. Since the film wisely decides not to have the car talk, we need a character to be assigned to speak on behalf of the car and who better than the slightly-off welder who at times takes 'strong drink'?The hero, Jim's strongest hook as a character is that he was a winner when he was a racer and after a few losses, he needed someone new to take a chance on him. Instead of one, he got two. And in a way, everyone deserves to feel like a winner, but Jim earns his inevitable victory in the end of the movie. Hey- it's Disney, you know how it ends. The entire movie is charming. And after myself seeing dozens of Disney live-action films, I can't say they've all been even half as entertaining as this one.

One could object now that that was the time when this subject and its state of condition was running out, when the last bits of this struggle between old and new were yet flaming up, but no movie is set upon minor problems and themes, if we watch something like a movie, we understand every second of it as if the screen itself was the whole world. The second thing to keep in mind is, as I stated in the beginning, the temporal gap between us youngsters watching this black and white flick today, with our so-called free or legal sexuality, with our ways of signaling our potential sexual partners and finding our friends, our way of building up a system of opinions and beliefs - even atheism is a belief, and as for today, most people believe in sexuality, it has become a whole new religion. Imagine the makers of this movie, if they could have foreseen our today.

Even that, the movie shows us at its end, when Tracy as Drummond stands above the journalist played by Kelly who is in fact a believer in nothing - the flipped-out Brady was honestly Drummond's friend, and also the scene with Brady's wife and Brady shows clearly that those cultural and religious or military over-signs we carry are there and do have an enormous power, but for the inner human self in us, they are completely irrelevant We can be cool folks, but cruel as carriers of certain official statuses - like with the Nazis They were no monsters like the Americans thought, they were normal people that just did their jobs.

You must pay strict attention in this one, otherwise you will be lost, and it's one of the most unpredictable films I have ever seen, plus it's full of twists and turns as well. I can see why it's controversial however it's seriously one of the most amazing films I have ever seen, and quite possibly the best Kubrick film I have seen as well (only competition, The Shining and Clockwork Orange), plus it's brilliantly made and written. Yes it has tons of sex and nudity, but it's a hell of a lot more then just that, as it may take one of two more viewings before it really sinks in, plus all the characters are extremely likable. It's also incredibly creepy as well, and the score is one of the best I have heard, plus the ending was just great.We are able to totally care for Cruise's character here, as we feel his pain, and yes even the jealousy, and the same goes for Kidman as well, even though I didn't like what she told Tom about her sexual fantasies, plus some of the creepiest parts in the movie, came at that weird party, with all the guys in hoods and masks, it really Creeped me out. Also the scene where that guy is following Tom across the street, was really suspenseful and well done, and I personally believe this should be in the top 250 in my opinion, plus This was an incredible way for Kubrick to go out in my opinion, as he may have given us his best film!. This film will not be for everybody, as it's an acquired taste, and it has some great atmosphere in it as well, plus even though I didn't know what the hell was going on at times, I was still extremely engrossed by it all!.It would have been even more wicked it they released it as NC 17 or even X, and the scene with Cruise and Sydney Pollack near the end, is quite confusing, but absolutely shocking! plus the scene near the end where Cruise breaks down in front Of Kidman and confesses is very powerful and moving. This is one of the most unique films around, and filled with lots of wonderful bizarre stuff, plus it may get under your skin (but in a good way) at times too!.

Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely likable, a jealous and somewhat tortured man, and we feel for him, are able to care for him, a lot of people complained he walked around too much with a smirk om his face but that's his style and it fit in with this film well, he also had wonderful chemistry with Nicole Kidman, had a very powerful scene near the end, he also played a real convincing Doctor, a powerful performance indeed, up there with one of his best.

Nicole Kidman is also amazing as always and is incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely sexy, had fantastic chemistry with Cruise, had a very likable character, even though she intentionally made Cruise's character jealous, she was just important to the film as Cruise was she was incredible!

Vinessa Shaw has a small but memorable role as the hooker Domino, she is incredibly gorgeous and played her part very well.

Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely likable, a jealous and somewhat tortured man, and we feel for him, are able to care for him, a lot of people complained he walked around too much with a smirk om his face but that's his style and it fit in with this film well, he also had wonderful chemistry with Nicole Kidman, had a very powerful scene near the end, he also played a real convincing Doctor, a powerful performance indeed, up there with one of his best. (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Nicole Kidman is also amazing as always and is incredible here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely sexy, had fantastic chemistry with Cruise, had a very likable character, even though she intentionally made Cruise's character jealous, she was just important to the film as Cruise was she was incredible! (Kidman Rules!!!!!!). Sydney Pollack is excellent in his role here he added lots of class, and was simply delightful, I loved him!. Vinessa Shaw has a small but memorable role as the hooker Domino, she is incredibly gorgeous and played her part very well. Leelee Sobieski has a very small part as Milich's Daughter and did OK I guess. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen it please do so immediately, although it may not be for everybody. ***** out of 5 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"14 March 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is probably the best loved of all Hitchcock's films and it is also one of his finest. It is a particularly daft comedy-thriller in that the plot hinges on a series of improbable events and it is hugely entertaining, full of classic set pieces. Cary Grant is the suave, debonair hero who finds himself clinging to a man with a knife in his back in the lobby of the United Nations Building. When he goes on the run, determined to find out who framed him, it isn't just the authorities who are after him but the villains as well. When he meets a leggy blonde on a train, (what is it with Hitchcock and trains?), she is not all that she seems. Eva Marie Saint plays her with an easy-going sexiness that makes her character very likable. And Grant has so much charm he gets away with playing Jessie Royce Landis' son when, in reality, she was only eight years his senior.The villains are James Mason and Martin Landau but they aren't given enough to do and as villains they don't feel threatening. What is threatening is the crop-dusting plane that appears out of an empty blue sky to chase Grant around some vast open spaces. And later, when Grant and Saint are chased over the faces on Mount Rushmore, it's our familiarity with the locations that heightens the tension. In the end the McGuffin, as Hitchcock called the device that held the plot in place, hardly matters. His genius is that he makes you care about the inconsequential things.

Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years. This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes offers that can't be refused. It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.That's an important theme family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all.

The commercial misfire of Big Trouble In Little China and the back to basics Prince Of Darkness left him looking for a new project. They Live was the outgrowth of a low budget, around $4 million, and a pre-existing love for B-movies. Carpenter's love of B-movies is well noted, not least by his direct re-workings of The Thing and Village Of The Damned . They Live profits from his obvious passion.L.A. the near future, John Nada (Roddy Piper) is a working class labourer that comes to town to find the work that has eluded him around the country. He discovers, via a pair of treated sun-glasses produced by an underground rebel force, that humans and the planet earth are being exploited by aliens that hold all seats of Political and social power. One of the movies best features is the visual differentiation from the everyday world and the alien reality. Shown in black and white point of view shots of Piper's character the underlying messages in advertising, newspapers and even money are strikingly exposed in black lettering. The most impressive element of this visual style is that many of the black and white POV shots are matte paintings.Another of the real strengths of the movie, surprisingly perhaps, is Piper's turn as Nada. He is never short of convincing whether he is portraying the fear of the situation he finds himself in or spitting one liners as he blows away aliens. He has said that his own experience of homelessness helped him create Nada. His performance is supported in the best possible way by the always watchable Keith David as Frank, Nada's labourer friend who he turns to for help. Meg Foster's performance as Holly Thompson is less impressive but not all the blame can be put on her as her role as Nada's captive, then love interest isn't well written or substantial. Her character moves the plot forward but does little to add to it.The action is acceptable and typical in its 80s style, lots of gun fire and bodies, but that and the uneven tone, from social satire to lines like I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum (a Piper ad-lib), work against what is an interesting and somewhat rare, anti-Reagan '80s action movie. While the film may have been improved by a slightly more serious tone the lighter elements do hold some pleasures. The near ten minute fight scene in which Nada tries to convince Frank to put on the glasses and see what is going on is hilarious, just when you think it is over they get down to more scrapping. It puts you in mind of The Fast Show sketch The Longest Fight and is just as amusing. The last shot of the movies also has to be seen to be believed but I'll let you find that out for yourself.Guilty pleasure or not, it doesn't really matter as many have discovered They Live ranks amongst Carpenter's best movies.An interesting sideline, the commentary track on the DVD release is excellent and includes the director and Roddy Piper whose stories about the filming of the movie and his position in the world of professional wrestling at the time are fascinating. As many fans of John Carpenter know, his commentaries are always good value. This one is no different.

It is beautifully filmed and many images may haunt viewers later on. But the script is rather weak and often boring, people definitely talk too much without saying a great deal. The cast has one big flaw, Brigitte Bardot. This pivotal character is, so I expect, supposed to turn from a loving wife into a woman full of contempt. Instead she is a pouting babe, insecure, immature and in a bad mood throughout, there was no character development I could see. The whole, long dispute in a modern flat between the Bardot character and her husband therefore is somewhat wasted and pointless, although it is really beautifully filmed. Difficult to imagine BB ever being happy and content. But, well, I guess that is the way people expected her to be and her contribution to movie history. Her greatest moment is a little pantomime with which she tries to explain an ignorant Amercian (played by Jack Palance with the charm of a Zombie) what a dactylo is and does. Yeah, right, dactylo, DACTYLO! It would have been interesting to see how Monica Vitti or Jeanne Moreau would have played that part.Friends of architecture will like this movie. The apartment house with the couple's flat in Rome looks fresh and modern even today, the final scenes are filmed in and around the spectacular Casa Malaparte on the island of Capri, a masterwork of Italian architect Adalberto Libera.

He has only lost one case--Max Shady was sent to Sam Quentin Prison and, now that he is about to be released, he wants revenge.Ned's wife Lana is cheating on him with Frank, the mechanic. There is a $3 million insurance policy on Frank's life, and under very unique circumstances (which Lana hopes to make happen) the amount will be tripled.Not that Ned is completely innocent. Lola needs Ned's help, and she's not wearing panties. Unlike Sharon Stone in 'Basic Instinct', she has her back to the camera when she makes this fact quite obvious to Ned.Ned's secretary has flashbacks of her abusive relationship at the strangest times. She is quite pleasant, though, and good at her job, and otherwise seems happy.This is what happens in the movie. How it all happens--that's what makes the movie unique. The opening resembles Film Noir, though it is in color, with a narrator and a saxophone playing. We eventually see the narrator on screen, and the man with him is getting tired of listening. Clarence Clemons, the sax player, also appears in the scene, and numerous others. In a later scene a trumpet is being played instead, by Doc Severinsen--the explanation is that Clarence is taking a break.Many of the gags involve breaking the fourth wall, such as when two people in a park speak in Yiddish so no one will understand. Bill Cobbs plays the man who offers advice about their situation. He can understand because he saw the subtitles.In a courtroom, Bob Uecker delivers play-by-play and Tony Randall impresses as the judge. When the court is in recess, this takes place on a playground. In another scene, putting flowers in water takes on a whole new meaning.Numerous other jokes in the style of movies such as 'Airplane!' show up. And as in that movie, they are delivered in such a way it's not clear they are funny. Some are so obvious, but then they would never be done in an ordinary movie. Others are not so obvious. The writing is quite clever, though not all the jokes worked for me. Perhaps this is because I did not know the movies that were being parodied. I did recognize a couple of scenes from 'Fatal Attraction'. One scene involving a pet on a roller coaster made no sense to me.I enjoy this type of movie, though some have been done better.

The acting is excellent - but nothing less should have been expected from this cast. The screenplay is also very good, as is the direction and editing. The film moves along at a comfortable pace, relying more on the somewhat obscure messages embedded in the intriguing plot than on characters, plot-line, action, or intellect.John Cusack plays a control freak whose obsession manifests itself in his choice of an unsuccessful career - as a puppeteer. Cameron Diaz plays his wife, a passive woman with little self-determination and a very big heart. Catherine Keener plays a shallow jet-setter Cusack, and later Diaz, becomes obsessed with. John Malkovich plays John Malkovich.... sort of.One of the challenging aspects of this film is that none of these characters, with the exception of Malkovich himself, are very likable. They all do drugs, obsess on their own fantasies and have rather warped self-concepts. Of the three principals, I chose to like Diaz' character most simply because she loved animals so much.In any case, the plot is basically a bit of post-modern twilight zone sci-fi, with a somewhat more linear and conventional story line than some of the more challenging material in post-modern cinema (i.e. Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). The success of this film is probably largely due to its inherent rationality - like Memento, it feels weird and moody, but is really based on a pretty simple, if somewhat silly, concept.By entering a tiny tunnel in an office on the 7.5th floor of an office building where Cusack and keener work, you can become John Malkovich for fifteen minutes. Unless you are a puppet-master, in which case you can possess the legendary actor for the remainder of his life. To reveal any more of the plot would require a spoiler, so I will stop here. However, I want to write a little about the general themes the film comments on.*BJM points out a relationship between puppetry and acting. Though clever and cleverly portrayed, this connection is really rather superficial and pedantic.*BJM has a queer concept of morality and control. While the question of what happens to Malkovich throughout the film is hardly asked at all, the film seems to say that overtly attempting to control others is a bad thing, while doing so passively is really quite OK.*BJM definitely has a drug-induced flavor to it. I haven't smoked dope in many years, but this film is the sort of thing I used to write while high. From the amount of pot-smoking references in the film, I also got the feeling that at least the writer considered it a major part of his life.This is a really neat little surrealism-lite film. It's far from a masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing.
