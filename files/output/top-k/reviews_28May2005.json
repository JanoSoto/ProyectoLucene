This is one movie you will never forget.I have heard it said that the true test of a movie, or any art form, is whether it accomplishes what it set out to do. Did it inform you, delight you, anger you, scare you, or make you laugh? Besides presenting a very entertaining and original storyline, this movie wants you to care about the environment. After seeing The Emerald Forest, I immediately called one of the major environmental organizations (I don't want to play favorites, but it's one of these The Nature Conservancy, WWF, Greenpeace, The Sierra Club...) to set up automatic monthly contributions. I never expected a movie to have so great an impact on me, especially such a long lasting one. You would expect that, after time, my enthusiasm would diminish, especially since I have no interest in ever visiting the Amazon! None whatsoever. However, this movie really changed my perspective on the global environment as a whole.The central character is Tomme (Charlie Boorman). While watching his father direct the construction of a huge dam, Tomme is quickly and silently taken away by a native Brazilian Indian tribe called the Invisibles. They don't see their actions as kidnapping. When they see the young boy, they figure he would be better off with them, rather than with the termite people, the name they give to the white men who seem to devour all the trees.Tomme's father spends the next 10 years trying to find him.This is definitely a thought-provoking movie, but one that is not too heavy handed. It's one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen, the type of movie you can watch over and over.Update Since I had not seen this movie for many years, I decided to see it again last night. I was totally blown away. It was even better than I remembered. Although my original 9-star rating is very high praise, I can't fathom how I could have enjoyed the movie more, so I raised my rating from 9 stars to 10 stars. Director John Boorman also directed Beyond Rangoon, and some other films that are amazingly good.Charley Boorman's performance is simply brilliant. I can't imagine anyone better in the role of Tomme in The Emerald Forest. I am definitely going to start watching the other movies he has made.

After all, that's the kind of stuff you expect in a sci-fi monster flick.What I can't stand is watching characters do things that are so stupid that they are simply not believable.

It's like the mission to Mars, or whatever life or death deep-space expedition, supposedly entrusted to a crew of highly trained astronauts, half of whom invariably have personality disorders or behavioral problems that would disqualify them from getting a job at the Post Office. In a film which requires a willing suspension of disbelief, being continually reminded that you're watching a movie by having poorly directed actors thrash about chewing up the scenery makes it impossible to enjoy. Illogical and aggressive behavior doesn't make up for the lack of a plot. Having characters act in a totally irrational or moronic manner for the sake of dramatic tension , like fighting and arguing when facing imminent death and destruction is the mark of a mediocre director. It's a bad-movie cliché to have actors bitching and bickering while bullets are flying.This waste of time was released the same year as James Cameron's The Abyss, one of the best deep-sea sci-fi films ever made. While they are both based on premises that were speculative and extreme, The Abyss has some of the best dramatic scenes of any movie in the genre, demonstrating that it's possible to have both believable acting and an excellent hard-core sci-fi story.

Some of the striking things how well the plot continues to work after Peter Gallagher's character goes through a change; the real chemistry between Bill Pullman and the delightful Sandra Bullock; the wonderful acting by Peter Gallagher as someone who comes to realize he's really NOT had a good character in his life so far (he's charming while also discovering this dismaying truth).Most of all it's the modesty and naturalness of Sandra Bullock - as a poor, lonely, still missing her late father, terribly sweet yet never coy, completely lovable, utterly sympathetic. We are WITH her in every frame. We want her to gain everything her heart desires - and we really LIKE Bill Pullman too.It seems to me that any romantic comedy rests largely on how likable the characters are - we must completely sympathize with them, feel with them - they can have difficulty deciding between love\/career or love\/location or between two people -- but we can't have difficulty deciding whether we yearn for them to be happy.In some respects, Sandra Bullock does seem a throwback - I could easily imagine this movie taking place during the Depression - though it would be a role reversal (in screwball comedies - which this really isn't - the woman are wealthy and the men are poor).There's an innate decency in the character played by Sandra Bullock - in that respect, it reminds me of the somewhat more genteel characters played by Irene Dunne in comedies like The Awful Truth or My Favorite Wife or Penny Serenade - you are watching a genuinely kind and thoughtful person when you see the characters - and it draws you in. (It's why I find it hard to imagine that Demi Moore was originally slotted to play this character - she has a toughness of heart that I cannot imagine for this character).This movie was written so well that I looked to see what else the screenwriters had done - nothing is listed!

Yes...both films were made within a year apart, but their objectives are completely different. The titles pretty much say it. Tombstone is about the events that transpired in Tombstone...Wyatt Earp is about the man Wyatt Earp. Therefore, they do not have the same goal in mind and are telling two very different stories. I enjoyed both films for different reasons and allow them to stand on their own merits. Tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top. Whereas Wyatt Earp had more of a personal, in-depth examination of the life, but not the legend, of Wyatt Earp.Now, lets get to the intention of this film. Wyatt Earp is suppose to be a story about the lawman, with the convictions and tribulations that shape him as a young boy up to old age. Unlike, Tombstone, which focuses on an array of characters with the plot leading up to a single event, quite historically incorrect, I might add. Yes...Wyatt Earp is cold, unforgiving, bitter, reserved, etc. However, he was not always that way, as his early life traveling with his family to California and marriage to Urella Sutherland, a woman he deeply loved, demonstrates. The turning point in the story is when Wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child. Wyatt lashes out and loses all reason to live. He becomes extremely self-destructive and sets about roaming the West with no real purpose at all except to die. His father slaps some sense into him and tells him to move on with his life. Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes. So...okay...Wyatt becomes reserved, quiet, and cruel, but it is not as if we do not know why. He was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target. He was plagued by external demons as well as internal demons, such as the bottle and a strong yearning, undying love for his dead wife. He was very human and this movie manifests that. Tombstone is fine for those of you that do not care for Wyatt Earp beyond the infamous fight at the OK Carroll or the lawman legend. However, if you can stand a more accurate, in depth character exploration of Wyatt Earp, without any pretensions, than this is a movie worth seeing. ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2005","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" First of all, I would like to know why so many people are comparing Wyatt Earp to Tombstone. Yes...both films were made within a year apart, but their objectives are completely different. The titles pretty much say it. Tombstone is about the events that transpired in Tombstone...Wyatt Earp is about the man Wyatt Earp. Therefore, they do not have the same goal in mind and are telling two very different stories. I enjoyed both films for different reasons and allow them to stand on their own merits. Tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top. Whereas Wyatt Earp had more of a personal, in-depth examination of the life, but not the legend, of Wyatt Earp.Now, lets get to the intention of this film. Wyatt Earp is suppose to be a story about the lawman, with the convictions and tribulations that shape him as a young boy up to old age. Unlike, Tombstone, which focuses on an array of characters with the plot leading up to a single event, quite historically incorrect, I might add. Yes...Wyatt Earp is cold, unforgiving, bitter, reserved, etc. However, he was not always that way, as his early life traveling with his family to California and marriage to Urella Sutherland, a woman he deeply loved, demonstrates. The turning point in the story is when Wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child. Wyatt lashes out and loses all reason to live. He becomes extremely self-destructive and sets about roaming the West with no real purpose at all except to die. His father slaps some sense into him and tells him to move on with his life. Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes. So...okay...Wyatt becomes reserved, quiet, and cruel, but it is not as if we do not know why. He was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target. He was plagued by external demons as well as internal demons, such as the bottle and a strong yearning, undying love for his dead wife. He was very human and this movie manifests that. Tombstone is fine for those of you that do not care for Wyatt Earp beyond the infamous fight at the OK Carroll or the lawman legend.

The camera work was excellent and Cage's acting was off the chart. It was very depressing as the life of an alcoholic would be like. At the same time, Cage and Shue ripped the floor up with their performances and Figgis was brilliant with the directing and screenplay. This is a good movie for teenagers to watch because it depicts the raw honesty of what excessive drinking does to you. I recommend this movie to all people my age (18 and around that), it will teach you a valuable lesson. Figgis is trying to put a point across with a movie this depressing and emotionally violent. Cage will also convince you with his superior acting ability, playing a raging alcoholic which is contrary to Cage's actual drinking habits.

So what you ask ? Well it turns out my parents absolutely detest football so as entertainment this must have a lot more going for it than just soccerWhat becomes clear very early on is that it's not really a sports movie it's a prison movie as former England international Danny Meehan ( Vinnie Jones ) is jailed for three years for assault . To be honest the screenplay exaggerates the English\/British penal system somewhat as Danny is assaulted by sadistic screws and rubs shoulders with inmates doing 30 years and meeting Monk who has killed at least 23 people But who said this was a documentary ? It's entertainment for the masses and it does succeed . It's interesting to note that that this was based on an American movie from the mid 1970s and the Brits have done a far better job adapting this than the Americans did with those two movies that starred Michael Caine and by some irony the only real problem this movie suffers from at a producer level is that it's perhaps a little too parochial , I mean would anyone in America understand what the characters are saying ? And since one of the producers is Guy Ritchie he deserves some congratulations to passing the directing helm to Barry Skolnick and letting him direct his way . Weren't audiences getting tired of people emulating Guy Ritchie's directing style by 2001 ? As it stands we have only a recurring cast from LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels to suggest Ritchie had much of a hand in it So congratulations to the producers for making a relatively entertaining and commercial British movie . When I come to think about the idea of re-making a mainly forgotten American movie starring Burt Reynolds seems like a stupid idea but it works . I bet this movie will still be more highly regarded this time than the Hollywood remake THE LONGEST YARD which is released this week ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2005","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember my parents telling me they liked this movie a lot after seeing it on Sky Movies .
