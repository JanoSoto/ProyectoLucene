This could have been a great film, with all manner of devious bastardry and backstabbing, and funny to boot.But something odd happened to this film. It seems to be aimed at a very young and dimwitted demographic. Why else the grotesquely exaggerated sex scenes (interesting, none of the adults portrayed in this film has what could be termed a healthy and satisfying sexual liaison - the teens get off relatively lightly, which bears further comment beyond the scope of this review), the extreme foul language, and the constant voice-overs that interrupt the flow of the film. The voice-overs, revealing the thoughts of all the major characters, are this film's major weakness. Why do we need them to know what the characters are thinking and feeling? These are actors, dammit, it's their job! It would be possible, I swear, to sit through this film with your tongue in the ear of the person sitting next to you, and you wouldn't miss a thing, the voice-overs save you from having to give the movie more than cursory attention. The denouement is also an exercise in the obvious, for anyone who had their eyes open in the first five minutes of the picture.

The man in this case is Grandy Tripp (Michael Douglas), a college professor in western Pennsylvania, who has been unable to duplicate the literary success he enjoyed seven years earlier when his previous novel created a literary sensation.  Now the long-overdue follow-up work he has been struggling to complete all this time has begun to achieve epic proportions with no ending in sight and Tripp's desperate-for-another-hit editor (Robert Downey Jr.) is arriving in town to check up on the new book's status.  Meanwhile, Tripp's personal life is in a mess as well.  His young wife has just left him, the woman he loves &#150; the married chancellor of his university (Frances McDormand &#150; announces she is pregnant and a disturbed young writing student (Tobey Maguire) has decided to latch onto Tripp as a sort of father figure\/literary mentor, a role Tripp feels, incorrectly perhaps, inadequate to fill.One of the strengths of `Wonder Boys' lies in its ability to create a quirky story without having to strain a lot at the edges.  Though the plot often veers off into the absurd, writer Steve Kloves and director Curtis Hanson manage to keep us always focused on the human characters at the film's core.  Particularly interesting is the relationship between Tripp and the young student, James Leer.  Though the aging professor feels he has literally nothing to offer his off beat protégé, all throughout their time together he is actually serving as a source of inspiration for the youngster just by laying bare the reality of his chaotic existence.  He is a man blessedly free of pomposity and pretense.  Tripp uncovers his own inner strength in his love for Sara - and the scenes involving Douglas and McDormand have a kind of quiet magic that is infectious.  The same can be said for the subtle interplay that develops between Douglas and Maguire as teacher and student.  In fact, Douglas turns in one of his most self assured and commanding performances in this role, even though this is one of the least heroic, most humanly flawed characters he has ever been called on to play. Given all these virtues,  `Wonder Boys' may strike one, ultimately, as a trifle overrated.  Although we appreciate the fact that we never know where exactly the story is taking us, it also doesn't provide much in the way of revelation once we finally get there.  The film often seems as if it is lacking in that one quality that separates the great films from the merely good ones - a driving purpose.  In short, likable as it is, the film seems, in the final analysis, to be a bit of a piffle.  The ending, in particular, seems way too soft-edged for the sophisticated nuances of the screenplay and the sterling quality of the performances.  (And it doesn't help that Downey seems to be playing the exact same character here that he did in the contemporaneous release `Black and White').'Wonder Boys' is certainly well worth checking out, but if you are expecting it to live up to its reputation as one of 2000's great films, you may find yourself a bit disappointed.

Because Tom Green took his humour just too far. I mean, let's review what wasn't funny He gave a horse and an elephant a h*ndjob (What was worse was that the elephant came), the camera showed two horses doing it, he bit off a baby's umbilical cord, he swung the baby around by the rest of its umbilical cord, he licked his friend's compound leg fracture, and he wore a bloody deer skin (Well, that was kinda funny). The only funny parts was the abuse his neighbor's kid took, and the episodes of clean humour in the movie (The Backwards Man skit was the best in my view, but the Daddy, would you like some sausage part was rather a disappointment). What also wasn't funny was that I had to drag my mom along to see it, since I am not 18 yet.Tom Green, you forgot that there is a fine line in comedy between humourous stuff that can make us laugh our *ss off, and obscene, incredibly sickening material that happens when you take that humour and expand on it in the wrong direction. Your movie went in the wrong direction. Personally, I almost felt like leaving the movie after the first twenty minutes because it became too extreme. Tom, you should have made your humour applicable to teens of all kinds, but you only made it applicable to the sick-minded.What would've been better about this movie? Here's a rundown on what would've made it better 1) Tom not directing this cr*p, 2) Tom not co-writing this cr*p, 3) Getting rid of all the gross scenes as mentioned in the non-funny things list above, and 4) Getting rid of the plot. Tom's act is heavily worsened if it has a plot to it.So, to summarize, Freddy Got Fingered was a waste of my time and money. Tom's act is better suited for TV. What he did on TV was funny. This movie wasn't funny at all, like I said. This movie should be a sure-fire candidate for a lot of Razzie Awards in the future. No mistake about it. This was the worst movie in history, and its fate is sealed as perhaps the box-office's biggest bomb ever.To those who haven't seen it, don't see it. Ever.

Not only does it contain action scenes to make any other action film cringe with shame, but it also contains solid characters, excellent acting, and a camera style all its own.The story is, at its core, not about killing, or a cop's relentless pursuit of a killer, but about two men on opposite sides of the law, seeing that they have more in common with each other than they'd care to think.This film is a landmark of Hong Kong cinema, a film of rare craftsmanship.  Chow Yun Fat delivers a performance second only to that in A Better Tomorrow, and Woo's direction creates a film with a unique feel, a film in which the plight of the characters commands as much attention as the incredibly staged gunfights.The only quibble one can have with the film is the relative weakness of the character of the crime boss, but since the film isn't really about him at all, this can be overlooked.  He's more of a plot device, a reason to bring together the two main characters, than a character in his own right.The film operates on so many different levels, an example of Woo's talents as a director.

However, it is really about his assistant and the transformation he makes.CAUTION -- SPOILERS FOLLOW --This is a perfect role for Kevin Spacey as the executive who looks at every transaction as a zero sum exercise. Someone has to WIN, and someone has to LOSE, even though his personalized plate says WIN-WIN. That is part of the satire. Buddy always wants to win, and his personal assistant is there for only reason -- to help him win.The story is told in flashback form. Fairly early we see Buddy apparently held hostage by his abused assistant, and a series of flashbacks explain how he came to that state. Ultimately it was a phone call that early in the movie we only hear part of. Buddy had accidentally patched his assistant into a call which included the assistant's girlfriend, who on the phone agreed to go over to Buddy's place for sex. Finally faced with Buddy tied up and bleeding in his chair, and his girlfriend standing nearby, Buddy insisting do it, go ahead, you know what you have to do,, and we hear a gunshot followed by a blank screen.Turns out he killed his girlfriend, Buddy corroborated a concocted story that the girlfriend was torturing him and the assistant shot her to save Buddy. As the movie ends, we see the equivalent of the assistant having sold his soul to the devil, who in this film is Buddy. He has REALLY become Buddy's servant, but has been promoted and is on his way to the top. Sacrificing everything he once held to be good and true, for fame and fortune in the movie business.I must admit that it was pleasant to watch the assistant get revenge for the totally abusive way Buddy treated him, but the overall message, even though it is satire, is a difficult story to warm up to. Still, I suppose there are people in all businesses who sacrifice part or all of their values to get ahead in business.  Come to think of it, I used to work with several of them!

Multiplicity is a romantic comedy, a fantasy, that lightly explores the source of a very common complaint among married people with children. If you have ever wished that you could be in two places at once, then you should enjoy watching this story of a man who actually gets his wish - and then some. We viewers have become a pampered and sophisticated lot, and I was pleasantly surprised that this film nodded its head in acknowledgment of this reality. The cloning technology in the film is no more believable than are wish granting fairy godmothers, but we all enjoy movies about ghosts, werewolves, monsters, and such, with out their having to be validated, so I tip my hat to director Harold Ramis for instead just dealing with the nuts and bolts of facing the clone, or oneself as it were. There is no super-serious or heavy message like that you would expect from something like the X Files. The treatment is light, and we are seated somewhere between a Michael Keaton special and family level comedy. Keaton is no less than superb, and his performance alone is worth the price of admission. The plot is very well contained and runs an appropriately narrow course allowing this master performer to explore not only his craft but also the old adage about  &#133; the best laid plans of mice and men &#133;.  The movie is seeded with straight-men(women) who appear as a matter of course as they do in any working day. They react in a believable way to the excruciating confusion that presents itself at almost every turn. The dialog is intelligent and the humor regularly sarcastic without being the least bit cynical. The lead straight-man in the film is Andie MacDowell, who plays her role as wife and mother with dignity, restraint, and is appropriately and intelligently challenged by what she faces as the plot unwinds. She remains loving and kind, while staying strong enough to allow Keaton to bounce off of her effectively without her being demeaned. There is something for all but the youngest viewers of this film and any love making that occurs is implied and anything approaching bawdy humor is short, quickly given, and quite tame.Keaton plays the lead male as well as the clones making this film more than a just simple romantic comedy; it is also a warm and charming gift of appreciation to the memory of the late Peter Sellers. Mister Keaton, my regards for a job well done, and thank you for continuing so well in the footsteps of your mentor.

To most kids my children's ages, Hogan is better known as a spokesman for Subaru station wagons than as an actor. However, he is a wonderful comic actor, fully deserving of vehicles such as this. The yokel- among-the-sophisticates plot is timeless, ranging from Buster Keaton's Elmer character through the Bowery Boys, Ma and Pa Kettle, Jerry Lewis, Jim Varney, etc. Hogan is working in that classic tradition, and his skills as a physical comedian, his superb comic timing, and his loveable persona will make this film a favorite on cable TV and as a video rental for decades to come. There were no dazzling special effects, nothing shocking, no social or political agenda--just well-performed, funny family comedy. The only flaw, if it can be called that, in the film was that Paul Rodriguez's character was not given enough screen time. I could imagine those two making a great screen pair. Maybe in the next film, Mick Dundee could call on his old friend from the movie business, the character played by Rodriguez, to help him out of some jam. With that large Aussie sidekick who accompanied Dundee in the second half of the film (the name escapes me)playing off both Hogan and Rodriguez, you'd have a great combination! Think about it, Paul Hogan and Lance Hool! I'll pay to bring my family to Crocodile Dundee 4 when it comes out. We had an 8 year old with us viewing the film, and she loved it, so I'd guess that the film should be acceptable to children 6 or over, and there's nothing really offensive in it if you have to take children younger than that.

I tried, and found very few.Worse than the lack of laughs, the Pulp Fiction rip-off in this film made the whole sub-plot totally ludicrous.Morgan Freeman as a kindly, old hitman who falls in love with Zellweger's Betty? Give me a break! What kind of sentimental character calmly watches his foul-mouthed, maniac of a son pistol-whip his victims?Speaking of whom, choosing Chris Rock for this role was worse than anything Freddy Got Fingered could muster. Take away his incessant F words, and he would have said less than Arnold in Terminator I.Showing him scalp a guy was real fresh for a comedy, too. Makes the chipper in Fargo look tame. At that point,  I should have popped the DVD out and demanded my money back from Blockbuster.The main story might have been good if the director and writer together had half a brain and kept in on track.

The brush cut seems very weird to me; almost as if it was a make-up job a skullcap with a brush cut hairdo stuck to it. Of course once the mohawk hairstyle is introduced, which is also an obvious make-up job, the style is maintained till the end. This is not a continuity mistake in the traditional sense but indicates that the movie has been purposefully edited in this fashion in order drastically restructure the narrative. The story of Taxi Driver is episodic in nature and could have withstood this sort of rearrangement of scenes more easily had Travis had one continuous look throughout; or at least until the assassination attempt scene. As it is, the changes in hairstyle only help pinpoint the course of this restructuring more easily for the student of the film. If you read Paul Schrader's published screenplay (Faber and Faber, 1990), and look at the film, much becomes clearer. Director Martin Scorsese went out of his way to remain as faithful as possible to the script. Almost all of the scenes in the script are there; the few minor changes and deletions are of no real importance. The discrepancies between screenplay and film are to be found in the order of presentation of the scenes. Schrader's screenplay indicates precisely where the change in hairstyle occurs in the narrative. In the script, the first mention of the brush cut is in the scene aptly titled A new face in the crowd where Travis attends a Palantine campaign rally and talks to a secret service man. The screenplay makes no mention of a mohawk haircut though; this appears to have been a new idea suggested shortly before production. Thus we assume that Travis has the same look from the beginning of the movie onward up until the campaign rally scene.The problem is that in the movie this brush cut look appears long before the a new face in the crowd scene. The first appearance of the brush cut is in two very short snippets of film lasting less that two seconds each in a montage sequence of Travis driving his cab at night. This is early in the movie, right after Tom, the Albert Brooks character, asks Travis to move his cab because he's blocking the doorway. The shots are so short and intercut between similar shots of Travis with longer hair, inside the dimly lit cab, that the brush cut would remain unseen by most people.The brush cut makes it's next sudden and more obvious appearance when Travis nearly runs over Iris, the Jodie Foster character, in the red light district. The scene is quite long as he follows her down the street as she converses with another teenaged hooker. He watches her at the street corner and drives off infuriated as she picks up a john. This is followed by the God's Lonely Man voice-over scene which is actually almost at the end of the script. So we have had quite a long look at the brush cut by now but Scorsese nevertheless cuts back to the old look as Travis sits at his desk and writes My life has taken another turn again. The days moves along with regularity, one day indistinguishable from the next, a long continuous chain, then suddenly-there is a change. In the movie, it is assumed that the change Travis is referring to is his decision to arm himself as the following scene shows him waiting to be picked up by Andy the gun salesman. In the script, the context is entirely different, as Travis says these lines after Betsy, The Cybill Shepherd character, leaves him after their disastrous first date at the porno theater. The third appearance of the brush cut is in it's rightful place the a new face in the crowd scene. Unfortunately, it has been moved up quite a bit and is thus premature. This is preceded and followed by scenes of Travis assuming gunman stances in his room, gunning down a convenience store robber, and watching American Bandstand, with of course, his regular hairstyle.  Next, Travis is sitting in his parked cab, with his brush cut, not far from where Palantine is giving a speech. This is where he reads in voice-over a card addressed to his parents. This is followed by Travis watching a soap opera on a TV that he precariously rocking with his foot (back to regular hair). Afterwards, he picks up Iris and the brush cut stays pretty constantly on the screen till the assassination attempt and the appearance of the mohawk, with the exception of the short shot of Travis supposedly sitting in his cab outside of Iris' room where she is with Sport.

Kudos to everybody involved.However, I found the ending of the film to be intellectually intriguing but ultimately manipulative and unsatisfying.  We are lead to believe that the beginning of the film (and ending of the story) is the culmination of Lenny's search.  The man that he did kill may not be the man who truly killed his wife, but we believe that Lenny believes the man to be so.  At the end, we find that Lenny has intentionally duped himself.This ending is intellectually interesting for two reasons (1) It says something about memory.  Without some goal to strive for, Lenny's life is meaningless and made all the more meaningless by his condition.  His decision to fool himself shows the lengths that he will go to in order to give his life meaning.  (2) The backwards formation of the movie makes us experience what Lenny does.  In the end, we are manipulated and handicapped by our condition, just as Leonard is frequently manipulated and handicapped.  As a result, there is a rhyme and reason to this manipulation, as opposed to the manipulation of the Usual Suspects, for example.However, while the goal of the movie is to cheat us, and while there is a point in cheating us, I nonetheless don't like be cheated!

In 'The Mexican' however James Gandolfini walks away with the show simply by being the only actor not to showboat. Apparently Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt took big pay cuts to make 'The Mexican' because they liked the script so much. Sadly the script doesn't seem quite so keen on them. Both are cast against type (Not a good idea if, like these two, you don't have much range), and as a result spend two hours saying Look at us, we're playing against type.' Roberts (a performer who does most of her acting with her teeth) is Sam, a self-obsessed, shrewish hysteric. Brad Pitt is Jerry, her boyfriend, an incompetent moron, who runs odd jobs for the mob. This is played for laughs, just as well as he wouldn't last till lunchtime with real gangsters. Faced with playing these two caricatures Pitt and Roberts resort to wild mannerisms and shameless mugging in a futile attempt to hold our attention. Fortunately the tooth-some two spend little time on screen together, as they generate little heat between them.  As one final job he is sent south of the border to retrieve a legendary pistol, 'The Mexican' of the title. Needless to say he screws up. Why he has to undertake this mission at all is never explained, 'The Mexican' is being held by the mob-bosses grandson. Couldn't they just ask him to bring it home? Why send someone as incompetent as Jerry to undertake this important mission is also left unexplained. Sam, failing to appreciate that Jerry isn't just being selfish in choosing to go rather than get his head blown off, high-tails it to Las Vegas.   No sooner has she set off than she is kidnapped by 'Leroy' in order to ensure that Jerry remains compliant. Leroy, played by James Gandolfini (Julia Roberts was instrumental in getting him cast, and in this - if not her own performance - she does the film a great service), is the one recognizably human character. Instead of the frantic arm waving of the purported stars what we get from Gandolfini is a subtle, nuanced performance. By turns funny, touching and brave, Gandolfini unfortunately highlights the absence of these qualities in the rest of the film. It is surely down to Gandolfini's skill that we care about Leroy at all, as the script doesn't give him much to do but trade therapy-speak with Sam. Leroy, as much as Sam and Jerry, is a walking, talking cliché He's gay so he must be sensitive; He contemplates giving up being a hit man as soon as he finds love; he is full of self-hatred; like any gay character in a mainstream film, he does not get a happy ending.It is hard not to believe that Leroy is gay just to try and make the film seem more hip, but this is a misnomer, as his newfound love for Frank - unlike that between Sam and Jerry - is not held to be of any great importance. Yet it is this brief relationship that provides the only moments of true emotion, Gandolfini is heartbreaking in these scenes, as Leroy finds and then loses love. Never resorting to the sort of weep-fest that Oscar voters love so much, Leroy - realizing Frank's death - exacts his revenge and moves on, brokenhearted but stoic. It is this disparity between the two couples that underscores the shallowness of the whole enterprise.  Sam, for all her psychobabble, has no real idea of love beyond her own self-absorption. When Jerry kills Leroy she protests But he was my friend. but has forgotten him by the next scene. We are expected to side with Jerry for killing Leroy, for it turns out that Jerry had already met the real Leroy and this wasn't him. This Leroy is really Winston (in an earlier scene when Sam sees the name tattooed on his arm 'Leroy' dismisses Winston as being someone he hates), and his intention was to steal 'The Mexican' for a rival gang. This sole fact is supposed to undercut the validity of 'Leroy\/Winston' as a likable character. Why? He pretended to be someone else but his personality was true, and it was this, which made him the emotional core of the film.  That Leroy isn't Leroy is supposed to be a twist, but you can see it coming over the horizon. When Sam finds out Gandolfini's name is Leroy she is surprised, isn't Leroy a black name? Sure enough the real Leroy is black. In a blatant piece of foreshadowing Jerry (before meeting Leroy\/Winston) mentions that he has met Leroy, from Michigan.' which makes Gandolfini's New Joisey accent rather a give-away.  The filmmakers think that we should side with Jerry rather than Leroy\/Winston because he is prettier. His death has repercussions for the rest of the film, if they had to kill him off couldn't they have waited till nearer the end? With the only likable person out of the picture, the remaining half-hour drag's on through the tedium barrier. For a film purporting to be fast-paced the two-hour running time is deadly. A lot of screen time is given over to Jerry's 'comic' adventures, and it is these, which would have benefited from a more drastic edit. The flashbacks to the creation of the gun are also wearing, displaying Hollywood's picture-postcard idea of south of the border folklore. These and the modern day Mexican's depicted are strictly stereotyped either sneaky tooth-flashing villains or mustachioed upholder of honour. The ending is cynically sentimental, the mob boss (a bored looking Gene Hackman) wanting the gun so that he can give it to the Mexican family whose ancestor we see in flashback, dying for the forbidden love of a man considered beneath her. If only Sam and Jerry had emulated these doomed lovers, but then self-absorbed as they are they would probably consider it to be avoiding commitment.

The Dude's world is ruined one day, though, by a bunch of thugs who break into his apartment, beat him up, ruin his favorite rug . . . and realize that they've assaulted the wrong Jeff Lebowski.  The thugs were actually looking to pummel Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston) the millionaire industrialist, who's up to his neck in trouble with organized crime.Since he was beaten up unfairly, and since his prized rug has been ruined, The Dude decides to seek compensation from this `other' Jeff Lebowski.  What follows from there is a wild tale involving kidnapping, modern art, pornography, bowling, and German nihilists.  In other words, it's another wickedly funny movie from Joel and Ethan Coen.Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude, an affable, easy-going guy who constantly struggles to do what he thinks is right throughout the film . . . even if his idea of what's right is sometimes slightly warped.  The best character of the film, though, is The Dude's best friend Walter Sobchak, as played by John Goodman.  How Goodman's portrayal of Walter failed to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, let alone even get nominated for one, is downright criminal.  Walter is a walking, talking, ticking time bomb, all sorts of contradictory rage rolled up into an extremely unstable package.  Walter likes to think of himself as this calm, all-knowing voice of reason, but deep down he knows he's not, and that makes him all the angrier. Watch how Walter belittles his other friend Donnie (Steve Buscemi) for Donnie's politically incorrect use of the term `Chinamen' -- and then watch shortly thereafter how Walter personally describes a group of German nihilists.  It's nothing short of comic brilliance.  (Also worth noting -- Tara Reid has a very small role as `Bunny' Lebowski, but she also has the best line in the entire film.  Don't miss it.)  `The Big Lebowski' is a character-driven film, heavily reliant on the quirks and reactions of its characters to make it work.  Well, not only do the performances in the film make `The Big Lebowski' work, but they make it work magnificently.Visually, `The Big Lebowski' is one of the Coen Brothers' best; there's a loving, sweeping series of glorious shots used for the bowling sequences that are offbeat, original, and highly effective.  (There's also a point-of-view shot from inside a bowling bowl that works to great effect.)  The weakest part of `Lebowski' is the actual story -- parts of the plot thread involving the German nihilists, while funny,   are often pointless and don't add much to the rest of the film.  Also, some plot threads either vanish altogether partway during the film or are never satisfactorily resolved.  That, however, is a by-product of one of the `The Big Lebowski's' overall recurring themes --'The Dude Abides.'  The Dud is easygoing enough to deal with any situation, no matter how weird or random it might be.  Unfortunately, by giving the Dude weird and random situations to deal with, the overall story loses focus.  It's not a major enough problem to drag the film down significantly, but it's enough to keep a good film from becoming great.Rent it, if only to see the tour du force performance of Jon Goodman.

Unfortunately the group of 20 friends seemed to revert enmasse to a group of juvenile school children as they giggled during two of the most powerful moments of the film - Richard when he describes having sex and when Florence masturbates herself as a demonstration of her re- asserting her power.Sarsgaard and Parker deserve extra kudos for taking the risk and accepting these roles and then for rising to the challenge and totally immersing the audience into these three days of their lives.  As another reviewer has said - go see it - more films should be made like this.

For years I have been perplexed at why men are such masochists and allow themselves to be tortured by strippers, Lap dancers and so on.  What is the point of the you can look but you can't touch mentality?This is basically the plot of this film, and for those that haven't seen it I won't reveal too much more.  It was wonderful to view an intelligent take on the dynamics of the liaison between Richard (the dot com millionaire - Peter Sarsgaard) and Florence (the lap dancer - Molly Parker).

Unfortunately the streak of bad movies is unbroken. If the holes in the plot were not so huge, I might have enjoyed this movie, but instead the plot screams of a screenwriter desperately trying to find a neat twist as the movie stumbles to a conclusion.  Instead what is delivered is a series of increasingly silly plot devices that leaves one thinking that this COULD have been a good movie. I hate it when I find myself asking why the character didn't do the obvious (well the movie would end for one thing), or how a character can be so smart one minute, and soooo stupid the next.
