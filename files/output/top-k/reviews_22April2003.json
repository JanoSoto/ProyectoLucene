The film consists of a fairly basic plot line, there is a killer, and he has to be stopped.  There are some things about this plot that make this film much more controversial.  The killer is a man who is killing other men who are gay.  He is meeting these men at what I would describe as themed underground gay parties and bars, and then murdering them after having sex.  This in itself is an interesting factor that drives this film along.  Suspense is created obviously here, because there is a sense of urgency to catch the killer.  Obviously the man who  is killing these other men has problems in dealing with his own self, because he is heard uttering you made me do this before he kills his victims.  There is a young cop played by Al Pacino, named Steve Burns.  He is asked by his Captain Edelson (played by Paul Sorvenio), to go undercover and live the life of the gay man for a while to see if the killer is going to be able to be caught.  Sounds simple enough right?  Not quite.Cruising touches on several key aspects of American life, and makes some rather interesting stereotypes, perhaps looking to make some social commentary.  The representation of gay men in general is very stereotypical, and most are portrayed as being very promiscuous and dirty. The clubs that are danced in are dimly lit, and there are some strange scenes that suggest other things going on.  For example, Burns looks like he is having a seizure, as well as a great time when he begins to dance after huffing an amyl nitrate.  There are bandanas that are worn by men all the time, which represent what they would like to do, sexually.  One color is for giving receiving oral sex, one color is for anal, and there is even one for getting peed on.  I can only imagine that this fueled racist perceptions, not only in the media, but in the world at large as well.  This is a very negative portrayal of gays, and if quite unfair to have this be one of the first representations of gay life in cinema.The character of Burns also is quite an interesting part of this movie. When I asked myself, who this movie was all about, and what the message of this film is, most of the answers I came up with were based around this character.  He is asked by the Captain if he is gay before the assignment is given to him, and this scene seemed a little awkward, almost like Burns was trying to act straight here.  After he gets the job and begins to get into character, he goes through some interesting changes.  He experiences difficulty making love to his girlfriend, Nancy (played by Karen Allen). He also confesses to the Captain that the job is getting to him, getting into his head too much.  So not only do we not know his real sexual orientation, we are left with more questions about the culture.  This movie is making it look like being gay is a spreadable disease.There are also a lot of strange lines in the dialogue of the film.  When Burns thinks that he has the real killer, they go up stairs and begin to engage in a sex act.  The cops however can not hear what is going on so they go in and raid the place.  Pacino is tied up here, and he keeps saying that they came too quickly.  Then during the interrogation, there is a huge black man wearing a jock strap and nothing else.  I know I am not alone in wondering what that guy was all about.  The captain also tells Burns that he needs him, and that he is his partner.There is an interesting sub plot concerning a writer and his lover.  Burns had been placed next to him and they became friends.  We find that the writer is in a tough relationship.  Towards the end of the film, we are introduced to the writer's boyfriend.  Burns talks to him while the man is wearing nothing but underwear.  This is another aspect of the film that confused me.  Burns ends up fighting the man and then at the end of the film, the writer is dead and the man is no where to be found.  The killer is eventually tracked down by Burns, and he is arrested in a strange scene, where there is a lot of tension.So what is really happening here?  The first scene of the movie is a tugboat finding a severed human arm.  The last scene is the tugboat floating along. Here is my take on what really happened.  While Burns is in the process of catching the killer, he realized that he is in love with the writer.  He then kills the writer and chops up his boyfriend and throws him in the harbor, which is the scene that we see at the beginning of the film. Burns has slowly taken over the role of the gay killer, and he is going to keep on killing.  Also at the end of the film, we see Nancy putting on Steve's gay outfit.  We then see Steve looking at her through a mirror, and get a close up of his eyes.Unfortunately, I feel that this movies central theme is quite negative.  I think that the director of this film had a message that said all gay people are evil, and they will spread like a murderous disease.

(Unless you enjoying laughing at loosers and fart jokes that is) If you're expecting anything like in Friends, Beverly Hills cop, Jackie chan films or even Ace Venture forget it.This film is a complete waste of time and the electricity that goes into watching this film.  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 April 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Never before has a director captivated an audience more than when Alfred Hitchcock did it with the release of his 1960 film, `Psycho'.  This film starring Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins attracted never-ending lines at the box office and sent the viewers home fearing for their own lives. `Psycho', which is referred to by Robin Wood as `perhaps the most terrifying film ever made' did not become a classic because it is an excellent shocker, but because it contains immensely deep themes, images and ideas that came together perfectly.  This is a film that will never be duplicated, not even by the great Gus Van Sant. There are many elements that fused together to make this film the ideal horror film of all time.  One major component that was essential to the effectiveness of `Psycho' was the casting.  Janet Leigh plays the typical 1950's bombshell.  She is calm, reserved, and very lady-like.  However she shares something in common with almost all the other characters in this movie.  Like her coworker with her tranquilizers, her boss with his bottle of whiskey, Cassidy with his tax-evading ways, and Norman with the obvious twist, Merion has a secret.  She is involved in a sexual relationship with a man that is deeply in debt.  This ultimately leads to her stealing the money and winding up in a disastrous situation.  To the audience Leigh represents a good-looking version of an everyday American woman, letting the audience know that this kind of thing can happen to anybody.  Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins is also perfectly cast.  He is a very sensitive, vulnerable, and nervous character.  He also seems to be stuck between boyhood and manhood, which is evident from his messy room and sworn allegiance to his mother.  Together with Leigh, the two are able to create the friction and tension that is so evident throughout the entire movie.  This was something that Van Sant was unable to do by casting Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn in the same roles.  Heche has been a very controversial figure in the public eye over the last few years.  As a result, the audience is unable to pick up the same sense of guilt that was so beautifully displayed by Leigh.  Vaughn as well may have performed well in the role, however he was clearly not meant for it.  One cannot simply jump from being a `swinger' to being a reserved, childish momma's boy. One of the many themes of `Psycho' is the idea that this sort of thing can happen to anybody.  This is seen in the opening shot where the camera is weaving through the city, and randomly chooses a hotel room of a random high rise building.  There we see two young lovers doing something that is for the most part human, although not ethical at this point in history. Merion the pockets a little cash to help her boyfriend get out of debt, so they could proceed to have a happy life together.  Once again, although it is not ethical, it is not unheard of.  On her way out of Phoenix Merion experiences some turbulent weather, forcing her to pull off to the side of the road to check into a motel.  We all know what happens from there.  The point is that it could have been any car pulling into that motel.  Perhaps if another car had pulled in just before her, this never would have happened.  It could have been your car. What makes `Psycho' one of the greatest thrillers of all time is audience identification.  This is achieved through a series of point of view shots coming from the eyes of Merion, as well as an eerie score performed by Bernard Herrmann.  This can be easily observed for the moment Merion gets in her car to leave town.  By letting the audience look through the eyes of Merion, we the audience, essentially become her.  The audience is in the mindset that we want her to get out of town unseen, and we hope that her boss doesn't think twice when he sees her on the road out of town.  When the audience is introduced to the police officer, it is once again through the eyes of Merion.  We feel her anxiety, and we want to get out of there just as much as she does.  `Like her, we lose all power of rational control, and discover how easily a 'normal' person can lapse into a condition usually associated with neurosis' (Wood, 124).  In the second half of the movie, the audience floats away from Merion, and to Norman.  Although he has committed a harrowing act, we are still pulling for him to cover up each detail. For example, as he covers up the crime he committed, we see only hands mopping up the bathroom, our hands.  The audience thinks, `Oh my, what have I done?' (Wood, 128). One thing that the remake of `Psycho' was able to do was let movie lovers realize how good of a film the original was.  By assembling a perfect cast, interweaving a series of deep themes and ideas, as well as forcing the audience to identify, Hitchcock was able to take this simple film costing less than a million dollars and turn it into his masterpiece, as well as an all-time classic.

However his film Tenebre is among my favorites along with Profondo Roso and this one Suspiria.  The typical horror fan may never understand this film, just as a typical film fan may not either.  I have heard so many people make fun of the over dramatic sequences in the film.  I have heard a lot about the color of the blood.  I have heard even more about the eyes in the window.  So many people have lost their ability to think in an abstract sense that the world's art has gone to dung over the years.   In Suspiria, Argento paints a picture.  He has been the only person who has been able to put on film the way we all see things when we are afraid.  When we are afraid we do not pay attention to the details simply because we are in a euphoric state of mind.  Fear is the greatest boost of adrenaline anyone can receive.  Fear unto itself is like a drug, it can give us a very abnormal view on our surroundings.  Don't you remember the shadows of your teddy bears when you were children, becoming monsters?  Don't you remember seeing things that could never possibly move do the impossible?  That is the abstract idea of the famous words There is nothing to fear but fear itself.  The point is when we are afraid our minds become playgrounds for extreme paranoia to the point of delusion.  You can scare yourself with your mind more than any person can.     That being said, although nobody will ever truly capture fear, and make you feel the same fear; Dario Argento has found a way for us to explore the beauty and ugliness of fear.  Thus far, he has been the only director in film history to scratch the surface in capturing the essence of true fear.  Suspiria is the film that displays it better than any other film.  If you like Suspiria check out all of Argento's work.  Argento is thus far, the only director to have never disappointed me.  Hopefully anyone new to Argento will feel the same.  Warning however, cynics need to stay away from this film.  While there are many spots in this film that can come off to non-abstract thinkers, (You know who you are, people who like the box office hits, and Academy award winners), poking fun at this film will only make you seem more ignorant than you probably are.  If you don't get it don't poke at it, just go watch Jaws, Psycho, or Scream and everything will be ok.  You will have return to the land of Hubba Bubba dreams!Suspiria  10 crows of 10, slaughtered and beautifully arranged.

So many people have lost their ability to think in an abstract sense that the world's art has gone to dung over the years.   In Suspiria, Argento paints a picture.  He has been the only person who has been able to put on film the way we all see things when we are afraid.  When we are afraid we do not pay attention to the details simply because we are in a euphoric state of mind.  Fear is the greatest boost of adrenaline anyone can receive.  Fear unto itself is like a drug, it can give us a very abnormal view on our surroundings.  Don't you remember the shadows of your teddy bears when you were children, becoming monsters?  Don't you remember seeing things that could never possibly move do the impossible?  That is the abstract idea of the famous words There is nothing to fear but fear itself.  The point is when we are afraid our minds become playgrounds for extreme paranoia to the point of delusion.  You can scare yourself with your mind more than any person can.     That being said, although nobody will ever truly capture fear, and make you feel the same fear; Dario Argento has found a way for us to explore the beauty and ugliness of fear.  Thus far, he has been the only director in film history to scratch the surface in capturing the essence of true fear.  Suspiria is the film that displays it better than any other film.  If you like Suspiria check out all of Argento's work.  Argento is thus far, the only director to have never disappointed me.  Hopefully anyone new to Argento will feel the same.  Warning however, cynics need to stay away from this film.  While there are many spots in this film that can come off to non-abstract thinkers, (You know who you are, people who like the box office hits, and Academy award winners), poking fun at this film will only make you seem more ignorant than you probably are.  If you don't get it don't poke at it, just go watch Jaws, Psycho, or Scream and everything will be ok.

These are the five View Askew movies, the movies directed and written by Kevin Smith. The only other one I had seen before Dogma was Jay and Silent Bob, which was funnier than this one.Linda Fiorentino is Bethany. She works in an abortion clinic and goes to church every Sunday, even though she has lost her faith. Meanwhile, two angels, Bartleby and Loki (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon), who were sentenced out of Heaven, find a loophole that would get them back into Heaven. They see an ad that says that all sins are forgiven when they walk through an archway of a church. So, if they cut off their wings and become mortal, then they will be forgiven and go to Heaven.However, this would lead to the end of the world. Since God is infallible, this would prove God wrong, so the world would end. The Metatron (Alan Rickman), who is the Voice of God, comes to tell Bethany that she is the one who has to stop Bartleby and Loki for reasons she finds out later. Along the way, she meets two prophets Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), the 13th Apostle Rufus (Chris Rock), and another Muse, Serendipity (Salma Hayek), to help her on the quest.Whenever I see a movie and go to write my review, I can always tell if it is going to be a good review or not, and this isn't one. I saw it in pieces, though, so that may be a reason. While Jay and Silent Bob had very raunchy and crude humor, Dogma seemed to stay pretty non-gross-out, with the only exception being the Noman, or, as put by Serendipity, a `sh*t demon'. You can guess what he looks like.All of the actors did their best acting job I've seen them in. Rock didn't seem to go for humor as much in this one, but I didn't find myself laughing too much at this one. He can be a good actor when not making fun of white people or being crude. Jason Lee, who plays another Muse banished to Hell, is great, also. I kept on wishing he were in more of the movie. Mewes was, well, Jay foul-mouthed, sex-obsessed, and maybe a closeted gay. Fiorentino wasn't all that great, but she wasn't in Men in Black also. Affleck isn't a great actor overall, and it shows here. Damon was very good, because he IS a good actor, and so are Rickman and Hayek.Although it isn't plastered with cameos, it does feature a few. George Carlin is a Cardinal, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Holleran (from Clerks) are featured in a few roles, and Alanis Morisette is God (when do you think you'd ever hear that?). Basically, if you're a big fan of other Smith movies, go for it. If you're just a casual fan or not one at all, go with another one.My rating 5\/10Rated R for strong language including sex-related dialogue, violence, crude humor and some drug content.

I do not like Yves Montand or his character - sorry to go with stereotypes, but he is the Dirty Frenchman, spying on her, finding out her address and personal information, twisting things to get her affection, being cloyingly (and not convincingly) sweet to win her...And as far as theplay that was going on...okay, though I loved the number, what does My Heart Belongs to Daddy have to do with the play's supposed point? And if you'll notice, Yves is not very good at anything, even after all those people try to help him sing, but funny, etc. Yet they keep him on the play when Amanda's boyfriend is doing all the rehearsing for the Jean-Marc character. So does he have teh part or not? And if not, why is her still there?! Nothing in this movie fits with what it's supposed to be doing! I've read that Marilyn did not like this role, and neither did I. She may have a heart of gold, and all those other cliches, but the character is just dumb (despite her going to night school - she should get her money back). Like I said, I love Marilyn but...even she saw how absurd this film was!

And if you'll notice, Yves is not very good at anything, even after all those people try to help him sing, but funny, etc. Yet they keep him on the play when Amanda's boyfriend is doing all the rehearsing for the Jean-Marc character. So does he have teh part or not? And if not, why is her still there?! Nothing in this movie fits with what it's supposed to be doing! I've read that Marilyn did not like this role, and neither did I.

The film is your basic teenagers on the way home from the prom get lost and stuck and run into spooky family in the middle of nowhere - mayhem ensues. Actually, this is the movie I thought of (fondly) when I first heard about House of 1000 Corpses. I like this movie much better, and not just because I REALLY want to bring it to a Matthew McConaghy Fan Club movie night.(SPOILERS)It's the details that make this movie. The wall of drivers' licenses that you can see in the background in one room of the creepy family's house, which implies they've been at this for a while. The filthy bathroom where you can't see the human skin hanging on the back of the door until you're already inside with the door closed.I've always found it hard to imagine a female villain character who actually works in a movie like this, unless she's either essentially browbeaten and incapable of individual action, or is utterly, irredeemably psychotic. This movie has a creepy female character who both casually flashes passersby from her office window (explaining only that she just got implants and everyone seems to want to see them) and flirts with cops while she has a girl tied up in her trunk. She also gives a variety of weird conspiracy theoryish explanations for why she goes along with what the spooky family does.Most unusual of all is the weird guy in the limousine who shows up for no particular reason and implies that he put these people here for some reason - presumably to generate exactly the type of urban legends they are generating - and who might be.... Satan? Some underling, anyway. Maybe Ranger Asmodeus (from Equinox) has a cousin. ..The movie left me wondering - in the best possible way. Not the usual why did they make this? or how could they have thought this was good? But instead who is that guy? Does he have other enclaves of evil out there just waiting for his visits? and that woman - was she a victim at one point who talked her way into joining them as a survival mechanism, and then convinced herself that it was OK?

Gans uses stock characters right out of a medieval morality tale which could almost be laughable (evil brother physically maimed disguising his true, inner ugliness; beautiful sister, seemingly strong needing rescue; the whore with a heart of gold; the resentful, corrupt priest wielding power and in control of the communities goings-on, etc.) - but which here draw us into another world.

However Dredd's history is revealed when his long-forgotten genetic twin escapes from captivity and kills high ranking council members.  The DNA evidence points to Dredd and he is sentenced accordingly.  However he escapes with hacker Fergie and returns to the city to try and stop Rico's plan for his own laws.It's been a few years since I saw this in the cinema and I thought I'd give it another go.  However I had only average memories of it &#150; memories that were pretty close to the mark now that I've seen it again.  The film starts reasonably well and has a good little bit of humour in it &#150; the recycling bot that says `recycle waste for food, it's good for the environment and OK for you!' is my favourite!  However any nice touches like this and any debate on the nature of the Judges is quickly lost in a by-the-numbers blockbuster.The action is OK but not great and the film doesn't manage to ever really have a genuine sense of excitement or tension.  Director Cannon is much better at style than substance and here he proves that again.  The cartoon violence will be OK for teenagers but is too basic and undemanding for many I think.  The cityscapes are quite good but a tad OTT.  Bladerunner got it pitch perfect all those years ago and every film since has tried to up the ante unnecessarily.Stallone is a pretty good choice for Dredd because of his strong chin.  I didn't care less if he removed his helmet or not, but his constant speaking in catchphrases did annoy me a bit.  Oh &#150; and I've heard a life time of `law' and `court' puns and kiss-off lines.  Schneider is a misjudged comedy sidekick, he isn't used well and just gets in the way.  The film would have been better without his `relief' and gone darker.  Assante is a strong villain and the council is full of famous faces.  Lane has nothing to do as Judge Hershey.Overall this is a cartoon for teenagers and those just looking for lots of bangs.  However, even for that crowd this may prove a little basic &#150; I wanted it to be more sophisticated than it was and be darker (but not just violent as it has been misinterpreted as here).  Maybe worth a watch with a beer and pizza but the fact that we haven't been treated to a JD2 speaks volumes.
