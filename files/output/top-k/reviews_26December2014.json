As a true work of art, the former's animation techniques were (and always will be) unsurpassed.I view the original Fantasia as a literal masterpiece of classic animation. While, on the other hand, Fantasia 2000 may indeed have had its share of spectacular moments, but, it could never be considered anything even coming close to being in the league of a masterpiece.For the most part Fantasia 2000 did succeed well-enough as being fairly entertaining animation.Out of the 7 new animated segments in this picture there was really only one that impressed me at all. It was the segment presented along with Stravinsky's Firebird Suite as its musical accompaniment.

Oscar worthy. Far superior to the plodding, lengthy Wyatt Earp, released too close to this one for whatever reason. #Hollywoodfail. It's in my Top 5 Westerns list. The performances, including cameos by some of the Western's greatest actors including Charlton Heston were all quintessential. Flawless costumes. Kurt Russell really understood the period and took us back to that time and place with some real craftsmanship. The attention to detail in the character relationships were what made this a particularly extraordinary Western. Gritty, realistic and stylish.
