I was eagerly looking forward to this films release seeing as I am a huge Bill Paxton fan, but why wasn't this film in wide release?  I was living in Toronto at the time and to find this film I had to go downtown to one very small art house theater.  It wasn't at any of the bigger Silver City's.  And that is a disappointment.  Because this film is amazing.  In a way ( I can't believe I'm saying this ) this film reminds me a bit of Star Wars.  Only in the sense that I think there is enough intrigue and well developed characters that you could have made a trilogy and prequels out of this.  Jacob could have a whole movie made about him.  The characters are that rich.The film starts off with two brothers named Hank and Jacob ( Paxton and Thorton ) and a friend named Lou( Brent Briscoe ) chasing their dog into the forest.  As they get deep into the woods, they stumble onto a downed plane. It is here they find the money, the buried treasure to the tune of about 4 million dollars.  At first they are talking about how rich they are and what they are going to do with the money.  But it is then that Hank says that maybe they should wait a while to see if anyone comes looking for the money before they start to spend it.  After all, the plane is snow covered so maybe it has been here for a while so by the end of the winter if no one comes for it, they will keep it.  The other two are adamantly against that logic.   This is the American dream,  one of them says.   You work for the American dream, you don't steal it. Hank replies.  Then of course all hell is about to break loose.Suddenly people that lead their lives without much money are consumed with greed and desperation.  Hank's wife Sarah, in a great performance by Bridget Fonda, says that she is tired of having to eat dessert at home when they go out for dinner.  She wants to provide a nest egg for their soon to be child. Lou owes money to everybody and wants his share of the money now.  Jacob wants to fix up his dads farm.  The insatiable need for money is driving everyone apart.  It is from here that the plot thickens and it is like the layers of an onion.  Every time you peel one layer back, there is another layer to deal with, until there is nothing left.  And then what happens?This film works because it has a terrific story but it also works because of the people involved with it.  I will first mention Raimi, the man responsible for directing this tangled web.  He masterfully strokes every shot perfectly.  He gets the feel for a small, cold winter town and he actually makes you shiver inspite of yourself.  If anyone is a true horror fan they would have known that Raimi had a ( hidden ) genius.  His Evil Dead films ( especially the first one ) really showed that he could direct a tight film and he did a masterful job of scaring you.  And that is not easy. There are not many truly scary films out there and Evil Dead is one of them.  Here he finally gets his due.The second person I want to mention is the cinematographer.  This is Alar Kivilo's first real foray into film.  He has worked mostly in TV and for this to be as well photographed as it is, is a true credit to his ability. Filming in the snow adds many challenges to this aspect of film and he conquers it beautifully.  There is one scene where there are a few men heading into the woods to find the plane and all we see is their footprints. This scene reminded me of a similar one in Lawrence Of Arabia.  It is executed perfectly and it conveys the feeling of what the scene is supposed to represent.As for the actors involved, as I said, I am a huge Paxton fan, just as anyone is if you like his portrayal of Chet and Hudson.  And he is very good in this film.  He has to play the level headed one of everyone involved and he comes across as the torn voice of reason here.  But as much as I thought he was excellent in this flick, I have to say that Billy Bob Thorton blew me away.  You can feel his pain.  You can sense his split loyalty--friendship and brotherhood.  Everything that we are supposed to see in him, we do. He really should have won a best supporting actor this year but he had the deck stacked against him seeing that he already has a statue and James Coburn, the veteran that he is, has none.  Go figure.  Too many politics in the academy, but anyway....This film examines so many human issues and it asks us to make our own decisions along the way.  And the sad reality is maybe we wouldn't make some of the same decisions, but maybe we would have made worse ones as well. It is a tough movie to examine, and that is what ultimately makes it brilliant.**** Just on a side note here, I just find it amazing how the six degrees of separation works here.  Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thorton have known each other for years and they worked together on a similar character study in One False Move. They also briefly had screen time together in Tombstone.  ( If you can't figure out who Thornton is in that film, try thinking of Johnny Tyler.  He was about 100 pounds heavier than what he is now. )  Raimi and Paxton met on the set of Indian Summer. Raimi had a small role as Stick. So it is kind of nice to see loyalty does perhaps still exist in Hollywood. And I am really glad they met and then hooked up for this project.  This is a true definition of a great film.

It has been 22 years since Lucas promised the world a nine-part space saga. With the release of the new movie, he modified that to six-part, saying that he never really intended to make a third, post grown-up-Luke trilogy. But seeing Phantom makes me think he didn't really have a second trilogy either. The movie is paper thin, filled with much to do about nothing.I imagine Lucas has been walking around with this story in his head for years, but that once he sat down to write it he discoved there just wasn't enough there to fill out three more movies. How else to explain the totally expendable character played by Liam Neesom? He does nothing but deliver exposition and bring the characters together that need to be together for the next two movies.  Any of the other major characters in this movie could have done that, particularly the more logical choice of Obi Wan.  And what about Obi Wan? He does nothing except pose as a stiff action hero until the last few minutes of the movies, when we find out his particular role in the coming two stories. He should have just showed up at the end to get his mission impossible assignment. We learn nothing about who he is, what his story is, what brought him here. Certainly that could have made this movie a little more interesting.Everything that needs to happen in this movie in order to prepare us for the next two could be compressed into the first 45 minutes of a better movie.A lot of people have complained about the acting, but I think everyone does just fine, considering they are all playing characters that have not been fleshed out at any level by the author. Lucas is lucky this is the fourth movie because fans of the previous films can fill in the character blanks for him and flesh out the characters in their own imagination -- an imagination fed by the creativity of the first three films. You just can't blame the actors. I mean, the acting in A New Hope was amateur at best (all of them got much better afterwards) and it was just fine because we cared about the characters. Here Lucas has picked some stellar performers and they all come across as though no one has told them what is going on.The strengths of the movie are all contained in its last half hour. Finally you get an exciting(albeit badly filmed and total ripoff of the earlier movies) battle scene with Darth Maul, and you find out who is going to what with who in the next two movies. The end of Phantom is why I think many people are still coming out of this movie excited -- because it does make you hope for greater things still to come.

Not since the first time I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail have I laughed this much at a movie.Being a musical can destroy even decent movies, but South Park pulls it off, partly because (while some are annoying, musically) each and every song in it is absolutely hilarous, and partly because most of the songs have some lame excuse or another to be sung.  It isn't as jarring when a character breaks out into song as it is in...well, any other musical.  But that might just be because the dialogue and visuals are so extreme.Which brings me to the very best part of the experience of seeing this movie.  The GASPS, and SHOCKED SILENCE from about a third of the audience (who clearly had never seen The Spirit of Christmas  (the original South Park short), and didn't have a clue what they had gotten themselves into) when the first instance of the phrase pigf**ker occurred.  Doubtless it will be less when I see it again, but this movie is worth going to just for the audience reaction.And this isn't just a pointless comedy, by the way.  This is some of the best animated satire you're going to see outside an exceedingly good episode of The Simpsons.  The frequent digs at the MPAA, and all the would-be censors in the US make it brain food, not just brain candy.This movie is everything in the TV series, the Spirit of Christmas, and the Terrence and Phillip special taken to new levels.  It is the most amazing experience I've had at the movies in a good long while.  It is easily the best movie I've seen this year, and that includes the Phantom Menace.  The ONLY down side to this movie, apart from the animation which is as lame as you would expect, is the fact that you don't have enough time to recover from one joke before they hit you with another.

Whew!!!  I am a die hard south park fan and this movie literally shocked me. Im sitting there through the first 10 minutes with my mouth wide open in complete shock. But if your are not easily offended and aren't disturbed by cardboard eight year olds who spew obsenities like drunken sailors, then south park is your movie.

When it comes to films of this type, Scorcese is one of the most brilliant directors ever, and it's largely due to the fact that he very obviously allows his actors simply to act, and to become the role that they are trying to portray. His convincing, no-nonsense, honest presentation of life in and around the mob has been imitated but never duplicated, and reflects a clear awareness on his part of the unwritten rules and principles of day-to-day urban interaction that go along with the business of crime.Joe Pesci won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of an unpredictable, out-of-control, and psychopathic mobster, a performance in which he quite literally scared the s**t out of movie audiences around the country. And if the award didn't go to him, it should have gone to Paul Sorvino, for his equally convincing performance as the impassive, experienced capo who was a master of the street life, and had the upper hand on nearly everyone and everything around him. Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, and (for a single but unforgettable scene) Frank Vincent also did outstanding work.De Niro was in great form as well, although his performance becomes a little disappointing if you read Nicholas Pileggi's Wiseguy, where you learn that the character he portrayed was in real life a much scarier guy - even tougher than the Pesci character. I wonder at times if Beau Starr, who played Henry Hill's hot-tempered and violent father, would have been more effective in that role.The film doesn't really tell a story. Instead, like Raging Bull and Casino, it essentially has the effect of a documentary.

The message is loud and clear Choose a life of crime, and eventually you'll wind up either murdered, in prison, or hiding for the rest of your life in the witness protection program, and this holds no matter how tough, how powerful, how well-connected, or how smart you think you are.

The visuals are unlike any movie, the Wachowski brothers have created a roller coaster ride with only a few stops (although those stops are just as beautiful as the rest of the movie - I especially liked the sensitive display of Neo's healing process after he has wakened to the real world). The premise of the movie - that the world might be nothing more than an illusion fed to our heads - is a bit of a science fiction cliché, but it can still be used to make an excellent sci-fi film (and most of the time The Matrix does just that). The acting is good, even Keanu Reeves manages to be credible, by acting as little as possible. Carrie-Anne Moss is also good, though her screen time could have been longer. The one who really steals the show, though, is Laurence Fishburne. His portrayal of Morpheus is excellent, I especially like the little touches that separate his Matrix persona from the Morpheus of the real world. To sum it up technically speaking The Matrix is nearly perfect.So, the set is excellent, the players are good, and the speed is breathtaking - what's there to complain about? The problem, as in so many other big budget science fiction movies, is the ending. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the last third as well, but only on a physical level, not intellectual. The shoot-out in the lobby is one of the greatest action scenes cinema has ever produced, but that's all it is - a great action scene. The deeper elements of the plot (such as the agony agent Smith feels having to live in a world populated by humans) are left unexplored when the rumble begins. Scenes like Keanu Reeves yelling My name is NEO! (when Smith calls him Anderson), or Carrie-Anne Moss reviving Neo with a kiss make my cliché-o-meter bounce up to ten. And why, oh why does a film with such potential have to end in a kung-fu fight? After seeing Bound, the Wachowski brothers' previous film, I had high expectations for The Matrix, but in the end it was clear that the low-budget Bound would still remain the better one of these two. Big money doesn't always equal conventionality, but in this case, sadly, it does.Let's just hope that the success of The Matrix gives the Wachowski brothers the courage to make movies which are satisfying both visually AND intellectually.

And what kind of scenes do these classics contain? Trees that come to life and grab at your clothes in dark forests. Evil queens who poison apples and threaten to bury beautiful girls alive. Witches who turn into dragons and scream, now do you deal with me and all the power of hell! And scariest of all perhaps, human hunters who slaughter mother deer and leave their baby sons to cry, Mother? Mother?The world is a scary place. Disney knew that and children know that. Look at the violent games they play, which are for them a way to feel in control of an unpredictable environment. Any child can identify with Babe's fight to survive in an unknown place, and any child would cheer his ultimate victory. Babe 2 repeats the excellent message of the first film that hard work and a kind and steady heart will triumph in the end.Babe 2 also teaches children the importance of caring for their fellow creatures. This movie is a searing indictment of man's cruelty to animals, of the way we often discard them like worn-out toys. None of the animals' suffering is treated as a joke.

I found this movie to have everything a good action movie should have.The film is filled to the top with great action sequences.  One of my favorites is the scene where Bond, utilising a new remote control for his car courtesy Q, is literally being a back seat driver!  The scene is full of explosions and gadjetry, all accompanied by thunderous music.  Definitely one of the best scenes of the film.The girl for this film is my favorite of all the Bond girls.  Although she may not be the best looking, Wai Lin is a dangerous action heroette. Some may argue that Agent XXX from The Spy Who Loved Me already was this, but really, XXX did nothing during the climax.  All she did was sit there tied up by the villain, waiting to be saved by James Bond.  Wai Lin also doesn't have a suggestive title like XXX.After Evita, Jonathon Pryce was looking for a role that was less serious than the one he just played, and so he turned to becoming, a Bond villain. Elliot Carver is the evil owner of a big news empire which finds it's news, by creating it.  This might not seem bad, if it weren't for the fact that bad news is what sells.  Elliot loves creating plane crashes, floods, and in this case, World War III simply so his empire can be the first to cover the stories.  We can really see how crazy and mad he is when he orders his own wife's death.Tomorrow Never Dies is fast moving, action packed, and humourous, and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good action flick. 9\/10.

A band geek is someone who has made all their friends through band, dated exclusively through band, and generally loves band.  Nerdy, yeah, it is, and I was one of that crowd. But we sure had fun.  That fun is displayed nicely in Opus, through Richard Dreyfuss's career as a high school band teacher.  My friends particularily enjoyed the scenes that depicted the common, everyday tribulations in the band room learning how to hold your instrument, much less play it, staggering backwards in muted agony after that first unison note.Near the end, the music program at Glen Holland's school is put into jeopardy.  This is, unfortunately, a sad fact that happens ALL too often in our schools.  Dreyfuss has a line to the effect of, you'll cut band but I guarantee you'll never cut football.  My former high school struggled with that very same vicious arts vs. athletics debate not too long ago.  It seems sports are always paramount to creativity.  But that is a discussion, not a review. Anyway, the subplot involving Glen Holland and his student, Rowena Morgan--the musical star, is uncomfortable because that too can happen in real life.  Although student and teacher thankfully do NOT have a relationship in Opus, this problem is latent and real in our society.  We do not hear about it all that much, but honestly, one occurance is one too many.  The movie does a good job of letting the viewer realize what is going on, yet doesn't subject us to anything further. Lastly, Richard Dreyfuss is commendable as the aging music teacher, who goes from young and unwilling to teach to silver-haired and fighting to stay in the classroom.  The make up effects here are wholly believable and Dreyfuss's performance is one of the most realistic depictions of a high school music teacher.
