However, the next time I saw it, the fun was all pretty much gone, and I saw the film for what it really was not that great.Shrek is the story of the adventures of an ogre named Shrek, played by Mike Myers. No surprises there. When his swampy home is invaded by fairy tale creatures, Shrek embarks on a journey with his new companion Donkey (Eddie Murphy) to find who is responsible. This journey leads him to the scheming Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Farquaad asks Shrek and Donkey to fetch him the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). This is where the story really begins. Shrek is basically a parody of fairy tales in general. There's a wolf in Grandma's drag, a terrorizing female dragon, three blind mice dressed like modern blind men, among many others. Unfortunately, the fun of seeing these caricatures and the way they interact wears off after a little while, revealing the film for what it really is a clichéd fairy tale in itself. The plot is something we've seen a thousand times in the very fairy tales that the film tries to poke fun at.Still, Shrek is certainly fun for a while. The animation is really neat and unique, bringing out the actors who voice the characters. Also, there are some really funny bits with Fiona and Robin hood's band of merry men, as well as some chuckles about Farquaad's Magic Mirror.Overall, the film is pretty good fun the first time you see it, and does have some really funny moments. I'd recommend that you rent this one and buy the sequel instead.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw Shrek for the first time when it came out back in 2001, and found it mildly funny.

Most of the stories with classical music are absolutely beautiful and completely magical, which is why I like this film. Some other people will find all the stories boring, but they are simply classics and masterpieces in Disney. Here is a list of all the story pieces with their music accompaniesJohaan Sebastastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor Fantasia begins with this portrayal of what may pass through your mind when you hear music. When the music first plays, you see the large orchestra away at their instruments. As it goes onto cartoon, you see many different shapes, colours and movements. Whether this would pass through your mind or not when you listen to music, this story, to begin, is very beautiful and well animated. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker ,Part 1 This is the first part of the Nutracker, each one very short and showing a little story, all the parts are related. This part shows fairies in the night decorating flowers. Nice animation and music, but that is pretty much it. 6 and a half\/10. Part 2 This part shows toadstalls dancing and is probably the most noticeable of the Nutcracker parts. The music here is pleasant and the toadstalls are entertaining, resembling Chinese people. 7\/10 Part 3 Possibly the most mediocre of the Nutcracker parts, here flowers in water dance and there is one white flower that dances about the most. There is nothing really special about this story at all. It is not even that beautiful. Frankly I am not sure why the Disney company bothered. 5\/10. Part 4 Other people will certainly think otherwise, but this is almost definitely my favourite Fantasia story. It shows fish in a river and has very beautiful animation and the situation under the water feels very interesting and surreal. The music is also very good here, but it does not seem to be very popular compared to some other parts of the Nutcracker. Well worth it for me. 10\/10 Part 5 Also noticeable and very jolly, is this part of the Nutcracker. It shows flowers dancing, resembling Russian people. The animation is very interesting and so is the music. It is possibly a bit too short. 7\/10 Part 6 A rather well-known part of Nutcracker in Fantasia, this one features fairies creating autumn, then spring. The animation and music are very beautiful here and the colours are well-portrayed for the seasons shown. 8\/10Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice The most famous of all the Fantasia pieces, this one starrs the ever famous Mickey Mouse wtih his sorcerer's hat - trying to do magic - but not managing very well. I personally do not find this as good as it could be, but Mickey Mouse has a bright personality and this makes the story bearable. 7\/10Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring This has been transformed into a portrayal of the ancient world - the forming of the earth, the first creatures on earth and dinosaurs. Personally this is my third favourite of all the stories. The animation, the music and the modern (of that time) portrayal of ancient earth. 9\/10.Meet the Soundtrack This is a sweet little introduction of the person whom we all know well - the Soundtrack! As we meet him, portrayed as a line, he performs different pieces of instruments and forms into many different shapes and colours. The meeting is very pleasant, nice and relaxing - not really a story. 9\/10Ludwig van Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony This story shows many different creatures (none of them entirely human) in a mythical world, resembling Greek Mythology. The music, colours and plot are very interesting, bright and mythical. This piece has a very Disney childish feeling to it, unlike any of the other stories. Well worth watching. 8\/10Amilcare Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours Also showing a slight Disney Childish style, is this story - featuring dancing ostriches, hippopotami, elephants and crocodiles doing ballet. The plot is not very structured, but it does not spoil this piece. This story is very light and silly. 7\/10Modest Mussorgy's Night on Bald Mountain This is my personal least favourite story in Fantasia as, because of the devil, it is very disturbing. The piece of music chosen helps with this scariness of the story, but it is really the animation that makes this story so terrifying. Funnily enough, this is one of the most well-known stories of Fantasia, among with, of course, The Sorcerer's Apprentice. I personally think that the music is very good. 3\/10Franz Schubert's Ave Maria This story is my second favourite Fantasia story. It comes right after Night on Bald Mountain and shows, in fabulous animated detail, who look like nuns going into church through a forest. The music and forest make this slow but incredible piece worthwhile. The opera is incredibly beautiful and so is the last five minutes of the story, which is very emotional.I recommend this to anyone who respects classical music and enjoys Disney. Enjoy Fantasia! -) ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2007","score":"","review":" This is an animated film with pieces of classical music along with animated stories.

Alice Johnson (the hero of the fourth film) is graduating high school with plans to vacation in Europe with her boyfriend Dan (also in the fourth movie). Her alcoholic father is going to AA meetings and is becoming a better person. She has a new group of friends who care for her a lot as well. Everything seems to be going perfectly for her and the town of Springwood is more peaceful than ever. Of course now that everything is normal, Freddy Krueger resurrects himself to once again wreck havoc on the defenseless town. It is once again up to Alice, who vanquished him in Nightmare on Elm Street 4, to put a stop to the sadistic sandman once and for all.Many people say Nightmare on Elm Street 5 is the worst film in the series but it is far from that in my opinion as it is much better than the disappointing part 6 as well as the crappy second film. Nightmare 5 is somewhat conjoined with the fourth one, as the films bear many similarity's and have all the same characters; much like Halloween 4 and Halloween 5. The main problem with The Dream Child is it's many plot holes. First of all Freddy brings himself back somehow with no actual explanation on how he was able to come back after his defeat in Nightmare 4 (well actually he does that in every movie), but at least they have a resurrection scene here instead of him just being there at the films start. Here he somehow brings his mother Amanda Krueger (a nun raped by 100 maniacs which resulted with Freddy) into Alice's dream to re-birth him into dream land. He then finds what was leftover from his demise in the previous film and crawls over to it (yes, there is a baby Freddy in here) and transforms into his old self. But for whatever reason he can only kill by going through through Alice. This was actually made up in the fourth movie but here since Alice is apparently too powerful for him to face, Freddy goes through her and Dan's unborn baby to get to everyone else. No, it really doesn't make much sense, especially now that Freddy is afraid of his mother as she for some reason is the only one who can kill him.As previously stated, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 wasn't a bad movie. I personally thought it was pretty good even though it wasn't as good as the previous two. One complaint is that Freddy doesn't seem like as much of a character as he was in the third and fourth movies; it seems like he appears very little and doesn't have a whole lot to say, where as the fourth film you see him frequently and he constantly makes odd one-liners. He still makes jokes here though and there were a few funny bits with him. You may have herd that this FX heavy, and it is. The special effects in this film look great. I consider The Dream Child to be the last classic entry of the series. The first five films continue each other very well and have a great 1980's nostalgia feel to them. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare was the sixth and final entry in the central series and it has a classic feel too in a way, but I consider the fifth the last because the sixth abandons all plot of the first five, makes up it's own rules (like when Freddy kills someone their entire existence is erased with their death), and does a poor and retarded portrayal of what Elm Street and Springwood have become. So Nightmare 5 basically wraps up the entire story in a way.The Breakdown PROS Directly continues after the events of the fourth movie, Lisa Wilcox (Alice) and Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) give great performances as do most of the cast. The soundtrack is pretty good though the one's for 3 and 4 were a bit better. The FX effects look really good and most character's are likable. It has that great '80's feel to it I mentioned earlier and Lisa Wilcox is both hot and cute. And to top it off the classic Nightmare on Elm Street theme is present as in all the Freddy films except for the second movie.CONS There are a crap load of plot-holes, Freddy doesn't appear as much as the previous two, and I can't really say what but some bits in the plot didn't really work (which is probably a lot of the reason why people didn't like this one a whole lot).OVERALL The Nightmare on Elm Street series tends to produce films with better quality and more plot than many of the other entries in standard slasher horror series. This film was no exception really as it's better than a lot of the Friday the 13th and Halloween films (though arguably some of those can be more fun and entertaining). Here you get a lot of what you would expect from a Freddy movie (mainly bad jokes and surreal fun), it's not really gory but then again none of Elm Street films really were aside from the original one. I recommend Nightmare on Elm Street 5 to anyone who likes these kind of movies (horror, fantasy, sci-fi, or whatever) or if your looking for something to pass the time on a rainy day or if your either bored or in the mood for a movie.

It has that great '80's feel to it I mentioned earlier and Lisa Wilcox is both hot and cute. And to top it off the classic Nightmare on Elm Street theme is present as in all the Freddy films except for the second movie.CONS There are a crap load of plot-holes, Freddy doesn't appear as much as the previous two, and I can't really say what but some bits in the plot didn't really work (which is probably a lot of the reason why people didn't like this one a whole lot).OVERALL The Nightmare on Elm Street series tends to produce films with better quality and more plot than many of the other entries in standard slasher horror series. This film was no exception really as it's better than a lot of the Friday the 13th and Halloween films (though arguably some of those can be more fun and entertaining). Here you get a lot of what you would expect from a Freddy movie (mainly bad jokes and surreal fun), it's not really gory but then again none of Elm Street films really were aside from the original one. I recommend Nightmare on Elm Street 5 to anyone who likes these kind of movies (horror, fantasy, sci-fi, or whatever) or if your looking for something to pass the time on a rainy day or if your either bored or in the mood for a movie. It's nothing incredibly special like the first one was but it's great entertainment as is the rest of the Elm Street series.Rated R Fantasy Violence and Language (the film is pretty mild), Runtime 1 hour and 30 minutes, Score 6.5\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"5 June 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Growing up, I must have seen An American Tail and feivel Goes West a million times. Recently, I got the DVD in a fit of nostalgia and found that I still knew every line from both movies. But while the first movie is well done and rather dark, this movie is much more lighthearted and has some incredibly amusing moments.The pace is that of a children's movie. I will admit, not a lot of time is spent on atmosphere an the tone of the movie is constantly shifting from serious\/sinister (ie. Feivel gets picked up by a Hawk) to goofy (said hawk gets blasted from the sky in a shower of feathers by teeny mouse natives).But despite its pacing, it is quite entertaining. Dom DeLuise is hysterical and really develops a character in this movie. He does the prissy city cat learning to be a frontier dog so well. The animation is much crisper than the first.The song 'Dreams to Dream' caught me off guard. When I was little, I loved the song because it was cute, but watching it again, this song is really an amazing song. Much more emotional and gripping than 'My Heart Will Go On' (another James Horner single). It has that kind of epic, romance novel feel that 'I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You' had (yet another James Horner single from The Mask of Zorro). The Linda Ronstadt version is OK, but the orchestral movie version with Tanya singing is really fantastic.John Cleese is wonderful as he always is. Cat R. Waul's fate is classic. His attempts to remain aloof and aristocratic, but his catlike tendency to completely overreact and lose his cool when caught off guard shines through perfectly.James Stewart is great and has some really great moments. His dry, sardonic wit shows through in a lot of scenes that I completely missed as a kid. I never taught him that... when Tiger sweeps Miss Kitty off her feet and the pair vanishes off screen.Kids will love this and parents won't be bored watching it with their kids. Entertaining, brief and a lot of fun.

No, there is no excessive drug abuse and there is no moral tale to tell about the dangers of leading a overly hedonistic lifestyle. In fact, Suburbia steers clear of the usual teen\/young adult stereotypes found in films such as Kids and Requiem for a Dream. Unlike those films, this movie will not give you the comfort of being a spectator watching a train wreck of a life. Instead Suburbia will show you something so realistic that the characters on screen could be you and that their problems could in fact be your own problems, which is what makes this film so unbelievably powerful.Released in 1996, this overlooked gem is about a group of friends who waste their days hanging out at the parking lot of a local convenience store. The film centers around the story of Jeff... a twenty-something guy who doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. Jeff's girlfriend, Sooze, is a zealous feminist performance artist wannabe with dreams of someday going to art school in New York. Jeff's two friends, Buff and Tim, are also drifting through life and not doing anything especially important. Buff works at a local pizzeria and does nothing but make up stories about getting laid and Tim spends his days and nights drinking alcohol. And Sooze's friend, Bee-Bee, is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict fresh out of rehab. The only person to leave and escape the suburbs was their old high school friend Pony... who left the suburbs and is now returning as a up and coming rock star. When Pony arrives onto the scene in a limousine with his nicely dressed publicist Erica the cast of characters react to his presence in variety of different ways. Buff and Sooze are both intrigued by Pony's success while Jeff and Tim are jealous of it. Bee-Bee is pretty much forgotten.... and she never let's her feelings be known to the rest of the characters.... She takes everything deep within herself and is perhaps the most self-destructive\/self-loathing one out of them all.In the end, Suburbia doesn't provide you with any clear answers or solutions, but it does raise a number of relevant social questions. As a young adult, this movie had a massive affect on me and it made me question the direction\/course of my own life. I really think that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and the script, acting, and filming was all top notch. However, there are certain things and elements in this film that make it sort of dated. This movie is obviously set during the 90's, but I really think that the messages found within this movie could still be applied to today's youth. This film really paints an ugly picture of the suburbs as a flat, plain, dull, and genuinely depressing landscape that breeds apathy in people.Check this movie out. You will not regret it.

One review said it should get an R rating because of the violence between the kids, but childhood brawls, fights, failures and conquests are all about growing up. If we censor things for the children we don't prepare them for what to come. I think this movie has a lot of important messages in it and I would suggest it for any parent to watch it with their kid. This was one of my favorite films when I was a kid, and although I didn't understand the post-traumatic stress disorder Kevin Costner was going through, I understood his angst and I had a better understanding of fights between children after I saw this movie. I did my share of neighborhood brawls when I was a kid and looking back now I don't even know of a reason. Its just something that we all go through. Parents shouldn't shun this away from their kids, after all it isn't Lord of the Flies. SPOILER* at the end of the movie it has a really important message when Elijah Wood's character risked his life to save one of the bullies, the message is that when in the face of death the minor fights between the kids were all forgotten in that instant- it didn't mean anything. It is also an important movie to show to kids for the Vietnam aspect. How there was a war for the veterans of Vietnam when they came home and soldiers have to deal with the guilt and whether they did the right thing or not- somewhat a good starting point for other movies like Born on the Forth of July and Jacob's Ladder. Other messages in this movie are racial ones, standing up for whats right, standing up for your friends, backing away from fights, and to treat anyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are. Also if you do watch this with your kid, prepare yourself, this like Fried Green Tomatoes is a sad movie. It deals with loss and hardships. Although this all seems to get a little preachy, but its good for a kid to watch because its all the stuff they have to figure out on their own. I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid and I watched it again for the first time in 12 years. I have the same fondness I did since I was a kid and more so now because I can appreciate the wonderful soundtrack and score, with great songs by Janis Joplin, CCR, and Cat Stevens and one of the best places in a movie for Gimme Shelter. The score was beautiful and very inspirational from the very talented Thomas Newman. This was a wonderful movie that I would suggest to anyone- one that will always be close to my heart.

She wants to have one day where she could just be a normal person, while touring Italy, she breaks down one night about her hectic life, her doctor gives her some sleep medication, but she sneaks out before it kicks in to go for a night on the town. But Mr. Bradley, a journalist, finds her asleep on a bench, and offers her a night in his little cheap apartment, but when he finds out who she is, he takes this opportunity to get a real story for a lot of money, not revealing his true identity to her and vise versa with her, but he shows her the day of her life time and they fall for each other. Only one problem, Anya knows that she must soon return to her life of scheduled hectic life.Roman Holiday is a beautifully made film that I'm sure anyone could enjoy. It's one of those films that is just impossible to not like, Audrey and Greg had great chemistry and I just miss these old romantic films, they have such a magical charm to them. I would highly recommend Roman Holiday, it's a film that truly captures a day of making wishes come true with someone that you care about.8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"5 June 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This film was released the year I was born.

I suspect it might have even been in the 70's or 80's. It is such a bizarre film (one memory that sticks in my mind is always the hat the boy wore!!).In England it doesn't get shown very often (shame) and when I finally got a video recorder I taped it.

The scenes with Buster Keaton were really stupendous and it was great to see him in several scenes and not just a one-shot cameo. The Don Rickles insult bit in his club was priceless, the singing wasn't outstanding but wasn't bad either, and the slapstick was a nice throwback to the old Mack Sennett comedies that you scarcely see today. Frankie and Annette made seven beach party flicks together not counting an NBC pilot which aired in 1978. Their last teaming in 1987 was more of a nostalgia trip than a real story and they played different characters than they had in the American International studio's series they made in the 1960's. They appeared in six films in the 60's, with just one (1964's PAJAMA PARTY) wherein they played characters different from their better known five-film series with the Von Zipper gang,Deadhead, etc., for AIP. As such, this series continued a great tradition of movies with continuing settings and stock characters, that hearken back to the good old days of Andy Hardy, Dr. Kildare, the Thin Man and Tarzan. Even more recent times has seen the trend of continuing characters in familiar settings going forward in the James Bond, Rocky, and Batman stories, just to name a few, besides lesser vehicles like the National Lampoon and Police Academy series in the 80's and 90's. In Hollywood, nothing succeeds like success, so the sequel will always be with us and some will go on and on. It will be interesting to see if the new Nancy Drew film will spawn a series of sequels as it did two generations ago. If it's successful the first time around, don't bet against it.

The continuity is off, with some characters like Victor and the Baron disappearing. Others reappear played by different actors. Most seriously, the most important role, and one played by the same character, goes from being a mute walking corpse to a chatty dancing machine, albeit still with homicidal tendencies.Okay, the Monster (Boris Karloff) doesn't dance so much as bob his shoulders in time to violin music, and his chattiness is mostly monosyllabic. Though last seen pinned under a burning rafter, he emerges in Bride none the worse for wear. Soon he is loose in the countryside again, while Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is approached by the mad, amoral Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger). Pretorius demands Dr. Frankenstein take responsibility for his creation and replicate his success by building another beast.The comedy of Bride would be more welcome if it worked within the context of horror. Instead, it feels absurd for the sake of absurdity, like Una O'Connor playing the hysterical servant Minnie or the tiny people Pretorius keeps in jars. Frankenstein works as an exercise in existential bleakness. Bride plays itself off as a nihilistic joke, less a true horror film than a Monty Python bit with lamer humor.What does work in the film is Karloff as the Monster. Despite the miscue of letting him speak this time, Karloff does bring empathy to his role. It's enough to almost allow for Whale's unsure handling of his character. Half the time the creature is a mad killer, and the other half of the time, merely misunderstood. At least with Karloff at the controls, you know the Monster will give the right amount of chills, and he does.Also good is Dwight Frye, returning from Frankenstein this time in the role of another henchman figure, just as compellingly creepy. Thesiger is also compelling that way, a lively figure amid an otherwise sleepy cast. You and I have gone too far to stop, nor can it be stopped so easily, he tells Frankenstein. To the Monster's comment I love dead...hate living, Pretorius deadpans You're wise in your generation. He's a bit problematic in his arch drollery, but at least he adds to the proceedings, even if he distracts from the film's menace.Whale doesn't do nearly so well with the other actors. Even Clive seems miscast playing the role he established so effectively four years before. The story goes off in weird, unresolved tangents like the strange fate of the Neumanns that never are properly explained. None is weirder than the opening, where we see Frankenstein's creator, Mary Shelley, with her lover Percy Shelley and their friend Lord Byron. I should say Lorrrrrd Byrrrrron for the way the guy rolls his R's. (I enjoyed haygraphs bright comment from March 2004 about how the prologue has the characters looking back on events taking place a century hence.)Whale may be celebrated today as an early gay director, but his penchant for jump cuts, awkward close-ups, and florid overacting should have stayed in the closet. Bride may have a certain camp sensibility its enthusiasts enjoy, but as a horror film it is neither scary nor successful.

It bears almost no resemblance except for a broad outline of what life in local and network TV news is all about. Broadcast News is a far more apt portrayal of the real pressures of a newsroom. And yet, Up Close and Personal is more fun to watch, especially on a rainy afternoon with a big bucket of popcorn and some Kleenex nearby. Robert Redford, Stockard Channing and Kate Nelligan give good performances while Joe Mantegna has one of the most delightful character names ever in a movie Bucky Terranova. Michelle Pfeiffer is the weakest link and her prison scenes are ludicrous, but her Miami wardrobe and hair are stunning.

I mean, why in the first place would they pick four total fools to interact with an alien life form that had been discovered half-buried on the sea floor instead of a team of highly trained and highly competent individuals? It's ridiculous, and considering that the team's ability to withstand psychological stress was paramount to the plot, even more so. I got so tired of Hoffman's underacting on this thing, the way he mumbled most of his lines and moved his mouth as if his teeth were wired together, that I'd really had it with him by the time he freaked out and became an hysterical idiot. I'm really surprised that so few people got a similar impression. It was most unfortunate that the movie relied so heavily on Hoffman's character because his performance was seriously flawed. He was completely incompetent as a psychologist and actually provoked Jerry in his lame attempts to humor and control him. As another commenter pointed out, Jerry kept telling him to, stop calling me Jerry, and the brilliant psychologist couldn't understand even that much. By the way, that blow-dried hairstyle of his is the pits. Whatever happened to Benjamin Braddock and Ratso Rizzo? Stone irked me at one point, when she was convinced Coyote was messing with their heads and counseled Hoffman to ignore his orders, but by the end, her distrust of authority figures is explained (Hoffman was once her therapist and had taken advantage of her sexually).

Jackson probably did the best acting job of the four so-called doctors, although he was asleep much of the time (the astrophysicist who was burned alive when the giant squid attacked was another pain in the tail, not as annoying as Hoffman but almost). As for the plot, I thought a thorough exploration of the buried ship would have been quite interesting, especially considering the nifty surround video recorder they encountered in the cockpit, but the filmmakers basically ignored that possibility and concentrated on the sphere instead. The idea that going into the sphere made their thoughts, dreams, and fantasies become reality was an interesting idea and led to some real chaos aboard the undersea habitat, especially near the end of the movie when they became utterly confused and unable to escape the explosion that was about to destroy everything. I have to admit that this movie was good enough to engage me to some degree, despite its annoying aspects, and for that, I give it four stars and concede that it could rate even five.

But none of these successors were able to recreate the same box-office appeal. Films like The Shadow and Dick Tracy fizzled. And sadly, so to did The Rocketeer.Inspired by the 30s Saturday matinée serials, The Rocketeer follows the adventures of daredevil ace pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell). Cliff is down on his luck. He's a pilot without a plane. His relationship with his girlfriend Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) is stuck in a rut. And his only friend in the world is oddball scientist Peevy Peabody (the greatly underrated Alan Arkin).But all that's about to change. When an experimental rocket jet-pack accidentally ends up in Cliff's hands, he christens himself the Rocketeer. But unfortunately, the rocket pack is a valuable commodity. And there are quite a few parties interested in acquiring it. The FBI. The Mafia. The Nazis. And even the reclusive filmmaker Howard Hughes!The Rocketeer is infused with such an authentic all-American, gosh darn gee-whiz enthusiasm its almost impossible not to like the film. Directed by Joe Johnston, one of my favourite filmmakers, The Rocketeer represents a slightly different change of pace for him. Johnston loves to make exciting thrill-rides that move at a breakneck pace. He did after all create the wonderful Honey I Shrunk the Kids and the quite spectacular Jumanji. But every now and again he likes to make films that are a little more restrained. Like the rather charming October Sky.In the case of The Rocketeer, he tries to meld both approaches into one package. And I thought he did quite a fine job. Its just as exciting as any of Johnston's purely action-packed films. But he also invokes the spirit of the 30s and turns out quite a lavish film.Some of the sets are very retro, but some of them, like an opulent restaurant recall the spirit of many a Howard Hawks\/Busby Berkeley picture. But where Johnston really scores is in the action scenes. That's the one aspect of film-making he really does well. The flying scenes are dizzying and even occasionally breathtaking. Just as they should be. And there's hardly any signs of obvious special-effects work. They've aged rather gracefully. Compare it to more recent comic-book adaptations like The Hulk. Where the effects work already looks dated. The Rocketeer runs rings around it.And at times it even manages to be thrilling too. The climax in particular. Aboard a burning Nazi zeppelin that slowly turns into an inferno. Its a real corker of a finale. Its the type of ending A View To a Kill wanted to be but wasn't.The effects and action scenes certainly can't be faulted. The cast is a little more variable. Bill Campbell is an almost too perfect incarnation of the lantern jawed All-American hero. But he's just a little too stolid in the role. He doesn't bring the sincerity that the part so desperately needs. Its no surprise that Campbell has never really done anything noteworthy since.Jennifer Connelly looks downright ravishing as a 1930s up and coming starlet. But like Campbell, she's a bit blank. She was still polishing her acting style since making her debut in 1986's Labyrinth. But it would be a few years yet before she would become an actress worthy of notice.Out of the cast, the ones that probably come off best are Timothy Dalton and Alan Arkin. Dalton is wonderfully slimy and perfectly sneaky as Hollywood star\/Nazi sympathiser Neville Sinclaire. He throws himself into the part with gusto, and interestingly, he plays the part like a larger than life Bond villain! And Alan Arkin turns in another archly droll performance as Peevy.

It was the scene where GZ's foot comes down on the T-Rex display in the museum (tho that later turns out to be a deleted scene). From that moment I was excited to see it- which I did the next summer on the bigscreen. I've loved it ever since. Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria and Jean Reno are just great to have along in this adventure.

I only watched the second half of this movie, and I already felt that I've seen the movie's all. This wasn't comedy, this was crap. Even worse than the first film.Rating 0 out of 5.

For our first film, we studied Baraka.I thought it AMAZING.We were required to present a discussion, talking about whether it is a protest, celebration, or both. Personally, I think it's both.In the beginning, it's celebrating and demonstrating cultures rich in tradition. In the middle and towards the end, it is comparing and showing other cultures and what they have reduced themselves to, such as the child prostituion and the homeless families.The montage of scenes uses emotional and appropriate music to help dramatize and bring the message across clearly. For me, the soundtrack was an integral part of this experience.There is no dialog, only a series of scenes, both moving and terrifying, which can often be more effective that speech.A picture is worth a thousand words is something to remember when viewing 'Baraka'.There is definitely a sense of juxtaposition. For example, the beautiful, serene images of Earth's natural beauty, and then there is the desperate child prostitutes and homeless people. It shows the difference and makes the viewer reflect on what some cultures have reduced themselves to.The movie slides from scene to scene using very slow and smooth movements, and sometimes a quick flash to dramatize. It is not a fast film, so this use of editing is appropriate in showing this.I think that this movie can be approached in a few ways. Being subjective, this movie could be about finding your inner traditions and what beliefs you still have while you have conformed to the materialistic surroundings.I believe that it is a protest. Simply because, for example, the Monks performing the 'monkey dance' towards the beginning. They are so happy and content with their tradition, and don't seem to have a worry in the world, yet when i viewed this film, most of my class laughed at what they were doing. I found this extremely rude, because they would be ashamed for us, and what we believe in. We, the modernists, believe in the internet as a culture and we conform to everything everybody is doing. Yet, we are the ones laughing at them. Although they weren't in the film, the Amish (people who refuse to use technology and live as though they were in the 1800's) are 100% content with themselves. They don't have the worries of modern world, and they are detached yet so very happy. I think we have reduced ourselves so much that we have lost all we used to believe in.I live in Australia, and our indigenous, the Aborigines, were shown in 'Baraka'. This was so foreign to us, for in our town we have next to no indigenous people. This proves to more of an extent how much we have immersed ourselves in becoming more technologically advanced and don't think of the outcome of losing out basic traditions. When my class saw the Aborigine, it was almost like it was foreign to us, even I felt this way, and that made me feel disappointed in myself.This movie is, for me, perpetually amazing.
