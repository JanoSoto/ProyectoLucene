In respect of the deceased I will say again that the stunts are damn good and worth a look.

Just because 16 cameras are used in one scene, doesn't mean each one should be used in the final cut. Cutting to and from multiple angles in one moment in time will not make the stunt any more realistic.

These two girls create a fantasy world and the way he presents this world through special effects is brilliant. He was doing some ground work for Lord of the Rings. However, J R R Tolkien did not let Middle Earth consume his life in the way that Misses Parker and Hulme let Bonrovia consume theirs. This is shown in the way in which they completely disregard teachers' instructions in their lessons at school and paint pictures of and write essays about their fantasy kingdom. One other correspondent says this film demonstrates how homophobia can kill. Well, the murder of poor Mrs Rieper was an extremely wicked act which cannot be justified in any way. The parents had worked out a compromise solution to the problem whereby the girls could stay in contact. Also, how could Pauline kill her own mother? I don't know if this is what happened in reality but when they first brain her with the half brick in the stocking she lets out a scream of agony. You can almost feel the blow. Normal humanity should have made them stop. But they continue hitting her until she's unconscious and then dead. And they'd set her up for it, doing things like dropping the jewel on the ground and making her look at it. Wicked! The girls were also living in a fantasy world thinking they'd get away with it. Yes, homosexuality was not tolerated in those days and was illegal in most countries. But even nowadays, in today's permissive and tolerant climate, no parent ever truly welcomes the news that their son or daughter is gay. Dr Hulme can't face it and when Mrs Rieper takes Pauline to the doctor the doctor has his face turned to the window and says homosexuality to Mrs Rieper like he's afraid of the word. Most of the other characters are portrayed favourably. Dr Hulme is portrayed as a rather stuffy man and his wife is exposed as a hypocrite when it turns out she's sleeping with one of the clients from her marriage guidance clinic. Mr Rieper is an easy-going fun-loving man who makes fun of the way his daughter takes Mario Lanza's music so seriously by saying to her so that's that great Irish singer, Murray O'Lanza and lip synching to her Mario Lanza record with a fish to his mouth. He is evidently a pleasant man who had a very bad thing happen to him. When the pervert lodger climbs into bed with Pauline (paedophilia is nothing new) he is justifiably angry and Mrs Rieper tells Pauline that the fact that she did nothing to discourage him from climbing into bed with her reduced her father to tears. But he is still in the mood for jokes when Dr Hulme comes round and expresses his concern at the intensity of the girls' friendship. Mrs Rieper is portrayed as a kindly housewife. But Pauline and Juliet are at best, two rather silly girls. Their life revolves round the fantasy world they have created and they are shown as very foolish in the scene where they both strip to their underwear in the middle of the woods while singing The Donkey Serenade in off-key voices, walk to the edge of the woods not expecting to see anyone and encounter a farmer hammering in a signpost who touches his hat and says g'day to them. Their murderous tendencies are shown in scenes faintly reminiscent of Billy Liar's fantasies about machine gunning people (and he created his own fantasy world as well, namely Ambrosia). When Juliet is in the sanatorium a hellfire preacher tells her that modern medicine will not necessarily save her from dying from TB and pushes an evangelical tract in her hand. He rants away at her and she fantasises about one of the clay figures from Bonrovia dragging the preacher away and beheading him. Well, maybe that was justified. I mean, the preacher had wished her dead first. However, in a similar fashion, Pauline fantasises about the same clay figure impaling the doctor on a sword. A very good film, showing how wicked and inexcusable murder is. Once you have committed murder you have not only ended another human being's life your own life will never be the same again even if you are released from prison. Pauiline and Juliet were forbidden to have any further contact with each other as a condition of their release and both had to assume new identities.

Sam has long lived in the shadow of his father Buddy, himself the sheriff at one time.  However clues point to the fact that the skull may belong to Charley Wade, the corrupt sheriff who `vanished' to Mexico when Deeds challenged him many years prior.  However when Sam begins to ask questions that go deeper than the legends, he finds secrets within the border town that hit very near home.Having just watched The Hi Lo Country (a modern day western with a sprawling story but focused on one thing), I was put in mind to watch Lone Star again.  Lone Star is easily the superior film and is a rich weaving of many characters and stories all around one event.  The one event is the uncovering of an old murder (possibly) and this central investigation holds the attention easily.  Within this investigation and the lives that Buddy affected we are shown a lot of subplots &#150; some followed through, others just giving us enough background to understand the characters.  All of these work very well and as a result you don't feel like the film is wandering when it moves away from the investigation by Sam.  The subplots are so well translated that we are given a lot of back story to complex characters in a very short time.For the script to be able to create so many characters that feel real and that have meaningful things going on is impressive.  That it makes them all work is amazing and is due to Sayles both writing and editing.  As director he is great as well, avoiding the washed out desert feel many `Mexico related' films have and instead goes for richer colours that reflect the rich mix of communities that are in his story.The acting is faultless all round.  No one actor stands out regardless of screen time simply because no one goes over the top and everyone realises they are playing part of a story &#150; even Cooper (realistically the nearest thing to a lead actor) plays it down rather than taking the film over.  Morton is good even if his character is the least connected to the investigation, McConaughey is strong despite being little more than a cameo, likewise with Kristofferson.  McDormand has a small role but is very impressive as Deeds' ex-wife.  Elizabeth Peña, so often dumped with almost token Espanic roles is given a real good part and works with it well.

I think this was reflected in poor box office at the time (comparatively poor anyway).  But those who have seen it will generally love it &#150; if only more people would watch it!  A final word on the film &#150; the ending is shocking and sensationalist on paper and a lesser man would have made a big deal out of it.

If you are looking for edge or your seat drama, you're shopping in the wrong store here.  What you do get is a story about relationships.  The main focus is the story of a friendship between five women, each character totally different, but very well defined by the five actresses who portray them.  There is also a major story about the relationship between a Mother and Daughter, some minor stories involving girlfriend and boyfriend, and husband and wife.  It is the actresses who make this movie watchable, Sally Field hits all the right notes as a mother who at times can seem overbearing to her daughter, but as we find out with good reason.  Dolly Parton as a beauty shop owner gives her best performance ever here, and for once doesn't try to draw our attention to her anatomy.  Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis are stellar as two women who you are always trying to one up the other, but who deep down really care about each other.  The biggest surprise here is Daryl Hannah, who plays a mousy church goer.  It is probably her best performance to date.  Julia Roberts, in an early role as Sally Field's daughter, does a fine job also.Although the male roles don't have much screen time, they are still pivotal to the story, and Tom Skerritt, Sam Shephard, Dylan McDermott, and Kevin J. O'Connor, give performances every bit as good as the ladies.  It's great to watch a movie where on the surface there doesn't seem to be much happening, but challenges you to listen to the dialogue between the characters.

In general, horror series like the seemingly endless Friday the 13th series are composed of one hugely successful original film (generally, by today's standards, inexplicably so, despite the abysmal standards of today) followed by a lot of stomach-turningly awful sequels that try in vain to recapture the success of the original film. The first sequel in the Friday the 13th series, however, seems to escape that trend, although it never manages to be much better than the original, which wasn't that great in the first place. But at the very least, even the Austin Powers series went more precipitously downhill than Friday the 13th.The movie takes place several years after the original ended, and since Mrs. Voorhees was the real killer in the original (which we all know because we've all seen Scream) and was beheaded at the end, we now have to have a real killer. The thing that helps this movie escape the treacherous realms of the sophomore effort is that it presents the story so well. Jason has lived in the woods since his mother was killed (a horrifying event which the young Jason witnessed), not interacting with a human being in any way in all those years. In order to seek revenge for his mother's murder, he has been savagely stalking and murdering anyone who comes close to his area of the lake.Not exactly the most intricate storyline, but at least it's not some mindless killer running around killing any teenager daring enough to get involved in any kind of sexual behavior (an extremely popular motive in cheesy horror movies). In this case, promiscuity is punished because Jason supposedly drowned because the counselors who were supposed to be watching him were making out when he was screaming for help.There is a cheesy fireside scene where one character explains this whole thing to all of the teens who are out there training to be counselors, which obviously ends with one person in disguise jumping out of the bushes screaming and scaring the hell out of everyone around the fire. The movie then jumps into auto-pilot for most of the film, becoming your typical slasher movie, but at least they took the time to explain why all these killings were happening, right?This makes me wonder, however, why they would cover Jason's face with a cheap piece of bedsheet with a little hole torn in it for one of his eyes. They've seen Halloween! They know the effectiveness of an expressionless mask, so why not be a little more creative here? The only reason I can think of is that Jason lives in the woods and doesn't exactly have access to things like the costume store where Michael Meyers got his mask, but he did have access to axes and machetes and candles and whatnot. Surely in all those years he could have come up with something at the very least a little more comfortable to wear or easier to see through.At the very end of the film, by the way, we are treated to a close up and slow motion look at Jason's real face (something that we never get to see of Michael Meyers, although we almost do in one of the films), as he leaps through a window to grab the last girl left alive. And what a face! No wonder nobody wants to play with him!As far as the killings themselves, Friday the 13th Part 2 fits in with most other 80s slasher films, which are little more than exercises in coming up with new and interesting ways to kill people, because we already know the formula from countless slasher films made before. In this case, there are certainly some creative murders, and the film even confused me with feelings of sympathy for Jason near the end, particularly when he is holding his arms up trying to get away from the chainsaw.The poor guy! Someone killed his mom for avenging his death, and he's lived in the woods alone his whole life! He's the victim here! Okay, I wouldn't go that far, but I definitely felt badly for the poor guy when he fell off the chair and then almost got chainsawed. But luckily he's soon back on his feet (even after almost being cut completely in half with a weak swing of a machete) goring people with big scary knives and reminding us of the dangers of messing with him. Or, as it were, being anywhere near Camp Crystal Lake.This is also, by the way, the last time that any sympathy can be felt for anyone dumb enough to go up to the lake. The rest of the sequels are filled with people who deserve to die anyway for being so dumb. Well, at least his mask improves from this point on.

No wonder nobody wants to play with him!As far as the killings themselves, Friday the 13th Part 2 fits in with most other 80s slasher films, which are little more than exercises in coming up with new and interesting ways to kill people, because we already know the formula from countless slasher films made before. In this case, there are certainly some creative murders, and the film even confused me with feelings of sympathy for Jason near the end, particularly when he is holding his arms up trying to get away from the chainsaw.The poor guy! Someone killed his mom for avenging his death, and he's lived in the woods alone his whole life! He's the victim here! Okay, I wouldn't go that far, but I definitely felt badly for the poor guy when he fell off the chair and then almost got chainsawed. But luckily he's soon back on his feet (even after almost being cut completely in half with a weak swing of a machete) goring people with big scary knives and reminding us of the dangers of messing with him. Or, as it were, being anywhere near Camp Crystal Lake.This is also, by the way, the last time that any sympathy can be felt for anyone dumb enough to go up to the lake. The rest of the sequels are filled with people who deserve to die anyway for being so dumb. Well, at least his mask improves from this point on.

This leads him all the way to Oakland, where his father, a local crime lord, is in contention with a rival black gang (headed by Delroy Lindo) over an NFL land deal that could make serious money. Turns out all the people living in the desired territory who have no intention of signing their property over are being killed off by the two gangs. With virtually no one to trust, Han turns to the rival boss's daughter (Aahliyah) for help.The movie is very loosely based on Romeo and Juliet, but despite what the purist naysayers might think, the thought of adapting the play into a martial arts thriller actually seemed like an interesting idea. But the film boasts nothing in the way of effective romance. Li and the late Aahliyah have almost no chemistry together; their pairing is awkward and stilted, and it's even more off-putting that it seems as if the filmmakers themselves look down on this interracial romance. The closest they get to intimacy is a hug, and even that looks like a hesitant move.Love story aside, Romeo Must Die is actually part kung-fu flick and part hip-hop gangster movie blaring with an obtrusive rap soundtrack. The latter genre doesn't serve the former particularly well. The rap music interferes with the fight scenes, the attempts at storytelling are shoddy and confusing, and the rivalry between the gangs isn't the slightest bit compelling. The plot is mostly nonsense, seeing as it relies on duping its audience into believing nobody in the press would somehow catch onto the connection between all these mysterious deaths and this high-profile NFL deal.Far worse is the fact that Romeo Must Die simply doesn't have enough action, especially for a film that runs nearly two hours.

I had been studying for most of the day and decided to make something to eat and watch the movie for a while to take a break from the books, and right about the time when I realized that Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) inability to sleep was to play a major role in the plot of the film, I fell asleep. A little irony that I found too amusing not to share with you all. Will Dormer is a detective assigned to a case in Alaska about a high school girl who has turned up dead. He finds out early on his mission that he is being accompanied by an agent from Internal Affairs, sent along due to some suspicion about some of Dormer's cases.(spoilers) Dormer immediately finds himself adored by a young police woman in Alaska (I think the name of the town was DeafMute or something) who has studied his every move and all but idolizes him, an adoration to which he tiredly responds with a roll of his eyes. He's seen this sort of thing before, and he just wants to get the job done and get back to Los Angeles and away from all of these backwoods people. The film is a typical investigation film until a great scene where the cops find the victim's backpack and put it right back where they found it, and then announce on the local radio stations that they need the backpack that the girl left a party in, offering a reward. They set up a trap at the location, knowing that only the killer knows where it is so they hope he'll show up to get it.In a great case of police stupidity, one of the officers accidentally presses the button on a megaphone, alerting the killer just as he arrives and setting up a good chase sequence through the fog. This is where the real conflict of the movie is introduced. Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, the Internal Affairs officer sent to investigate him. Knowing that he will be blamed for the murder, he covers it up, making it look like it was the killer that shot him, and thus beginning an increasingly tangled web of lies (have you ever noticed that lies tend to lead to more lies?). We may begin to wonder for the rest of the film how likely it is that Dormer would have been blamed for the shooting had he simply told the truth in the first place. Sure, it would look suspicious since the guy was investigating him, but that is hardly proof of premeditated murder. He would have been innocent until proven guilty, and his guilt is not likely to have been proven beyond what was obviously an accident.The movie ultimately teams up Dormer with the original victim's killer, Walter Finch (played by Robin Williams in a decidedly uncharacteristic role), who also may not have had such malicious intentions in the first place. Dormer crosses the line of the law when he decides not to tell the truth about how his partner died, and now he is going even further by teaming up with the killer to frame the girl's boyfriend for the deaths of both victims. This forces us to question a lot of assumptions that we take for granted about authority figures and criminals in modern society.We assume that the police are there to protect us (although, we should always keep in mind the famous and all too true quote from some source that I don't know beyond the Skinny Puppy song that I heard it in, `The police used to watch over the people, now they're watching the people.'), and that they are the good guys out to catch the bad guys. In this case, assuming that Finch is telling the truth about what happened, the bad guy is not necessarily a bad guy (although certainly not the most admirable character), and the good guy, the police officer, is even worse than the bad guy because he's trying to frame an innocent kid of murder.This also brings up another point, however, since the kid is also not the most admirable character. The movie not only makes us examine our assumptions of authority and criminals, but also of ourselves as we find ourselves hoping that they succeed in framing this kid, who we dislike enormously because of his inflammatory temper and his tendency to beat his girlfriend, who sought the company of the man who killed her in order to get away from him. In that way, he certainly played a role in her death. He was definitely not the most nurturing guy in the world.Will Dormer is the main character in the film, charmingly named because of his inability to sleep, which is undoubtedly brought on because he certainly has a lot on his mind. He has been assigned to find the killer of a high school girl, he has inadvertently shot and killed his partner who was investigating him for Internal Affairs, he finds himself identifying with the criminality of the suspect that he is trying to bring in, his own plan of covering up his own murder is falling apart, and all of this is taking place in a location where the sun never sets. No wonder he can't sleep.Up to this point, this is a great psychological thriller. There is relatively little action put together to add up to an enormous amount of tension, but this conversely makes you wonder about some scenes that seem to have been thrown in just to have a little more action in the movie, when next to none was needed. There is, for example, a scene where Dormer chases Finch across a lot of loose logs on a river and ends up getting trapped underwater, which is one of the more tired action sequences of the thriller genre. This scene stands out so far from the tone of the rest of the film that it seems to belong in a different movie.But more importantly than that, the movie really starts to fall apart at the end when Dormer and Finch turn against each other and the movie devolves into a typical shootout. This is the point where the film lets us know that these two characters were trying to put a plan into action that could never work, they were on a doomed path. So don't try this at home, kids. The whole set-up of the interaction of Finch and Dormer falls apart into low-rent action, which reminds me of the ignored opportunities of Hollow Man and, even more, the similarly obligatory ending of the recent Robert DeNiro film 15 Minutes, which was a tremendously well-made film with a conclusion that is just as much on auto-pilot as this one is.We get the nice poetic justice as the two major criminals in the film shoot each other simultaneously, and Dormer is given a chance to do a deathbed conversion, redeeming himself in the eyes of Ellie Burr (the young policewoman played by Hillary Swank who admired him at the beginning but eventually discovered his secret), urging her not to throw the one piece of incriminating evidence into the river but to turn it in so this whole sordid mess can finally be resolved. Very nice, but this convenient ending just doesn't do justice to the effective tension created in the first half of the film. Like the two main criminals, the ending is almost a polar opposite of the beginning, leaving us enormously entertained but eventually disappointed.And in case you were wondering, both of my midterms today went remarkably well.

He has been assigned to find the killer of a high school girl, he has inadvertently shot and killed his partner who was investigating him for Internal Affairs, he finds himself identifying with the criminality of the suspect that he is trying to bring in, his own plan of covering up his own murder is falling apart, and all of this is taking place in a location where the sun never sets. No wonder he can't sleep.Up to this point, this is a great psychological thriller. There is relatively little action put together to add up to an enormous amount of tension, but this conversely makes you wonder about some scenes that seem to have been thrown in just to have a little more action in the movie, when next to none was needed. There is, for example, a scene where Dormer chases Finch across a lot of loose logs on a river and ends up getting trapped underwater, which is one of the more tired action sequences of the thriller genre. This scene stands out so far from the tone of the rest of the film that it seems to belong in a different movie.But more importantly than that, the movie really starts to fall apart at the end when Dormer and Finch turn against each other and the movie devolves into a typical shootout. This is the point where the film lets us know that these two characters were trying to put a plan into action that could never work, they were on a doomed path. So don't try this at home, kids. The whole set-up of the interaction of Finch and Dormer falls apart into low-rent action, which reminds me of the ignored opportunities of Hollow Man and, even more, the similarly obligatory ending of the recent Robert DeNiro film 15 Minutes, which was a tremendously well-made film with a conclusion that is just as much on auto-pilot as this one is.We get the nice poetic justice as the two major criminals in the film shoot each other simultaneously, and Dormer is given a chance to do a deathbed conversion, redeeming himself in the eyes of Ellie Burr (the young policewoman played by Hillary Swank who admired him at the beginning but eventually discovered his secret), urging her not to throw the one piece of incriminating evidence into the river but to turn it in so this whole sordid mess can finally be resolved. Very nice, but this convenient ending just doesn't do justice to the effective tension created in the first half of the film. Like the two main criminals, the ending is almost a polar opposite of the beginning, leaving us enormously entertained but eventually disappointed.And in case you were wondering, both of my midterms today went remarkably well.

I had been studying for most of the day and decided to make something to eat and watch the movie for a while to take a break from the books, and right about the time when I realized that Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) inability to sleep was to play a major role in the plot of the film, I fell asleep. A little irony that I found too amusing not to share with you all. Will Dormer is a detective assigned to a case in Alaska about a high school girl who has turned up dead. He finds out early on his mission that he is being accompanied by an agent from Internal Affairs, sent along due to some suspicion about some of Dormer's cases.(spoilers) Dormer immediately finds himself adored by a young police woman in Alaska (I think the name of the town was DeafMute or something) who has studied his every move and all but idolizes him, an adoration to which he tiredly responds with a roll of his eyes. He's seen this sort of thing before, and he just wants to get the job done and get back to Los Angeles and away from all of these backwoods people. The film is a typical investigation film until a great scene where the cops find the victim's backpack and put it right back where they found it, and then announce on the local radio stations that they need the backpack that the girl left a party in, offering a reward. They set up a trap at the location, knowing that only the killer knows where it is so they hope he'll show up to get it.In a great case of police stupidity, one of the officers accidentally presses the button on a megaphone, alerting the killer just as he arrives and setting up a good chase sequence through the fog. This is where the real conflict of the movie is introduced. Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, the Internal Affairs officer sent to investigate him. Knowing that he will be blamed for the murder, he covers it up, making it look like it was the killer that shot him, and thus beginning an increasingly tangled web of lies (have you ever noticed that lies tend to lead to more lies?). We may begin to wonder for the rest of the film how likely it is that Dormer would have been blamed for the shooting had he simply told the truth in the first place. Sure, it would look suspicious since the guy was investigating him, but that is hardly proof of premeditated murder. He would have been innocent until proven guilty, and his guilt is not likely to have been proven beyond what was obviously an accident.The movie ultimately teams up Dormer with the original victim's killer, Walter Finch (played by Robin Williams in a decidedly uncharacteristic role), who also may not have had such malicious intentions in the first place. Dormer crosses the line of the law when he decides not to tell the truth about how his partner died, and now he is going even further by teaming up with the killer to frame the girl's boyfriend for the deaths of both victims. This forces us to question a lot of assumptions that we take for granted about authority figures and criminals in modern society.We assume that the police are there to protect us (although, we should always keep in mind the famous and all too true quote from some source that I don't know beyond the Skinny Puppy song that I heard it in, `The police used to watch over the people, now they're watching the people.'), and that they are the good guys out to catch the bad guys. In this case, assuming that Finch is telling the truth about what happened, the bad guy is not necessarily a bad guy (although certainly not the most admirable character), and the good guy, the police officer, is even worse than the bad guy because he's trying to frame an innocent kid of murder.This also brings up another point, however, since the kid is also not the most admirable character. The movie not only makes us examine our assumptions of authority and criminals, but also of ourselves as we find ourselves hoping that they succeed in framing this kid, who we dislike enormously because of his inflammatory temper and his tendency to beat his girlfriend, who sought the company of the man who killed her in order to get away from him. In that way, he certainly played a role in her death. He was definitely not the most nurturing guy in the world.Will Dormer is the main character in the film, charmingly named because of his inability to sleep, which is undoubtedly brought on because he certainly has a lot on his mind.

The foil in the movie was his own neurosis, dutifully reinforced by his friends. So what we really ended up watching was a series of TV sitcoms exploring the meaning of life while on the trail for a mate with a camera and a sound boom. The narrator could only express a sense of cluelessness at each turn. Art imitates life. Even the film maker, himself, admitted that the premise could only be stretched so far when he took a different tack, one where he had finally found true love but still must continue dating other women to complete his movie. An unsuccessful attempt to reanimate a dead story line. Some nice touches, however. The movie critic, with his deadpan sudo-psychoanalysis, added a sense of poignant humor. I also enjoyed the satirical moment with his bashing of the French, given that film critics normally swoon over the French as the masters of cinema. Then there is role of Elie, the financier, which offered some momentary humorous distractions by relieving the viewer from Berkowitz's constant self-examination. It's ironic that the woman on the first date observed to our hero during dinner that everything was really about him. I submit that it was a warning to the viewers as much as it was dialogue. Next time, maybe Myles Berkowitz will do a short film about Elie. Can it be any worse?
