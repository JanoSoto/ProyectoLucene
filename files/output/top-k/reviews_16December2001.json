What, with it's a-list cast that includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, it's Academy Award winning director Steven Soderbergh of Erin Brockovich and Traffic fame, and, of course, if you remake an old Rat Pack classic, you better do it right.And they did.The plot of Ocean's Eleven by itself is great. Danny Ocean (Clooney) is a con artist who just got out of jail. And he's already got a new gig in mind. He wants to `knockoff' three casinos in Las Vegas the Mirage, the Bellagio, and the MGM Grand. He enlists the help of his friend Rusty (Pitt), another schemer and together they set off to gather a crew of nine others to make...Ocean's eleven. The `others' they enlist include such big name stars as Matt Damon as the pickpocket Linus, Casey Affleck (Ben's younger brother) as the vehicle guy Virgil, and Don Cheadle as the ammunitions man, aptly named Basher.There has to be some bad guy in all this, if you don't count every single man involved with the heist as a `bad guy'. That role is played perfectly by Andy Garcia as Terry Benedict, the owner of all three casinos who happens to be dating Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts). He isn't a bad guy, but he's ruthless. You don't want him to catch the bad...er...good guys. Even when they begin to rob the casino.The tagline for Ocean's Eleven is `Are you in or are you out?' I'm in. This movie was awesome. Only one word comes to mind when you walk out of this movie cool. The clothing, the music, the atmosphere, the way they talk. They are cool all the way. Like the original Rat Pack, they have a certain...air about them. They seem so laid back and relaxed about what they're doing. At the end of the movie I couldn't help but begin to hum the words to `Smooth Criminal.' They were smooth as stone.Every person in this movie contributed something. With out anyone single person in the 11 the job wouldn't have worked. It was amazing the things they did and the ways they did them.

Most of the time with the bigger or more important parts, they would show you what everyone else thought was going on, but when you discovered that wasn't the case, they replayed from the `eleven's' point of view. This was a really good way to keep the audience guessing and to make the movie look fun.There is one thing I didn't like about this movie though. When Linus (Damon) would pickpocket someone, they would slow the picture down and close up on his hand. This bothered me for two reasons. One, it took some of the mystery away in one scene where it was critical he `lift' something without getting caught. Two, it made it too movie like. In real life, pickpockets work so quickly and slyly that a person standing next to them couldn't even see it happen. They should have just kept the camera rolling like they did in the rest of the scenes.I suggest that anyone who is looking for something light and fun to watch, go see Ocean's Eleven. The feel of the movie will get you happy. Just like the plot of this movie, a whole lot of little things pull together to make a great picture.

The first film did not disappoint.Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring is ready to hit screens nationwide Wednesday, Dec. 19 and will almost assuredly make a gigantic impact on the box office.Lasting a full three hours without ever reaching a firm ending is not the normal recipe for movie success, but director Peter Jackson managed to work around that problem. He spent enough time working on this project for the film to fully live up to its lofty expectations.Jackson is not the only one to be commended. First off, J.R.R. Tolkien deserves credit for writing the books nearly 50 years ago and creating a world where Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs and creatures of all sorts roam `Middle Earth.' The plot is engrossing, as anyone who read the books can attest to. But just because the books were good, that does not mean the movies would be.Set design, costume production, good scriptwriting, a quality cast and a good score all contribute to make this movie enjoyable.The screen comes to life in vivid color as the audience gets to travel with the main character, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), through snowy mountaintops, lush green forests, dark swamps and even darker mines. That doesn't even mention the gorgeous cities Frodo and his friends encounter along their journey.Frodo is a hobbit (a species that in the books was said to be about 3 foot 6 inches on average) who must destroy an extremely powerful ring before it falls into the hands of evil. Sounds like a basic enough plot Good vs. Evil with several subplots thrown in along the way. But it is through this vivid scenery that the story really flourishes. The costumes help add to that powerful scenery. All the hobbits wear large, hairy feet to match the description of the creatures in the books. To make sure the hobbits appear shorter in the movie, there were plenty of camera tricks involved. The end results were very effective. There are also plenty of Dwarves, Elves and other species that took a great deal of time and effort to make look as good as they do.The acting is nearly as good as the scenery. Ian McKellen (X-Men, Apt Pupil) delivers one of the best performances of 2001 as Gandalf the Wizard.

Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus walks Neo (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) through a lot of discussion of what the matrix is, in the middle of the film.  This fits into the category of 'exposition', a definite problem with script writing.  It would have been better if the character Neo would have been involved with more drama while actually figuring out what the matrix is.  In a movie like Star Wars, the characters are placed in a setting unlike our world...In a galaxy far, far away.  The action in Star Wars moves from one scene to another without the characters stopping whatever they're doing, then sitting around and explaining how the Millennium Falcon jumps to light speed or how the Death Star destroys planets...the viewer actually sees the stars race across the screen as the Millennium Falcon gets away from the Empire fighters, and see how Princess Lea painfully watches her own planet get destroyed.  In The Matrix, besides the long scene that gets bogged down by exposition, there isn't much to character development.  If you take away all the amazing special effects, there wasn't that much in the script to hold the characters together.  I am bothered how this movie is considered a thinking man's sci-fi thriller.

I was (and still am) quite cynical about the entire hype surrounding the world of 'Harry Potter' though to be fair, I have yet to read the books. However, thanks to this movie, I am now intent on exploring for myself the wonderful world of 'Harry Potter'. From an objective point of view, this film is pure fun and adventure. We are introduced to Harry as an abused young boy growing up with cruel foster parents and it is quite fun to see how he grows and develops into, well... need I say? Along the way, we are treated to various characters of the book, all of whom are portrayed with great enthusiasm by an awesome cast. I loved the gorgeous sets and the visual effects, while not brilliant, are well suited to the film. Kudos to Chris Columbus for having been able to orchestrate everything so well together.Whilst watching it, I was pulled right into the realm of Harry Potter and emerged as a sort of convert. I still remain a cynic about all the hype but I was impressed enough by the film to try the books. My only complaint with the film would be that it is a bit too long and the momentum is disrupted somewhat but it is a minor niggle that fails to tarnish a good film.
