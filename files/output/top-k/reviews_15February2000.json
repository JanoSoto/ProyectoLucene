Well, I thought the commercials made it look like some hip kind of movie that would make a mockery of war and attract the commonfolk.  Let's admit it, the commercials didn't at all accurately show what this film was really about in fear of not attracting a big audience.  So there I was on my computer, despising the film and at Roger Ebert's website, when I saw a review for Three Kings with 4 stars.  I thought it was some kind of fluke, but then a friend who saw it told me he thought it was one of the best films of the year.  So my interest in the film was then huge and I went to see it a few weeks later over Fight Club, which I had wanted to see but my friends didn't.This film was such a treat.  I knew it was going to be unique after the first scene, but I wasn't sure if it was going to be the good kind of unique.  The storyline has 4 soldiers fighting in Desert Storm right after the War has been declared over.  The soldiers find a map in a surprising place(trust me, you wouldn't want me to give it away) and find that it leads to bulyan, the Kuwaiti form of gold.  On their journey to get the gold and throughout, the soldiers find themselves changing gradually.  I won't go any further into the summary.The acting was good, with strong performances by Mark Wahlberg, Spike Jonze, George Clooney, Ice Cube, and 2 Arab actors whose names I am unfamiliar with.  This is the first war movie I've seen that is successfully funny yet very dramatic.  The end of this film is touching, and the film satiates your need to know about what happens afterwards by telling you exactly that.I also thought there were no superfluous scenes in this film.  Every scene feels important, and every scene will keep you interested.  The film is shot in a really unique way, and it looks great.  The only problem I had with this film is the title.  Why couldn't it be titled Four Kings?  Why in the world are they leaving Spike Jonze out?  He definitely had as large a role as the other three leads....About the comedy in this film, a lot of it may fly over your head.  I never understood the haircut joke until I read about it on a website after I saw the film.  This film is probably hit and miss comedy at its best, and I can't recall any misses!  I am writing this a few hours after the Oscar announcements and am quite angry this film wasn't at all acknowledged? What is the Academy afraid of?This review has been all over the place, but that's the way I feel about this movie.  There's so much to say, and so little room to say it.  I recommend this to any mature person over the age of 15.  Trust me, don't let anyone younger watch this.  I give this movie a 9\/10, but on the IMDB, a 10\/10 because it needs it to balance out the low number of votes.  If any other movie I've seen this year has generated more positivity, I haven't seen it yet....(ok, ok, so I haven't seen American Beauty of Being John Malkovich yet, hehe) ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2000","score":"","review":"  When I first heard of Three Kings, I absolutely despised it.

As I sort of expected, much of the first part was fairly slow moving and a bit boring. But if you stick with MEET JOE BLACK, it gets a little more exciting and you'll find the story a bit more interesting.William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a very successful businessman who has raised a good family, had a good career and has lead a good life. Then one day, Death (Brad Pitt) comes to William and offers him more time to be alive in exchange for Parrish showing him around life. Death, using the name Joe Black, really starts to enjoy life and fall in love with Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). When this happens, he considers changing the rules of life & death.The plot is very original and fairly interesting. I think it would have been a little less boring if there wasn't a dramatic pause between every sentence. The beginning of this movie is actually pretty good, but the rest of the first half tends to drag a bit. The second half still has similar flaws, but because the characters have been set and the plot really starts to threaten, it is a lot more interesting. I had mixed feelings for the ending. I thought it was OK, but it could have been a little better. The ending was kind of predictable, but not especially since it was hard to tell where they were going with it. Half of the movie is predictable and half of it wasn't.The acting was superb in this movie, as expected with a veteran like Anthony Hopkins and a newer, but talented, face like Brad Pitt. Hopkins, in my humble opinion, stole the show right out from under Pitt, who I think was meant to be the showcase. Claire Forlani did pretty well as the adorable girlfriend of Pitt, and I thought the Jamaican Lady, played by Lois Kelly-Miller, and was both funny and noble. I loved the scenes between her and Pitt, and I thought Pitt was very funny speaking a Jamaican accent.The character development in this movie was pretty good. It was pretty cool to see the Grim Reaper himself (Joe Black\/Death) have feelings and curiosity about life, let alone fall in love with someone. You can relate to Parrish, even though he plays an old fart, because he knows that his death is coming and he is, naturally, trying to tie up loose knots. You would do this too if Death came to you and said Hey, you're gonna die in a week. So, how 'bout them Yankees? Both of Parrish's daughters represent two stereotype daughters. One was the older, favorite daughter who is struggling with her feelings about love. The other is the younger daughter who is jealous of her older sister, but is married. Again, I loved the Jamaican Lady, but I don't think I would have if it weren't for Pitt's excellent dialogue with her.If you don't like long movies, you'd better stay away from this one. If you're a Pitt fan, you'll love it because he is everywhere on this film. I'd still say this is one great film and that you should check it out, but not if you have a bad attention span.

It is so packed with humour it reminds me of the old Mad Magazines with the jokes written in the margins.  Some of the humour is rather subtle and the dialogue rolls right over it.  If you're not paying attention, you might miss it.Tom Hanks is perfect as Lawrence Bourne III, the Ivy League cad.  John Candy is at the top of his form as the brainwashed Tom Tuttle from Tacoma.  Geddy Watanabe as the street smart Thai gives a performance on par with his Long Duc Dong of Sixteen Candles.  And Rita Wilson is totally convincing as the idealistic Peace Corps volunteer out to teach the masses the advantages of Self-Styling Adorn.If you don't think the ratings are off on this one, I suggest this test.

Normally that would be my reaction, too.  But NO!  RUN!  FAR FAR AWAY!  Picket your local distributor if this movie graces its shelves.

Warren Beatty should be very proud of this masterpiece.   Not only for the guts it took to so brazenly confront the modern political process (and how it affects race relations, the film industry, education, medicine, and so on) but also for the fact that he wrote it, produced it, directed it, and starred in it. Any one of those jobs can be a supreme undertaking, and here he has accomplished all four with integrity, wit, humor, intelligence, and undeniable brass.

A film that, according to like 89% of the guys in the world would never EVER go see it in their lives because of Leonardo DiCaprio and his god like status amongst young females! Despite what both sexes think of him, I enjoy Leo's movies, especially the darker roles. I didn't know what to expect going into this film, hadn't seen Leo on screen for a couple of years since Titanic. But I went into it with an open mind, and by the end of it, my buddy and I were quite impressed. The scenery was breathtaking...(although I can't award much credit to the director of photography on that one, considering any idiot in that region could just pic up a camera and roll...and it would turn out pretty) Don't get me wrong though..the D.O.P did a wonderful job!! The acting was really well done too, and some of you may not like the narrative voice over, but I enjoyed it. It allows the audience to read deeper into the thoughts of the characters, which if used correctly, can really push a plot line.  There were quite a few humorous sequences in the film (Video games anyone) that I thought were kinda interesting.But enough about that!! I enjoyed this film, and if you are one of those guys who hates Leo, then I think you should see it anyway...because it's not fair to spite someone who's image is molded by the media (notice why he is NEVER at celebrity events...because HE hates all that c**p too...well, i'm assuming)  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2000","score":"","review":" Well, tonight I saw The Beach!

I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, narrator.  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.
