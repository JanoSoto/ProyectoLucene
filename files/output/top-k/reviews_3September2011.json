What makes this case so special is that the agent was on the staff of those who letdown Kennedy on that faithful day and this assassin makes it a game trying to compare himself with the agent. I remember when this movie was released many people called it very Dirty Harry like and I guess I'd agree to a point since this agent plays by his own rules just like that famous detective. This is an extremely well made and well acted picture that's certainly gotten better with age thanks in large part to the terrific storyline and strong performances. I also remember quite a few people thinking the film was tasteless because it mixes in this fictional story with a subplot about Eastwood protecting Kennedy the day he was assassinated. Many people found it quite tasteless that they'd take real history and twist it around to fit the story here but I thought it actually added a lot of drama and it really helped stretch out the character played by Eastwood. The actor was just starting his hot period, which amazingly continues today but he delivers a terrific performance and really nails this character. We all know that the actor can play the tough guy like no one else but the screenplay allows him some quieter moments and this is where he really shines. Reliving his feelings about his past mistakes have Eastwood really going for broke and he delivers. Malkovich is also excellent in his part and watching him here you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real psycho with these evil plans. He's just so calm, cool and collective that you can't help but see how truly sick he is. The actor is so good that you just have to look into his eyes to see that cold nature. Rene Russo plays the love interest but she makes the character more than just that and her chemistry with Eastwood makes this subplot work. John Mahoney, Fred Dalton Thompson and Dylan McDermott have supporting roles. IN THE LINE OF FIRE contains quite a bit of suspense as director Wolfgang Petersen does a very good job at building up the cast and mouse game between the agent and the assassin. I think the film works best as a psychological thriller because the best moments aren't really the action scenes but instead the scenes where the two actors are on the phone simply talking to one another. These scenes are so intense and well-handled that you can't help get caught up in everything that's going on.

So I checked it out without too many expectations and WDYK, I wasn't disappointed. What I wondered later was why this flick had to be made at all, as it constitutes a clear Been There, Seen That example the inside workings of a Casino--mainly from the POV of its security--those of a mob hierarchy and, as a bonus, an inside look at a screwed up romantic couple.

Events build upon themselves like rows of brick giving shape to a wall, without any central guiding idea. The thing goes just by the formula bad guys do bad things, kill people, get their comeuppance. Now, the usual set up in many action flicks is that bad guys do bad things and we feel bad--so we feel good when, later, justice is done. But here everyone is so shallow, contemptible and lame we don't care when they kill someone or are killed themselves. They are all indistinguishable pieces of the same pile of sh*t.

And what do you know, at such a conjuncture the best way they found to put her back aboard is by bringing back her former pimp.

The same thing may be said of the others, with the possible exception of Rickles' Sherbert. No depth, no nuance, no complexity there. Pesci plays the same violent, foul--mouthed SOB he has been doing forever--even his JFK's Ferrie is indistinguishable from Casino's Santoro--and De Niro plays the same self-restrained, still--waters--run--deep goon he did in OUATIA and in others flicks.No plot, no characterizations. What's left? Oh, mood and atmosphere. The sumptuous setting should serve to establish at least the second with some help from the acting and the score; but no help there either. The problem here is, we have seen the same thing sooo many times before--ever vigilant Casino goons, managers; smart-ass players who get theirs in the biggest burner; random wise guys getting their clock cleaned.

They could've turned her into a faithful wife, devote mom, just the same and we wouldn't have noticed, so shallow had been her characterization; but of course that wouldn't have helped selling tickets. The same thing may be said of the others, with the possible exception of Rickles' Sherbert. No depth, no nuance, no complexity there. Pesci plays the same violent, foul--mouthed SOB he has been doing forever--even his JFK's Ferrie is indistinguishable from Casino's Santoro--and De Niro plays the same self-restrained, still--waters--run--deep goon he did in OUATIA and in others flicks.No plot, no characterizations. What's left? Oh, mood and atmosphere. The sumptuous setting should serve to establish at least the second with some help from the acting and the score; but no help there either. The problem here is, we have seen the same thing sooo many times before--ever vigilant Casino goons, managers; smart-ass players who get theirs in the biggest burner; random wise guys getting their clock cleaned. Mob bosses getting their cut, ordering hits, imparting justice...yawn...So, 2\/10, only for settings, cinematography.

A lot of stuff seemed so familiar, and of course, the name Henry Hill was the tip-off, a non-Italian in the world of Mafioso high rollers and hit men. I read the book shortly after it came out, and the movie seemed to come out very quickly after. I don't remember a whole lot about the book now, but some of the things that stand out are the Air France job, the Lufthansa heist, and that bit about feeding a guy to a lion. Oh yeah, and the burial, exhumation and reburial of Billy Batts. You have to admit, Goodfellas has the best ba-da-bing opening of all time when Tommy (Joe Pesci) goes berserk on Batts in the car trunk and just keeps wailing.I've read a few of the other comments in the reviews section for this picture, and can only chuckle at a few of the naive posters who think that what happens on screen here is forced and not very believable. I can only surmise that they didn't grow up in New York or it's suburb environs, because mob rub-outs were a staple on the front pages of the New York Daily News and The Post throughout the Sixties. Usually they more closely resembled Michael Corleone's first hit in the Italian restaurant in The Godfather, but nevertheless, this kind of brutality did occur. Although I have to say, the way Tommy whacked Michael Imperioli was a little over the top.I guess the most memorable scene in the movie for me was Pesci giving Ray Liotta the business in that 'who's funny' routine. For first time viewers, you're not really sure where Tommy's going to take things because he's such a loose cannon. Then suddenly, Pesci calls himself on it, and you know full well he was playing around with the new kid. The character Pesci was portraying, real life mobster Tommy DeSimone, was in fact a young aspiring gangster with psychopathic tendencies specializing in truck hijacking and stolen goods.So for those who think Goodfellas is the best gangster flick ever, fair enough, but putting it up against the first two 'Godfathers' is a little bit of a stretch for my money. I also prefer the Coen Brothers' take on crime in Miller's Crossing. But this one's based on a true story, and you can't get more real than some of the outrageous things that happened in the life of wise guy Henry Hill. For an outsider, he could be a real goombah.

You have to admit, Goodfellas has the best ba-da-bing opening of all time when Tommy (Joe Pesci) goes berserk on Batts in the car trunk and just keeps wailing.I've read a few of the other comments in the reviews section for this picture, and can only chuckle at a few of the naive posters who think that what happens on screen here is forced and not very believable. I can only surmise that they didn't grow up in New York or it's suburb environs, because mob rub-outs were a staple on the front pages of the New York Daily News and The Post throughout the Sixties. Usually they more closely resembled Michael Corleone's first hit in the Italian restaurant in The Godfather, but nevertheless, this kind of brutality did occur. Although I have to say, the way Tommy whacked Michael Imperioli was a little over the top.I guess the most memorable scene in the movie for me was Pesci giving Ray Liotta the business in that 'who's funny' routine. For first time viewers, you're not really sure where Tommy's going to take things because he's such a loose cannon. Then suddenly, Pesci calls himself on it, and you know full well he was playing around with the new kid. The character Pesci was portraying, real life mobster Tommy DeSimone, was in fact a young aspiring gangster with psychopathic tendencies specializing in truck hijacking and stolen goods.So for those who think Goodfellas is the best gangster flick ever, fair enough, but putting it up against the first two 'Godfathers' is a little bit of a stretch for my money. I also prefer the Coen Brothers' take on crime in Miller's Crossing. But this one's based on a true story, and you can't get more real than some of the outrageous things that happened in the life of wise guy Henry Hill. For an outsider, he could be a real goombah.

Short on action but full of introspection, often set in exotic locations, his stories typically made for slow-moving but visually stunning motion pictures.Slow-moving and visually stunning could also loosely describe the style of director Henry King, who helmed this version of Hemingway's short story The Snows of Kilimanjaro. King was by no means dull, and he never got hung up on imagery, but he certainly encouraged a thoughtful style from his cast and had a love of natural beauty. His shots of the outdoors are unique; never expansive, empty landscapes but always layered, detailed compositions that show off shape and contour. There is always a sense of closeness and intimacy in King's pictures, evident from the first few shots of The Snows of Kilimanjaro &#x96; a close-up of Gregory Peck, the shadow of a tree branch sweeping across his face, cut with close-ups of him watching the flight of a vulture &#x96; a haunting and compelling introduction to the story.And Peck is very much the right man for this sort of thing &#x96; deep, serious, with an air of melancholy, but also handsome and charismatic. And of course, a very fine actor. He handles the lengthy stretches of dialogue well, putting character into Hemingway's words. And his women here are equal matches, especially Susan Hayward, who is all quiet confidence. From her voice to the way her arms lie as she sits next to Peck, everything says here is a strong-willed woman, every bit an equal partner in her relationship with Peck. And every bit an attractive woman too. One thing that The Snows of Kilimanjaro suffers from however is a lack of really outstanding supporting players.I haven't read the original Hemingway story on which this is based. Apparently the central theme is supposedly Harry Street's sense of dissatisfaction with his own writing. However, whether it is differences in this adaptation or simply my own impression of it, I was struck far more by Street's rocky love life, in particular the series of disillusioned women he leaves behind him. It is to me the epitome of 1950s melodrama, from the stabbing score of Alfred Newman to the searing shot of Peck and Ava Gardner kissing before the stark backdrop of a tree. And it seems this is how the American public saw it too. Despite its hard-going literary roots, it became the third highest-grossing picture of the year.

It is about the brutalizing effect of war, not only on the direct participants, but for those back home. Everyone is impacted; everything is changed. People are forced to deal with issues relating to loss, especially of innocence. There is nothing that prepares them for the consequences of what they experience, neither for the men who go and fight or for those at home who care for them. The movie is a study of contrast between two friends, one who survives and tells a story, the other, who succumbs to the trauma that distorts his mind. It is about a man who undergoes a transformation through fire. The movie avoids becoming melodramatic. It tells a story instead. Everyone in the movie is affected by the war. Many scenes are poignant. The movie avoids moralizing about the Vietnam War and instead lets the story speaks for itself. The Russian roulette scenes are powerful and evocative. They are a metaphor for the uncertainty of life. Like with the Americans, the Vietnamese are shown as being brutalized too. Brutalization is the recurrent theme. Everywhere there is violence. Yet, one man rises about it - Michael. He had gone through hell and has survived without losing his mind or his dignity. The movie is long but maintains a quick pace. The movie is about perseverance, courage and hope. It is about home, family and community. It is about personal strength. It is about human vulnerability. It is about friendship. It is about returning to home and reuniting with people. It is about the United States. It is about the world.Actually this movie is about what happens when people are forced to deal with change. The main character, Michael, is a tower of strength, but he doesn't know that, at first. He is just one of the guys, a worker, nobody special; he has his friends; people like him. He's a little distant emotionally but nothing that really interferes with his socializing. In short, there's nothing particularly remarkable about him. Then he goes to war and in war he is tested and his inner strength comes out and he is able to maintain his emotional balance while his friends cannot. He comes home, injured but intact. People know that he has changed - for the better. They now know that he is strong, not just physically, but psychologically. Robert DeNiro is brilliant in this movie. The entire movie revolves around his character and he does a great job, which made this movie into a great movie. In this movie, everyone is affected by change. Nobody is the the same. Their complacency is shattered; they are left with uncertainty. Michael is struggling to keep himself together; he knows what happened to his pals. The character Linda is beautiful and she is strong.

She plays a key role in the story. This is a great movie. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"3 September 2011","score":"","review":" This movie is an epic. It is about the brutalizing effect of war, not only on the direct participants, but for those back home. Everyone is impacted; everything is changed. People are forced to deal with issues relating to loss, especially of innocence. There is nothing that prepares them for the consequences of what they experience, neither for the men who go and fight or for those at home who care for them. The movie is a study of contrast between two friends, one who survives and tells a story, the other, who succumbs to the trauma that distorts his mind. It is about a man who undergoes a transformation through fire. The movie avoids becoming melodramatic. It tells a story instead. Everyone in the movie is affected by the war. Many scenes are poignant. The movie avoids moralizing about the Vietnam War and instead lets the story speaks for itself. The Russian roulette scenes are powerful and evocative. They are a metaphor for the uncertainty of life. Like with the Americans, the Vietnamese are shown as being brutalized too. Brutalization is the recurrent theme. Everywhere there is violence. Yet, one man rises about it - Michael. He had gone through hell and has survived without losing his mind or his dignity. The movie is long but maintains a quick pace. The movie is about perseverance, courage and hope. It is about home, family and community. It is about personal strength. It is about human vulnerability. It is about friendship. It is about returning to home and reuniting with people. It is about the United States. It is about the world.Actually this movie is about what happens when people are forced to deal with change. The main character, Michael, is a tower of strength, but he doesn't know that, at first. He is just one of the guys, a worker, nobody special; he has his friends; people like him. He's a little distant emotionally but nothing that really interferes with his socializing. In short, there's nothing particularly remarkable about him. Then he goes to war and in war he is tested and his inner strength comes out and he is able to maintain his emotional balance while his friends cannot. He comes home, injured but intact. People know that he has changed - for the better. They now know that he is strong, not just physically, but psychologically. Robert DeNiro is brilliant in this movie. The entire movie revolves around his character and he does a great job, which made this movie into a great movie. In this movie, everyone is affected by change. Nobody is the the same. Their complacency is shattered; they are left with uncertainty. Michael is struggling to keep himself together; he knows what happened to his pals. The character Linda is beautiful and she is strong. She plays a key role in the story. This is a great movie.

I loved it then, and since then I've seen it many times and find something new to love about it each time. It is such a beautiful movie, in the gorgeous music- one of my favourite movie musical scores actually-, the colourful visuals, the charming and touching(if slightly convoluted occasionally)story and Catherine Deneuve at her most irresistible. And it is also a unique one, not only in the sparkling sung dialogue but in how it's sung too, it always surprises me at how interesting the singing is and how the singing is done. The cast are uniformly excellent, though it is Deneuve that makes The Umbrellas of Cherbourg so good, the film moves quickly and the direction is sharp. All in all, a real bon-bon of a movie. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"3 September 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I love musical films and movies with romance, so The Umbrellas of Cherbourg when I first saw it a year ago was more than ideal.
