[{"date":"5 September 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election is the type of movie where one shakes the head in disbelief as they question why the movie was made. Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon are the leads in this disjointed film that was supposed to be similar to Ferris Buehler's Day Off; however, the director failed in making a connection to the prior movie. There were too many flashback sequences and cutbacks that ruined the flow of viewing the film.However, the biggest reason Election didn't work for me was the chemistry between Broderick and Witherspoon, which was lacking. It is true that they are talented in their own right, but it seemed as if they were working off of two different scripts. It is a shame to watch these actors in a movie that never materialized.
