Cesar on the other hand seems more intelligent and more believable. we know both character's are very wealthy however in open your eyes, his background is mentioned only once at the start of the movie. the character of Pelayo, Cesar's best friend, is also much more believable than his American counter part, Brian Shelby. Shelby just seems to be unable to take serious offence and doesn't seem upset that much when David tries to chat up Sofia. in the original, when Cesar begins chatting up Sofia (played also in this version by Penelope Cruz), Pelayo seems generally hurt and the audience does take sympathy for him.

Certainly in my area where I am from, this one is a stone cold classic having been filmed in large part in our very small town where nothing like that ever happens. So perhaps I might be a little biased in my opinions but I just really enjoy this movie for its characters and that it isn't afraid to be dark before the light. It is reminiscent in some ways of A Christmas Carol which can also be a bit of a dark and disturbing movie before the happily ever after. I'm not sure I would let youngsters watch One Magic Christmas because of its significant undertones about death. I mean if you dissect it, you have to find it almost disturbing that Santa's helpers are made up of dead people that helped others in life. Putting all that aside, the characters are very well created and acted. The film covers everything from angels to Santa Claus to a father at his rope's end and a mother who is a bit of a scrooge. There are so many layers to the story and it is just really well crafted. Many people are turned off by the darkness of it but it really has some heart and a lot of magic.Mary Steenburgen is just excellent as Scrooge. Essentially that is exactly who her character is. She hates Christmas, she thinks she has nothing in her life worth talking about, and she feels like everyone around her should keep Christmas to themselves. She leads the cast well. Gary Basaraba is also good as her husband who is much more sweet and enjoys Christmas. Despite everything going wrong he is holding it all together much to his wife's chagrin. His character isn't as strong as Steenburgen's and he doesn't give the same level of performance but he fits the role well. I didn't necessarily feel like their chemistry was fantastic but it was good. Harry Dean Stanton feels odd in his role as the Christmas angel Gideon but maybe that's what makes it so interesting. He is sort of a dark almost foreboding character but he somehow fits the story. When he tells the little girl of his past and how he became an angel it instantly gives him this back story that makes you understand him better. Wayne Robson is very good as the father who is at his wit's end and trying to provide for his family and thus makes a horrible decision. I almost wish we had seen more from his character because it really is a good character and he does it very well. Elisabeth Harnois and Robbie Magwood do a solid job as the Grainger children. They are sort of the focus of the story and yet it happens all around them. They fit their roles fine. Jan Rubes, in a small yet important role, is terrific as Santa.Director Phillip Borsos captures the perfect amount of melancholy and sadness to the film as there is magic and hope and light. The scenes in the North Pole are beautiful and for a film like this to cover so much story without feeling cumbersome or boring is quite a feat I think. I know people that complain about Christmas movies being too sweet and sappy and if for no other reason than I recommend One Magic Christmas because it isn't afraid to go into the dark realm where someone is actually murdered to show the main character find her Christmas magic. You could argue the film shows too much darkness for a Christmas movie but its always touched me and I enjoy it every year and for that reason I recommend it highly! 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 December 2012","score":"3 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" There is something about One Magic Christmas that endears itself to many.

I can't watch the final 40 minutes, they... suck. Somehow, at that point, the movie loses focus, tension and yes, even craftsmanship. The imagery gets weaker, the voice overs get tedious, the misery of the characters stops reaching inside you. However, what comes before that is just overwhelming cinema.It's a shame John Toll didn't get the Oscar for cinematography, but obviously, at that time Saving Private Ryan was too groundbreaking in its visual aesthetics to not steal it. Today, however, after zillions of other movies have turned the shaky hand-held-fast shutter-bleached bypass look of SPR into a lame cliché, we realize that the cinematography in TTRL is outstanding in a much more profound and timeless way.Same goes for Hans Zimmer's score, which is inspiring and beautiful and could stand it's own ground against anything simply as a great piece of modern music. It's a score that can easily bring tears to your eyes, but it still transcends the movie rather than blatantly forcing fake emotions onto you.The acting is great and i've never felt cheated by those short appearances of Travolta and Clooney. Travolta, as always, is really into his character and has a tense chemistry with Nolte. Clooney, well... in my world, this movie is only 125 min long, so i never get to see him anyways. Nick Nolte is indescribably awesome as Col Tall. Way over the top, but in a believable way, and every time he's on screen, the movie is just so damn gripping. So there you have another Oscar TTRL should have won but interestingly, Nolte had another nomination going that year (which didn't make it either).Now, it's said that this movie came down from a first 9 hours cut to a 6 hours version and finally reached the 3 hours mark for theatrical release. Well, i wish they would've taken it one step further and shed away everything that comes after the storming of the Japanese camp. Maybe after Staros is relieved of command and flies off. That would've been a perfect point to end this movie...Regarding comparisons with Saving Private Ryan These two are completely different kinds of movies, so comparing them is just as pointless as arguing whether Bruce Lee would kick Chuck Norris's ass or the other way around. I think that in 2012, SPR looks a bit outdated while TTRL continues to be a very appealing movie with timeless, beautiful and transcending cinematography and music. One that can and, if you allow, WILL make you contemplate about human nature, love, life and war on a level way above the usual cheap morality play.

I think most people would agree it is pretty hard to make a bad Christmas movie. As long as you put all the pieces in place and make people feel good and display some sort of magic of Christmas concept, you're pretty much golden. Then factor in the Ephron sisters having written this adaptation, Nora Ephron directing and an ensemble casts of various comedians and Hollywood talent all led by the amazing Steve Martin. It reads like a zany madcap holiday adventure not unlike National Lampoon's classic Christmas vacation. The problem is that this is where it all falls apart. It is simply missing something, an x-factor that leaves you feeling unfulfilled and really not having as much fun as you should be having. I think part of the problem is that it simply tries too hard. There is so much going on and it tries to incorporate all of these loud boisterous characters that you get overwhelmed. It perhaps feels more, at times, like a TV pilot to a crazy sitcom than a holiday movie.I love Steve Martin, especially his early work. He is a legendary comedian for a reason. He tries very hard to lead this cast and he does well playing the no-nonsense and almost uppity leader of the hot-line. He even gets a chance, albeit in very small doses, to show off that legendary physical comedy that I love. But he doesn't really get to shine and somehow seems stuck. Madeline Kahn is good but very stereotypical as the shrill and very uppity Mrs. Munchnik. I enjoy her but she doesn't really get a lot of character development to make her character go anywhere. Juliette Lewis and Anthony LaPaglia are lovers stuck in a perpetual battle against each other. Their banter is good and I think I would have preferred to watch more of them than everyone else. Both are very good in their roles. Liev Schreiber probably steals the show as cross-dresser Chris. He is the one character that really stands out and has some great scenes and is such a quirky and fun character that you can't help but like him. Rita Wilson is Catherine, a dreamer who is in love with Steve Martin's character. Wilson is fun and has some great charisma on screen and her and Martin are good together but like Martin, her character is left unexplored and without enough depth. You will spot a lot of very familiar faces in the supporting cast including a young Adam Sandler being the same Adam Sandler he has always been, complete with that stupid voice that has never been funny. Rob Reiner in a small cameo role that doesn't really stand out but he's always fun to see and Robert Klein in an even smaller cameo role.I think Mixed Nuts just simply has way too much going on. I think the Ephron sisters were a little ambitious and tried to cram too many ideas into one small story. They could have focused more closely on the key characters and maybe cut out some of the more chaotic scenes and Mixed Nuts would have felt more balanced. I mean, Nora Ephron knows comedy and romance and even drama and they just felt like a half hearted attempt all around. It wasn't completely un-enjoyable. It did have its moments and has some genuinely fun scenes but I honestly didn't even find myself laughing at much of it and this is the type of movie that should have you in stitches.

But there is only one individual in film history that is actually not afraid of them. This individual is Herbert West. I wouldn't say he loves zombies but he's definitely not scared of dealing with them. West is a scientist who has broken the barrier on how to keep people from dying.

And this all happens when Herbert West is transferred to Dan Cain's college. There, West convinces Cain to help him in his studies. Not much else needs to be said, it's a domino effect from here.To many fans, this movie is a dark comedy. Even though I enjoyed it, I found it more bizarre than funny. There were a few moments where I did laugh, either because of Jeffrey Combs' ability to give his cracked character a dry sense of humor (now and then), or, just how clumsy the zombies were. Speaking of which, these zombies are not your standard zombie. No, this is not the tear your flesh off your skin down to the bone zombie. The zombies depicted here are just plain angry. Almost like they didn't want to be re-animated and they were mad at West for doing so.Special effects are actually fairly decent here for 1985. There's not a lot of blood but enough to satisfy. If you're a fan that likes crazy nude scenes, you'll especially like this one. Like I said before, this film is just strange. As for music goes, Richard Band created the score.

It has the credentials, including Best Picture. But it also is filled with secondary actors to support the dubious leading man, Charlton Heston (who gives one of the performances of his life, for sure, and has openly credited the director for that).The director is none other than the consummate professional, the ever-versatile and polished William Wyler. And he takes a huge story with grandiose necessities and makes it really watchable. And epic. And with cinematographer Robert Surtees (look at that man's film list!) it's certainly an exquisitely beautiful movie, and very very widescreen, shot with double sized 65mm film, the IMAX of its day.The story is of a Jewish man named Ben Hur who survives persecution from the Romans, including his boyhood friend, and becomes a master chariot driver and a believer in the peaceful ways of his contemporary, and upstart Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, the movie is supposedly about Prince Hur but in fact it's all aimed at illuminated Christ, always indirectly, but in the end with surprising power. We only see Jesus from behind, or from a distance, or in small part (his hand is shown nailed to the cross, for example), yet we feel his aura in the few scenes where his is present. His affect on Hur in their brief encounter is touching and pointed.We need to see that Hur himself is a kind of Christ figure, but a flawed one, a secondary man by comparison (which elevated the primary one further). Hur says early on that he rejects violence, which was not an especially contemporary attitude, especially as the Romans are occupying his home town. He then goes on to show mercy to the very people who want to abuse and kill him (that is, he turns the other cheek). He wins in the end not by killing, but by setting a good example, by being deeply good in the face of unfair hardship. It isn't clear he is a believer in particular, other than his deep rooted faith in his people, the Jews.Context matters here, just a decade or so after the defeat of the Nazis. The Romans are presented as the evil colonizing empire, greeting each other by raising their arms in what I grew up calling the Nazi salute. Their colors and even their symbolism (a big eagle) are Nazi echoes. And the victims of the Nazis and the Romans equally are the Jews. Take this an important step further, and we see that there is a not-so-subtle subtext that the contemporary inhabitants of this area, recently named Israel, belong there. Hur even reminds his Roman friend to remember that the Jews lived there before the Romans ever came along.The movie works best as a story of power, of virtue, of Christian morality, of individual triumph. It also works as a visual and visceral epic. Scene after scene is stunning to just look at, and I'm sure in a big theater (remember going to movies in a full sized theater?) it was a true spectacle movie. We forget how important the venue is in getting the movie in spatial, visual terms (that's one reason Westerns survived so well into the 1950s and are not thriving now).The themes of love, romantic as well as family love, are important here but are thin, filled with empty clichés and total lack of chemistry (perhaps on purpose for a movie with religious intentions). The writing is solid but lacks magic. The editing might be faulted for being a bit indulgent at times, letting scenes roll for their pageantry when we might rather get moving. And ultimately the acting is often more functional than inspired. In a way I respect Heston for pulling off a role burdened with stiff archetypes of the wise hero. Many of the actors are doing their level best with a script that has a message, and you can't quite get the drama directly when the message is itching to be heard, too. Some of the acting is actually a hair lame (Cathy O'Donnell, who I adore in other movies like They Live by Night, is really awful once you notice her, which is really a casting problem more than anything).So I resort to nitpicking because somehow as wonderful and impressive as it all was and is, I wasn't swept away. It's not a completely gripping and moving film.Yes, there are ways of approaching this weighty classic other than saying its a dated religious picture or that it's a profound late-Golden Age masterpiece.

Nash, a Nobel Prize winner, is an eminent mathematician with (in the words of a colleague) a beautiful mind. Unfortunately, it's also a sick mind. Although he manages to function normally these days, without the aid of medication, Nash is still a schizophrenic (who has an adult son who suffers from the same disease).As moviegoers know, Ron Howard directed the movie version of the book, starring Russell Crowe. While the film does a fine job of introducing audiences to the ins and outs of schizophrenia and the difficulties that caregivers experience while trying to assist someone afflicted with the disease, it shows only the tip of the iceberg. Anyone wanting to know more about what schizophrenia entails should read Nasar's book. It is gripping and reveals the agonies of a schizophrenic life. Thoroughly researched and effectively presented in a cohesive narrative which fully engages the attention of readers, this biography shows how Nash fell prey to the disease and how his family-first his mother and sister, and later his wife-sought to have him treated and provided with the best medical care then available.

Forget about the fact that it revived the careers of many actors including John Travolta and a Post-Hudson Hawk Bruce Willis or it's notable impact on today's cinema (Catch .44 is one of the numerous failed attempts of catching the magic). Tarantino found a way to not only keep us intrigued for a solid two and a half hours (something not a lot of directors can do these days). But he did it the same way Seinfeld did for almost 10 years (with a lot more balls too, anyway.) He made you care about Vincent Vega, The Wallace's, Jules Winfield and the many supporting characters who have literally made careers for people (Eric Stoltz Exhibit A) that in real life would be scorn and condemned.

For example, Thérèse is an interesting character because of her abnormal intelligence, and when the narrator announces she's been raped it's a shocking, disheartening moment (even though we don't actually see that rape). There's also some humour in Danielle announcing she wants a baby but also having a lack of interest in a husband, and in how her own mother arranges for her to get laid.

Thrilling and rousing film is set about two years after the events of Guns of Navarone , in which a valiant and skilled trio , Harrison Ford-Robert Shaw-Edward Fox , is dispatched to a dangerous mission during World War II in Yugoslavia . This powerful , dramatic story from the Alistair McLean novel starts when the commanding staff assigns a mission to several oddly assorted military experts as Mallory , now been promoted to the rank of Major (played by Robert Shaw in this sequel and was his last film completed , he was called Captain Jack Mallory ; in the original was played there by Gregory Peck) and Miller, who has now been promoted to the rank of Sergeant (played by Edward Fox who replaced Ian Bannen ,here was called Corporal Dusty Miller , in the original performed by David Niven) . They are teamed to discover a traitor and destroy a bridge vital to enemy strategy . The outfit must destroy a huge dam and a bridge that threaten the Allied . To do so , they must sneak throughout the Nazis' noses disguised as German soldiers.It is one of the most thrilling and moving films set on the years of the Second World War . This interesting wartime picture contains high-powered action-packed , shootouts , explosions , floods , mass slaughter and lots of fun . Fairly decent acting by the star-studded , a traditional all-cast , this Box office hit is a funny , exciting WWII actioner . Common production personnel who worked on or were credited for both this movie sequel and the original The Guns of Navarone included novelist Alistair MacLean , producer-scriptwriter Carl Foreman, production designer Geoffrey Drake, editor Raymond Poulton and production supervisor \/ production accountant Sidney G.

The picture is well set in Yugoslavia and results to be a great super-production with all-star-cast , impressive scenes , shimmer photography and a vibrant sound , the time has increased its value ; despite its releasing was panned by critics . The acting of the interesting characters is believable and convincing , furthermore and enjoyable support cast as Carl Weathers , Franco Nero , Alan Badel , Michael Byrne and it's one of three movies, all made during the mid-late 1970s, that actress Barbara Bach and actor Richard Kiel both appeared , it includes The humanoid , Spy who loved me and Force 10 . Director Guy Hamilton uses a clip from his earlier film Battle of England when the Messerschmitt attacks the Lancaster bomber and the so-called German Panzer tanks shown at the end of the movie are actually Soviet T-34s - a medium tank produced from 1940 to 1958 . The screenplay has eloquent dialogue , humor , double-crosses , continuous tension and surprising twists that keep the viewer's attention . Sweeping wartime movie epic from the director of 'James Bond's Goldfinger' presents the historic events of hokey manner but it does so fascinatingly . All in all,it's a successful piece of warlike fluff. Although overlong ,has good battle footage , solid acting , breathtaking scenes which help offset a sometimes far-fetched plot, but suffers on television , as the small screen damages its really spectacular images. The soundtrack by French composer Maurice Jarre , Jean Michel Jarre's father , is full of vibrant sound , brings a solemn score, cutting edge, played by an orchestra of wind . Colorful cinematography in glimmer color by Christopher Challis , being filmed on location in Jersey, Channel Islands , Mediterranean Film Studios, Malta , (studio), Montenegro , Plymouth Docks, Plymouth, Devon, England,Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, UK .

As for Bad Taste, this movie was made for less than 30,000 USD - but it took years to complete it. The plot is peculiar and main characters is uncommon mixture of zombies and aliens. The ending is witty and distinctive - and all this is years before when Tarantino or Rodriguez began their famous mishmashes.The cast is totally amateur - Jackson's friends and acquaintances - but in a good sense, giving an interesting purity and fun.

Jody is followed by his teenage brother Mike (Michael Baldwin), who has just lost his parents and is afraid of losing his big brother that intends to travel.Mike snoops around the cemetery and sees the mortician known as The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) carrying Tommy's coffin alone without any help. Mike breaks in the mortuary to investigate the mystery and discovers weird dwarf creatures with yellow blood and dangerous flying spheres that protect the location. When he is chased by The Tall Man, he cuts his finger and brings it home to show Jody to convince his big brother that there is a dark secret in the mortuary. Jody, Reggie and Mike discover that The Tall Man is from outer space and is transforming dead bodies in dwarfs to work as slave in his world. Now they decide that The Tall Man must be destroyed. Will they succeed in their intent?Phantasm is one of the most weird and original cult movies that I have ever seen. The surrealistic and dreamlike story entwines horror with sci-fi with many twists and bizarre characters and situations. I saw Phantasm for the first time on VHS in the early 80's and I have just seen it again on DVD and surprisingly the film has not aged, only the clothing, the hair style and the special effects. But for fans like me, it is still attractive and entertaining.
