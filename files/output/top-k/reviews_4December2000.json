This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it is.  It is very high on filmmaking `coolness' and the action is intense and impressive.  However, it suffers from excessive form and very little substance.The science in this so-called science fiction story is laughable.  If we are to accept the premise presented here, suddenly, over a period of about 50 years, man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants.  There is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations; it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution.  Well, evolution doesn't work that way, not even close.  Major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species.  So the concept is really more fantasy than science fiction.`Lighten up', you say.  `Who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway?  It is just an awesome movie!'  That's a good point.  However, even fantasy films need a plot.  `X-Men' trots out the same tired storyline; good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on.  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the story.The film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants.  However, the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not vice-versa as depicted here.  Feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them.  They have the power.  How much sympathy can we have for them?At the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned e-mail, I have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was.  This film was all sizzle and no steak.  There was only one character with a shred of substance and that was Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  The rest were just cardboard cutouts.In 1995, at the age of 29, wunderkind director Bryan Singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called `The Usual Suspects'.  He then burst into flames with `Apt Pupil', a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly Nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the U.S.  After that disaster, he went underground until `X-Men'.  This film showed that Singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick, but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of `Suspects'.  That film showed that he has a certain directorial genius, but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative, but shallow projects like this.The acting; well, there wasn't much acting to be done.  Anna Pacquin and Hugh Jackman had the only parts that weren't utterly superficial.  Both of them did a good job, actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor, and she said all six of her lines like a true professional.I'm being overly hard on the film.  It wasn't bad.  It was very enjoyable.  It just didn't deserve the raves that were doted on it.  I rated it a 7\/10 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences.  These areas were an easy 10\/10.  The screenplay was about a 3\/10.  It's definitely worth seeing, but leave your brain at the door.

The casting really caught my eye, especially Michael Caine as Wilbur Larch (I originally pictured Richard Harris in the role, for some reason), and Charlize Theron as Candy.  I have a lot of respect for Ms. Theron as an actress, and she's very easy on the eyes.It also helped that John Irving himself wrote the screenplay ... and took a LOT of time (ten years) to do so.

To present the core of a story that massive within a two-hour block of time, without losing any major elements of the story, was quite a challenge.Well, Mr. Irving was up to the challenge, and the movie was wonderful.  The actors were convincing, the dialogue was good, the pacing of the story was very good.  I was surprised at some of the changes, certain elements that had been left out, situations that the characters reacted to differently on screen than they had in the novel.

I think that Mr. Irving does have a very strong opinion about abortion, and he does express it within the story, but there's a deeper message to it; that people have to make moral and ethical judgements about laws, and decide for themselves which ones are worth following and which ones are better off ignored or only followed for the sake of appearances.Dr. Larch has decided that, since women will seek out abortions whether they are legal or not, he will perform an abortion on whoever asks, in a time when abortion was completely illegal; this is better than the potentially fatal alternatives, which are spelled out in graphic detail in the novel, and mentioned several times in the movie.So, he's risking his medical licensure, his job, and his freedom in order to provide a service in a way that will save the lives of women who might otherwise be severely injured or die.Regardless of your personal views of this hot-button issue, you have to respect the character of Dr. Larch for continuously risking so much to do something, just because he feels that it's the right thing to do.

When I go watching a Disney-movie with my girlfriend I expect light, humorous entertainment. I enjoyed, Hercules, Tarzan, and Mulan, along with the others on video. I expected a similarly pleasing experience with Dinosaur. I was surprised by the seriousness of the movie. The visuals were amazing. Impressive camera angles, nice pans and a soundtrack that I found very good - but that's a matter of taste, I guess.

Being John Malkovich is breathtakingly original, wonderfully warped and it sustains its demented tone all the way through, rather than casting it aside at some convenient point to focus on another lame good vs. evil showdown. (As so many other initially intriguing films do, with a good example being Dark City.)The cast here is superb, especially John Cusack's lonely, lovestruck puppeteer and Catherine Keener's emotionally unavailable, ruthlessly unreachable object of seemingly everyone's desire.  (The movie really belongs to her; she's created one of the most fascinatingly inscrutable characters that I can recall.) And what wacky, refreshingly blunt dialogue. It has a cartoonish feel to it, like their words are frying pans to conk each other on the head with. From Keener's I am dubious when Cusack corners her for a date, to her Craig! I don't find you attractive! when he, and his wife, both attempt to seduce her at the same time. Or Cusack's wife (Cameron Diaz) brutally telling him Don't crowd me, Craig, or Charlie Sheen, in a funny cameo as himself, explaining to a distraught Malkovich that The truth is for suckers. Or a lukewarm fan telling Malkovich You were really great in that movie where you played the retard. And finally, in one of the funniest lines I can remember, Malkovich, after his reality has been severely tampered with, screaming at some guy in a bar I am not John Malkovich! then attacking him.The movie careens off in all sorts of unanticipated directions, while always remaining faithful to character and premise. It explores notions of identity, celebrity, mortality and finality in a very unique way. But at its core it's really about the pain of loneliness and the inability to connect.

Plenty of chemistry between not only the actors, but within all the main ingredients to bake a well worth ticket purchase. If you take it all a bit tongue in cheek, then I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride this film gives. Strong soundtrack that is used very well and the final edit with just the right pinch. Cameron just lit the screen up with that sunshiny smile of hers and that wonderfully wacky shtick she so innocently delivers. Yet the strongest performances came from a man of two and one that uttered not a word. Sam Rockwell, (Galaxy Quest) and Crispen Glover, (McFly of Back to the Future). I was excited to see how comic booky and sinister Crispen poured from this character. And Director McG caught the true essence he portrayed. Sam got a juicy opportunity to play the semi shy computer geek that turns to stud muffin psycho dude. And what a performance he gave. Spitting food on Drew was such a nice additive. Helped to give that character a bit more bite, as well as when he twirled that gun like a majorette on New Year's Day.For a film that didn't even have a finished script by first shot and was handled by no less then seven (count em) seven writers, (or is it eleven...)I'd say it was put together quite well. Expect a second installment, but don't think for an instant it'll come cheap! Guestamating...13mill for Diaz, 5 for Lucy Lui, probably 9mill for Drew plus some additional producer kick back. Oh, and I'm sure Murray will want his penny shined quite brightly. More then deserved I'm sure.

Most of the humor is centered on Nick Cage being out his environment, being thrust into an unfamiliar situation and having to take on the duties of a parent.

Most of the humor is centered on Nick Cage being out his environment, being thrust into an unfamiliar situation and having to take on the duties of a parent. That's where Hollywood's research on target audiences comes into play; this film is aimed at women who are mothers and the husbands they drag along to the theaters. The women get to see Nick Cage, often without a shirt on, and the men get Tea Leoni (sorry guys, no nudity).My big problem with this movie is that it feels like it has to explain every little detail, as if the audience was too stupid to figure things out on their own; putting two and two together and such. The last half hour was also far too long and drawn out.Yeah, there were some problems with The Family Man, but it was still better than 90% of the other movies that came out this year. But that isn't saying much.

Has he EVER been sick? This thriller\/suspence\/Drama, is very well acted on all counts, especially by Jackson as always a fine fine performance. Willis is very good, as he was in Shyamalan's The Sixth Sence. Very well written, also like in T6S it too has a suprise ending. One which will BLOW you away!!!!! But cant tell you it. You have to see it for yourself. But it's well worth it.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2000","score":"","review":"  At the very start of the movie we see that Willis' character David Dunn, does not have a very happy marriage as he flirts with an attractive young woman on a train, who later turns out to be married, and is among the 171 to die in a train wreck, which leaves Willis alive and unharmed.When he is contacted by Elija Price (Jackson) who has a serious disorder which leaves his bones so brittle they break like glass, where he gets the nickname Mr Glass as a 13 year old, Dunn realises something about himself.
