The film, Roger Moore's first performance in the signature role, has James Bond investigating the mysterious deaths of three MI6 agents that appear linked to Kananga, a diplomat from the island nation of San Monique. The film is unique in that it is the only 007 film to include elements of the occult and supernatural. Oddly enough, though there are a lot of aspects of this movie that I love, I still find it hard to claim it as one of the best of the series.Let me start by saying that I thought Roger Moore was a great choice to replace Sean Connery. At this point, I've seen nearly all of the 007 films and I thought Moore, while he did put his own spin on the character, was a fine replacement. Moore was able to add a bit more humor to the role and I thought it was a welcome addition. As a whole, this movie has a great cast and some of my favorite characters from the Bond canon. Jane Seymour did a fine job as Solitaire; her performance was nothing extraordinary (though it WAS one of her first leading roles...give the girl a break) but she was easily one of the most beautiful, if not THE most beautiful, women to ever pair with James Bond. In this film, my favorite performances came from the villains. Yaphet Kotto does a great job as Kananga, making him appear dangerous without ever going over-the-top or campy, and Julius Harris as Tee Hee (the henchman with the mechanical hook-arm) was a real highlight. I'm not sure why, but Tee Hee's scene introducing Bond to the crocodile farm is one of my favorite moments from the movie. Despite his role as a villain and desire to off the hero, the dude's got a natural charisma. For me, though, the best character in the film had to be that of Baron Samedi (a fantastic job by Geoffrey Holder), the voodoo god of cemeteries and closest Bond's ever come to encountering something supernatural. I WISH he had been given a larger role in the film; it's a shame the filmmakers weren't able to work the character into a future storyline.On the flip side of the character choices, I really think the film could've done without Sheriff J.W. Pepper. The character, a mildly amusing performance from Clifton James, feels completely out of place and tacked on for whatever reason. Aside from the lame choice of comic relief, the film did have one other major flaw for me...there were a lot of points where it felt as if the whole thing slowed to a near stop. 007's main visit to San Monique drags on a bit once he joins with Solitaire and the boat chase seriously could've been cut in half and still had the same effect. While I was impressed by some of the stunts in the sequence, I think nearly 10 minutes is a bit of overkill for a boat chase. Otherwise, it was a fun film with some great scenes (i.e. the crocodile farm or Bond's visit to Harlem). Sure, the special effects are very much dated and some spots are downright awful by modern standards (i.e. Kananga's last moments) but it isn't enough to detract from the film. Regardless, this movie is easily a must-watch for any 007 fan, as it contains some great characters and it proves that Moore had what it took to become the new Bond.

I have not read the novel, but the film is extremely powerful and stands, to this day, as one of the best motion pictures of all time. Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director and, with a capable cast and some Beethoven tunes, he effectively turns A Clockwork Orange into a timeless work of art. The film is not watered down, nor is it for everyone. For those who can appreciate it, though, A Clockwork Orange is a true masterpiece that does not disappoint.Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) is a young man intent on getting his way. In the undated future of England, he and his three droogs &#150; one of the many strange words he uses; this one referring to friends or cohorts &#150; go out at night and terrorize to get what they need. The boys are content with drinking drugged milk at the Korova Milk Bar, beating up hobos, and raping innocent women in their own homes. They lie, cheat, and steal to get what they need. And they don't feel badly about it. Unfortunately for Alex, our humble narrator and lover of classical music, he's in for a little change. After being set up by his fed up buds, he is arrested for murder, sentenced to fourteen years, and he's scheming all the while to get out of it. When he hears of an experimental treatment that guarantees to cure him of his violent tendencies and secure him as a free citizen, he jumps at the chance. However, things do not go exactly as planned.Malcolm McDowell &#150; who is extremely underrated &#150; provides an extraordinary performance as Alex. He is hilarious, terrifying, and pitiful at the same time. This could not have been an easy character to portray. Alex is a delinquent a murdering, thieving, violent rapist. However, McDowell's performance makes him extremely likable. In the end, it's so easy to root for Alex. It would have been easy to make the character detestable, but the way in which the film develops and the way he is portrayed, Alex is our hero and friend.As disturbing as the film is said to be, it is that much more hilarious. I was not expecting to laugh out loud at such things as I found myself laughing at. This is essentially a black comedy more than a drama. A Clockwork Orange makes many points regarding society and government, but it does so in a way that is completely satirical. Most of the laughs come from Alex's narration and the utter ridiculousness of some scenes. In one scene, Alex attacks a woman with what looks like a ceramic penis. There is also a scene in which, while reading the Bible, Alex imagines himself in certain Biblical scenes. This includes the boy being fed grapes by topless girls that he refers to as his wife's handmaidens. There are sex scenes at double speed, rape scenes set to songs such as 'Singin' in the Rain', etc. It is stylishly violent, bitingly satirical, and nothing short of entertaining throughout its entirety.The film raises many questions regarding the infringement of rights. Is it moral to dehumanize a person by ridding them of violent tendencies? Is reforming criminals, cleaning up the prisons, and making the streets safer really worth tampering with a person's free choice by forcing them to change themselves and their beliefs? Is this a right that the government has? Is what's best for society necessarily the best thing for the individual? These are all questions which the audience may draw their own answers. Although no such treatment exists today, it is easy to see that the film may not be far off from the direction society is moving toward. Alex was a despicable human being, but didn't he have the freedom to be that?

To have a good heart and a kind spirit is a rare engine to drive a man. But such things happen in this cruel and cynical world of ours. It is us or them. Jonathan Pryce plays this good man in this cruel world. A man who allows himself to dream of something else, a dream of being set free. Simple right? A natural need, but the question is the means to reach the goals of ones dreams. And a question of what makes a man content and happy of his moral standings in those matters. Sam Lowry never reaches his goal, not without significant sacrifices, his mind and his life. Good people are like islands some continue to prevail others sink, Archibald 'Harry' Tuttle prevails and finds happiness i helping others that is why he sinks, right. That is Terrys meaning of life in this movie, in my opinion that is. All Brazil the world needs is love, and love is the poison in which dreams are cast like this one. David.

In short, it's nothing special or different than any other horror film out there. A group of teenagers head to camp, the majority end up murdered, the remaining person finds the villain, fights with villain, villain gets killed. However, this was actually quite entertaining, but for the wrong reasons.Firstly, the negatives, Mrs. Voorhees has to be one of the worst scary villains ever in a film. I think this is down to both the writing by Victor Miller and the performance by Betsy Palmer as a whole. The mama scenes being particularly bad.The action sequences in the film were also quite bad with a lot of the scenes being hugely under-acted. After Alice beheads Voorhees, she almost calmly walks away from the decapitated head still lying on the floor. And one of the girls throws a box to try and keep somebody away at one point.I think keeping the first half of the movie mostly action free and getting to know the characters and seem them naturally worked well for the film though personally I don't think it really made me care for the character's death scenes as much as it should have done. But I do think a lot of the actual death scenes were quite memorable and well carried out.The ending I also thought carried a nice twist though I think the movie should have ended straight after Alice wakes in the hospital bed screaming and a lot of the dialogue used in that scene cut.Overall, a good film if you're looking to be entertained while killing some time, though I wouldn't recommend it as a must see.

One of these teens is played by Judd Nelson. If you've gotten through those first two sentences without barfing, you might get a kick out of The Breakfast Club. It's not a bad movie, despite the absence of plot and presence of Nelson. However, it's trying to be a portrait of a generation, and it fails miserably. If you want to know what high school was like for most of us in the 80s, try Fast Times at Ridgemont High or Heathers. But if you want to know what high school was like for .02% of the American teenaged population, i.e. those who attended high school in a North Shore suburb of Chicago, then Breakfast Club is practically a documentary. Having dated (and married) a succession of women from this area, I can assure you that the students at New Trier, Glenbrook North, etc etc were just like Andy, Brian, Claire, etc etc -- self-absorbed, status-conscious and (back then at least) whiter than Arm & Hammer baking soda.For an iconic 80s movie, it sure has a stereotypical 60s perspective -- kids good, adults bad. There's also a trace of 70s smarm inasmuch as this movie posits that everything will be fine if you get stoned and talk about your problems. Whatever -- no one ever accused John Hughes of having great depth or insight, he's just a hack who turned his case of arrested development into a string of highly profitable schmaltz-fests. But in the mid-1980s there was so little of importance happening in popular culture that Hughes was heralded as some kind of artist. Furthermore, his young actors were proclaimed The Stars Of Tomorrow. They weren't. That's actually kind of a shame in the case of Molly Ringwald, who is genuinely attractive and talented but has been a punch line since 1988 after playing the same whiny brat in, like, 300 movies. In Breakfast Club, she portrays the whiniest brat of them all Claire, the Princess character. Claire is pretty, popular and stuck up, but as you can probably guess, her polished facade masks almost unbearable pain, and she's more than willing to tell you about it. (Sad to say, I knew people in the 80s who said they could identify with Claire. Sadder to say, most of them were guys.) Anthony Michael Hall was never going to do Hamlet, but at this point in his non-career he showed some comic ability and as Brian, the Nerd character, he gets more mileage out of his terminally dumbfounded facial expression than he ever would again. Emilio Estevez probably wouldn't have risen above community theater without his family connections, but at least he's a better actor than his brother Charlie (faint praise, of course) and he seems to grasp the intended complexity of Andy, the Jock character, even if he can't convey any of it. Ally Sheedy isn't bad as Allison, the Crazy character, but she's probably there because Jennifer Jason Leigh wanted too much money and Winona Ryder was too young. (It should also be noted that if Breakfast Club was set in 1995, Winona would have played Allison as a Goth, been the heroine of the picture and walked off with an Oscar, bad joke intended.) As for Judd Nelson as Bender the burnout, well . . . someone should have told him that angry does not always mean yelling, intense does not mean creepy unblinking bug-eyed stare, and chewing the scenery is a metaphor for overacting, not a way to prepare for a role. (Seriously, he waddles on screen in his first scene like he's just swallowed the entire set of Risky Business. Maybe he did. Has anyone seen that Porsche?) Still, every young man who dreams of a career on the silver screen should be made to watch Nelson's performance in Breakfast Club. It's the thespian version of Scared Straight.

Rocky has the feel of a real person with a real, three dimensional life by now, but he's come a long way from the Rocky we knew in the first two movies. Most notably, he's RICH now. He has a genuine career going in full swing in boxing by now, and the first part of the movie is a montage of event fights, all of which he wins soundly and comfortably. He is a tremendous champion with 10 successful title defense fights and a whole list of corporate sponsors. Not surprisingly, he begins to feel overconfident and a little lazy.There is some ham-handed foreshadowing as we see clips of a concerned Mr. T in the audience at Rocky's fights, and it's not long before Clubber Lang (Mr. T) begins publicly insulting Rocky, challenging him to a fight and taunting him at press conferences. I'm curious about where Lang's anger comes from. He is clearly furious with Rocky, but we know nothing about him. We don't know anything about his past as a fighter other than what is passed on through dialogue, and the unsolved mystery surrounding his uncontrollable rage is probably the movie's only genuine fault.The important thing that we are told is that Lang is not a boxer, like Rocky, but a wrestler, so it's a completely different, ah, ball game this time. There is an interesting fight that Rocky has midway through the movie with a hulking giant (Hulk Hogan) curiously named Thunderlips, in an illustration of what had become of his career. He had reached such a level of success that his fights became little more than performances put on to generate ticket sales, but Rocky's humanitarianism shows through, as he sometimes donates all proceeds, as in the case of the fight with Thunderlips, to various charities.But as always, Rocky maintains his laid back demeanor, letting the insults and taunts roll off his back, which is one of the qualities that has really allowed him to win so many hearts. But at an outdoor press conference, Lang taunts Rocky's wife, and he gets genuinely angry for the first time in the first three movies, other than the sudden tantrum he had in the first film when Mickey first asked to be his manager. After this, everything starts to fall apart. It turns out that his championship is not what he thought it was, and he is put into a position where he has to defend his wife's honor as well as his own, and to do that he has to fight a fighter that no one, including himself, really believes he can beat. True to his form, Mickey tells him, This guy'll kill you to death inside of three rounds!And there is no mistake to be made about that. Lang is absolutely a KILLER. This guy has no interest in getting a knockout, he doesn't even seem that interested in being recognized as the real champion, he just wants to hurt Rocky. Essentially Lang's role in the movie is to knock Rocky out of the rut of complacency that he has gotten into. Thunderlips was billed as nearly 7 feet tall and 390 pounds, which I think it roughly twice Rocky's size, and is clearly a wrestler and not a fighter, and yet Rocky was able to win a fight with him, so it's no surprise that he assumed the fight with Lang would be about the same.When they finally fight, Lang walks all over him, and Rocky realizes that he has gotten soft. Apollo Creed, by the way, is now a sportscaster, and becomes Rocky's trainer when they learn how tough Lang really is. The movie loses track a little when Apollo starts training Rocky like he's never been in a gym before, like he's a complete amateur. Yeah, he hasn't been losing much lately, but does that mean he hasn't set foot inside a gym in all those years? Doubtful, but nevertheless, it's great to see Rocky whipping himself back into shape and once again becoming that hardened hero that we have come to love. Although I have to admit, I loved the swimming scene. Rocky swims like my grandmother!There is one moment of almost unforgivable cheese when Rocky and Mickey have a heart to heart on the beach at sunset in which, for example, Rocky claims that he's really afraid for the first time in his life.

There is notably more anger in part three than either of the previous movies, and while a second sequel runs a high likelihood of being the one that marks the first really noticeable turn downwards in the quality of the series (hear that, Terminator?), this one is no less watchable than the first two and, amazingly, neither is part 4.

One of the highest-profile mainstream X-Rated films of its day in the UK, its explicit sexual and violence scenes still cut close to the bone today and yet never distract from the narrative as Caine's Jack Carter ensures there's a hot time in the old town tonight, as the old song has it. Caine is great in the title role, bulked up in his black raincoat, toting, (but never shooting) the rifle which forms the iconic movie-poster, oozing menace and magnetism in equal proportion, this mix serving to intimidate his pursuers and charm the various women he has on a string in the movie. Of the support, I felt Ian Hendry as his nemesis could perhaps have been showcased to be a bigger villain than the cowardly reprobate who Carter finally collars. John Osborne, the famous Look Back In Anger playwright no less, is better as the sleazy, never-bettered Mr Big who gets his own revenge right at the death for Carter's tipping off the police to bust him at his mansion. The acting by the women in the cast is equally sharp and sensitive by turns, although everyone will forever remember most Britt Ekland's brief phone-sex scene with Caine in front of his sex-starved land-lady (guess where she ends up soon afterwards?!). The remainder of the all-British cast offer solid support down to the smallest part.

The settings are great, cheap bed and breakfasts, sleazy bars, ugly car parks and of course the final scenes played out at the quarry by the beach. Was it right that Caine was killed off in the last reel, thus fulfilling the film's title? For me it works, not only the surprise element itself but also on the premise of just desserts.

It seems that the Soviet Union has finally officially entered the world of professional wrestling, entering a contestant in the form of Ivan Drago, a stolid mass of scientifically trained punching machinery, played with effective stoniness by Dolph Lundgren.Creed and Rocky are undeniable boxing rock stars by now, as is unquestionably illustrated when we see that Creed learns about the arrival of the scary Russian one lazy afternoon when he's watching TV from his POOL. I didn't know people watched TV in their backyards during the day while lounging in their pool. Isn't the screen a little difficult to see with the sunlight?No matter, because soon we learn that Drago can throw punches that deliver the intricately measured force of 2150 pounds per square INCH. It's interesting that this installment in the Rocky series has made the effort to actually measure and describe the force of the punches landing on our hero's head, but I calculate that the man's fists, with gloves, are roughly six square inches at the impact zone. Now, if my calculations are correct, at more than a TON per square inch, every single punch would send Rocky or any other human being doing backflips into the audience behind him.The point of all this force, however, is that Drago is a machine, the man is barely human, he's a biological experiment that the Russians have hooked up to innumerable different pieces of equipment and trained to be literally a scientifically flawless fighting machine. Apollo, however, is the one that loses his cool, not Rocky. At a press conference, Apollo loses his temper and berates the Russians in public, himself challenging Drago to a fight. Evidently he hasn't learned anything from the first two movies, because he lets his confidence run away with him, and again puts on an elaborate, ridiculous dance when he enters the arena. Of course, this whole fight is designed to generate anger from Rocky towards the Russian, and to show how little humanity Drago has left in him after all those years of scientifically guided training. They have trained the human being out of him, and someone needs to beat it back in. Notably, this is the first time real revenge has been a motive for Rocky. The fight between Apollo and Drago was supposed to be another spectacle fight, just a show to raise money and attention, but clearly Drago didn't understand that or didn't care. At any rate, Rocky demands a chance to fight Drago, but the Russians insist that the fight has to be in Russia because Drago has received too many death threats. This leads to lots of footage of Rocky training alone in the freezing cold of a Russian winter juxtaposed with images of Drago training in a nice warm lab surrounded by scientists. It's hardly fair!!Adrian, as before, is highly unhappy about the fight. She doesn't want Rocky to fight anymore because she's worried that one of these days he is going to be seriously hurt, and justifiably so. Rocky has taken more than his share of beatings over the years, and a Russian who can deliver the weight of small cars with his fists is not the kind of person I would want to get in the ring with either!Part 4 is the first Rocky movie that had a noticeably and ridiculously cheesy musical montage, cutting in footage from the older movies and giving me the feeling that they just needed to pad the movie for sufficient running time. I can't think of any movie I've ever seen where a cheesy music video was put in and added anything to the story or made the movie better in any way. And there are two in this movie!At any rate, I appreciated that the Russians assigned Rocky with two escorts who followed him wherever he went. I have been living in Communist China for two years, and trust me, the feeling of being watched never goes away and is never unjustified!The fight itself, however, is definitely one of the most exciting of the series so far. Drago comes on like a machine, he is completely invincible and beats Rocky around the ring like a kid. The crowd, meanwhile, cheers against him. He's totally alone out there in the dead of winter in a foreign country, and it's not hard to feel a little scared for him. But the important thing is that, despite what Drago says, both fighters respect the other's physical perfection. Rocky says that he sees three of Drago out there (Hit the one in the middle!), and Drago tells his trainers that Rocky is like a piece of iron. Mutual respect changes the meaning of a fight like this drastically. It makes it much better. I am curious to know how the movie was received in Russia, because the Russians behind Drago are clearly the villains of the movie, and the story presents them as representations of the Russian government. Te escorts that followed Rocky around are nothing more than spies (the real life ones are not impressive either), and the movie ends with an impressive but preachy speech about the importance of overcoming nationalist differences and people coming together. But preachy or not, the movie is still inspirational even after the Soviet Union has collapsed, even though it has gone much too far, ah, 'over the top' in the exaggeration of reality department.

Our hero faces the greatest threat this time around A family film. Since when was RoboCop anything resembling child-safe? The humor almost invariably(the rocket scientist bit is arguably a notch above the rest) takes such a dive, it goes right through the bottom in a mess of few jokes and gags, and an even smaller amount that anyone could actually find remotely funny. The dark comedy in this comes off as extremely misplaced. They continue the tradition, started by the prior entry, of making fun of what we earlier took seriously. Honestly, there should be severe penalties for the puppy line. The attempts at recreating or mimicking elements of the first get increasingly desperate, and the satire is worse than nonexistent, it's plain *ugly*. Some of what Frank Miller wrote for the sequel before this one that wasn't used in that, made its way into this, utterly devoid of the fun and imagination of how he thought it up, of course(do read that comic book instead of viewing either of these, if you're a fan of his). Evidently, between the previous picture and this, Johnson turned into... well, his name. In fact, all the old characters seem messed up, several are parodies of their old selves, and the new ones aren't that interesting. Credibility is an issue, too. It can be debated how adequate a choice Burke was... he certainly doesn't bring a lot of emotion to the part... but CCH Pounder, Rip Torn and Mako do impressive work. How do you manage to render their efforts forgettable? I suppose this script was what it took. And Stephen Root... for crying out loud, they wasted *Milton*! The flight gear and Otomo... let's just say, I'm with Rod Hilton in regards to those. A cute, spunky kid hacker(and of course, computers can do whatever is convenient for them to do) is one of the leads. Who thought this would be worthwhile?

It is superior to most films that fall in this genre because it manages to stay away from most of the worn-out action clichés, while focusing more on character\/plot development and exposition than the action sequences.Doug Liman and Tony Gilroy have created a fresh action thriller with THE BOURNE IDENTITY; one that will entertain many viewers without feeling stale or overstaying its welcome. The acting is pretty top-notch, with Matt Damon's emotionless and laid-back approach to his character a welcome one in a genre dominated by overacting or poor acting. Chris Cooper and Franka Potente play their supporting roles well, and Potente adds a nice contrast to Damon's Bourne. Clive Owen has a brief cameo that is worth mentioning.So what about the action? Well, there is an obligatory car chase that gets a bit old after the first two or three minutes or so. Frankly, I don't see why these pointless scenes have become a requisite for the genre. This chase adds nothing that viewers haven't seen before, and didn't really have to be that long. The fight sequences are worth watching, and many of them involve some sleek hand-to-hand combat, which are thankfully well-edited and choreographed. But the real selling point is not the action, but the screenplay (as written by Tony Gilroy) which keeps the more intellectual viewers on edge trying to figure out Bourne's identity. The exposition is well-written and doesn't come out of the blue. Again, top marks for writing; something that is usually absent in action thrillers.The editing is crisp and clean, making the movie-going experience worthwhile. I decided to mention this because most action movies have dreadful editing, to the point where the action sequences seem blurry and nauseating. The music in this film is also worth mentioning, as it contains a modern upbeat feel that suits the movie well.A final note about Jason Bourne's past it is worth noting that screenplays that encourage viewers to root for a character with a shady past\/present are usually frowned upon by many 'upstanding citizens'. I bring to mind the recent controversy surrounding the popularity of Showtime's DEXTER series. I was impressed by Gilroy's ability to write the past Bourne as different from the present Bourne due to the amnesia. It should at lest keep these 'concerned' folks quiet.All in all, a great film.

I couldn't tell, but his movies carry the sensation that he's managing every little detail, so he might as well play the lead role. Besides, it's a role that fits him perfectly. The way he always find the right look, his raspy but characteristic voice and the understatement that defines him-even when playing the type of character I described that he portrays perfectly-make his Frank Corvin someone to love. Eastwood sets the mood with a nice color of shooting, taking us to the past. Once a star engineer of the US Air Force, Frank was replaced by a monkey that would travel to outer space when the NASA was created. But Frank had a team, the Team Daedalus, which Bob Gerson (James Cromwell, always great when combining good and bad in an unexpected way) kicked out. Now, as in any classic tale (Eastwood is always, fundamentally, classic), the NASA will request for Frank's knowledge, given that he's the only one who can solve a big problem they have, and he'll bring the whole team back. This team, underestimated by most people because of their old age, includes a womanizer played delightfully by Donald Sutherland, a pastor played by a humble James Garner, and a crazy pilot played by Tommy Lee Jones in a type of role we're not used to see him.It's a great setup, and a setup with knowledge of actors and situations they might generate by Eastwood. He also puts Marcia Gay Harden in the mix, to play the role of a strong woman that only she can pull off. All this established, Space Cowboys is a fun, unpretentious ride where the viewer doesn't know what to expect. In every scene these four 'cowboys' are together, a laugh can come from anywhere; and don't worry, that in this half adventure\/half buddy movie, Clint leaves room for a few dramatic moments and a little bit of adult romance.The performances are key to the success of the film, and you can't try to figure out something else than what the screen shows, because this time the master filmmaker delivers one of his most straightforward stories. Intelligent as he can only be, he gives us a musical selection that includes a modern hit as Space Cowboys, by N'Sync. How about that? But going back to the script&#133;Did Eastwood selected it personally? Is this a movie to show that he is in command? That he likes, as I said, to be the hero who saves the day?I said it before. I couldn't tell, but the role fits him perfectly, and we can't imagine any other man on earth playing it. This is something that many young actors can easily achieve, but a seventy-year old man?

A story where he could be the hero the manipulative, individualist, arrogant know-it-all who will, in the end, save the day. Is Clint Eastwood really like this? I couldn't tell, but his movies carry the sensation that he's managing every little detail, so he might as well play the lead role. Besides, it's a role that fits him perfectly. The way he always find the right look, his raspy but characteristic voice and the understatement that defines him-even when playing the type of character I described that he portrays perfectly-make his Frank Corvin someone to love. Eastwood sets the mood with a nice color of shooting, taking us to the past. Once a star engineer of the US Air Force, Frank was replaced by a monkey that would travel to outer space when the NASA was created. But Frank had a team, the Team Daedalus, which Bob Gerson (James Cromwell, always great when combining good and bad in an unexpected way) kicked out. Now, as in any classic tale (Eastwood is always, fundamentally, classic), the NASA will request for Frank's knowledge, given that he's the only one who can solve a big problem they have, and he'll bring the whole team back. This team, underestimated by most people because of their old age, includes a womanizer played delightfully by Donald Sutherland, a pastor played by a humble James Garner, and a crazy pilot played by Tommy Lee Jones in a type of role we're not used to see him.It's a great setup, and a setup with knowledge of actors and situations they might generate by Eastwood. He also puts Marcia Gay Harden in the mix, to play the role of a strong woman that only she can pull off. All this established, Space Cowboys is a fun, unpretentious ride where the viewer doesn't know what to expect. In every scene these four 'cowboys' are together, a laugh can come from anywhere; and don't worry, that in this half adventure\/half buddy movie, Clint leaves room for a few dramatic moments and a little bit of adult romance.The performances are key to the success of the film, and you can't try to figure out something else than what the screen shows, because this time the master filmmaker delivers one of his most straightforward stories. Intelligent as he can only be, he gives us a musical selection that includes a modern hit as Space Cowboys, by N'Sync. How about that?

Then it gets rough. Joel Schumacher decided to bring the torturous films-within-the-film to the surface.

That's my opinion.Anyway, the point is I, like many, found this an uncomfortable watch when I rather expected to be whiling away an hour and a half in a tick-box flick. To that extent I didn't mind Cage's Tom Welles wearing a very silly wardrobe without irony or rancour. Gandolfini and Stormare are well-cast as despicable underworldlies; Joaquin Phoenix is unmemorable, although one suspects that's because he did a perfectly good routine job.
