And for the sake of spoilers, that is all I can tell you about the story.As far as movie quality, it is spectacular. The movie has extremely well written and well acted characters, with a spectacular cast that fits perfectly into their roles. The dialogue is amazingly well written and it manages to be funny, witty, and non-cliché at the same time. The story is interesting throughout, without a single dull moment (thanks to David Fincher's directing).

Any film directed by him always have a stunning art- direction and marveolus cinematography with adaptive actor\/actress performances. And i would say also he was one of the legendary director that Hollywood ever had.The Wizard of Oz. A hundred percent, no other family-genre film had reach the level of this movie, even a small piece until now. Only one movie that i know which nearly reach the level of this film as a fantasy-genre, it is Pan's Labyrinth.By wide aspect, TWOO have a deep and inspiring storyline. It is enjoyable by any age range and also enjoyable by any generation- time. The art- direction is by far, the no.1 in 1939 since any movie ever made in the past, and it also superb nowadays. Then if we see into detailed aspect, any costume-design, make-up, and set-decoration are undoubtedly extraordinary. This film, set a new standard model for color-movies in 1939. This movie is a predecessor for color-movies after 1939. Victor Fleming genuinely using suitable style direction for color- movies, yet technicolor also beautiful. Fleming means to separate Dorothy's real life with Dorothy's world in Oz, so he using two style of coloring (technicolor and color). These will drive the viewers to feel how the true fantasty-film is. No director ever used that style before Fleming, it was absolutely genius and trend-set.Any act performed by actors\/actresses was incredibly natural. They likely fit with the film itself and had use to live inside the film already. I must tell that to perform in a fantasy-genre needs something that people called it a talent. Actors and actresses need high level of imagination and creativity to perform any role in fantasy-genre. In TWOO, there were no miss act by all role. That was unbelievable.I can's say anymore.

It purely is my level of enjoyment during my experience of watching the movie. As a 23 year old in 2015, with limited experience in watching silent movies, in fact, just this and The Kid so far. It's hard for me to truly appreciate the movie. Unfortunately as time goes by, City Lights (just like all movies this old), will slowly fall down popularity lists like the IMDb Top 250. That is not to take away anything from what is so obviously a masterpiece of it's era. The movies that came before our times will always have their place, and people intrigued enough by our history in general, and the history of cinema, will always give movies like this, time, even if 6 out of 10 does seem like I am dismissing it.During my time watching, I had fun in parts. There were parts where I was bored, tired. This is down to where I am at in the comedy evolution scale. I'm in 2015, I love The Office UK. Me personally, I'm not going to laugh anymore when I see someone hit their head constantly. This is not ALL that happens in the movie, but you get my drift. Though luckily enough for older fans, i'm a rare breed these days; just because something doesn't entertain me to the highest possible level, I won't just brush it off and call it shit. My 6 stars come from a respect of the entertainment and therefore intrigue to watch. The freshness of it to someone who is new to silent movies. The freshness of watching a screen legend like Charlie Chaplin for only the 2nd time. The powerful ending. What it leaves me with, for example, I will have more fun thinking back to this movie, than I had actually watching it. The reason for that is I can cancel out the bits that bore me. I am left with some great characters, and my imagination. The Blind Girl, there is a beauty about blind people that only blind people can attain. An unfortunate but also fortunate naivety about the world. I love the story of the tramp and the blind girl. It's something that i'll remember.If you like silent movies, you've already seen this movie. If you don't like silent movies, you'll hate this movie.

After first fighting against each other over the microfilm, the two agents are ordered to work together against the real enemy, billionaire Karl Stromberg who plans to use the submarines to destroy the world so he can finally create his dream world beneath the sea. However, James must also defend himself against Anya as she finds out that James had killed her lover on a previous mission...Bond movies are never remembered for their narrative, they are remembered for the opening sequence, the villains, vehicles, and gadgets, and this one has them in droves.After a slight back step with Golden Gun, this is the film that waved goodbye to Connerys shadow, and Moore became Bond, rather than play him, and in its favour it has some wonderful moments, and of course, the introduction of probably the most iconic Bond villains of all time.......Jaws.His first proper scene in the pyramids is still shocking to this day, he's a cold blooded killer, plain, and simple, but on this viewing, I kept asking myself 'why on earth didn't Fekkish just stay where he was?'.But even though he's a killer, he's also one funny character, and the scene ending with the Egyptian builders quip, isn't just a funny scene, it's also somewhat of a relief, knowing he couldn't be real, at all.Unfortunately, it's dated badly, and it has some terrible green screen. Great miniatures, terrible green screen.So all in all, it's the film that Moore became Bond, rather than playing him, and owns the role, even though the films after this went a little too over the top, and in turn, downhill.

But the dialogue between them is very good and makes me laugh! Some examplesWhat the hell was that guy's problem? My first guess? INBREEDING!You know the part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it? This is it.Hey, bum-f'uck police, I'm being chased by a guy who likes to pull tongues out of severed heads with his teeth. Is there a special extension for that?So yeah, in a way this is sort of a horror comedy, even though it isn't advertised that way. Even when things get the most ridiculous, you are entertaining by both the brilliant and the stupid one-liners. It's hard to not be critical of this film though. For example, the creature itself, once fully revealed... isn't that scary. It looks pretty dumb, to be frank. Especially when it flashes its damn wings! I just laughed at that part. I really tried to be creeped out, but I laughed my ass off. Jezelle is also annoying. I mean, the actor playing her is just too damn over-the-top, almost bordering on camp. So yeah, that's a weak link. The song Jeepers Creepers playing in a few scenes is hilariously cheesy, but it was at least used effectively in one scene when two cops are shocked out of their seats when the creature appears. The worst part of the movie is the last twenty or so minutes. From starting out as genuinely creepy and then just is entertaining... it becomes stupid. The last scene with Darry's head chopped off had me dying with laughter, even though it was supposed to be scary and not funny. Thankfully, the characters are never too unlikable. Yes they are sorta irritating, but they are still good enough people that you want them to survive.Jeepers Creepers is an all right watch. It could have been awesome if it just had better actors and a more professional director... but it also could have been terrible. With witty dialogue and a few actual unsettling moments, this is successful as a popcorn movie.

It is probably for these reasons that the movie is regarded so highly. However, it is difficult to see what all the fuss is about. Plot is OK, but not great - it is even dull at times.

Worthless. Pointless. It filled me with a strong urge for pissing on the director and defecating on the script writer. And no, I'm not particularly proud of that feeling.This is a movie for people who find pleasure in watching women getting beaten and raped, breast-feeding mothers getting molested, 16-year old girls getting their virginity taken and women's vaginas and underwear getting sniffed. And the perpetrators getting away with all of that with a flamboyant charm and not a trace of reflection.Oh, did I mention people keen on watching suicides committed by pistol shots to the vaginas? Yes, this is a movie for you, guys. Bon appétit.Yes, I have seen a lot of movies, where even more distasteful things were shown. But those movies had actual plots. They were filmed to tell some story or to send some message. Showing those awful things had some purpose. The purpose other than filming sick fantasies of the perverted script writer.I believe this was the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I'd like to warn especially those people that are now thinking Great, I love disgusting things, I love shocking value, I love Tarantino - this is a movie for me. Trust me - it is not. I was thinking the same and now I'm filled with disgust. I'm disgusted with the creators of this turd, I'm disgusted with people that praise this movie but also I'm disgusted with myself - for not being able to predict how terrible it is and for wasting two hours watching it till the end.
