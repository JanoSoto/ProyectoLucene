Writer\/Director James Cameron returns along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton from the first one. The story picks up many years after the original that finds Sarah Connor (played with vulnerability and intensity by Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution and her now punk teen son John (played to a tee by Edward Furlong) who's living with foster parents. John's world comes crashing down however with the arrival of a terminator (played once again by Arnold Schwarzenegger who does a great job in the role) whose been sent from the future to protect the young soon to be leader of the resistance from a deadly time traveling cyborg known as the T-1000 (played to perfection by Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype which makes it that much more dangerous. Soon The Terminator is in a race against time to protect Sarah and John from a formidable foe it may not be able to defeat. The whole cast are exceptional in their roles especially Schwarzenegger who does a fantastic job as the Terminator, Linda Hamilton still proves to be a perfect Sarah Connor, and Robert Patrick makes for an effective villain. He may not have much dialogue but Patrick makes the best of his villain role in the movie. Well done. Director James Cameron continues the story from the original and gives us a worthy sequel that is much better than the first one. From the intense action which is pretty much non stop, to the acting, to the characters, the story, the suspense, thrills, and some small does of humor this sequel makes for an enjoyable movie to watch. The special effects are amazing especially considering they didn't have the technology we do today. Despite some flaws when dealing with the time-traveling plot and some over acting at times the good more than outweighs the bad. Overall Terminator 2 is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made with plenty of action, chases, explosions, fist fights, amazing special effects, solid performances, a compelling story, and some humor that sure to please any fan of the series or genre. Go see it. Terminator 2 does not disappoint.

It proves to be a fast-moving, quick-witted movie that keeps you engaged with laughs the whole time. It's a rather simplistic story, involving three women who want to rebel against their sexist boss (Dabney Coleman, playing a role typical of him at this time). A series of mishaps leads them to think they've poisoned him, causing the women to steal a dead body which turns out not to be his. When he finds out about their plot, they must kidnap him to keep him from talking, and it's all pure fun from there to the end. Sure, it's ridiculous nonsense, but that's what makes it so enjoyable, and that's the way comedy was meant to be, in my opinion. It takes about half an hour to really get into the film, but once the action starts, you'll find yourself laughing like crazy. One thing I like about this film is that there are no unnecessary secondary plots that take away from the main story. Everything works together here for one purpose, and the film does not try to make a statement. The film exists just to make us laugh, something we rarely get to see anymore.

What exactly is 'a film'? Certainly it is more than technical ability. It is more than just the acting, or the directing, or the story. It is everything which makes up that film. So The Godfather II (as did the first The Godfather) presents us all with something of a dilemma.

The most notorious performance is that of Phoenix, whose budding career was tragically cut short when his life met an end eight years later at the hands of a drug overdose. While Phoenix manages to steal the show away from the lead, Wil Wheaton, it must be noted that the ensemble as a whole did an outstanding job. Heck, if Corey Feldman can make you like him in any film, you know an actor and their director have done their jobs right.

Too bad it's so terrible. It tells three horror stories with a animated sequences attaching them together. The first is Old Chief Wood'nhead. It's about an elderly couple (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour in her last role) killed by a gang of thugs. An old wooden Indian Chief comes to life and avenges them. The second is The Raft with a bunch of brainless teens on a raft in the middle of a lake and being killed by something. It's supposed to look like an oil slick but looksa more like a huge Hefty bag! The last is The Hitch-Hiker where a woman (Lois Chiles) accidentally runs down a hitchhiker and drives away...but the corpse of the hitchhiker keeps coming back and trying to kill her.The stories are all written by George Romero from stories by Stephen King. King does a cameo as a truck driver and makeup master Tom Savini appears briefly as the Creep. You think with all this talent behind the camera you'd get a great movie. Sadly that's not the case. The stories are heavy-handed, boring, not even remotely scary and obvious at every turn. The acting ranges from OK to terrible--only Chiles gives a good performance. The animated wrap around segment contains some of the worst animation I've ever seen (even by 1987 standards). It wouldn't even pass muster with Hanna-Barbera. Add to that boring and badly done gore and you got a real dog. The only bright spots are a pretty good score, Chiles and a guy in bed at the beginning of The Hitch-Hiker segment (David Beecroft) who is absolutely stunning. I saw this film originally back in 1987 and his body and face has never left me. There's also an amusing little quote from Colliers magazine back in 1949 that points out that comic books are NOT damaging to kids! Still this is basically another worthless horror movie sequel.

This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather').

Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless.

While the film's world is wonderfully fleshed out and rich feeling, the whole tone of it all is not meant to be taken seriously - this is a fun movie, and as long as you don't expect Oscar-caliber material, you will enjoy it immensely.No detailed plot description, no serious critique, and no spoilers. Just this This movie has such a HUGE amount of charm, awesomely witty banter and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, great actors (Kurt Russell as hilariously-cocky & self-assured Jack Burton, Kim Cattrall as charming & determined Gracie Law, Dennis Dun as Jack's sidekick Wang, Victor Wong as hilariously-quirky Egg Chen, & James Hong as sinister Lo Pan), all of whom totally own their roles and mesh so well together to really pull the viewer into their universe. This movie has some of the best one-liners ever put on film, mostly from the most charmingly arrogant loner-type in film since Han Solo, courtesy of Russel's Jack Burton. There is literally nothing else like it, except maybe The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension for a similar style, but Big Trouble In Little China is by far the more well-rounded, consistently funnier, and more likable film. In my opinion, this is tied with Halloween as John Carpenter's best film. If you like John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, rich fantasy themes, the charm of 80's movies in general, or buddy action\/comedy movies, then you REALLY owe it to yourself to check this one out!

It's essentially a puzzle; a puzzle that has murder as its theme. Almost invariably it's a requirement of the genre that the intense human emotions that would in reality accompany such a dramatic subject (murder) are, if present at all, subordinated to the needs of the puzzle, and the protagonists must go through their paces behaving like... well, behaving like the characters in a Whodunnit. However, just as good comedy, even at its most surreal, must hold on to a central truth, a good murder mystery must never entirely forget that its dramatis personae are indeed just that, and that their emotions (whilst molded by the needs of the puzzle) make an essential contribution to turning a curious riddle into a gripping Whodunnit.Unfortunately, the script in René Clair's adaptation of Ten Little Indians rather neglects dramatic considerations and plays the story more for laughs than tension. It's almost as though, in recognising that Whodunnits stand aside from real-life (and none more so than the rather cold-blooded British affairs of the 'golden age' of crime novels) the studio decided to make a piece of family entertainment where the puzzle is preeminent and the cast are relegated to playing characters who behave more like they have found themselves on a somewhat disappointing mini-break in Devon than as cornered prey of a crazed murderer. As such it's still an enjoyable piece of cinema, but watching it one can't help but be aware of what is missing. Most glaringly, the characters show little sense of horror or fear at their predicament (with one exception no corpse is shown and one murder is even merely reported).

The film still is an awesome piece of American film-making and in my opinion represents one of the first great 'indie' films as everyone aside from R.K.O. turned away the young upstart and his blasphemous script (with credit to his writing partner Herman J. Mankiewicz). The film is thorough in bringing along for the journey, even if it does hit a hump at the midpoint it follows quickly enough to keep us interested. Obviously it has survived the ultimate test, which is time, to prove itself since it was basically left for dead upon original release. It also didn't help that 'Kane' is one of those films you really do need to take in more than once to fully appreciate the film-scape. (In tribute, just see their reference in an episode of 'Family Guy' as Two long boob-less hours!) Given that Orson Welles was a filmmaker well ahead of his time, it leaves one to wonder what his legacy may have been if 'Kane' had been more widely accepted by the film industry and the populace. Unfortunately we are left to realize his greatness too close to his death and well after it.

Luckily, we'll always have his 'one hit wonder' (to those who simply ignore his body of work) to remind us of 'wasted potential' (due in NO part to Welles' own effort) in epic film.

Well, it's debatable, but I'd rank HOOSIERS high up there. Coming out in 1986 (the dated decade!), HOOSIERS still holds up remarkably well thanks to really great cinematography and set design. It really looks and feels like 1950s Indiana, even today. Without overdoing the period piece aspect and focusing on small town life and hometown values, HOOSIERS is a top-notch movie. In particular, the film is incredibly fast-paced.All credit goes to the great Gene Hackman, who plays dejected, displaced, and disgraced Coach Norman Dale from a big-time college program, who must take a downgraded high school coaching position as head coach at Hickory High School, the Huskers. Hackman exudes credibility as a no-nonsense, firm, yet sensitive man at the crossroads of his coaching career and his life. This actor could do it all by just being himself! Coach Dale arrives in the small town of Hickory, Indiana circa 1951 and immediately faces disdain and uncertainty upon his arrival. The small towners see him as a big-city guy who looks down on them and won't fit in. The locals question his coaching tactics and even challenge his authority directly at times. But Dale sticks to his guns and instills discipline and toughness into the promising basketball team. In particular, Dale shows particular interest in Jimmy Chitwood, a pure shooting guard who at first is not on the team, but then decides to re-join them on the condition that Coach Dale stays.Dale also has an initially rocky relationship with local Myra Fleener (well played by Barbara Hershey), who isn't very crazy about basketball and thinks education is more important. Best Supporting Actor nominee Dennis Hopper plays town drunk Shooter, whose son is on the team. Hopper almost steals the show, but I still think this film belongs completely to Hackman, especially with 20+ years of hindsight.Special mention should also go to the young men who played the Hickory Huskers. Really a band of unknowns who I don't think any have become famous since this film, the fact that real teens (and basketball players) played these characters helps make HOOSIERS all the more authentic.Of course, you have the obligatory happy ending, but it all fits into this gem of a sports film. Really, it doesn't get much better than HOOSIERS!

Well, it's debatable, but I'd rank HOOSIERS high up there. Coming out in 1986 (the dated decade!), HOOSIERS still holds up remarkably well thanks to really great cinematography and set design. It really looks and feels like 1950s Indiana, even today. Without overdoing the period piece aspect and focusing on small town life and hometown values, HOOSIERS is a top-notch movie. In particular, the film is incredibly fast-paced.All credit goes to the great Gene Hackman, who plays dejected, displaced, and disgraced Coach Norman Dale from a big-time college program, who must take a downgraded high school coaching position as head coach at Hickory High School, the Huskers. Hackman exudes credibility as a no-nonsense, firm, yet sensitive man at the crossroads of his coaching career and his life. This actor could do it all by just being himself! Coach Dale arrives in the small town of Hickory, Indiana circa 1951 and immediately faces disdain and uncertainty upon his arrival. The small towners see him as a big-city guy who looks down on them and won't fit in. The locals question his coaching tactics and even challenge his authority directly at times. But Dale sticks to his guns and instills discipline and toughness into the promising basketball team. In particular, Dale shows particular interest in Jimmy Chitwood, a pure shooting guard who at first is not on the team, but then decides to re-join them on the condition that Coach Dale stays.Dale also has an initially rocky relationship with local Myra Fleener (well played by Barbara Hershey), who isn't very crazy about basketball and thinks education is more important. Best Supporting Actor nominee Dennis Hopper plays town drunk Shooter, whose son is on the team. Hopper almost steals the show, but I still think this film belongs completely to Hackman, especially with 20+ years of hindsight.Special mention should also go to the young men who played the Hickory Huskers. Really a band of unknowns who I don't think any have become famous since this film, the fact that real teens (and basketball players) played these characters helps make HOOSIERS all the more authentic.Of course, you have the obligatory happy ending, but it all fits into this gem of a sports film.

Think Dangerous Minds crossed with Death Wish and you'll have a pretty good gist of things here.The ever excellent Tom Berenger stars as a tough as nails mercenary who seeks retribution after his teacher girlfriend is viciously assaulted on the orders of a high school gang calling themselves the Kings Of Destruction. And what better way for our hero to get up close and personal with his quarry than to take the now vacant teaching position his girl friend has left at school and to pose as a substitute. In this assumed role our man quickly weeds out the problem students with some no nonsense discipline which will be sure to raise a smile on most viewers faces. Matters turn out to be a bit more complex however when it is revealed that the school principle is not quite such a genial chap as he at first appears.....in fact far from it as he is orchestrating the gang within his school and trafficking drugs via them. Subsequently our hero enlists the aid of his mercenary buddies to lend a hand and all merry hell subsequently breaks out including in one hilarious scene, one of our boys firing off a rocket launcher down a school corridor(!!!!!) Yes, whilst realism this may be woefully lacking, in fun it more than makes up for! Go on, treat yourself to this wonderful slice of carefree and highly satisfying escapism - you know you want to.

I had avoided seeing this up until now because, I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of Woody Allen. I just find his films about neurotic New Yorkers whinging about life so damn annoying. Get out of the city and deal with it, people. There is a world outside, you know. But I digress...I loved this film because it was sparkling and imaginative and very clever. I knew as soon as the opening credits rolled and Fred Astaire is singing Cheek to Cheek that I would love it. It's a film that celebrates the cinema, and how illusion is sometimes better then reality. Mia Farrow's character could have indeed been written about my relationship with film.
