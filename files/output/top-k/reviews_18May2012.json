An incredible Work by a Cinema Master, Director James Whale. Much to admire here, not the least of which is a beautiful Musical Score by Frank Waxman and Karloff's touching, Sympathetic Portrayal. Adding to the bizarre emphasis to this great Film is Elsa Lanchester's Bride with Iconic Makeup and Wedding Dress, Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, and Dwight Fry as Fritz.This the best of the Universal Studio's 15 years of Horror Monster Movies. Ideally should be viewed as a Double Feature with...Frankenstein (1931)... that establishes the Characters, Setting, and Style, that gave birth to the Mythological Template that would endure to this Day.Note...A very interesting Biographical Movie about James Whale, the Director, was made in 1998 titled...Gods and Monsters...Ian Mclellan won a Best Actor Oscar for his touching and poignant portrayal.
