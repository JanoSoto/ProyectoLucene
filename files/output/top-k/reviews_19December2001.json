Though there have been instances where Tom Cruise has occasional done well in a film, for the most part, he is an inconsistant actor who comes up short more often then not.  If he was considered so cute by the ladies in his youth, he would never be making movies today.  Throughout this film, I laughed at the choices he made as an actor.  His character has this unconvincing, self-deprecating laugh that annoyed me because it sounded so contrived.  And when in doubt as to how to act in a scene, he seemed to default to this unconvincing smile.  Furthermore, I can't buy into the entire relationship between he and Penelope Cruz because it stretches credibility that she saw any charm in him.  (between all of the other fantastic things that happen which I CAN accept, that women were supposed to be seduced by him, is too far too stretch.  And I understand that he was supposed to be a rich, self-obsessed womanizer - but most womanizer's have a charming side that seduces their 'victims.'

This movie is the kind of movie I watch movies for (um....did you follow that?).  I would make one suggestion, however....watch it twice before you decide if you like it or not.  If you're like me you'll probably be lukewarm the first time you see it but like it more each time you see it after that.The reason for seeing it twice is because the film's strong points become more evident the second (and beyond) time around.  Each character is well-defined, with individual traits and idiosynchracies, but this can be lost the first time through because you're trying to follow the story. There is a very strong soundtrack for the movie, but you appreciate it more the second time through, because you better understand how the music applies to the scene.  The actors have great chemistry and the character interactions are great.  The movie never takes itself very seriously and it's just a lot of fun to watch.  You'll find yourself rewinding it to see certain scenes again and again.I grant you the movie will never win any Academy nominations.  The plot is simplistic and the neat ending (all problems solved perfectly in just one day) is unrealistic (not that this bothered me....I personally loved the ending....if I want reality I'll watch the evening news).  Also, trying to follow the storyline tends to take away from the character interaction the first time you see it; hence, the suggestion to see it at least twice.  I actually didn't care for it the first time I saw it because I was looking at it strictly story-wise.

Peter Jackson did a fine job creating Middle-Earth and its locations in their full splendor.  True, there were some plot and character omissions and changes, but again, you can only squeeze so much into a 3-Plus hour story.  However, I can say that very little was left out or altered, and they kept more than they took away.

But hopefully, it will motivate them to read the stories for a better understanding, instead of scratching their heads or blindly criticizing the film.  This truly is a remarkable film from a technical and storytelling standpoint, regardless of whether you like this genre or not.I feel safe in saying that Tolkien fans have very little to worry about, and hopefully the average movie-goer will find a great deal of enjoyment out of this film, but they need to keep in mind before seeing this film that this is only the first part.

The only disappointment I felt when I left the theater was that I had to wait another year for the next one to come out.The Lord of the Rings. It, in itself, is one big novel. The story for the next picks off where the previous left off, with no time gaps or plot jumps. Peter Jackson gives this feeling admirably in Fellowship. The main title of Lord of the Rings is shown, on a black background, to stand out. But, when Fellowship of the Ring is shown, the actual title of the movie, it's down at the bottom of the screen, as we watch Frodo reading a book. Between these two titles is the main thing that was worrying me about the film. They had to have some sort of prologue The history of the ring, what it is, how it was lost, and most importantly, how it was found. I have to say they did a very good job with the telling of the story, which is basically the prologue to this movie series.The other thing which worried me about the movie was the role of Liv Tyler. Not her, especially, I was looking forward to her role. But, the fact that the character she portrayed, Arwin, was 5th on the cast list, but wasn't even in the first book. My guess of where she showed up, from the previews, was correct, and the only real inaccuracy from the books to the movie. The reason for it, I believe, is quite simple. All movies nowadays have to have some sort of love interest. The only romance in all the books is the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, but this isn't shown until the 3rd book. So, the screenplay writers decided to give her a few scenes in the first movie (and most probably the 2nd) to foreshadow her role in the 3rd (she's one of the MAJOR characters in the book).Other than a few minor scenes taken out, Tokien's work was basically untouched. There were even surprisingly few changes in the Tolkienian dialogue. A lot of the lines, much like Darabont's version of The Shawshank Redemption (another great film), are taken straight from the novel.The visuals are just plain amazing. From vast scoping landscapes to majestic castles and spires, to even small sets (Bag End) looking amazingly authentic. Some of the CG done to facial expressions at key points (i.e. Bilbo at Rivendell) are shocking, and extremely well done, showing people the realness of the corruption the ring bestows upon it's bearer.The acting is second-to-none. An all-star cast has been assembled, and everyone played their role to a T. The true standout, and the only actor that really worried me since I read the cast list a year ago was Elijah Wood. After seeing the previews, my worry was lost, and not unfoundedly. Elijah Wood turns in an oscar-worthy (yes, oscar-worthy) performance. Never have I seen a character portrayed so well hopelessness, loss, grief, anguish, torture. Elijah Wood truly went beyond anything I ever would have expected. The minor standout was that of Sean Astin. Astin has been extremely typecasted ever since such roles as Encino Man, Rudy, Harrison Bergeron, and Toy Soldiers. He always plays the same character The everyman, dealing with some sort of uneasy situation. Now, not to knock Sean, he's one of my favorite actors for this type of role, but he was nearly unrecognizable as Samwise Gamgee. From his shy eagerness, to his amazingly crafted accent (everyone's voices were great in this), he truly stood out. I look forward to the chemistry of both these characters in the upcoming movies. Everyone else was nearly as good.The direction was extraordinary. You will never see so many close-ups or cut-shots in any other movie. The feeling of togetherness in the fellowship was portrayed very well, and the feeling throughout the movie, that this is a hopeless journey that cannot be completed, is felt in every gesture and line of every scene.A great movie, one of the best, technically, and physically I have ever seen.

It is absolutely the greatest book I have read, and one of the greatest stories ever told.  So to expect something short of it being one of the greatest movies ever made would be foolish.  I wanted a film that would blow my mind, and I honestly thought they couldn't do it, and I thought they would disappoint me.  When I left the theatre, however, the movie still had a strong hold on me and it is the best thing I have ever seen put on film.  I thought my expectations were as high as they could be, and this film easily surpassed them all and took me along for the ride.First of all, I have to say that Peter Jackson is absolutely brilliant.  The direction in this film is astounding.  He took what was probably the most difficult book to translate onto the screen and he excelled in a way that I didn't think was possible.  The performances he got out of his actors was amazing.  Even more amazing were some of the shots in the movie.  The cinematography was absolutely amazing.  Those of you who thought 'Crouching Tiger' was beautiful, well it doesn't even compare to the awe inspiring scope of this film.  The whole sequence in Moria is breathtaking.  I don't remember blinking when I was watching it.  It is so astounding to watch it that you wonder how it is even possible that they did it.  I've never seen anything as amazing as the Moria sequence and I doubt I ever will again. The acting in the film is also fantastic.  I was watching it and I did something I rarely do, I forgot that they were actors.  Ian McKellan IS Gandalf.  I never saw anything but a powerful wizard.  He was so amazing and was how I saw him in my imagination.  Elijah Wood IS Frodo.  I assume you get the picture.  I do have to comment on Viggo Mortensen as Strider and say that he is the absolute perfect choice.  I always see Strider(Aragorn)as the ultimate hero, and Viggo captures my expectations in that character and made me believe in him.  No one is out of place in this film at all, and Ian Holm is especially great as Bilbo is what portions of the film he is in.  The casting director did the perfect job and I couldn't have, in any way, done it better myself.Lets not forget to talk about the incredible sets and special effects.  The Moria set is just astounding.  I can't describe it to you, but when you see it, you'll get the picture.  Lothlorien was beautiful.  Different than what I pictured, but effective all the same.  The Shire was perfect.  You can tell that they paid careful attention to detail and finely crafted everything.  The evil characters in the film were also great.  The Nazgul were terrifying.  There is really no other way to describe them.  What amazed me the most was the Balrog.  I had some ideas of how it could have been, but the image they gave me of it was great.  I could also tell you how great Mordor looked, and how great the eye looked, and how great the two tower looked, but I won't. You just have to see it all for yourself.  At the end of watching 'The Fellowship of the Ring' a couple of thoughts occurred to me.  First of all, it occurred to me that I HAVE to see this film again, and soon.  And secondly, it occurred to me that nothing has even happened in the story yet.  LOTR is of such a huge scope, and they have just touched upon it.  This film absolutely blew my mind, and I am positive that the best it yet to come.  That said, I have never in my life seen a film that was as good as this, and as a fan of the books, it was really powerful for me.  It was not a film you sit in the theatre and watch, is it something you experience.  The film sucked me in and it still has a strong hold over me.  It is a very powerful film, one that everybody should see.  Greatest story ever, greatest film ever(only until the sequals of course!!!!).  Thank you so much Mr.Jackson and everyone else associated with it.  And of course, thank you J.R.R. Tolkien.  An astounding 10 out of 10, it doesn't get any better than this.

What I will say is that I now have a second favorite movie this year. LotR was pretty damn good and worth seeing, despite its over-ambitious pace and washed-up cast.First of all, the good. Ian McKellen was tremendous. He steals EVERY scene he's in. His wizard was so believable. Near the beginning, when Bilbo is contemplating keeping the ring for himself instead of passing it on to Frodo, McKellen really shows why he's been dubbed Sir Ian by the queen. As Magneto, McKellen wasn't given the chance out-act his coworkers because of the shoddy script, but he has many lines and stands as the most important, best acted character in the movie.Elijah Woods' portrayal as Frodo is decent. He's shown up by John Rhys-Davies and Billy Boyd (two of his Hobbitt friends) though. Sean Astin's Samwise Gamgee was really disappointing, however, and proves why Astin hardly makes any movies anymore; he can't act very well. Astin and Woods spend most of the movie crying or whining about something, as do Boyd and Rhys-Davies, but at least the latter two are hilarious.Upsettingly, Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler weren't given enough screen time to do anything with their characters. This was one of the biggest shames. Tyler's love scenes with Viggo Mortensen's Strider were touching and believable. Blanchett, as an Elf queen, is absolutely beautiful. She is the most beautiful on-screen actress in recent memory. Too bad the girls didn't get much screen time, but perhaps we'll see them in the next two movies.Sean Bean (Boromir), Viggo Mortensen (Strider), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), and I believe Andy Serkis (Smeagol) were great. Next to Gandalf, they were the best characters in the movie. I hope for big things out of each of their characters in the next movies (except for Bean's Boromir, who dies heroically).Most reviewers have slammed the film for its incredible length, and I'm going to be no different. It is too long. Some scenes (such as the scene where the evil Saruman destroys a mountain to block off Frodo and company and another where Frodo is attacked and stabbed by a ringwraith and is saved by Tyler's character Arwin, which I believe wasn't even in the book) were just unnecessary. I have no major complaints, just that that these scenes interrupt with the pace of the movie, making it seem somewhat clumsy and laborous. Had it been cut to a more lean 2 and a half hours, it may have been better.However, some scenes which were fantastic were cut waaaay too short. The opening scene, which tells of the forging of the evil ring was too rushed, as was the end battle. I just felt kind of disappointed, because the battle scenes in the middle of the movie were so well-done and their timing's were just right, but then the end battle is abruptly cut short.Despite minor complaints, I felt this movie was absolutely terrific. Many movies claim to the be the next big Star Wars Trilogy in the making, but Lord of the Rings is really going to do it. Forget about the kiddiness of Harry Potter. The wizards, orcs, dwarves, elves, and hobbitts of middle earth are much better peoples. Simply put, I can't recommend this movie to all of you enough.

It's not that the story holds no surprises (save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter), it's just that many of us have already read the book, and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye. And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema, and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now. The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect. Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long. And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister! There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved. That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience. Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere. Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.

Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect. Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long. And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister! There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved. That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience. Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo. All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time. And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere. Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here. BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good. There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again. The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors.

I wasn't as satisfied as I felt I should be. I went into this movie not expecting much but the typical Hollywood epic, totally manufactured (It was kind of like Titanic meets Legend meets Pearl HArbor meets Willow).
