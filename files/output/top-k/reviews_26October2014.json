I laughed hard when I watched this film for the first time - I could not believe how incredibly wacky the characters are. The funny lines and crazy sight gags are sure to please those that are into odd-ball comedies. The movie is 'far out'.This movie has a strange feel to it - as if it belongs in with some of the 50's 60's or even 70's science fiction films. That is a compliment to the film makers.If you liked movies such as 'Galaxy Quest', 'Spaceballs', 'Airplane', 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', or 'The Man With Two Brains' then it's a good chance you will like Mars Attacks! 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Mars Attacks! is by far one of the zaniest comedies I have ever seen.

Is a twisted timeless comedy masterpiece. There are several sight gags with a lot of bizarre humor.

This movie was a top-notch hit when it came out and it is still one of the best films of it's kind.If you like the movie Airplane! then I would recommend you watch this zany cast in Airplane II The Sequel.
