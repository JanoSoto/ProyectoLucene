It also does a good job showing how complicated life really is and how it can't be summed up into two factors (love and hate).This film revolves around a troubled teenager named Donnie Darko who is constantly having nightmares where he is visited by a horrific giant rabbit named Frank. Frank tells him in a very monotoned voice that the world is going to end in about a month. After hearing this information Donnie gradually tries to understand what is going on in the world around and also the world inside him.Now this movie does have its fare share of possotives but it does have some negatives. One of which is there are a few unanswered questions left behind. Now i don't mean unanswered questions which are left to you to come up with the answer, i mean unanswered questions where there is no answer (one example why were the bullies hanging out in grandma deaths cellar late at night with knives). Another problem is that there is a few to many characters in this piece. In the end there is a purpose for each character though, but i still felt the film could have been just as good by leaving a few out. The final problem i saw in watching this film is some of the dialogue was not very believable (and this is coming from someone in the same age group as Donnie). Don't get me wrong a lot of the scenes have very well put together dialogue which make you think and at the same time take you into Donnies mind and show what he's thinking, but sometimes there scenes which to me are very fake and lame (one example The first bus stop scene).Now don't get me wrong i did enjoy this film, it's just that there are some flaws i felt i should point out. In the end though the positives out way the negatives to this dark thrill ride. This is a very well shot movie and will keep you on edge of your seat the entire way through. I will recommend this movie to anyone who actually enjoys thinking while they watch a movie.8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"22 July 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie has many interesting concepts of what is really going on in the universe around us.

I remember seeing Red Heat when I was a kid and I didn't really like it, but I think I was just too young to appreciate a movie where Arnold plays anything other than the Terminator or Douglas Quaid.  In Red Heat, he stars alongside James Belushi, who is so small, iconographically, in a movie with Arnold that you almost forget he's in it at all. Arnold plays the part of Russian supercop Ivan Danko, a role that he fits perfectly because of his size, his looks, and his accent. Audiences in Russia may notice that his accent is not quite Russian, but it fits well enough for his purposes. Where Belushi is concerned, the movie is more comedy than action, since every single scene he appears in is tailored to allow for some pert one-liners.

You have the normal Christie crew; a cast of suspects and victims    with rotten pasts.  These characters are lured to an island where they are picked off one by one.  Closterphobia sets in as the remaining people realizes that the killer could be one of them.  Now, this sounds like the makings of a wonderful movie, full of suspense, drama, horror, and perhaps romance?  Sadly the seriousness of the plot is diminished as the whole thing is played up like a parlor game.  There really is no suspense at all for the whole thing is made into a sort of comedy.

For example, the 2 worst Moore 007's were Man with the Golden gun (2nd worst Moore 007) followed closely by Moore's debut as 007 in Live and Let Die. Spy who loved me saved possibly the entire 007 series. Then it regressed a little bit again with Moonraker and especially For Your Eyes only (which to me was the worst moore 007). But then a great one with Octopussy with Khamal Khan and then this awesome film, AVTAK.The reasons this is the best are many. Best theme song, most action scenes (the eiffel tower, the horse chase, the blimp scene, the city hall elevator scene, the scene in the mine, and so many others). I guess my main reason for considering this one the best is Zorin. The villain is always obviously a main character in any bond film, I don't care who plays 007. In this one, Zorin was by far the most evil and psychotic villain. And I think Mayday was very good as his henchman (or henchwoman in this case- anybody think she couldn't kick knick nack's but??). Just who was the henchman in for your eyes only, by the way? Sure this movie didn't deal with global destruction, but millions dying in California is nothing to sneeze at either. Nobody really was going to die in Goldfinger, he was just going to have a monopoly on gold, yet everyone seems to rave about that one.And the them song by Duran Duran simply kicks but. It's a different genre of theme song from say FYEO or TSWLM, but even so, overall, it really is the best theme song. I dare say it was the only one to hit #1 on the charts.Best Moore 007 films are 1) AVTAK 2) Octopussy 3) SPy who loved me....after that it really doesn't matter since the rest are all mediocre at best.

The dog napping plot of One Hundred and One Dalmatians is adapted to fit the catnapping plot of The Aristocats. O'Malley and Duchess are reconstructions of Lady and the Tramp at heart. But, as long as the end result is just as enjoyable as the past movies, why complain? No matter how the success was achieved, as long as it was achieved. The plot is simple. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is an old millionaires spinster in Paris, 1910. The only other people in her lonely life are her cat, Duchess, and her kittens, Toulouse, Marie and Berlioz, as well as the faithful butler, Edgar. When Madame's lawyer, Georges, comes over to make Madame's will, Edgar overhears her plans. She wants to leave all her belongings to her cats, and at the end of their lifespan, the vast sums of money will go to Edgar. Quite unreasonably, Edgar is infuriated, and drugs and catnaps the kittens and dumps them in the French countryside, miles from home. There they find Thomas O'Malley, an alley cat who helps them back home, mainly because of Duchess.The characterization of O'Malley certainly doesn't seem to have been a problem. Voiced by Phil Harris (Baloo from The Jungle Book), he also acts like the lovable bear and even looks just like you would imagine Baloo to look like, were he transmogrified into a cat. His bunch of jazz cats, led by Scat Cat, are some of the more effective Disney cameo-players. My favorite was the long-haired, blonde English Cat (besides Scat Cat, the rest have no names but clearly distinct nationalities). Roquefort the house-mouse and Frou-Frou the horse have brief roles, but shine in these glimpses. Edgar isn't really the real Disney villain in that he is not evil...he is simply impatient. He is not cruel from the start--his only sin is impatience. If he hadn't known about the will, he would've taken care of the cats as if nothing had happened. One sees his point in a way--what would those cats DO with the money? Madame could have given her estate to Edgar, and the butler would never have abandoned the cats had they not been privileged more than himself. So I like Edgar, in some ways.The story is a mix of other Disney classics. Besides Fantasia--which had NO plot--this was Disney's first shot at writing an original story for an animated feature, and even so they had to take shortcuts. Here are the main plot elements repeated 1) Villain-pet naps-animals-for-personal-gain from One Hundred and One Dalmatians. 2) Pampered-pet-learns-of-life-on-streets-through-streetwise-friend from Lady and the Tramp. It also borrows a little bit from Chuck Jones and Abe Levitow's Gay Purr-ee (1962). The plot is berated for being too shallow, but I don't see how it can be with so many elements of faultless classics. Again, as in the first paragraph If the audience enjoys a story, it doesn't matter how the story developed.The animation, so often blasted for being lazy and flawed, can never be seen the same way by everyone. It's solely a matter of opinion. The animation isn't bad, like television cartoons it's a different style, radically different from, say, Sleeping Beauty. If that great fairy tale were portrayed by such animation, it would be the greatest failure in history; the same way, the sketchy, loose, carefree style of The Aristocats is perfect to tell that kind of story with those characters. Sleeping Beauty needed to be immaculate, as near to photography as could be; The Aristocats is the most cartoony of Disney animated features.The Aristocats will always have an advantage over many films in my book. It was one of the few movies my dad saw in theater, so I was exposed to it more than several other movies. Besides that, it has always been one of Disney's more enjoyable features, more fun than most. It doesn't aim for the realism and drama of Bambi.

Again, as in the first paragraph If the audience enjoys a story, it doesn't matter how the story developed.The animation, so often blasted for being lazy and flawed, can never be seen the same way by everyone. It's solely a matter of opinion. The animation isn't bad, like television cartoons it's a different style, radically different from, say, Sleeping Beauty. If that great fairy tale were portrayed by such animation, it would be the greatest failure in history; the same way, the sketchy, loose, carefree style of The Aristocats is perfect to tell that kind of story with those characters. Sleeping Beauty needed to be immaculate, as near to photography as could be; The Aristocats is the most cartoony of Disney animated features.The Aristocats will always have an advantage over many films in my book. It was one of the few movies my dad saw in theater, so I was exposed to it more than several other movies. Besides that, it has always been one of Disney's more enjoyable features, more fun than most. It doesn't aim for the realism and drama of Bambi. It's just wholesome entertainment.9\/10  ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"22 July 2004","score":"24 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":"  I watched this movie when I was 21.

When their mother's father has a heart attack, the parents of the three children have to leave town to visit him, so they need a babysitter, pronto! Call it misadventures in babysitting because they get the father's somewhat irresponsible, but loving uncle, Uncle Buck (John Candy).The story is typical. Uncle Buck is a big mess at first. Not really sure how things work, but trying hard to make friends with the younger kids (Gabby Hoffman and Maculay Culkin), and trying very hard to make peace with the older, cynical niece (Jean Louise Kelly) who for some reason, just can't take a liking to Buck. In part, that's understandable considering that he does try his bess to embarrass her at times in order to get her to see how stupid she's being (especially when she's around her idiot boyfriend, Bug). But in her case, she really has an overdose of teen angst, and that spells trouble for Buck. The niece does her best to get revenge on Buck, and make life as difficult as possible for him so that her parent's will see what an irresponsible bafoon he is, or at least that she pegs him to be.The story also examines typical John Hughes elements, namely class divisions. Buck isn't exactly wealthy, let alone classy. Also, there are familial tensions, since the oldest daughter doesn't get along with her mother well at all (or either parent really, but we really don't see her relationship with her father). But, like all Hughes comedies, it is resolved and everyone lives happily ever after. This is a better movie for kids in their mid teens and younger, since Buck's comedic antics (the monster size pancakes, the washing machine mishap, and the revenge on the boyfriend, Bug) will generate plenty of laughs. Buck has his own way of doing things, kind of like Michael Keaton in 'Mr. Mom' (although Keaton follows a standardized process afterwards unlike Buck, who's improvisations are his own, and he sticks with them). The interaction between Bug and Buck are the best because Bug is such an idiot and scared as hell of Buck. Though, I think the funniest scenes are with Laurie Metcalf (always a scene stealer) as the seductive, cooky next door neighbor who takes a liking to Buck.John Hughes fans in general will probably enjoy this comedy, though that depends if you kept maintained faithfulness to his film catalogue even after he started going strictly with mindless family films (and not teenage comedies). Though, this is the earliest period of that transition, about the same time as Dutch and Curly Sue, so it really depends on what serves your taste as far as John Hughe's family film collection goes.It is a nice little comedy, and one that wouldn't hurt to try. You'll probably get a few good laughs in there. John Candy always does.

Coneheads came out and for some weird reason that is beyond me got a bad rep, I know that this was a sillier movie and not the strongest to come out of the vaults of Saturday Night Live with it's goofy characters. But the film in my opinion worked because it had Dan Aykroyd writing the film as well as starring in it. Honestly, how could you not laugh at this movie? If you're telling me that you did not laugh one time during this movie, there is something wrong with you, check your funny bone because this movie has a great cast who looked like they just had a blast making Coneheads.Beldar Conehead and his wife Prymaat Conehead as they try to assimilate into American society and pursue the immigrant's American dream. Their spacecraft was part of an advance scouting mission for an invasion, but was shot down by a F-16 fighter-interceptor, stranding them on Earth. They live with secret identities while an INS agent tracks them incessantly over the years. They Conehead family blend into Paramus, New Jersey and take up activities that are part and parcel of the American Dream. They also raise their teenage daughter, Connie, who has recently begun dating. As they continue to wait for their mother ship, they live the American dream where they are respected and upstanding citizens.I know this is silly but I can't help but laugh at the way the coneheads talk to each other, especially when Beldar gets his citizen name Donald R. DeCicco, the way he says DeCicco is just too funny. I'm not a huge Chris Farely fan, but he is so hilarious and charming in this movie as Ronnie who takes a liking to Beldar's daughter. When he starts to get a little touchy feely with her and she tells her parents about it, Beldar rips the roof of Ronnie's car like a can opener saying in his own alien way that he will kill Ronnie if he tires anything again and Ronnie being confused by the way Beldar said it said back Uh, thank you?. The movie may be silly, but when have we let being silly get in the way of us having a good time? If something makes you laugh, don't fight it.
