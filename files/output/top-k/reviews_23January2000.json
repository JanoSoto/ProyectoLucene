[{"date":"23 January 2000","score":"","review":"  Having recently seen Godzilla there is no doubt that Matthew Broderick should never again attempt an action film and should stick strictly with smaller works that center on characters. Here again he shows his subtle hand at understated comedy.  He is just fine as the teacher who is drawn into a high school election,  simply because he cannot stand to see the annoying, overacheiving,unopposed candidate for student body president win without a race.  That candidate is played by Reese Witherspoon, who is totally believeable as the high school senior with one thing on her mind;WIN...WIN...WIN.  THE injured bodies she leaves in her wake as she pushes through to her goal is what this movie is about. And in examing the price of success the movie examines much of what is wrong with a society that places its only value in success.Witherspoons impact on all those around her leaves them all damaged.  If they challenger her they are beaten down, threatened, and forced to submit.  After they are dispatched and she has moved on to the next contest, they are forgotten, irrelevant to the immediate goal. And they are left to repair whatever damage she has done. That is not to say the injured parties are not responsable. They are.  Their own weakness causes their eventual downfall, not Witherspoon. But when a problem rises up to confront her it is the amoral singelness of her purpose that gets her through.  The others fall because they have a morality.They have an occassional weakness of the flesh.  She does not. This of course speaks volumes about our current politcal system.  Dont we all feal that most of our leaders, those that have risen to the top are nothing but a bunch of amoral, issueless, pointless, driven, self-centered,attention seekers, whos opinions change with the latest public opinion poll, and who wouldnt take an unpopular moral stand on anything even if their lifes depended on it.  This is Witherspoons character. Her whole being is one of connections, networking, and using people.  If your own board great. Until you are no longer needed.  If you oppose her she will try to crush you for no other reason than you stand in her way.  A great social commentary on what I believe we all feal about our political leaders.  There is not a real person in the bunch. Ironically her two opponents in the election eventually get exactly what they have always wanted.  Thats because they were no real opposition to Witherspoon.  They were just there as something of a joke.  For Witherspoon its real,  and she knows who the enemy is, and the enemy pays. And once the enemy is dispatched........well its on to the next contest.  She never looks back.  And cares nothing about the consequenses of her acts.  Thats because there is no morality in her game.  There is only one thing;WIN...WIN...WIN. Great charecters and a great script make this a good move.Not in the top 250 of all time...and I suspect as it ages it will disappear from the list. Still a good movie and worth an EIGHT......

I must admit that I have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned Quintet, if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown-up and beautiful Brigitte Fossey, who was unforgettable as the little girl in Forbidden Games; HealtH, for having Lauren Bacall, Carol Burnett, Alfre Woodard and Glenda Jackson, all in the same cast; Popeye, for that splendid and surreal world, Shelley Duvall's Olive Oyl and the wonderful Malta locations; O.C. & Stiggs, for its proposal of an anti-adolescents flick; Beyond Therapy, for all its lunacy and for the presence of Genèvieve Page, who for all her effort to look Parisian chic is taken for a travestite... I have even enjoyed his one-act TV movies, like The Dumb Waiter and The Laundromat. When there is not much plot to develop in his films, you have wonderful performances, from Burnett, John Travolta, Kim Basinger or Jane Curtin. I perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the United States. It is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated, and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out American prizes and awards. He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies. He is more of a maverick. So it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about The Gingerbread Man, his most 'mainstream' effort to date and to my knowledge. I did not know there were so many people who thought like Leonard Maltin, who does not like Altman at all. In this case, one may dislike The Gingerbread Man, but for me the reason has more to do with Grisham than with the director-screenwriter. Some of Altman's trademarks are here improvised dialogue, great performances, a funny lawyers' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary. While some people find it boring, I found the first act fascinating, thanks also for the great cinematography by Changwei Gu, the man who shot Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and Farewell My Concubine. He has a way of showing us the same things we see in other American movies, but under a different light. Through his foreigner's gaze, almost everything seems new and different. In this first act, things were so logical and true! Wait until you get older. You may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as Embeth Davidtz. I know for myself what I have done fascinated by someone who is younger than I am! Then you have Robert Duvall's repellent, menacing and mysterious character, while that Geraldo storm is threatening Savannah. The second act gets a little phony and even funny, because Altman may have conducted it with a grin. I remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks. I think he was applying a bit of Brecht, distancing us, preparing us for the third act, which is plain Hollywood pastiche. Altman does it with expertise. Being a wise man, and an intelligent director, luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies. He was directing a tale of lust, greed and death. I was not disappointed a bit with the movie. If I give it a nine instead of 10, it is because of Grisham. The American reader has turned him into a best-selling author. So why complain? Maybe we should thank Altman for showing us the seams in his stories, the dullness, the flatness and the silliness of them all. However, he does it with so much gusto and humor, that I cannot but disagree with the negative comments. For me, these persons saw another movie... And vice versa.

His one puppy-dog like expression seemed endearing in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, but later translated to simply bad acting.  In his new movie, Prinze plays Al Connelly, a college student searching for love, among other things.When he meets freshman Imogen, played by the lovely Julia Stiles, he is immediately fascinated by her.  Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple.  The movie chronicles their tale of first love, along with every obstacle in between, such as Al's friend who directs porn movies, and his father, who wants to start with a Cops -like cooking show with his son.At the beginning, this seemed like a wonderful idea for a movie.  The first fifteen minutes were a sweet, almost realistic account of first love, which many people could relate to.  A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple.  However, all of the potential of this movie was shattered when all of a sudden, in a moment of 90210 like melodrama, Imogen thinks she's pregnant.  Of course, this event is the beginning of their problems for the rest of the movie.The film continues its downward spiral, culminating an unrealistic and contrived ending.  Prinze and Stiles simply had no chemistry on screen, and by the end, the audience was simply not interested in whether they got together or not.

Of course, this event is the beginning of their problems for the rest of the movie.The film continues its downward spiral, culminating an unrealistic and contrived ending.  Prinze and Stiles simply had no chemistry on screen, and by the end, the audience was simply not interested in whether they got together or not.  Prinze seemed incapable of showing any emotion, making his character extremely boring and just annoying.  On the other hand, Stiles (of 10 Things I Hate About You) was charming as usual, but unfortunately stuck in a bad movie, with no place to show off her talent.  Additionally, the supporting cast was no help, awkwardly put in scenes to make badly acted sex jokes, and having no relevant or even interesting purpose.Written and directed by Kris Isacsson, the movie had some good ideas, but those were quickly overshadowed by too much melodrama and contrived storylines.  What could've been an earnest and sweet romance, turned into a boring story with annoying characters.

For starters, the music is so loud and continuous that you simply can not pick up on the dialog. The story rambles, switching from one depressing scene to another and back again.  Between the music blaring and the characters screaming, I absolutely couldn't take anymore and my wife and I walked out. What ever prompted great actors like William H.

Told with a crisp, quick dialog style, the film depicts first the meeting, then develops the interest in the two schemers, leaps to the murder, then sees the perfect plan start to erode because of the efforts of Edward G. Robinson to protect the company from having to pay a double indemnity charge on the life of the deceased.The viewer will be able to follow the movie rather easily, but it is obvious that Robinson sniffs something suspicious, and is not going to let go of the matter without giving a serious effort t uncover the truth.  Eventually, the tensions mount to the climax, and the lovers are ultimately pitted against themselves in an effort to avoid the legal charges.This film did receive several nominations from the Academy Awards festival, including Best Picture and does remain a great example of suspense coupled with tension and mystery.  An easy 9\/10, and a must see for fans of this genre.
