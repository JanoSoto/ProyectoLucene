Now a days it's a rarity to see such ideas being put forth in cinematic form. No Way! It was nearly in rare form when it came out. The Story is about Maria, a faithful believer in God. It starts with her trying to do her best at being a nun and failing. Thus, moving her into the story line of her finding her life. The music and the production are the backdrop to this.The production has nothing to do with real life Austria except that it's filmed on location there and the scenery is breathtaking. If you're from Europe or are German\/Austrian you probably going to find the whole thing to be laughable if not offensively American. But it's a Hollywood film and the story and musical were written in America.In spite that, the production and direction of movie are very, very Well Done. Robert Wise new what he wanted from this movie and he stylized the whole thing to create a very nice pastel hues atmosphere to go along with the very Idealistic story. I read one reviewer who said that Andrews deserved an Oscar for her part. Blah! The parts were not that hard to act...the characters aren't dramatic. That being said, the actors in the movie were very fine actors and played their parts very well...Eleanor Parker, Chris plummer. If you watch the movie enough times, and you start paying attention to the faces of each character throughout the movie you realize everyone of them stays in character through out all of their scenes. especially Parker and Andrews. their faces are always reacting to exactly what's being said. It's just actors who know their craft and very good and superb direction.However, I don't know if anyone could have played the part as iconic-ally as Andrews did. I also don't think this movie would've been as popular had she not been the female actress to play the part. her sweet persona and voice just do the virtuous, honest Maria Von Trapp role so succinctly. She's truly beautiful in this movie.it's by no means a mind blowing drama. It's a very romantic movie (Happy Ideals being hyperbole-ed). It's the wholesomeness of this movie, the archetype Mother figure who comes in and saves the day that people really enjoy. They like the fantasy of it all very much to the point that I believe it gives them hope. Other critics laugh at it or are disgusted by it's over use of saccharin, but the movie's cultural following speaks for itself. The lyrics of the songs are Great. Climb Every Mountain is a beautiful song..if you really feel the message of that song, it will get you every time. I saw another reviewer complain about how ridiculous the scene between Maria and the Mother Superior was..could not take anymore. I was like What?! that's like the best part of the whole movie. Such a wonderful scene of a nun in modern culture opening up and being vulnerable to a student..Leading by Example. The song is perfect in taking the place of the dialogue. Such a powerful moment in the movie. The one song in the entirety of the movie I don't like and wish they would have written differently is the somewhere song that the Captain and Maria use as a duet. I don't think the lyrics have anything to do with the movie and it's clear they created it to add to the kissing seen for the romance. I don't mind them singing together and enjoy the intimate romance of the moment but the song sucks. It needed different lyrics.In the end, I believe this movie deserved the best picture Oscar in 64...I do not think the actress needed any nods. their parts weren't that difficult. But putting everything together, it all made for quite a very well done movie. Especially for a musical. One of the most mature and professionally made musicals ever to be produced.

Many of these comics were previously adapted by Amicus in films such Tales From the Crypt and Vault of Horror. While those films were good, the great black humor of EC comics was largely missing. Romero and King get that part right and in that sense, Creepshow is a more faithful adaptation of EC comics than the movies from the '70s, even though these stories are all original King tales and not from the comics.There are five stories plus the linking story in this anthology. The first story is called Father's Day and is about a wealthy family that gathers every year on Father's Day to remember Uncle Nathan a mean, evil man who was killed seven years earlier by his daughter Bedelia (Viveca Lindfors). Ed Harris and Carrie Nye play two of the family members. This is a slight but enjoyable story that kicks the movie off well.The next story is The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verill and is probably the most divisive of the stories, as it's a comedy piece that stars Stephen King. The story is about a deeply stupid hayseed farmer that finds a fallen meteorite on his farm and thinks it's his ticket to fortune & fame. After he cracks it open, however, he and the farm are quickly overrun by some kind of alien vegetation. King, whatever else he is, is not a good actor. When I first saw Creepshow as a kid, this was hands down my least favorite of the stories. Over the years my dislike of it has softened into a grudging admiration for the cornball comedy that it is. It's still the weakest story of the film, though.The third story is Something to Tide You Over, about a millionaire (Leslie Nielsen) who buries his wife's lover (Ted Danson) up to his neck on the beach as the tide comes in. As he drowns he's forced to watch a video of how the wife suffered the same fate. The two come back from the dead to seek revenge. As a kid this was the story from the movie that I remembered most. Perhaps that was because it had the biggest stars. It's a good story and I've seen several reviews single it out as the best in the film.The fourth story, and my personal favorite, is The Crate. It's about a college professor (Fritz Weaver) who finds a Yeti-like creature inside a crate hidden in the university basement for over 100 years. He shares this find with a colleague (Hal Holbrook), who has an abusive and obnoxious wife (Adrienne Barbeau) that treats him like garbage. Holbrook decides to use the creature in the crate to get rid of his wife problem. This is a great little story. I enjoy the concept of an old expedition that found some Yeti-like monster. Plus, the performances from the three principal actors are great. Barbeau is the worst wife ever and you really root for poor Hal Holbrook here. This is also the longest segment in the film.The fifth story is They're Creeping Up On You, about a miserly mysophobic billionaire (E.G. Marshall) who lives in a hermetically sealed apartment controlled with electric locks and surveillance cameras. The apartment is invaded and overrun by cockroaches, much to Marshall's horror. This is a disgusting story that will gross many of you out. Don't watch it unless you have a strong stomach for bugs and bug guts.The prologue\/epilogue story that links the other tales is about a young boy (Joe King, son of Stephen) who has an abusive father (Tom Atkins). The father finds his Creepshow comic and throws it out because he doesn't want his son reading such crap. It's an enjoyable story despite a disturbing realism to the abusive father. The way it ends is deliciously dark. Although the Living Dead movies are Romero's bread and butter, Creepshow is my favorite film of his. I can watch it over and over. The acting, writing, makeup effects, music, and direction are all terrific. I'm a big fan of horror anthology films and this is right up there near the top of the list.

Only two years after the release of 'First Blood' you can see where this idea main have spawned from eh. In fact a script by James Cameron intended for the Rambo franchise was the inspiration for this very film so there. But since then this film itself has been copied many times, the ever popular one man army with a big gun.The mission, Chuck only just got back from Nam where he was held prisoner by some nasty Vietnamese. Once back in the States he realises there are still US POW's MIA back in Nam, so what does he do?. Well he packs up and goes back into the danger zone to find them of course. Isn't there a chance he might get killed or recaptured you say? pfft! Chuck Norris laughs in the face of danger, he tweaks the nipples of fear, he curses politely at those who stand against him.So I'll leave the extremely obvious Rambo similarities aside and just give my views on the action. Well it takes time to get there that's for damn sure, a long time. There is much build up and deliberation as Chuck works out what he's gonna do and how he will do it. Takes him ages to find his old army buddy for a start, not sure why that guy was such a big secret with the locals but there you go.Once we do hit the action its...well OK I guess. Dare I say its identical to 'Delta Force' in the sense that you never see any blood, violence, squib hits (not many) etc...I've mentioned before how Chuck's films tend to be like A-Team episodes haven't I, well its deja vu again. Now I'm not saying its bad because its not, its reasonable fun watching Norris run around gunning men down, but its hella tame.What I love about this film is the horrendous editing and feeble accuracy by everyone involved shooting a gun. So many times you get a shot of someone firing a machine gun (bad guys), just standing there and firing continuously at an enemy yet they never hit a thing!.

Now I'm not saying its bad because its not, its reasonable fun watching Norris run around gunning men down, but its hella tame.What I love about this film is the horrendous editing and feeble accuracy by everyone involved shooting a gun.

But let's not forget that he was nominated for an Academy Award for this film, as well.Why is this my favorite O'Toole film? Because it's nice to see an actor not taking himself quite so seriously. And most of O'Toole's films were damned serious. This is rollicking fun, and as O'Toole' character points out early in the film, Death is easy, comedy is hard. And indeed, that is so true. Comedy is tough! And that shows O'Toole's brilliance all the more, because we are used to seeing him in dramas. So I feel that here he is at his very best, challenged by being an actor who is acting funny, rather than a comedian doing what comedians do.The script, too, is brilliant. It seems to be based loosely on when Errol Flynn guested on Sid Caesar's comedy show...not that there were the fireworks that are portrayed here in this film. But, as hilarious as it is, it's also a very touching film. A washed alcoholic actor who can still buckle his swash. An estranged father who hasn't the courage to talk to his daughter.

Dr. Strangelove and 2001 are on my top 10 list. Clockwork Orange blew my mind when it first came out. I think Barry Lyndon is a visual masterpiece. But The Shining has always struck me as the director's new clothes&#x85; a film that forces me to question whether Kubrick was really a charlatan.I remember being at a bookstore back in the late 70's and seeing a paperback book called The Shining with the tag line soon to be a Stanley Kubrick motion picture. I immediately grabbed it and devoured it in a day or two. I had never heard of the author and I had never experienced such intense horror while reading it. I absolutely could not wait for the film to come out.I imagine that Kubrick must have had a similar reaction to the book which is why he bought the rights. The advertising for the film promised a horror roller-coaster the blood pouring from the elevator, the creepy girls, Jack Nicolson with the ax, the boy and mother running through the maze in the snow. But when I sat there at the first showing the movie just never took off.Was it me? Had I been expecting the book? Shouldn't I have known better than to expect a faithful adaptation from an iconoclast like Kubrick? But the screenplay seemed amateurish and way over thought. The whole production struck me as an attempt to create big effects with music and sound to cover up a complete lack of substance.What went wrong?

In this fight, everyone said that Chuck Wepner would last 2, maybe 3 rounds at most. What actually happened was chuck Wepner was knocked out in the last 20 seconds of the 15th and final round, even managing to knock Ali down in the 9th round. Stallone was so impressed and inspired by this, he decided to write a script about a lone underdog who gets a shot at the title. Armed with only $1,000,000 as the budget, Stallone started work on one of the most influential and famous films of all time Rocky.The film is about a guy named Rocky Balboa, a down on his luck part time boxer, part time loan shark enforcer. His life isn't really going anywhere and he lives in a grotty apartment in Philadelphia. He spends his time trying to impress Adrian, sister of his friend Paulie. His trainer, Mikey Goldmill has given up on him, due to him thinking that Rocky is a 'Tomato', and not a contender, like other boxers who go to his boxing Gym.At the same time, the current champion Apollo Creed is set to fight Mac lee green, the top contender. Unfortunately, Mac Lee green breaks his hand while training, and all the other ranked contenders are unavailable to fight. Apollo then come up the idea of, instead of fighting a ranked contender, he will fight an unknown boxer for the chance of the heavyweight title. He then decides to fight Rocky, due to his boxer name of 'The Italian Stallion'. Rocky then takes this opportunity to go the distance, not for glory or respect, but for his own self-respect, to prove to himself that he has what it takes to go 15 rounds with the champion.Every single thing about this film is flawless. I wouldn't change a single thing about this movie. Here's why First of all, the acting is spotless. Everyone from Stallone as Rocky, to Carl weathers as Apollo Creed, to even Burgess Meredith as the grouchy Mikey Goldmill. All the actors deliver and then some. There isn't a single actor that is anything less than perfect.Next, is the script. The script is unbelievably good. There are tons of memorable lines and no badly written lines at all. All the lines have some importance some where, without coming across as preachy, cliché or soppy at all.Next, you have the pacing. It is without fault. It gives you plenty of story without feeling slow at all. There are also the famous montage, but even though that was in here, the pacing doesn't feel spoiled or ruined in anyway.The best thing about this movie is how much heart it has. Rocky is just an average guy, who is given the chance of a life time. He doesn't feel like he can do it at all, which is what makes it brilliant. In all other films, the protagonist feels 100% like they can do it, which comes across as predictable. Rocky, however doesn't fall into that trap. Rocky himself is full of doubt, and that makes him realistic. An the fact he accepts the challenge for unselfish reasons makes Rocky Balboa one of the greatest movie characters of all time. The fact that he also doesn't give up during the fight makes him even better.The fight is also very well done. I find that there is more heart in that 8 and a half minutes than in the entirety of most movies that are released now. The fact that Rocky gets up, even though his trainer tells him not to, just shows how much he won't give up.I also have to talk about the score. Words cannot describe how good the score is. It's emotional and kicks in that the right time. The Rocky theme in it's self is legendary, and has been used as many times as Rocky has been punched in the entire six movies.This movie basically kick started Stallone's career as an actor, writer and director, as he would go on to direct 4 of the six Rocky films.10\/10.

When he finds a drawing instead, Rose (Gloria Stuart\/Kate Winslet) comes on board and tells her story of Titanic and her love Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). She's a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He's a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.I have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like 'Pearl Harbor'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it's well written, and well acted.There is the great CGI. It's relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.Then there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it's iconic status, I have to give this 9\/10.

Re-visiting that show again for its Madison Square Garden engagement, I reflected on the movie which has become a Christmas perennial, showed repeatedly on cable stations every December, sometimes as long as 24 hours without going to another program! Growing up in a small town in New York in the mid 1970's where Christmas was celebrated in the old fashioned sense, I could relate to every aspect of this film which took place some 20 years before.Pretty much everyone can relate to that one present they desperately wished for when they were a child, even if it wasn't a red-ryder beebee gun. You'll shoot your eye out, kid!, everybody tells him, and in the musical, there's even a huge production number where his fourth grade teacher Miss Shields sings and dances in red sequins after giving him the notorious C+. Miss Shields (Tedde Moore) doesn't sing and dance here, but she's still part of Robby's fantasies. Greeting the teacher with monster teeth attached to their own, the kids turn them in to which she adds these choppers to a collection of other trinkets she's taken away from children not paying attention to their lessons over the years. The story focuses on Ralphie's family, which includes Darren McGavin as the irritable father, Melinda Dillon as the sweet and understanding mother, and Ian Petrella as the adolescent Randy who is sort of mistreated comically as he eats mashed potatoes like a pig and is over-wrapped in winter clothes which make it impossible for him to keep his arms down. Ralphie is played by the adorable Peter Billingsley who went onto produce the stage musical version, and he truly is the dream version of the every day kid. Disciplined and polite (even if he does utter a curse word in one very funny scene), he is still a 9 year old in every sense of the word, prankish and funny, and cutely geeky. Jean Shepherd (the adult Ralphie) provides the witty narration, giving the viewer an inside look into what life was like in the mid west when tradition was everything.This film has so many wonderful moments, and even if I don't watch it every year (seeing the musical twice over the past two holiday seasons did it justice for me), I still look back on it fondly. Who hasn't experienced a nightmare visit to Santa in the local department store right before the holidays where nasty assistants and a possible inebriated fat man in a Santa suit hasn't hurried them along as the night rolls to an end? Who hasn't been humiliated by an obnoxious present by a well-meaning relative who thinks that a 9-year old would look cute in a pink bunny suit? Who hasn't wondered what it would be like to stick their tongue on something frozen? (I know that a certain member of my family actually did, and with much regret too...)Also memorable is the prize which McGavin receives from one of the many contests he's entered (nothing like a good old leg o' lamp...) and his constant fighting with the furnace, plus Dillon's reaction to the Chinese Turkey they receive when the downtrodden neighbor's dogs steal their own. Lots of subtle innuendos too about kids of this day, particularly one goggle-clad little boy in line to see Santa who declares to Ralphie, I like The Wizard of Oz. I like the tin man! as Ralphie tells the woman in the wicked witch costume to beat it. While this film had a rather small theatrical release and appears to have been a sleeper of the time, it has certainly erupted into cult status, even providing an obscure sequel, It Runs in the Family, once re-titled A Summer Story for VHS release. (That film is memorable for me for a sequence in which Mary Steenburgen as the mother tired of receiving a gravy boat at a local movie theater, started a riot by tossing her umpteenth one at the nervous host of the dish giveaway.) It is in that film too where the secret of the Kettle like next door neighbors is revealed.
