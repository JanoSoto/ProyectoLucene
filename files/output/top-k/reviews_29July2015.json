Gavin D'Amato, a divorce lawyer, is discussing case with a client. Realising that relationships between the man and his estranged wife have become very bitter, Gavin decides to tell him a cautionary tale based on the true story of his former partner Oliver Rose. The film then flashes back to Oliver's courtship of, and marriage to, his wife Barbara. Oliver is highly successful in his professional career and is promoted to a partner in his law firm. He, Barbara and their two children appear to be living the American dream in a luxurious house.Their marriage, however, is not faring so well, and Barbara shocks Oliver when she asks him for a divorce. Although he believes that the marriage can still be saved, he reluctantly agrees, but things start to get worse when the couple fall out over the financial arrangements, especially ownership of the house. Neither seems willing to give way on this point, and they begin to wage an ever-deepening war against one another, seeking to destroy first each other's most cherished possessions and then each other's reputations.The film stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner who had earlier acted together in Romancing the Stone and its sequel, The Jewel of the Nile. In one respect Turner might have seemed miscast. The script implies that Oliver and Barbara are around the same age, whereas in reality Turner is ten years younger than Douglas and at 35 was really too young for the part. Barbara, after all, is supposed to have been married for around twenty years and to be the mother of two children in their late teens. This is, however, one piece of apparent miscasting which turned out to be absolutely right. Turner plays Barbara as a force of nature, a sort of deranged fury eaten up with hatred for her husband and absolutely determined to have what she sees as her rights, no matter what the cost. There is no rational reason for her dislike of Oliver; when he asks her why she wants a divorce all can reply is that she has a desire to smash his face in. At the same time she is sexy enough to make us understand why, for all her spiteful antics, her husband still, in an odd way, is still in love with her- and nobody could do deranged but sexy like Turner as she was to prove in another, later black comedy, Serial Mom in which she plays another suburban housewife turned avenging fury. Douglas's Oliver is subtly different. Although he can be just as spiteful as Barbara, we get the sense that he is more sinned against than sinning, a man who has worked hard to provide as good a life as possible for his family only to have his love thrown back in his face by an ungrateful wife. Barbara announces her intention to divorce him when he has just come out of hospital, which seemed particularly cruel. Some of his tricks, such as his insistence in remaining in the house after the couple have split up, seem to be motivated partly by a desire for revenge but also partly by a desire to stay close to the person who has been at the centre of his life for so long. My one complaint would be that he seems too old in the early scenes when he is supposed to be a young student. DeVito is also good as Gavin, desperately caught in the middle of a battle between two people he considers friends. Although it has an ostensibly improving moral about the need for tolerance and mutual understanding in marriage and personal relationships, The War of the Roses is essentially a black comedy. It can be seen as a romantic comedy in reverse. Many rom-coms are based around the Pride and Prejudice story of how a couple start off by disliking one another and end up by falling in love; this film simply reverses the process. A comedy on this theme could have become very nasty and mean-spirited, but in the hands of Danny DeVito, who directed the film as well as playing Gavin, and of its two stars, it somehow manages to avoid this fate. It is one of the funniest unromantic comedies of the eighties. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The War of the Roses is a film told using that old literary device of the framework technique.

The animation holds up well and also helps with the world building; whether it's the 2.3 million individual hairs of Sulley that bounce and bristle with life, or the very complicated sequence of thousands of moving doors that must have been a nightmare to storyboard and coordinate. But it's the characters that really bring Monster's Inc. to life. Monster's University, the sequel more than a decade later, wound back time and placed original characters in a rather by- the-numbers college movie, with the usual jocks and geeks that arise in that genre. In MI, they are less one dimensional and more complex; and the voice acting is equally great. John Goodman brings a jovial and good natured Sulley to the screen, so convincing that its surprisingly scary when he finally bares his teeth and roar, the audience reacting as effectively as Boo does (I'm off duty). Billy Crsytal voices Mike, the wise cracking joker and best friend, delivering both juvenile and adult humour, while Steve Buscemi is Randall, the slimy rival scarer that has darker intentions. James Coburn is Waternoose, the well rounded boss who thinks first and foremost for his family's company, but also expresses regret at banishing his favourite scarer. The scene stealer is Boo, played by a infant Mary Gibbs, so young that they had to follow her around the studio and record sound bites which make up her gibberish speech. She's animated with such care and precision - there's a wonderful irony in the way she pops up in Monstropolis and says boo adorably, only to have every scary monster in sight run for their lives. Her and Sulley's relationship make up much of the emotional core of Monster's Inc. and it progresses with remarkable realism and pacing. Goodman exposes the very confines of Sulley's heart, looking beneath the agile and powerful frame that the animation presents. It's a very touching and sometimes funny relationship that develops gradually and begins to even intrude into the long lasting bond that he has with Mike. There's such a poignancy to the way Goodman delivers the line Did you see the way she looked at me? that conjures up a wealth of subtext about the overall premise of the film, their careers, the ethics of scaring innocent children the growing fatherly role he has adopted for Boo...it's neatly tied up in the ending when they switch to comedy instead of horror (which gives Mike a new-found responsibility and role) and also is much kinder and fun for the kids. The little bits of laughter from Boo and their effects throughout the film foreshadow this nicely. Randy Newman's score is also an important element. The jazzy big band influence is apparent from the opening credits sequence, and also excels in the stand out track The Scare Floor, played in the very first reveal of the elite Scarers making their way into the room and preparing for another day of screaming. The percussion beats build steadily and prepares the audience, while the jazz section swings with a wonderful rhythm that goes well with the hard work and chaos of the scare floor. The award winning is If I Didn't Have You is saccharine and pleasant, if not a little similar to Toy Story's You've Got a Friend In Me, but Goodman and Crystal play off each other well.

In MI, they are less one dimensional and more complex; and the voice acting is equally great. John Goodman brings a jovial and good natured Sulley to the screen, so convincing that its surprisingly scary when he finally bares his teeth and roar, the audience reacting as effectively as Boo does (I'm off duty). Billy Crsytal voices Mike, the wise cracking joker and best friend, delivering both juvenile and adult humour, while Steve Buscemi is Randall, the slimy rival scarer that has darker intentions. James Coburn is Waternoose, the well rounded boss who thinks first and foremost for his family's company, but also expresses regret at banishing his favourite scarer. The scene stealer is Boo, played by a infant Mary Gibbs, so young that they had to follow her around the studio and record sound bites which make up her gibberish speech. She's animated with such care and precision - there's a wonderful irony in the way she pops up in Monstropolis and says boo adorably, only to have every scary monster in sight run for their lives. Her and Sulley's relationship make up much of the emotional core of Monster's Inc. and it progresses with remarkable realism and pacing. Goodman exposes the very confines of Sulley's heart, looking beneath the agile and powerful frame that the animation presents. It's a very touching and sometimes funny relationship that develops gradually and begins to even intrude into the long lasting bond that he has with Mike. There's such a poignancy to the way Goodman delivers the line Did you see the way she looked at me? that conjures up a wealth of subtext about the overall premise of the film, their careers, the ethics of scaring innocent children the growing fatherly role he has adopted for Boo...it's neatly tied up in the ending when they switch to comedy instead of horror (which gives Mike a new-found responsibility and role) and also is much kinder and fun for the kids. The little bits of laughter from Boo and their effects throughout the film foreshadow this nicely. Randy Newman's score is also an important element. The jazzy big band influence is apparent from the opening credits sequence, and also excels in the stand out track The Scare Floor, played in the very first reveal of the elite Scarers making their way into the room and preparing for another day of screaming. The percussion beats build steadily and prepares the audience, while the jazz section swings with a wonderful rhythm that goes well with the hard work and chaos of the scare floor. The award winning is If I Didn't Have You is saccharine and pleasant, if not a little similar to Toy Story's You've Got a Friend In Me, but Goodman and Crystal play off each other well. Monster's Inc. delivers laughs and emotionally rich moments for both children and adults and is another demonstration of Pixar's ability to seamlessly combine the two in a creative and original premise.

There's nothing in particular that's wrong with this one but I just really prefer The Road Warrior and Fury Road. Basically the plot is simple, someone manages to steal Max's ride and go to a town with it so he has to go get his stuff back. However halfway through doing what the leader of the town (Tina Turner) he decides to leave but that ends up with him walking through a desert which at the last minute gets him to a civilization that believes that Max can lead them to their paradise, 1980's Sydney. However he decides the way to do this after he is reluctantly dragged along is to steal vehicles and other odds and ends necessary from the town and gain numbers from their prisoners. However them doing this means everyone and their brother is out to get them. The movie is stock Mad Max. Basically that's a problem because there is nothing in it as spectacular to look at as the stunts in Fury Road or The Road Warrior, It's just Max walks in this movie like a cowboy, then leaves in the sunset. There are good things like the cinematography, the stunts and the actors are good for the most part. It just has good elements but never goes above and beyond.

In fact, it's not among writer\/director Luc Besson's best (The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita are definitely better). Why is it rated so highly? The film stars Jean Reno as a top ninja-like assassin. However, in an odd twist, this lone wolf killer falls in with a girl (Natalie Portman) and he becomes her foster dad. This is hard to believe but even harder to believe is his training her to be a killer as well as he going after the baddie lone wolf style! And, speaking of the baddie, Gary Oldman pretty much plays the same guy he played in The Fifth Element. Saying the film has some ridiculously difficult to believe aspects is certainly an understatement. Now I am not saying it's bad...but it cannot be a great film, in my opinion, if so much of it is difficult to believe. Interesting, yes....top 100...no way.By the way, I think it's safe to assume that Portman was named Mathilda in the film because of her and her family's strong similarity to the characters in the Raold Dahl book Matilda.

All of those elements make Hellraiser Clive Barker and Horror movies at their best.Based on the novella The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker,Hellraiser tells the story about Husband and wife Larry(Andrew Robinson)and Julia Cotton(Clarie Higgins)who have moved into Larry's childhood home. While there Julia discovers the skinless but alive body of Frank Cotton(Sean Chapman,Oilver Smith)Larry's brother and Julia's former lover who has escaped the clutches of monsters called Cenobites who exist in a puzzle box that when opened unleashes pain and Horror. Frank decides to use Julie to help him get some blood and skin which leads to terror and chaos.Released in 1987,Hellraiser is a brilliant and unforgettable Horror film that was the directorial debut of novelist CLive Barker and was the movie that introduced Barker and one of the all-time iconic characters in Pinhead to the world of Horror. During the time when Slasher movies were all the rage,Hellraiser was released and gave audiences something different and also gave audiences one of the most original,imaginative,twisted and bizarre Horror movies of all-time and one of the finest genre films of the 1980s. Hellraiser is a truly depraved but incredible work of Horror that is like a nightmare coming to life that is ugly,bleak and is a movie that offers no salvation for viewers and puts viewers who are watching the movie through hell and back. Hellraiser is unique because it was the film where S&M was combined with Horror and Fantasy showing viewers a frightening world where somethings are turned on it's headtorture is fun,pain is good mixing together with themes such as murder,death,sex and lust. The scares and terror in Hellraiser are nonstop and they don't happen with jump scares but with the horrific things that the characters go through. The movie is also scary because of the atmosphere which is surrounded by darkness and dread that hangs over the movie like a tightrope and never stops until the very end and when you watch the movie you will feel like no one is safe in any way shape or form. The blood and gore in Hellraiser is effective,brutal and will make you sick to your stomach with it's harshness and will give viewers nightmares for years because it's not just blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore it's there for a reason and makes an impact. Despite Pinhead being on the poster and being the face of the Hellraiser franchise the movie is really about the human characters and the things they go through as well as their interactions with one another and how they deal with the chaos going on in the film. Most Horror movies are never without memorable monsters and in Hellraiser the memorable monsters come in the form of Pinhead(in this film he listed as Lead Cenobite)and the Cenobites. While the Cenobites are only in the movie for a short time(5 to 10 minutes)they add to the movies nightmarish tone because what sets Pinhead and the Cenobites from other Horror villains in the first Hellraiser is that while they are not really good they are not always evil they are Demons to some,Angels to others. The Cenobites come from this puzzle box that is dangerous for the owner because if you open it the Cenobites appear and use chains and hooks to inflict pain or pleasure to the person who owns it which is terrifying and creepy. The Cenobites also have a look that is unique with black leather and different looks with their facesthere's Pinhead,one with no eyes and big teeth,one with a hole in their throat and a butterball with sunglasses. Pinhead and the Cenobites are classic characters you will never forget as long as you live. The ending of Hellraiser is fantastic and is filled with thrills,terror and lots of surprises that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Ashley Laurence is outstanding and beautiful as Kristy,the heroine of the film. Andrew Robinson is wonderful as Larry Cotton,Kristy's Father. Claire Higgins is terrific as Julia,Larry's cheating Wife. Sean Chapman is great as Frank Cotton,Larry's Brother. Oliver Smith is superb as Skinless Frank\/Frank The Monster,the villain in the film.

Highly Recommended. 10\/10. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"29 July 2015","score":"","review":" Hellraiser is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,scary and unforgettable Horror classic that combines terrific direction,a fine cast,great special effects and an amazing score. All of those elements make Hellraiser Clive Barker and Horror movies at their best.Based on the novella The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker,Hellraiser tells the story about Husband and wife Larry(Andrew Robinson)and Julia Cotton(Clarie Higgins)who have moved into Larry's childhood home. While there Julia discovers the skinless but alive body of Frank Cotton(Sean Chapman,Oilver Smith)Larry's brother and Julia's former lover who has escaped the clutches of monsters called Cenobites who exist in a puzzle box that when opened unleashes pain and Horror. Frank decides to use Julie to help him get some blood and skin which leads to terror and chaos.Released in 1987,Hellraiser is a brilliant and unforgettable Horror film that was the directorial debut of novelist CLive Barker and was the movie that introduced Barker and one of the all-time iconic characters in Pinhead to the world of Horror. During the time when Slasher movies were all the rage,Hellraiser was released and gave audiences something different and also gave audiences one of the most original,imaginative,twisted and bizarre Horror movies of all-time and one of the finest genre films of the 1980s. Hellraiser is a truly depraved but incredible work of Horror that is like a nightmare coming to life that is ugly,bleak and is a movie that offers no salvation for viewers and puts viewers who are watching the movie through hell and back. Hellraiser is unique because it was the film where S&M was combined with Horror and Fantasy showing viewers a frightening world where somethings are turned on it's headtorture is fun,pain is good mixing together with themes such as murder,death,sex and lust. The scares and terror in Hellraiser are nonstop and they don't happen with jump scares but with the horrific things that the characters go through. The movie is also scary because of the atmosphere which is surrounded by darkness and dread that hangs over the movie like a tightrope and never stops until the very end and when you watch the movie you will feel like no one is safe in any way shape or form. The blood and gore in Hellraiser is effective,brutal and will make you sick to your stomach with it's harshness and will give viewers nightmares for years because it's not just blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore it's there for a reason and makes an impact. Despite Pinhead being on the poster and being the face of the Hellraiser franchise the movie is really about the human characters and the things they go through as well as their interactions with one another and how they deal with the chaos going on in the film. Most Horror movies are never without memorable monsters and in Hellraiser the memorable monsters come in the form of Pinhead(in this film he listed as Lead Cenobite)and the Cenobites. While the Cenobites are only in the movie for a short time(5 to 10 minutes)they add to the movies nightmarish tone because what sets Pinhead and the Cenobites from other Horror villains in the first Hellraiser is that while they are not really good they are not always evil they are Demons to some,Angels to others. The Cenobites come from this puzzle box that is dangerous for the owner because if you open it the Cenobites appear and use chains and hooks to inflict pain or pleasure to the person who owns it which is terrifying and creepy. The Cenobites also have a look that is unique with black leather and different looks with their facesthere's Pinhead,one with no eyes and big teeth,one with a hole in their throat and a butterball with sunglasses. Pinhead and the Cenobites are classic characters you will never forget as long as you live. The ending of Hellraiser is fantastic and is filled with thrills,terror and lots of surprises that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Ashley Laurence is outstanding and beautiful as Kristy,the heroine of the film. Andrew Robinson is wonderful as Larry Cotton,Kristy's Father. Claire Higgins is terrific as Julia,Larry's cheating Wife. Sean Chapman is great as Frank Cotton,Larry's Brother. Oliver Smith is superb as Skinless Frank\/Frank The Monster,the villain in the film. Doug Bradley is brilliant and frightening as Pinhead,Lead Cenobite,one Horror films all-time great characters. Nicolas Vincent(Chattering Cenobite),Simon Bamford('Butterball' Cenobite)and Grace Kirby(Female Cenobite)are terrific as the other Cenobites. Robert Hines is decent as Steve,Kristy's boyfriend.The direction by Clive Barker is amazing and stylish,with Barker giving the movie a solid atmosphere and stunning look that is frightening and eerie.

Together with an old Indian fighter and a gambler, they help a rancher and his family fight a rival rancher that is trying to steal their water.El Dorado is another one of many collaborations between Howard Hawks and John Wayne, and this was one of the last ones that they did together. Personally, while I did like the movie, it's basically something that a lot of us have probably seen before. What I mean by that is, El Dorado is more or less a rehash of an earlier John Wayne\/Howard Hawks collaboration, 1959's classic, Rio Bravo. Granted, I don't believe this movie is horrible, as I did enjoy it, I just believe that Rio Bravo is the superior movie. Perhaps if I had seen this movie before I saw Rio Bravo, I might have enjoyed it more. John Wayne and Robert Mitchum were both good, and Hawks did a good job directing, but since I had seen Rio Bravo, I was rather obvious that this movie contained a lot from the aforementioned movie, and was sort of predictable in several instances. But nevertheless, the movie did have many things going for it, so it wasn't all that bad of a picture.Robert Mitchum gave the best performance in the movie, he plays a drunken sheriff who teams up with John Wayne to fight a rival rancher who is trying to steal water belonging to a family. James Caan was okay in his role as sidekick Mississippi. John Wayne was good too, but Mitchum was the best in my point of view. However, I don't think that Wayne was as good in this movie as he was in Rio Bravo. In Rio Bravo, he was absolutely superb, but in this movie, he was only on the level of good. Hawks directed this movie well, but he didn't quite give it the same edge with the same amount of energy as the one that he gave Rio Bravo seven years earlier.One problem I had was with the costumes. Nearly everybody in the movie were wearing clothes that did not suit the Western setting. Except for Robert Mitchum, whose clothes looked like somebody had thrown up on them, everyone looked like their clothes had been washed and ironed, which isn't something that was very common in a Western setting.All in all, while this movie is nowhere near as great as Rio Bravo, it still has a few things that make it worth a view. If you do decide to watch this movie, then it would probably be a good idea if you try not to imagine this movie as being a rehash or a remake of Rio Bravo. Like I said, I did like the movie, but I believe that Rio Bravo is the better movie. But who knows? You just may like this movie more than Rio Bravo, you might think that its a masterpiece.

Holly and Grizzard's Paul happen to meet one day in her building and become involved even though he's Neal's kept man, and she's already secretly married. In fact, she has many secrets of her own, and in this film version of Truman Capote's novelette, she's not as loose living even if she is a bit bizarre.Paul comes out of his shell when he's with Holly, doing things he normally wouldn't do which includes shoplifting, offering a librarian at the New York Public Library the opportunity to sign his book, and along with Hepburn, ordering a silver plated telephone dialer at Tiffany's. Through the cynical eyes of Truman Capote, the sharp direction of Blake Edwads and the elegant score of Henry Mancini, these characters from the best seller come alive, even though it's not totally perfect. Yet, it's become a beloved classic on screen even though there were two flop stage versions-one a musical that closed in previews and the other a straight play that managed to only run a month or so just a few years ago.Of course, Neal's aging socialite isn't quite so willing to let Peppard go, especially to somebody much younger and much more desirable, without a fight.

When she breaks into a chorus of Moon River while strumming a guitar out on her fire escape, you can't help but love her even if like Capote insisted, you find her miscast.

The grandmother together with the children is the one, two punch of painfully annoying. Luckily, she walks in the acid lake water, saving everybody, so we are rid of her the last half of the movie. The depiction of the eruption seemed quite geologically accurate, the Lahar, the ash clogging all the cars and machines; this was all well done. You will get to see why you do not take a helicopter out of an ash cloud. The other cringe worthy moment is when they outrun a pyroclastic flow. Please, they move at 130 MPH, you are not outrunning them. This is not as bad as driving over the molten lava but for anyone who had geology, it is silly. There is the requisite romance between Hamilton and Brosnan but it does not take up much screen time. The supporting cast is OK, a little weak in some areas, no Oscars here.This really is the paradox, Volcano cannot hold a candle to this movie in effects, writing or suspense; it has the best actor, Tommy Lee Jones but a little of Anne Heche goes a long way. Volcano is worth watching but this is the one to buy. The volcano effects are so stunning you will hardly notice anything else.

Look at they way she's the fuel behind the conversation, a driving force one intellectual level above her verbal opponent. How, when in trouble, she doesn't collapse under pressure &#x97; instead, she, cigarette in hand, talks from the side of her mouth with striking sass, at once condescending and commanding. How she can merely lift an eyebrow in sly disdain and scare the sh-t out of the person sitting across from her. She's tough. She's smart. She's sexy. She's &#x85; Jackie Brown.To most, Pam Grier is an action heroine, a Coffy, a Foxy Brown, or a Friday Foster; she's the Queen of Blaxploitation &#x97; hell, she is the blaxploitation movie. But she's a cult favorite, a black Angelina Jolie of an era forgotten by most. And after the subgenre ended in the late 1970s, things changed for the leading lady. Most movie executives had no idea what to do with her (too resilient to be tossed aside as a meager love interest, too arousing to convince as a matronly, sexless authority figure), so she spent the majority of the '80s and '90s philandering around in thankless supporting roles that could hardly capture her brassy appeal. So Hallelujah Quentin Tarantino noticed her past highs while working as a video store clerk before he became the boy wonder of the independent movie giving her the role of a lifetime, Jackie Brown is the movie Pam Grier was born to star in. Not cheap, not badly written, not supported by a bundle of terrible actors, not hastily directed, she no longer is the best thing in a bad movie (a characteristic most of her best films kept in their chest pocket for everyone to see); she's the best thing in a great movie, and by 1997, it was about time.In Jackie Brown, Grier is as badass as Coffy ever was, but she's also quite a bit wiser, a tough cookie all grown up. Jackie is 44-years-old, a stewardess for the worst airline in America, and makes a disappointing salary of $16,000 a year. She's had trouble with the law before, but in her middle-age she's become much more methodical about her criminal actions, preferring to keep things low-key enough to keep herself happy and the cops oblivious. Currently, she acts as a smuggler for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a corrupted arms dealer so closely monitored by the ATF that he's forced to work with an odd assortment of runners for the sake of keeping business afloat.Things turn sour one day when, en route to work, Jackie is stopped by a couple of ATF agents, who find Ordell's dirty money and a few ounces of hard drugs in her handbag. She spends the next few days is prison, eventually finding bail through Max Cherry (Robert Forster), a worn-out bondsman. Following her release, the ATF presents her with two options she can either (1) avoid jail time and direct them to one of Ordell's schemes by acting as a courier once again or (2) go directly back to her jail cell and forget that they ever offered her such a deal. The scrappy Jackie chooses option one, but she's never been one satisfied working alongside the law or following the orders of a street smart but academically winded guns dealer. So she comes up with her own plan double-cross both parties (telling the heat she's going to betray Ordell,, telling Ordell she's going to betray the heat), run away with $500,000, and buy a one-way ticket to Spain and start life anew, with lavishness.Whereas all of Tarantino's films deal with violence as part of the aesthetic, Jackie Brown trades pulp fervor for insanely sharp exchanges of dialogue, the only carnage occurring offscreen while the characters size each other up and entertain us with their canny games of one-oneupmanship. Much of his mainstream success depends on the ruthlessly funny intrigue of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but look closely &#x97; while not so tongue-in-cheek, the cunning Jackie Brown quite possibly delivers his finest screenplay, so endlessly amusing that there are a number of moments that call for near inescapable applause. The climactic money exchange, conceived in the same style as 1956's The Killing, is so ingeniously drawn that I found myself laughing in delight, not because so much of it's humorous (which a lot of it is), but in disbelief. Call Tarantino an idiot savant of the cinema all you want &#x97; but he's brilliant.Equally brilliant is the accomplished cast &#x97; with no obvious supporting characters, the performers are of equivalent importance in pushing the lustrous plot forward. Grier is a sensation as the titular character, a victorious combination of sexy and too da-n tired; Jackson is as threatening as he is inexplicably winsome. Forster provides an amiable straight man who loves Jackie too much for his own good, De Niro is lucrative as Ordell's dim-witted, raging partner-in-crime, and Bridget Fonda, who gives the most uproarious supporting performance (in a movie of unlimited uproarious supporting performances), is hilarious as Ordell's pot-smoking, surfer-girl mistress.It's less grandiose than Tarantino's other movies, but Jackie Brown is a masterpiece nonetheless, with a screenplay dressed to kill and a leading lady ready to smack all the Julianne Moores and Sandra Bullocks out of the picture and provide a leading lady to be reckoned with. If you're as smitten with the film as I am, you'll know what I mean when I say I never wanted it to end.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"29 July 2015","score":"","review":" For comedy\/dramas or dramedies as one might call this form of film, the blend of humor and human characters is essential to creating believable story lines. The way of going about this has been done multiple ways. A frequently picked method of execution is the separate story threads conjoining at the finale direction. Although not anything new, it is a common way of telling individual stories that share a common theme and then bring them together at the end for one grand congregation. The most recent movie that came to mind when thinking of this type of storytelling goes to John Herzfeld's Reach Me (2014). Although entirely stepped on by official critics, it wasn't entirely a waste of a film. It was quick on the draw for certain parts of its script but it also had a positive overall message about improving oneself as a person using unique characters. In some respects, the way this movie was presented felt somewhat in the same vein. Different groups of people from various areas of the U.S. enter a karaoke contest in the hopes of being awarded $5,000 as the winner. Along their travels, they learn things about themselves and each other. Sounds simplistic enough right? It is in fact, but this is not the problem. The issue lies underneath all that once looked at under a closer lens. The screenplay, written by John Byrum (The Razor's Edge (1984) and Mahogany (1975)) suffers from three factors. One is that the movie cannot find a clear tone in its entirety and its three independent story lines. One story is about a selfish karaoke hustler named Ricky Dean (Huey Lewis) who discovers after his distant wife passed away left him his daughter Liv (Gwyneth Paltrow). Then there's Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti), a rundown salesman who gets tired of the same old same old and leaves his life behind while running into just released convict Reggie Kane (Andre Braugher). Lastly is Billy (Scott Speedman), a guy who just got cheated on and discovers new girl Suzi Loomis (Maria Bello) who has a knack for getting what she wants by sacrificing her dignity.It's difficult to say which story feels the most sympathetic. The father\/daughter struggle could've been heartwarming all the way through but instead is kicked around as a nuisance and is only quickly reconciled later on. The adventure salesman\/convict thread only seems to get more uncontrollably rash and negatively misunderstood the longer the characters are on screen. As for the lonely guy\/new girl parable, the play out often feels like a dark raunchy comedy that was meant for another film entirely. With all the inconsistent tones, the film as a whole doesn't work that well. What exactly are you trying to be movie? Unfortunately with the confusing tone brings up the second issue with the screenplay and that's the story lines not complimenting each other in some way. How does one find a comparison between these three- mismatched story threads? Finally, the last issue (which is probably the biggest and most noticeable) is that the whole concept of karaoke isn't of main focus for a lot of the running time. It's actually more of a backdrop and that's rather sad due to the pros that are about to be listed next.As much as the problems mentioned prior bring down the film a lot, there are positives to bring up and these points at least show it had the potential to be better. For one, the acting is solid. Every main character has a certain personality and the actor portraying that character fits it nicely. Even Huey Lewis, for the small amount of times he's acted plays it cool (although arrogant). Paul Giamatti gets more and more psychotic as time progresses and his dialog gets more and more garbled. Maria Bello with a Southern accent is different and her attitude is quite sharp. This is just a few from the tip of the iceberg. Now if only the characters were actually written better. Also just for fun, there are a couple of cameos viewers may not be aware of. For one, Michael Bublé has an obvious appearance but is still fun to see him doing what he does best (singing that is). There's even a quick shot of Terminator (1984) director James Cameron having some fun. Weird but intriguing.The cinematography was adequate too. Shot by Paul Sarossy (Exotica (1994) and The Sweet Hereafter (1997)), there's a mix of outside and inside shots. However even for inside camera-work Sarossy manages to keep the camera moving substantially without being distracting. This at least gives the audience something to look at and get an idea of where they are and the scale at which the setting is taking place. Finally the music, which is a mix of instrumental score but mostly singing was good. The best part of this film is seeing the actors actually sing. Other than Huey Lewis (for obvious reasons) singing, who knew Gwyneth Paltrow, Paul Giamatti, Andre Braugher and Maria Bello could sing so well? It was very believable and certainly made the performance feel a tad more emotional. Again though, if only those characters were written better. The best sung song from the film would be the popular single Cruisin' (originally by Smokey Robinson) covered by Huey Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow. A very smooth and enjoyable song. The score produced by familiar composer David Newman was also appropriate. It was anonymous but useful for the scenes required, this time.Sadly even with catchy songs sung legitimately by the actors, good camera-work and solid acting, the entire execution is just a hodgepodge of ideas that don't coalesce as easy as it should have. The individual story lines don't match in tone, which doesn't make the film understandable in its message and the whole concept of karaoke isn't focused on like the premise promotes. It had potential but wasn't utilized properly.

Many were annoyed at the temporal juxtaposition of Vito and Michael. Believe me, nobody hates temporal jumping back and forth than more I do but it is used by Coppola for dramatic contrast. What you will notice is what we knew about Michael already The Outsider. From the first, in The Godfather, he sits at the farthest periphery of the family, on the outskirts on the family. This is an existential metaphor for Michael himself. He is barely in the family, just barely. My favorite scene contains the essence to understanding Michael versus the family Patriarch Vito. At the end, after having Fredo shot, we see a flashback where Sonny, Hagen, Fredo are all sitting at the table waiting for Vito's birthday cake. When Michael tells them he has defied Vito and enlisted for WW2, Sonny has to be restrained from kicking the crap out of him. Watch Michael's contempt for Hagen, You talked to my father about my future? Then, they all file out leaving Michael alone in the room; fade back to the future. Coppola zooms in on Michael's face, half of it goes into total darkness. Get the Message? He is not in the family; he is a loner. The darkness is his personality; he is much more evil and ruthless than Vito.Vito always had Fredo out of the picture somewhere, drive the car, later he sends him to Vegas to keep him away from messing up the family business. Michael will not tolerate his dangerous stupidity. Watch the contempt when Fredo lectures Michael on how he wants respect and he has been passed over. This after almost getting Michael killed twice once in his house, the other time in Cuba. This is the reason for going back and forth. Coppola wants you to see that Vito is plenty ruthless, in the killing of Fannuci, and returning for vengeance to Sicily. But Vito is the family patriarch, he simply could not kill Carlo in the original. He retired and made Michael do it. The bad news is that Michael changed from that experience. He waits to kill Fredo, just like he did for Carlo in the original. His coldness darkens the film deeply.His cruelty to Kay, Connie, Fredo, even his own children, closing the kitchen door on her while turning and glaring at his children is not a pretty sight. The man is nothing like Vito. We see Vito making friends with Clemenza and Tessio, using his influence to protect Signora who has been ejected with her children into the street. He has a warmth and caring underneath all the evil and power on the surface. Michael Corleone is a walking iceberg; pure cold ruthless evil devoid of all forgiveness. He seeks explanation for his deviation from his mother, she tells him he can never lose his family. Michael blames the times, wrong, he is not Vito; also, he never really was nor wanted to be in this family. Vito's near assassination, in the original, sucked him into the family business. He came in but he retains his contempt and icy separation. Watch him turn on Hagen,Are you coming with me on this, otherwise you can take your wife and your mistress and leave. This is the difference; Kay is not Mama Coreleone to him; she is a baby machine to produce heirs. This is a great movie, I simply find the depth of his evil darkens the movie considerably.Michael's killing of Fredo is not an anomaly. The man kills anyone he perceives to be a threat or an enemy. Hagen triggers him by saying the truth,You've won, is it necessary to wipe everyone out? Vito would not have, Michael changed when he killed Carlo in the original. Fredo pays the price; he is cold as a serial killer. A great movie, it is in my inventory; I must admit I rarely watch it, too ugly and depressing.
