The film is full of those tired horror cliches that were old back in the early 80's, where Horror was at its peak.

The biggest Horror cliche of them all is tacked on at the end for the invevitable series of sequels, spinning out endlessly.

At last we have a film that gives us raw emotions and romance and lets us dream of true love, passions, beauty and tragedy without any of the usual sarcasm and ugly bitterness and disillusions of modern films where love and tenderness are ugly words.Titanic lets us escape and experience something greater andmore important than the usual self-preoccupied and self-analyzing plots of the modern film. It is a complete return to the bigger-than-life characters and drama of the old classics and its huge success proves that people are desperately searching for a sense of tenderness, warmth and true love that this film succeeds so beautifully to convey.The emotional impact of Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's performances is almost unique in its strength and through their extraordinarily beautiful and expressive faces we suddenly stop being ourselves and become one with them and their love and passion, devotion and sacrifice.Visually this is one of the most stunningly, breathtakingly beautiful films ever made. The colours are brilliant and luminous, and there is an unusual shimmer and depth to the light which adds to the beauty.James Horner's music is truly haunting and profoundly romantic. It masterfully blends with the visual drama and enhances the emotional experience in a unique way.The performances of every actor and actress are excellent, and there is no weakness anywhere which is unusual and which typifies an outstanding film. In my view Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is grossly and unfairly underrated as his acting is intimately connected with Kate Winslet's to the point where they are artistically inseparable. He should clearly have been nominated for an Oscar alongside Kate Winslet and their contributions to cinema history should have afforded them both with Oscar statuettes, which went as so often before to inferior but politically more correct performers.However, the ultimate reward is of course the fact that Titanic will always remain one of the greatest and best loved films in history.Caroline FridSWEDENcaroline.frid@malmo.mail.telia.com ","genre":null},{"date":"10 October 1998","score":"","review":"  Titanic is the most emotionally powerful and visually beautiful film created in a long time. At last we have a film that gives us raw emotions and romance and lets us dream of true love, passions, beauty and tragedy without any of the usual sarcasm and ugly bitterness and disillusions of modern films where love and tenderness are ugly words.Titanic lets us escape and experience something greater andmore important than the usual self-preoccupied and self-analyzing plots of the modern film. It is a complete return to the bigger-than-life characters and drama of the old classics and its huge success proves that people are desperately searching for a sense of tenderness, warmth and true love that this film succeeds so beautifully to convey.The emotional impact of Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's performances is almost unique in its strength and through their extraordinarily beautiful and expressive faces we suddenly stop being ourselves and become one with them and their love and passion, devotion and sacrifice.Visually this is one of the most stunningly, breathtakingly beautiful films ever made. The colours are brilliant and luminous, and there is an unusual shimmer and depth to the light which adds to the beauty.James Horner's music is truly haunting and profoundly romantic. It masterfully blends with the visual drama and enhances the emotional experience in a unique way.The performances of every actor and actress are excellent, and there is no weakness anywhere which is unusual and which typifies an outstanding film. In my view Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is grossly and unfairly underrated as his acting is intimately connected with Kate Winslet's to the point where they are artistically inseparable. He should clearly have been nominated for an Oscar alongside Kate Winslet and their contributions to cinema history should have afforded them both with Oscar statuettes, which went as so often before to inferior but politically more correct performers.However, the ultimate reward is of course the fact that Titanic will always remain one of the greatest and best loved films in history.Caroline FridSWEDENcaroline.frid@malmo.mail.telia.com ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"10 October 1998","score":"","review":"  Titanic is the most emotionally powerful and visually beautiful film created in a long time.
