The characters are all so obsessive, neurotic and downright oddball that the film makes love seem more like a bizarre illness than something to be cherished.The narrative is awkwardly split into two distinct stories, both involving mopey guys who are mooning over girlfriends they've lost. The two guys are pretty similar - they're both nice, passive, quirky, and cops - so I wonder why the film-makers felt the need to tell two separate stories in the first place. Why not flesh out one or the other more thoroughly? Or do a proper anthology with lots of shorts about love?Despite their weirdness, the characters are endearing, but their behavior often veers away from realism and into the realm of what I call movie-land. It seems implausible, for example, that a woman would fall in love with a complete stranger, and then decide to gradually clean and refurbish his apartment, when he's not home and without his knowledge, over the course of several weeks. That kind of behavior is sort of insane, isn't it? In real life, it'd get you arrested. It stretches credibility even further that it appears to take this guy forever to notice the changes to his surroundings, and when he finally does notice, he discusses the matter with a bar of soap. That's what I mean by movie-land. Compounding my irritation, the characters sometimes decide to wax poetic about their personal philosophies, in that mock-deep movie way, saying things like people remind me of expired cans of pineapples or some such rubbish. Is this really deep, or is it just like that old Saturday Night Live sketch, Deep Thoughts by Jack Handy? Thankfully, Chungking Express is somewhat elevated by interesting shots of Hong Kong and energetic (but occasionally tiresome) hand-held camera work. The narrative has a disjointed feeling that is both a plus (it forces you to watch events closely, which is good) and a minus (because sometimes it's too confusing). In the first story, for example, I quickly lost track of exactly what on earth the woman in the blonde wig was up to, and who she happened to be shooting at each particular moment.It sounds like I really hated this movie, but I didn't. I just think it fits into that category of art-house movies that really aren't so great. I applaud it for being experimental and daring, but I don't think it really sheds a lot of light on the human condition. It's too slick and self-consciously over-the-top to achieve that particular goal.

Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine did a great job doing their roles. As for the ending, I really liked this ending far better than Hitchcock's ending. The audience simply refused to accept Cary Grant as the murderer. So RKO didn't want Cary Grant to become a villain in the end.So Hitchcock ended up making a different ending where Cary Grant is not guilty. It does make more sense than the original ending, because everything we are watching in the movie is in Lina's point of view except the ending. When the current ending was added, I think the film ended up becoming more of a psychological study on Lina.I think Johnnie is more like a ghostly figure to Lina with many roles. For Example, he suddenly appears to Lina after Lina writes a letter that she is leaving him in the middle of the film. Another Example is Johnnie (door scene) suddenly appears to Lina and Beaky when they are talking about the corporation. Another scene is after Beaky's death. Johnnie suddenly appears in front of Lina right after she finds out that Johnnie left the club yesterday morning.There is another major question that we should look into. The question is who is Johnnie? We see him in different roles throughout the film. We see him as a playboy, romantic person, a good friend to Beaky, Immature and lazy husband, mysterious husband, a thief, and as a murderer. But which will you pick? This also gives a psychological question to the audience - who are you? That is why I like Suspicion far better than the book Before the Fact.But I don't believe he is a murderer. If he was looking for money, then he would have married a woman who was far more rich. Not only that Lina's father didn't like Johnnie. And Johnnie knew that.We even see Lina saying this in the beginning of the movie Oh, I know you didn't marry me for my money. You could have done much better elsewhere. Beaky knew that Johnnie lies. But he knew that Johnnie is a person who doesn't destroy the lives of others. That is the reason why he visited Johnnie often. Not only that, Beaky was a good friend of Johnnie since his childhood. And Johnnie was broken all of his life financially. Lina's suspicion starts only after their marriage. If Johnnie was responsible for the death of Beaky, then he would have been focusing on getting the profits from Corporation. The Corporation is still in place, because Beaky wasn't able to sink the corporation. So if he was the murderer, he wouldn't have applied for a loan out of Lina's life insurance policy.If Johnnie isn't a murderer, then what is the reason for the increase of Suspicion?Lina's Suspicions increase only after her father's death. Her father's death was very shocking for her. So this might have been one of the reasons that led to the increase in her Suspicion. The audience should also notice that it was Lina, who bought Murder on the Footbridge. And it was Lina who spelled Murder (Anagram). And Suddenly, she started imagining Johnnie killing Beaky.Audience completely travel with Lina after that. In Lina's mind, there is also an internal conflict between her and her father about Johnnie. Lina's father didn't like Johnnie. Even Johnnie mentions it in the beginning of the film (Portrait Scene after the Hunt Ball). And Lina was against her father. This conflict continues even after her father's death. For Example, Lina talking to her father's portrait - He didn't go to Paris. He didn't go to Paris. I tell you. She fears that her father's opinion on Johnnie may come true. This may have been a major reason for the increase of her suspicion. As for the testimony of the waiter, it isn't clear if Johnnie is the murderer. This is because French waiter only has a slight understanding of English. So its also highly possible that Beaky was talking about Old Bean, but not talking to Old Bean. French Waiter says Old Beam or Holby referring to Old Bean. So we know how much he understood the conversation.If you like suspense movies, then this is a great movie. It confuses the audience a lot.
