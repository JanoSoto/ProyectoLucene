Perhaps the most striking deviation from classic film is his use of hyper-saturated digital colours. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is Rohmer's way of creating a living 18th century oil painting. But as the other reviewers also have pointed out, it's not always convincing. Indeed there are a handful of magnificent scenes where he succeeds. For a split second you're not sure if the camera is focused on a fancy Rococo painting...until suddenly the characters begin to move and talk. But the problem arises once the gimmick wears off, and those same vivid images begin to look like cheap CGI trickery, common in low budget made-for-TV films.The next biggest flaw--an bizarre oversight which I can't fathom--is the lack of music except at the very beginning and the very end. If this movie is indeed an aristocrat's view of late 18th century France, complete with impeccable costumes and fancy furniture, shouldn't there be, at the very least, an occasional Mozart, Rousseau or Bréval sonata in the soundtrack to help us settle into the period? Instead the scenes are awkwardly silent. I never realized how distracting it can be to NOT have music in a film!Last topic character development. We get a nice performance from Lucy Russell as the Englishwoman (she did an excellent job of creating a Parisian accent tainted with Scottish roots, and when she dumbs it down in the scenes where she's pretending to be a tourist, it's very impressively done). But unfortunately I feel like hers was the only character that had any soul. Jean-Claude Dreyfus (the Duke), who was riveting in DELICATESSEN as the heartless villain, and equally memorable in CITY OF LOST CHILDREN as the big ole softy, never seemed to have a clear character in this film. This, I believe, is the fault of the director. He should have given Dreyfus a few closeups to allow us to see that very expressive face of his. Instead, I recall seeing only full body shots and profiles where we're not sure how genuine he is. The result is that you never trust the Duke at his words; you never know if he's a good guy or a bad guy. It also doesn't help that the Lady is constantly flip-flopping her affections\/hatred toward him. The resulting character confusion leads to us, the audience, becoming apathetic and distanced from the Duke.The story itself is very interesting, but I won't get into that because I don't want to ruin anything if you decide to see the film. Overall... I really don't know what to think of this. It held my interest for two hours but was never quite satisfying. Watch it on a rainy day and judge for yourself.

To tell you the truth, according to its making's circumstances (2 years of its leads' ages !!) then it's a black comedy already !. Hmmm, maybe it's a horror movie, for sure when I review my memory of watching it, I discover how it's a ruthless horror indeed, it even managed to give me nightmares after (and ironically I'm not kidding !). Actually it could be one of the most anti-western civilization films ever, cursing the killer materialism, and unspiritual thinking which led the human to immerse in sex and get lost through its deepest aberrant ways. (Stanley Kubrick) wanted to make a different satire against the wide eyes shut's belief, disgracing all of his community by the shame of being wildly blind, crazy about coitus with or without love, being bodies kill each other or themselves for fun, as if humans became the worst animals. The film tried to be an ominous of this civilization's end. And that's great. Yet theoretically. Because Mr. perfectionist-in-a very-sick-way (Stanley Kubrick)'s ultimate result out of that was something totally uninteresting, and highly disappointing. Humdrum, tasteless, and one of the blandest. The list would go endlessly. Originally it's highly thoughtful but obviously not as great as what it handles. At first you'd feel how the story is sort of expressing as a simple and symbolic one that can epitomize its cosmos, lampoon it, and insinuate to its death, though it sounded eventually forced and not to mention spiritless. The long very long shots weren't for the sake of scrutiny inasmuch as the sake of being sleepy or unbearable. The editing transformed the whole matter into one big slow enema. (Tom Cruise) is the best paradox when it comes to soil the American dream or looking misguided childish but despite how he tried he wasn't that important actor to represent any possible depths. Some of the image details looked primitive (the newspaper's title  How lucky that you're alive or some things like that !). Everything ranges rather between ambiguous or naive. All the mind games that (Kubrick) loves to play (deliberate image goofs for instance) went to nothing, that dreamlike scene was done so dully, or maybe they're just goofs after all !. Even the piano music so the classic records were very monotonous and blank, stealing the movie's spirit. It looked wholly lifeless.

It feels like a documentary !. It ended up having the sad irony of  good premise, bad film. I suppose (Kubrick) did it wide eyes shut himself !. To sum it up, it's a film where the only actual good things about it, else being so creepy, are seeing (Nicole Kidman) naked, and the moment of her saying the F word at the end so tenderly; although it's a smart, so cynical, ending for the film, but sorrowfully it could work as a thing you would say about watching it as well !!

After being escorted out of one town, Joey lands in San Francisco without two cents to rub together but with a devilish glint in his eye. After initially struggling to find work, he meets up with old pal, Ned Galvin, and lands a regular spot as MC at a club run by Mike Miggins, but where there's music and lights there are women, and Joey is going to be caught between a rock and a hard place.Pal Joey has quite a story to go with it, based on John O'Hara's New Yorker stories, it was brought to life on Broadway in 1940 by Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart. Tho not the roaring success they hoped for, and starring Gene Kelly as Joey, the play had raised many an eyebrow and turned many a cheek in the process. Columbia mogul Harry Cohn wanted to bring it to the silver screen, inking names such as Cary Grant, James Cagney, Irene Dunne, Gloria Swanson and Ethel Merman to the project, but in spite of his tough reputation, Cohn binned the idea due to it being inappropriate for wartime audiences. Into the 50s and Cohn, clearly with the bit between his teeth, was desperate to get this story into the cinema's of America. Marlon Brando was mooted to play Joey this time, but after using, and reigniting his career in From Here To Eternity, Cohn went for Frank Sinatra and shifted the plot from being about a heel dancer, to that of a singer, thus putting Gene Kelly's nose out of joint in the process; something the dapper dancer was rumoured to carry around with him forever more. The two female leads went to Rita Hayworth as the ageing rich widow, Vera Simpson something she was most displeased about and rising hot bod Kim Novak as Linda English.Pal Joey the picture has divided many a critic since its release in 1957, many feeling that the cynical and racy aspects of the source being absent really do devalue the piece. Things were watered down thanks to the intervention of the Production Code and thus the character of Joey Evans is a sort of troubled hero as opposed to the worm heel he was in the original offerings. But what remains is to me still a right entertaining picture, Sinatra is fabulous, crooning out the likes of The Lady Is A Tramp and I Could Write A Book, while the music of Rodgers and Hart firmly warm the old cockles on many a winters night. The sets, costumes, choreography and sound are first rate, while the editing from Viola Lawrence was rightly nominated for an Academy Award. But as a fan I am of both leading ladies, it hurts me a little to say that they annoy me in the picture. Hayworth looks disinterested, the resentment of playing the older woman clearly influencing her efforts, whilst Novak may well be gorgeous and her delightful hips swing as much as the music--she's miscast a touch and feels like sexiness over thought of character.Still the annoyances in the picture are not enough to stop me from being a fan of the picture. I can't help but tap my feet and grin from ear to ear all thru it, and then when the glorious colourful end arrives I feel rewarded for my time and involvement with the movie. Not perfect for sure, but to this particular viewer, Joey most definitely is my pal. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 December 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Joey Evans is a fabulous singer, he's also a full blown womaniser.

Columbia mogul Harry Cohn wanted to bring it to the silver screen, inking names such as Cary Grant, James Cagney, Irene Dunne, Gloria Swanson and Ethel Merman to the project, but in spite of his tough reputation, Cohn binned the idea due to it being inappropriate for wartime audiences. Into the 50s and Cohn, clearly with the bit between his teeth, was desperate to get this story into the cinema's of America. Marlon Brando was mooted to play Joey this time, but after using, and reigniting his career in From Here To Eternity, Cohn went for Frank Sinatra and shifted the plot from being about a heel dancer, to that of a singer, thus putting Gene Kelly's nose out of joint in the process; something the dapper dancer was rumoured to carry around with him forever more. The two female leads went to Rita Hayworth as the ageing rich widow, Vera Simpson something she was most displeased about and rising hot bod Kim Novak as Linda English.Pal Joey the picture has divided many a critic since its release in 1957, many feeling that the cynical and racy aspects of the source being absent really do devalue the piece. Things were watered down thanks to the intervention of the Production Code and thus the character of Joey Evans is a sort of troubled hero as opposed to the worm heel he was in the original offerings. But what remains is to me still a right entertaining picture, Sinatra is fabulous, crooning out the likes of The Lady Is A Tramp and I Could Write A Book, while the music of Rodgers and Hart firmly warm the old cockles on many a winters night. The sets, costumes, choreography and sound are first rate, while the editing from Viola Lawrence was rightly nominated for an Academy Award. But as a fan I am of both leading ladies, it hurts me a little to say that they annoy me in the picture. Hayworth looks disinterested, the resentment of playing the older woman clearly influencing her efforts, whilst Novak may well be gorgeous and her delightful hips swing as much as the music--she's miscast a touch and feels like sexiness over thought of character.Still the annoyances in the picture are not enough to stop me from being a fan of the picture. I can't help but tap my feet and grin from ear to ear all thru it, and then when the glorious colourful end arrives I feel rewarded for my time and involvement with the movie. Not perfect for sure, but to this particular viewer, Joey most definitely is my pal. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"22 December 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Joey Evans is a fabulous singer, he's also a full blown womaniser.

There were several films I remember seeing when I was a kid growing up that would forever change my view of women, they were 'Barbarella', '1Million Years BC' & 'Good Grief It's Candy'. All I remembered about these movies were that there these women made me feel funny and awkward when I was watching them with my family.Years later when I revisited 'Barbarella' & '1Million Years BC' I watched them with a new viewpoint, I didn't feel awkward & appreciated Jane Fonda & Raquel Welch for who they were,beautiful strong women playing strong female lead characters in ever so slightly titillating movies. So, I unwrapped the DVD, put it in the player, told my girlfriend about it being a bizarre film that I saw when I was a kid & I couldn't really remember that much about the movie but there was a gorgeous girl who starred in it who I fancied when I was younger. Then I pressed 'play'.Everything started off great, brilliant opening, great soundtrack, dead trippy, wow, this is gonna be psychedelic. Wow, Burton, Coburn, Starr, Brando, amazing cast. My kinda film. Then I started to feel awkward again, like I did when I was a kid with my mom & dad sitting on the sofa next to me. But this time my girlfriend is sitting next to me.You all know the plot so I wont go over it again. Actings over the top from everyone except Ewa, who doesn't really act. Ewa Aulin, as I remembered, was still incredibly beautiful, but I forgot the actual subject matter of the movie. I think I was too young to understand it. I remember this movie was quite naughty. I kinda felt a little queasy half way through watching it.Don't get me wrong, it is a film that needs to be experienced purely to say you saw it to your mates. There were some proper funny moments, some wtf! moments & some moments you wouldn't want to watch with your girlfriend sitting next to you. I would recommend this to anyone who liked any kind of 'Grindhouse' purely for some of the strange direction & editing & exploitation (Tarantino must has ripped off some of this). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who takes anything literally (free your mind,man).As a comedy it was OK, not 'carry on..' or 'confessions of..', darker, much darker, more 'O Lucky Man' meets 'Magical Mystery Tour' with breasts & bums. As satire & a social commentary of the time it pretty much took the rip out of all the establishment, including hippies.I am still thinking about the movie a day on trying to suss out what it was trying to say, whether it was trying to say anything, whether it was one of the best or the worst films I have ever seen. My girlfriend & I had a chat for about an hour afterwards. Initially we both thought it was exploitative but as the conversation grew the question became who was getting exploited? Obviously Ewa Aulin was shown to be a naive irresistible beauty but I believe you needed Ewa as the catalyst to show the weakness of the men involved. Any man would have tried it on with Ewa given the chance, thus showing men really for what they are. Ewa reduced these men to primal beasts. My question was I know the men in the movie supposedly had the strength, but I believe Ewa had the power. No matter what their position or stature, they crumbled. The situations were extreme in the movie, with the outcome of Ewa getting her kit off & getting manhandled becoming more and more tiresome. Initially I laughed at the incest & other taboo quips, not believing the subject matter the movie was delving into. As the movie went on though, I started to realise it wasn't that funny, actually it was a little sad. It was supposed to be a psychedelic saucy romp & I started to feel nasty fancying Ewa all them years ago. I felt nasty watching the old movie stars groping Ewa.

This theory becomes skewed by the average cinematic use of the term, as many Hollywood productions simply take the true events tag as a framework for mainstream exploitation of real tragedies for entertainment purposes. But then there are films like Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures, which take potentially combustive subject matter, and rather than exploiting it for sensationalist entertainment, actually make a genuine attempt to mine the situation for emotional truth and nuance, taking a gruesome tragedy and turning it into a transcendent emotional portrait, all the more astonishing in the process. While Heavenly Creatures might have ended up a routinely melodramatic albeit morbid thriller, the endless innovations and quirks of director Peter Jackson transform the unsettling story into something infinitely more compelling. Unlike the majority of such cinematic murder mysteries, geared around cheap shocks and a consistently building sense of tension, Jackson's film is a true rarity through his willingness to allow the viewer to enter into the minds of his protagonists, sharing their dreamlike euphoria and hysteric fantasy world. What makes Heavenly Creatures truly eerie and unsettling is the intoxicating sense of delirious happiness throughout, evoking discomfort not from overly contrived ominous foreshadowing but from aligning the viewer with the characters depicted (with unsettling use of extracts from the diary entries of the real life Pauline), demonstrating their mental fragility in a compassionate but uncomfortably credible fashion, making the abrupt shift to visceral realism and violence all the more jarring and emotionally devastating. The uneasy immersion is aided by the enormous amount of care and attention devoted to visualizing the girls' fantasy world, exquisitely realized by pre-Lord of the Rings fame Weta workshop's brilliant character and set design, making a realm of 'clay people' come alive with commendable humanity and immediacy, while never abandoning the fantastic trappings, powerfully backed by the soaring musical score of Peter Dasent. Such attention to detail and moments of welcome humour (the girls' strange fixation with Orson Welles) makes empathy with characters who could have been dismissed as a pair of deranged psychotics in the hands of a less sensitive director becomes not only possible but almost inescapable. Jackson contrasts the relationship between the two girls with his candid portrait of repressive 1950s New Zealand, revelling in the delights of a much needed friendship fraught with honest emotion and imagination (while leaving ambiguous overtones as to the proximity of their relationship), before subtly increasing the tension, transposing the intensity from joyful to uncomfortable and subsequently manipulating the viewer's emotions to a disconcerting degree. The remarkable premise is truly brought to life by the astonishing performances of the two leads, both making their motion picture debuts, yet delivering more disturbingly powerful performances than most critically acclaimed actresses twice their age. The utter humanity both coax into their roles despite the sinister overtones makes the viewer's heart break, seeing the two not as monsters but as tragically mislead adolescents grasping desperately for companionship but getting carried away. As Pauline, Melanie Lynskey gives a performance of vastly further complexity, breadth and believability than the average cinematic social misfit child, her softly wounded expression hinting at the turmoil underneath and her diary voiceovers are truly stunning and chilling. Kate Winslet is similarly stunning as Juliet, her slow transition from defiant rich girl to being hysterically transfixed by her fantasy world is a truly masterful one, hinting at the superb performances yet to come. Sarah Peirse also delivers a fantastic performance as Pauline's compassionate yet traditionally repressive mother, and Peirse thankfully resists the temptation to make her character an outright villain but merely an honest human being bound by social conventions and concern for her daughter.Few films striving at such daring aims as Heavenly Creatures are met with such success not quite a biopic and hardly a murder mystery, but more of an honest portrait of a genuine friendship between two lost souls, whose intensity grows to potentially out of hand dimensions, all the while refusing to sensationalize the inevitable tragedy. Fuelled by the simply stunning performances of the two promising young actresses and Jackson's quirkily irrelevant yet vividly accurate direction, the film proves a perfect example of masterfully wrenching emotional storytelling, one worth examining for any in search of a draining yet fundamentally human drama.-9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 December 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" There is an odd societal catharsis film viewers seem to achieve through the billing based on a true story, as if by watching the cinematic re-creation of emotionally raw subject matter, further truth may be extracted from the circumstances or social closure may be obtained.

It's no surprise because that's really all the film is, a documented and filmed account of what it's like to rave and club; for the rest of us, it's a non-event; a moderately dramatic and slightly inventive drama about British young adults that try to kill off sensations of pain to do with stresses of work, flailing relationships and even the actual lack of them. Human Traffic is a very specific film in the sense it is going to appeal to a direct audience; the illusion that the audience are seeing something better than what it is lies in the surrealistic content that has wormed its way into the film thanks to other recent attempts at the time such as Trainspotting and The Acid House. On the other hand, the filmmakers are not fooling anyone else.The trouble with the film is its study of this particular mentality. The defining scene is about half way through the film in which a couple of the main characters stand on a stairway to a large, old manor house and systematically turn around to the camera to address us. If you're struggling for a visualisation, think the opening few seconds of the music video to that Spice Girls song from years back entitled 'Wannabe'. As they turn to face us, they talk and laugh in our direction about how brilliant the night's going to be and how they love doing what they do. The problem here is that rather than see the night through the eyes of one of the characters, the highs and lows but hopefully not too much of either without the highs glamorised; we are invited to see the scenes unfold through our own perspective that is the camera's POV.This means whatever viewpoint or opinion we have on these people and this lifestyle will stick throughout this sequence, meaning if you're into it you'll be loving it but if it's all alien to you in the first place, you'll probably be despising what's going on. We are not invited to participate through one of the characters, instead we must watch from outside the box as events unfold in a dreary fashion.The film is one of those driven by lifestyle and consequence rather than out and out narrative. There is a lot of narration establishing the life certain people lead as well as several scenes that kill time whilst coming across as quite eccentric afterthoughts, the scene in which everyone stands up in the pub and sings at the camera being one of them. Jip (Simm) is the narrator and is so all over the place, both in speech and movement, that he manages to go from mentioning Neil Armstrong to talking of Milky Bar chocolate bars in one monologue spanning about four seconds. Such is the nature of the film.Simm plays the character well, a sort of eccentric person who's on the brink between being perfectly normal and completely loosing his mind completely. Simm hates his life and 'lives for the weekend' where he can let loose and try to scratch that itch of not having had a partner in ages. Initially, Jip is conflicted on his lifestyle after all this time. He initially seems to be on the brink of an epiphany but he doesn't know it. It looks as if he's about to mature, questioning his lifestyle and coming to terms with the damage he's doing to himself. Unfortunately, the film does cop out towards the end with this idea and has Jip find a partner, thus halting the possible maturity stone dead. All of a sudden he's happy with his lifestyle and nothing seems so bad after all, which was disappointing.Along with Jip are Koop (Parkes); Lulu (Pilkington) and Moff (Dyer). What they get up to is slightly uninteresting at the best of times, their activity only demonised on the rare occasion Danny Dyer narrates what it's like to come down off drugs at a bash full of random people all doing the same thing. The film is all style, with its study of the British male in crisis filling in the rest. Jump cuts; breaking the fourth wall; subtitles and popular culture dialogue are the attempts at coming across as somewhat different to what you might have expected. For watching ravers, it'll add to the disillusioned sense they might already have while watching but for everyone else, it's just quite ordinary and often comes across as a bit of a gimmick.Very near the film's immediate beginning is a short monologue about how a 17 year old boy hopes to have sex for the first time on a night out with the characters. This will instil some viewers with dread as to what might come; others will probably laugh their heads off and miss the subsequent thirty seconds of the film through that laughter. Human Traffic can be added to list containing Trainspotting and The Acid House as surrealist, realist drama comedies made in Britain around about the turn of the decade. It isn't as good as those films because it doesn't feel grounded. The film might just as well have been shot with real ravers on a real night out, but of course where's all the director's post-modern style going to come from then?

It's no surprise because that's really all the film is, a documented and filmed account of what it's like to rave and club; for the rest of us, it's a non-event; a moderately dramatic and slightly inventive drama about British young adults that try to kill off sensations of pain to do with stresses of work, flailing relationships and even the actual lack of them. Human Traffic is a very specific film in the sense it is going to appeal to a direct audience; the illusion that the audience are seeing something better than what it is lies in the surrealistic content that has wormed its way into the film thanks to other recent attempts at the time such as Trainspotting and The Acid House. On the other hand, the filmmakers are not fooling anyone else.The trouble with the film is its study of this particular mentality. The defining scene is about half way through the film in which a couple of the main characters stand on a stairway to a large, old manor house and systematically turn around to the camera to address us. If you're struggling for a visualisation, think the opening few seconds of the music video to that Spice Girls song from years back entitled 'Wannabe'. As they turn to face us, they talk and laugh in our direction about how brilliant the night's going to be and how they love doing what they do. The problem here is that rather than see the night through the eyes of one of the characters, the highs and lows but hopefully not too much of either without the highs glamorised; we are invited to see the scenes unfold through our own perspective that is the camera's POV.This means whatever viewpoint or opinion we have on these people and this lifestyle will stick throughout this sequence, meaning if you're into it you'll be loving it but if it's all alien to you in the first place, you'll probably be despising what's going on. We are not invited to participate through one of the characters, instead we must watch from outside the box as events unfold in a dreary fashion.The film is one of those driven by lifestyle and consequence rather than out and out narrative. There is a lot of narration establishing the life certain people lead as well as several scenes that kill time whilst coming across as quite eccentric afterthoughts, the scene in which everyone stands up in the pub and sings at the camera being one of them. Jip (Simm) is the narrator and is so all over the place, both in speech and movement, that he manages to go from mentioning Neil Armstrong to talking of Milky Bar chocolate bars in one monologue spanning about four seconds. Such is the nature of the film.Simm plays the character well, a sort of eccentric person who's on the brink between being perfectly normal and completely loosing his mind completely. Simm hates his life and 'lives for the weekend' where he can let loose and try to scratch that itch of not having had a partner in ages. Initially, Jip is conflicted on his lifestyle after all this time. He initially seems to be on the brink of an epiphany but he doesn't know it. It looks as if he's about to mature, questioning his lifestyle and coming to terms with the damage he's doing to himself. Unfortunately, the film does cop out towards the end with this idea and has Jip find a partner, thus halting the possible maturity stone dead. All of a sudden he's happy with his lifestyle and nothing seems so bad after all, which was disappointing.Along with Jip are Koop (Parkes); Lulu (Pilkington) and Moff (Dyer). What they get up to is slightly uninteresting at the best of times, their activity only demonised on the rare occasion Danny Dyer narrates what it's like to come down off drugs at a bash full of random people all doing the same thing. The film is all style, with its study of the British male in crisis filling in the rest. Jump cuts; breaking the fourth wall; subtitles and popular culture dialogue are the attempts at coming across as somewhat different to what you might have expected. For watching ravers, it'll add to the disillusioned sense they might already have while watching but for everyone else, it's just quite ordinary and often comes across as a bit of a gimmick.Very near the film's immediate beginning is a short monologue about how a 17 year old boy hopes to have sex for the first time on a night out with the characters. This will instil some viewers with dread as to what might come; others will probably laugh their heads off and miss the subsequent thirty seconds of the film through that laughter. Human Traffic can be added to list containing Trainspotting and The Acid House as surrealist, realist drama comedies made in Britain around about the turn of the decade. It isn't as good as those films because it doesn't feel grounded. The film might just as well have been shot with real ravers on a real night out, but of course where's all the director's post-modern style going to come from then? After all, we've got to have all that in there- haven't we?

Face\/Off, a feature that knows action and pulls it off eloquently, does more to get the adrenaline pumping than most of the genre's more standard fare, and while it certainly doesn't do much &#150;if anything- remarkably new, there's enough done extremely well to satisfy anyone's thirst for stylised, balls-to-the-wall action. It also represents peaks in both lead stars careers, which both have arguably failed to revisit upon subsequent tours of the genre; sure it's not Shakespeare and it's not Oscar nominee material, but that's all part of Woo's otherworldly charm here. Face\/Off is more science-fiction than drama, but with a healthy dose of intellectually informed subtext and some brilliant character dynamics, the movie manages to grip from beginning to end, providing a healthy dose of escapist entertainment at its purist.Telling the undeniably hammy story of Sean Archer and Caster Troy &#150;two arch nemesis types on the opposite ends of the law- where both end up swapping faces and in turn identities, Face\/Off at base level is certainly cut from the same cloth as The Wizard of Oz in terms of its fantastic nature, but that doesn't mean that it loses its value as entertainment; rather, it reinforces it. Of course this is a story that seems perfect for your average sixties Star Trek episode, but again, that is all part of the charm. Not only is the premise an interesting one in itself, but Woo and his writers capitalise fully on the setup consistently, playing out the dynamics of the two characters' convoluted predicament with some juicy focus on character and the dualism of good and evil. It's the kind of movie that has to be taken further through the mind than face value, because, while Woo does well to give his movie a nice, comfortable balance between fantasy and reality, it's the ideas and nuances of this shift in character and themes that gives the movie its edge.To say that Face\/Off exists as a fine testament to both Travolta and Cage's skills as actors would be something of an understatement. To be sure, both play as Woo's puppets in his exaggerated, over the top world where people accentuate their shadings of black or white, but they do it so well that the caricature style becomes one with the movie itself. Furthermore, the dynamics that are involved here, from switching between personalities and in effect playing each other, the actors are given work here that extents far beyond the asking price of your average action thriller. As a duo, the two work well together as well as on their own; from the snarly façade of Castor Troy to the tormented psyche of Sean Archer, both actors embody both personalities as best as they can and often give life to moments that would easy to be glossed over if not played through Woo's absurdly glamorized and in turn engrossing style.But let's not fall under any pretence here; Face\/Off is first and foremost, an action movie. Yes, there are some great characters, touching drama and intellectually rewarding themes on dualism and metaphysical questions on personality and psychology, but all of this is given the bench to what Woo has arguably always been best at. This direct focus on huge, ridiculously potent action full to the brim with explosions, gunfire, violence and people flying through the air, forms what is quite possibly all that is best about the Hollywood action movie. With a distinct lack of shaky-cam syndrome and a larger desire to show how grand his images are, Woo delivers a visual and aural spectacle which is best to be taken on pure entertainment terms. One can easily point holes in nearly every aspect of the movie's plot, character and action, but it's hard to be so cynical when you're given masterfully executed shots that put so many other so-called action movies to shame.When it comes to speaking for the action genre, one can't remain positive without thinking of how bloated and derivative it has become over the recent years. Yet looking back almost decade and watching Face\/Off, it's somewhat uplifting to see that many years after its inception, there's still people out there capable of delivering the no-frills, no-nonsense excitement that made the genre such a formidable audience pleaser in the first place. Yes, this is by no means a cinematic classic, but its one of those movies that will likely be kept alongside such movies as Die Hard and Con Air, ready to be watched time and time again just for the sheer fun of it. Cinema, as much as it would like to deceive us, rarely does manage to deliver the true essence of fun; Face\/Off is an excellent reminder that such movies don't always have to end up being mundane and formulaic.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http\/\/www.invocus.net) ","genre":null},{"date":"22 December 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Out of all the movie genres available today, none please me more when pulled off correctly than the too often lame and castrated action movie.

This one is definitely worth a re-watch sometime soon, minus my Dancing-with-the-Stars-judge-raising-score-on-a-panel-every-5-secs attitude.

Especially De Niro who gives his best performance yet as the warm-hearted Mike. The bondage between individual characters is sublime and powerful.Cinimo moves the camera from scene to scene like a painting; beautifully illustrated and detailed to the point of near greatness.The music is immensely bold and chilling every time it's being played and adds a certain depth and movement in the characterisation of the characters.Verdict A god among any film about Vietnam and definitely provides a strong-held suggestion of being one of the great's of cinema.

This means his salary, prestige, and success with women are very limited. Living in a small apartment with his faithful dog, Milo, and with the landlady from Hades next door, Stanley keeps trying, nevertheless. When the lovely Tina Carlisle (Cameron Diaz), a lounge singer, comes to open an account, Ipkiss is more than attentive and gracious. One day later, his car breaks down and he is also thrown into the gutter by a pretentious nightclub bouncer. Ending up in a river, our hero finds an old wooden mask. For some unknown reason, he takes the relic home and flings it onto the couch. But, aha! That mask is magic and the following evening, Stanley is compelled to put it on. From that moment, Stanley is transformed, when the sun goes down, into a green-faced, super-powered, ultra-confident man. Heading toward the nightclub where he was rejected, he scores a hit with the crowd and with the lovely Tina. But, during the night, he also beats up some thugs and scared his landlady, so the police detective (Peter Riegert) comes by to ask questions. With the mob gaining power in the town, especially Tina's horrific boyfriend, Dorian, the detective wants to curtail the criminal activity. But, can Stanley avoid the urge when the mask's powerful magnetism comes calling? This is a hugely entertaining film that masks none of the fun from its intended audience. Although there is enough violence and sexual connotations to make the film unsuitable for the youngest, older children and adults will delight in the flick's antics and Carrey's irresistible performance. As the man who goes from zero to hero, Carrey's genius for physical comedy is a total delight. The supporting cast is also nice, with Diaz a huge asset in her first major film, for she is utterly gorgeous and sweet. Riegert, too, is dead-pan fun as the uber-serious detective, while all of the other cast members give equally memorable turns. The setting in seedy Edge City is marvelously tacky while the costumes, especially Tina's knockout outfits, are very nice. As for the script, the direction, and the special effects, they are all beyond great. Miraculous might be a better word! In short, if your goal for an evening's film choice is to laugh, laugh, and laugh some more, here is a first tier candidate. It would be difficult to see anyone not having a swell time while watching The Mask.

It has been considered now a literary masterpiece thanks to the great James Matthew Barrie. But somehow the classic tale, even as a kid and even with Disney's magical touch, never attracted me all that much, and I have found out why that is. The reason is that Neverland has always seemed to me as too good to be true. Peter Pan flew, he never grew up, never went to school or had any particular troubles the likes of which life seems to offer, he plays around all day long with the Lost Boys, was friend with Indians and admired by Mermaids and in his free time he had even more fun fighting off Pirates. He never even worried about food, water, sickness, loneliness, hygiene, wild and dangerous animals, criminals or anything else. Neverland to me has always seemed like a Utopia that was too good to be true and an inevitable life that will head eventually towards boredom. Even in the various adaptations made from the tales of Peter Pan we always see it as a too perfect utopia that can be ridiculously surreal, rather it be a winter movie, a Disney animation, a TV series or a stage show. But all that changed when one man decided to ask himself a rather curious question that is the main theme of this movie What if Peter Pan grew up? The apparently immortal boy completely isolated from real life would suddenly realize that his eternal dream would eventually bring him to an inevitable wakening tot he real world that was full of imperfections, but that would bring also it's benefits if played well. The man in consideration is none other than one of the biggest fans of the Peter Pan genre, the legendary director Steven Spielberg. Spielberg finally brought the Flying boy's adventures to an end, but this time with a big twist in Peter Pan's life that's probably more human and realistic than we ever dared dream of. Spielberg's Hook tells us what really happened to the great Peter Pan. He has left Neverland, returning to Earth from the clouds to be able to live a real life filled with something that has always been missing in him love. And so he remained there on Earth for many years, going to school, finding a job, getting married and even having kids of his own... completely losing his memory of Neverland. That is until Hook learns of his whereabouts and decides to kidnap his children, forcing Peter to return to the distant island and try to remember his true origins and, in the process, learn to be a better father. None other than Spielberg could've accomplished such a task in such a tender way. He finally turned Neverland, the impossible and surreal island into a very realistic and possible one where everyone, even doubtful adults, can escape to. Aside from Spielberg's supreme directing and wonderfully emotional touch in this film, it's success also goes to the rest of the cast and crew To Robin Williams who prorated the once flying boy and turning him into his greatest nightmare, an Adult, only to make him open his eyes again to who he truly was and is. Robin Williams is my favorite actor, and he's the perfect role for this character thanks to his great acting, his real inner childishness and his wonderful expressions of great delicacy and emotion. To Dustin Hoffman, who brought to life the fearsome Captain James Hook, Peter Pan's eternal enemy, with an unrecognizable makeup that hides his true features and with a great acting that reflects the mind of the most famous fictional pirate of the last century. To Julia Roberts, for turning into the most famous and loved fairy of them all -Tinkerbell- giving her a good heart instead of just showing her off as the usual spoiled brat who tries to mess everything up when she sees her precious Peter in the hands of another. To Maggie Smith, for showing that everyone, even the ones we remember as always young, grows up and becomes old, but doesn't necessarily mean that it is a bad thing. She has portrayed a perfect version of the lovable Wendy Moira Angela Darling who lived a full life without any regrets and who one day will rest forever, but in an eternal peace that is one of the rarest things at the end of life. A true example to follow. And finally to John Williams, who with his musical talent has given the background of the emotions of the characters in such a perfect way that can give at long last the chance for everyone to feel like Peter inside. This movie is one for anyone and everyone to watch, seniors especially, for it has began a hundred years ago to when they where young and could feel the magic of the classic Peter Pan story, and has developed now into an ending that can satisfy us all and make them return to their childish selves one more time and see through this movie what their life has been like before one day going to the next big adventure after life, which is either the bright light up ahead at the end of the tunnel... or the second star to the right that goes straight on 'till morning...
