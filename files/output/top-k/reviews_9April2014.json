[{"date":"9 April 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A very different film, for Schumacher, that stands totally detached to all his others, where he enters some really dark territory. This is thanks to the 7even writing talent and genius, Andrew Kevin Walker, in a story that hits reality deep, and like 7even, has you walking out the cinema, very numb, this one really leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Like Seven, this writer works his special magic to shock. High ranking PI, Cage, uncomfortable in the role, or could be just be his character, where if this true, he's really convinced us. He's a family man with a kid, has a bad habit, his wife (Catherine Keller) duly reminds him of. Cage does make smoking look like an art, especially in this. Taking on a new case, where some disturbing evidence has been found, a 8MM roll of film, a semi pornographic movie, involving a strung out young girl who's been bludgeoned to death, which like Cage's reaction, is a bit of a hard to choke scene. Is it fiction or reality? That's what this old woman is paying Cage to find out, after the recent death of her husband magnate, where amongst scant belongings, this disturbing evidence was found. So Cage is sent on a journey that has him knocking on doors, whatever, and has him seen trolling the streets of seedy film sets, porn shops, whatever. On his travels, he forms a partnership with a struggling rocker\/porno shop rocker, Max a colourful energetic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Eager Max and Cage, end up in the New York, where soon the nasty truth of the girl's fate becomes known. The small of bad guys, sickos, including the late great, Gandolfini, a hide under the rock, cringing character, a sleazy talent agent who gets it off with young girls, during their audition phase. He has some sick vices too, when explaining the girl's demise, which his recount is disturbing, where we really at the darkest point of the movie, where you really want to scream revenge. The baddies, pornographers, are really nasty and despicable pieces of work, truly evil, where you won't encounter scum like these guys for many years to come. The showdown between Cage and the masked man in that snuff film (slicer and, podgy mummy's boy, Chris Bauer, the molester from Devil's Advocate) is grippingly fantastic. 8MM is a very shouldn't of cop flacked movie. It's important to the fact that, these are the realities of desperate starlets, who are trying to make it in the acting or modelling worlds, and evil can come in the purest forms and facades of people of people. Cage's character is so dumb to admit snuff doesn't exist, but when viewing that movie, has him even holding his doubts, as well as long shocked gasps. 8MM is not for everyone. There are some sick and truly repulsive scenes. It's a very dark and psychological journey, we share with Cage into the world of vice and corrupt minds, better put to rest, with bullet holes in them, or like Gandolfini, who's really good here, playing a different kind of type, to the tough roles he normally plays. What was weird, once was, I overheard a woman commenting on 8MM, saying Yeah it was okay. I found that really a odd opinion for this movie, and it's disturbing tones and themes of story. I heard of one person, not being able to sleep after seeing it, where one I know, had nightmares, after seeing it. Judge for yourself but don't miss it. Anthony Heald is cunningly great and solid as the corrupt attorney to the powerful and dead magnate. Love the unforgettable music score at the end, mumbo jumbo lyrics.

With an average acting performance and a basic script you'd be right if you didn't have much expectation going into this, but just give it a chance and it can fully enjoyed by all film fans. I personally felt it was Pretty Good and here below is why I, but many other didn't, felt that way.The story is slow and then kind of fast and fluxuate's between both varied pacing, the plot isn't all that exciting either but it makes for very watchable film and just give it a chance and you may be entertained by this. The film has about 50 scenes where you think it will end but it never does, frustrating yes but I did feel the film was worth watching, even after going through so many end parts to the movie.Brad Pitt is average in this and although he does nothing to harm the film necessarily he doesn't really ever take a firm hold on the piece. Julia Roberts and James Gandolfini work together well and although Roberts as with Pitt isn't at her best, Gandolfini show's off his talents with beautiful ease and although this film is unknown these days, Gandolfini was just brilliant. I didn't care much for support though which did harm the film with stale performances, luckily they aren't seen as much as the main cast at all.Gore Verbinski in the directing role does a job that is fairly good, but is not his best and knowing what he can sometimes do, he fails with this and the positives of the film are not down to him. I felt one part of the film that I personally loved was the setting with some camera shots being doubly beautiful due to location, one great example is where Pitt is crossing a crossroads and looking each way, great camera work with a great locality to match.The film is too long and stretches too much to be considered a straight good film, although it does a good job with the majority of the story, it just falters towards the end and as I said with the multiple possible endings it just can annoy you. The acting also as previously mentioned is poor all round and sometimes it feels like a slight comedy but just manages to avoid being funny as well. Not much more to say negativity way but if you see for yourself, I am sure you may find more bad things than I did.It is hard to say who will like this, people who enjoy fun adventures may enjoy this because it is quite fun, not a stable film by any stretch of the imagination but excitable all the same. Pitt fans won't like this too much as he doesn't get to well, act, and Roberts is the same and seems they were put together as the stars but never see each other in the story. Don't watch it if you don't want to watch a long film with little new to offer, but watch it in a good mood and it is enjoyable.Overall a 7\/10, many many people give it lower but I really did feel it was Firmly Kind of Good and as I have said all the way through this review, the film is genuinely a fun one, with lots to offer too. Watch it as I say in a good mood because once you overlook the more serious parts of the film, the more light hearted parts become fun and can be enjoyed, given you open your mind a bit and stop thinking about this critically.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"9 April 2014","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The Godfather Part II has the rare distinction of being a sequel that is equal to, possibly even greater than, its predecessor. Indeed, it is one of the finest films ever made, a gangster picture that manages to be epic in scope as well as length, showcasing a number of brilliant performances and proving that, for all the fancy special effects in the world, nothing beats a truly compelling story. The only thing to bear in mind is that The Godfather Part II relies heavily on a knowledge of the previous film &#x96; it is not one of those follow-ups that can be watched out of sequence with any hope of grasping what is going on. 'Sequel' might be the wrong word actually, as the film is divided into two sections, one continuing the story of the Corleone crime family from where it left off at the end of Part I, the other acting as a turn-of- the-century prequel, showing the rise of Vito Corleone from orphaned Sicilian immigrant to powerful Mob boss. In effect, The Godfather Part II is therefore a continuation of, and prequel to, the existing narrative dealt with in the original.Following the death of his father and older brother, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is the new head of his family's empire, based now in Nevada having moved out of New York several years earlier. Running the 'business' is taking its toll on the once-honest Michael &#x96; his relationship with wife Kay (Diane Keaton) is frosty and distant; his brother Fredo (John Cazale) is becoming more of a burden than ever; he must deal with rumblings of discontent from New York; and his pledge to legitimise the Corleone family is further than ever from becoming a reality. Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt, Michael puts consigliere Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) in charge of the family for a while, while he goes away to deal with some business matters and investigate who tried to have him killed. His adventures bring him into contact with Jewish gangster Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg), who may be Michael's ally or enemy. The story traces Michael's long descent into isolation and paranoia, alienating himself from everyone in his all- consuming quest to come out on top in this epic gangland-battle-of-wits. Interwoven into the story are a number of flashbacks showing the rise of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando's character from Part I, here portrayed by Robert De Niro). After arriving in New York a poor immigrant, Vito eventually finds honest work in a grocery store but is hounded out of his job by local gangster Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin). Making ends meet through petty burglaries, he gradually rises up the criminal ranks, killing Fanucci and eventually becoming a feared and respected figure in the neighbourhood.Whereas The Godfather was criticised for glamorising violent crime and the Mafia, The Godfather Part II shows things in a much uglier light. Families are torn apart by jealousy and betrayal; relationships are destroyed by the lack of communication; innocence is tarnished irrevocably. In short, the world seems somehow more rotten and corrupt in The Godfather Part II. It's an altogether more ruthless film, harder-edged, shockingly authentic even. The performances are exemplary throughout. How Pacino didn't win the Best Actor Oscar of the year is beyond comprehension, creating as he does this incredible character whose grip on his empire comes at a terrible price. De Niro is excellent as the young Vito Corleone; Keaton fabulous as Michael's neglected wife; Duvall convincing as ever as the family lawyer; and Strasberg mesmerising as the slippery Hyman Roth, one of the truly great characters of gangster cinema. If it seems like in this review I have done nothing but shower superlatives upon this film, that's because I have. The Godfather Part II is, quite simply, one of the greatest movies of all- time.

Objectively if you compare it to the original it's a disappointment . The story is pretty much a copy of the first movie with small changes. It's also unrealistic and dumb in places. Despite it's faults it's still an entertaining movie.What we have here is basically Die hard on train. The train itself is a good location. There is lot of pretty scenery and since the train is in constant motion the movie is also fast paced. I had problems with Geoff Murphy's direction in Young guns 2 . Here he directs US 2 with formidable energy. The movie is edited very quickly, almost like a music video. Speaking of music Basil Poledouris score is far superior than Gary Chang's from first movie. It's one of best soundtracks for action movie ever made. The special effects are adorably cheesy and add to the overall campy entertainment value. The script has some quotable one-liners  Nobody beats me in the kitchen , Chance favors the prepared mind , Guess I'm not trained for this....There is lot of cool train action here (on the train , under the train , in the train) . Every bad guy is dispatched with minimum of effort as no-one is anywhere near as hard as Casey Ryback . Broken bones, severed limbs, terrorists in agonizing pain &#x85; This movie has an obvious comic book feeling to it and I really liked the non stop carnage. They just don't make them like this anymore. Steven Seagal is basically invincible here. He gets shot , but the movie quickly forgets about it. His doing unbelievable stuff without breaking a sweat . US 2 it does stretch reality to the breaking point and beyond, but it can be forgiven.Steven Seagal was forced to do this movie after the failure of his very personal movie On deadly ground . There is even an unused footage from ODG here . Seagal doesn't even try to act here. His obviously unhappy that his making this movie and more stiff than usual. There is a damsel in distress here- Ryback's niece Sarah played by Katherine Hiegl who is a good eye candy and nothing more.

On Valentine's Day, 1986, first-time director, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates himself), released 'Psycho 3' and, at the time, no one cared. It's a shame because, unlike 'Psycho 2' &#x96; which spent a lot of time and energy reproducing and imitating Hitchcock - this is a totally new and much darker take on a scenario that we already know quite well.If you haven't seen the previous 'Psycho' films, there are a number of sub-plots and asides in 'Psycho 3' that will mean absolutely nothing to you. It is a film that really hinges on all the previous elements and as careful as I was in my 'Psycho 2' review not to reveal all the twist and turns, it was all for not because 'Psycho 3' defiantly unravels every one of them.Much like the original, the film starts with a woman running away. This time it's a very disturbed nun who has left her convent having lost her faith in God and her will to live. Janet Leigh look-alike, Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid - 'Mommie Dearest' \/ 'Rumble Fish') treks across the desert where she is picked up by a very sleazy Jeff Fahey ('The Lawnmower Man' \/ 'Body Parts'). The two wanderers end up checking into the Bates Motel and, by now, you should have a hint at what's in store for them.There are a few attempts at building on the 'Psycho' mythology but there aren't any big surprises and there really isn't one over-arching story (unless you take the previous films into account). Here's a rundown of the sub-plots tied in 1.) Maureen has lost all direction and Norman feels sorry for her so they go on a date before she gets killed. 2.) Duke, Fahey's character, is working his way out to L.A. where he's going to be a big rock star. He learns a bit more about Norman than he should and tries to use this to his advantage. 3.) There's a reporter trying to discredit Norman's sanity and disprove the truth about Norman's mother (one of the twists from 'Psycho 2'). 4.) The Bates Motel is full of guests for once and Norman has to sneak around killing them (for no reason).What's so different about this sequel? For starters, I'm not really sure who the main character is. Unlike the previous sequel, Norman doesn't seem to be conflicted any longer; he's back to taxidermy, he's got 'Mother' back, he's peeking through holes in bathroom walls, and he's quick to kill. Maureen barely has any screen time and, though she is introduced as a possible heroin, her character doesn't really go anywhere (a la Marian Crane). Duke is too repellant to root for (but gets more screen time than almost anyone). So, oddly enough, the closest we're given to a protagonist is Roberta Maxwell's ('Popeye' \/ 'Philadelphia') reporter who is the least interesting character with the biggest payoff.All in all, this is the most sequeley sequel you will ever see and that should be enough to spark your curiosity.

But while Husbands and Wives has some pretty spot on observational humor, the story is largely somber and dramatic. Not dramatic in the sense of a Wednesday afternoon soap opera but a benign drama that with a few spikes of activity focuses mostly on the characters. There is no clever high concept or narrative liberties here like say, The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985); the film is more straight-laced and character driven along the lines of Interiors (1978) and Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989).And what of the characters or rather the actors who flesh them out? Judy Davis, Mia Farrow and Juliette Lewis are the obvious standouts, representing three very different women all of which are looking for the same thing; someone to love and someone to love them back. Davis received an Oscar nomination for her role as a bitter divorcée trying to come to terms with her ex-husband's infidelity and being single again. She's continually frustrated and confused by the yearnings of the heart occasionally even lashing out on her boyfriend Gates (Liam Neeson). She's cynical and wary of attachment yet deep down she knows that her entanglements with Jack aren't over.Mia Farrow is a stark counterpoint to Diane Keaton's brassy personalities of Allen's earlier work. Farrow's intensity lies always below the surface, providing the perked looks and mousiness of a young ingénue with the mind and body language of a veteran in the trials of love. It's a shame that out of the twelve Woody Allen films she has been in (for which Husbands and Wives was most famously her last) she had never received recognition by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for her stellar work.Juliette Lewis who plays one of Gabe's young students from his Literature course, has the appearance and vulnerability of a dewy-eyed devotee. Yet when the amiable Gabe discovers he might be the object of desire here and Lewis's Rain the controller, he recoils. There's a scene where the two are in a cab discussing the latest draft of his book. Unable to take criticism, Gabe calls Rain a 20-year-old twit and says I'd hate to be your boyfriend, he must go through hell. Rain cavalierly responds Well, I'm worth it.Those who bemoan Allen's post-Annie Hall (1977) work won't find relief from his more meditative works of the 1980's. While most of the characters are likable they sometimes do unlikeable things, each on their own journey of discovery. I suppose we all do things we regret for love and those with a mature outlook on the subject matter will find a lot to enjoy and a lot to flinch at in Husbands and Wives.

It does however still require strong central performances to make it work, and whilst Kirk Douglas may not be my favourite actor, his performance as the lethally cynical journalist is very good. Yet Jan Sterling who plays the wife of a man who is trapped in a cave, does steal the acting honours. She has a difficult and seemingly unsympathetic role. One which makes you care about someone who couldn't care less about the plight of her husband. The story which involves the trapped man being made to stay trapped, in order to allow the journalist to get a better story, is made for Billy Wilder to direct. He exposes the cynicism of the journalist and then a crooked sheriff who allows the man to stay trapped for political gain. Billy wilder makes it seem effortless in turning a potentially cold movie into a film where wit is allowed to offer a break from the overall cynicism.The film is not without flaws, but they are minor ones, and for some might not be seen as such. Melodrama for example is not to everyone's taste, and it does veer too much towards it at times. Kirk Douglas acting does perhaps strain too much towards it as well. I didn't find it off-putting, as I sometimes do with Kirk Douglas, because overall his acting style is suited to the story.The cinematography is very crisp and clean, and gives the film a freshness that belies the fact it was made in 1951. The film's take also seems fresh. The cynicism of journalistic methods today, may not be as overt as in the film, but your are constantly reminded of the hacking scandal and the way the paparazzi operate today. The last scene of Kirk Douglas falling towards the film camera in the moment of his death, is a justifiably famous one, and comes at the culmination of a terrifically tense sequence. This film also does some nicely nasty detail in the way that even the man trapped in the cave is not entirely innocent. He is in the cave basically too loot an old Indian spiritual site, so he can sell the recovered artifacts at his roadside diner. It's the way all the characters seem to be compromised by their desire for money or fame that suggest that Wilder was attacking capitalism, rather than just the characters themselves.

He makes inappropriate advances on two coworkers and makes a huge spectacle of himself all of which I found cringe-worthy. This seemed nothing more than a vehicle for Robert Downey Jr. to showcase his array of talents. I've seen this before where young actors are used\/exploited for these purposes. The problem for me is that while I like Downey as an actor and find him charming, I don't find him particularly funny. He is not John Ritter or even Jim Carrey.

It's great, I have to open this with the amazing versatility of Bruno Ganz. I may start to check his movies out more, he is a great foreign actor. He and Max von Sydow have become some of my favorite foreign actors. I understand that this movie is filled with sub-plots and branches, which usually would leave some plot holes for me and my purely-tunnel-vision-American-mind. The sub-plots only made this film easier to understand and better comprehensible. The plot; great. I would've changed a few things, most likely being the ending, but the film was still great. At first I thought this movie was legitimately from the era of black and white due to the great coloring of off-tempo sepia and the Fritz-Lang-esque camera angles. It wasn't until half way through the movie, when I researched that this movie was made in '87. The film asks every question that should be asked, and answers very few. But the answers are beautiful. Also the reoccurring little phrase throughout the movie only adds to the great narration. The beauty; is amazing due to the fact that nearly 80% or more of the dialogue, is narrated, and the emotion of the character on screen has to match the narration. This is amplified, the story telling through narration; being the fact that the narration is matched by dull and blank faces. It's beautiful. Also, I am a true sucker for movies that are 'reborn' or a movie in which the main character has a revelation to the wondrous world. And the humor only adds to the greatness, contrasting color, and change in tone of dialogue. I don't know why Nick Cage had to go and remake this.Lastly, the hardest decision, rating this movie.

Thia film is a masterful thriller that toys with the viewer's mind and presents a deliberately unfocused narrative to confuse the audience and colorful characters.The actors in The Usual Suspects are all perfectly cast. Gabriel Byrne presents the most mystery out of the five leads; his Keaton is the most murky and reserved. Kevin Pollak, known for more light-hearted comedic roles, makes Hockney the least serious and more witty of the main characters but still excels in playing a scumbag. Stephen Baldwin, before his career collapsed and he became a has-been born-again Christian, is suitably reckless and unpredictable as McManus. Benicio del Toro is the less prominent of the five leads, although his poor usage of English provides much of the film's humor. Kevin Spacey is the most impressive out of the cast, playing Kint as a sympathetic man who may be more than he appears to be which won him the Oscar.

There's No Business Like Show Business is almost identical in one way or another to practically every Fox musical dating back to George White's Scandals. It's a show business story, of course, focusing on a vaudeville family which started with mother and father (here played by Grable's former partner, Dan Dailey), and continued with their grown children (Donald O'Connor, Mitzi Gaynor, and Johnny Ray). Obviously, O'Connor and Gaynor have musical theater talents, while crooner Ray wasn't much of an actor, his character here taking a higher calling which for some reason upsets mama Merman.Coming into this wake of family drama with Irving Berlin music behind it is the sexpot Marilyn Monroe who wins the wrath of Merman by taking on their big number, Heat Wave, for herself. Merman isn't too happy that other son O'Connor is obviously nuts about Monroe, but this is a 20th Century Fox musical, and nobody stays mad at nobody for long. To make this a bit different than all of the other similar musicals, 20th added Cinemascope into the mix, and packed every musical number with every available extra on the lot, especially for the lavish finale set in the now long gone Hippedrome.Musically, There's No Business Like Show Business can't be beat, with a blonde wigged Merman very funny while singing A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody and being ignored by husband Dailey, squiring around the chorus girls as she falls off a stage bench. Merman and Dailey are also ripe for a little parody from their own children who amusingly imitate them in a reprise of When the Midnight Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam. Monroe not only heats up with Heat Wave but serves more electricity with After You Get What You Want. There will probably be a mixed reaction to Gaynor and Merman in military drag when they sing the somewhat tacky A Sailor's not a Sailor 'till a Sailor's Been Tattooed. To add to the audaciousness of it all is a huge elephantine revisit to Alexander's Ragtime Band which, in set as well as length, seems to go on forever.Overall, this is a nice big entertainment that misses something if not seen in its original Cinemascope presentation, and should probably be caught on the big screen if revived. When the entire company gets together for the title song finale, you'll feel relieved that the lengthy movie is coming to a close.

First, the theatrical cut of Superman 2 runs 127 minutes and Richard Lester takes credit as the director. Second, the cut of the movie that original Superman director Richard Donner helmed, clocking in at 116 minutes is now available as the version you've never seen. Personally, I prefer the Donner cut, but Superman 2 looks more like a brisk comedy with several outlandish dramatic moments. This is the Superman movie where savvy reporter Lois Lane cracks the mystery of Clark Kent never being around when Superman shows up to save the day. Superman finds himself pitted against more than just human villains in Superman 2. As feats of heroism go, the Man of Tomorrow leads off by foiling an attempt to detonate a hydrogen bomb that terrorists have hidden in the Eiffel Tower. Naturally, he has to rescue Lois, who has concealed herself underneath the Eiffel Tower elevator. After he saves Lois, he flies into outer space with the hydrogen bomb and hurls it into the void where it explodes. What the Man of Steel has no way of knowing is that General Zod, Ursa, and Non, who were imprisoned in a phantom zone not long before Krypton blew up, are floating around in space. The hydrogen explosion releases the trio of villainous Kryptonians from confinement, and they fly to the Moon where they encounter an American-Russian space expedition. General Zod (Terence Stamp of Billy Budd) comes to the realization that they are far stronger under a yellow sun and they head to Earth where they plan to confront the son of Jor-El. The tension here grows out of the Man of Steel tangling with three adversaries who have super power virtually identical to his. Meanwhile, the wily Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman of The French Connection) has managed to escape from prison. This is one of the least believable scenes with the help of Miss Teschmacher. Apparently, Lex has patched up his relationship with her because she removed the Kryptonite necklace dangling around Superman's neck so he could foil Luthor's earthquake scheme to obtain the best real estate on the California coast in the original Superman. The last half of Superman 2 is like a wrestling match with General Zod, Ursa (Sarah Douglas of Conan the Destroyer) and Non (Jack O'Halloran of Dragnet) battling it out with the Man of Steel. Actually, this superhuman struggle boils down to a product placement smash up with the characters smashing up or crashing into signs or vehicles with trademark names like Coke, Marlboro, and Kentucky Fried Chicken on it. Incidentally, if you haven't seen the original Superman, all you have to do is watch the opening credits of the theatrical Superman 2, and you can see a montage of the entire film.

In the first half of the film, Privates Joker and Pyle struggle through the mentally and physically tiring stresses which are intensified by the strict guidance of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half of the film is set in Vietnam. Privates Joker and Rafterman go out into the field to get a firsthand account of the bloodshed and atrocities of war.The basic training scene alone could have given the movie a fantastic rating right from the start. It was not only hilarious but also very true to life. It also shows how hard and stressful basic training is for the soldiers that go through it. It shows just how fragile some people's minds can be in such stressful situations as well. It makes you realize just how strong the notion of patriotism is. It's a word that can put a nation to collectively agree to go to war or make someone put themselves in a situation that they know they can't handle.Contrasting the limits is the hellish chaos of Vietnam, where Marines can try to march in line, but the unpredictable can, and will, throw them off. The film as a whole is distinguished by how intimately it depicts the psychological impact on the Marines, whose cracking faces are often quietly observed in close-ups. Joker and his boys go to war mimicking John Wayne movies and expecting to be heroes in the same sort of Western showdowns. What they get instead are abusive sergeants, hookers with tuberculosis, people who don't want to be saved, and a shootout so traumatizing that, by the end of it, they revert back to infancy for security, chanting the Mickey Mouse song just to get by.It details the lives of several Marine Corps. Infantrymen. The most recognizable is that of Private Pile. Private Pile is not your standard Marine Corp. soldier, as he is on the overweight side and a bit clumsy. Pile must also survive the basic training of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, who gives him utter hell as he progresses through training. his movie has many iconic and classic quotes that have made it a classic. As far as philosophical content , there are some morality questions that may be raised; especially those about how soldiers are trained and how another individual can decide whether an individual lives or dies. However, those seem to be some of the realities of war.This film is darkly humorous, uncompromisingly brutal, and subversive in every way, Full Metal Jacket is easily one of the best war movies without being remotely similar to your standard issue war flick. Through out it all though, Kubrick is subversive, funny, and offensive to authority, which fits in well with his style. I think Kubrick again draws you in by showing you the true nature of war and the character of the me n required to go fight and die; they are humans each and every one, just like us all.
