I had also seem bits and bobs of the many original sequels as a child and they had made absolutely no impact on me what so ever! But I became aware of the significance of this, the original, only recently and it was due to this discovery that I hunted down the best copy available.I ended up with the 2005 Region 1 release, which also includes the U.S. reworking from 1956, Godzilla King Of The Monsters!. I could not have imagined that a the 1954 version of Godzilla, or more literally, Gojira, could have been so mature, so sombre, or so tempered with its sledgehammer philosophising. Produced just nine years after the devastating nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which effectively ended the Second World War, Gojira takes up the mantle on doing what Science Fiction does best, and created the cypher in the form of Godzilla, to represent the devastation left over from the nuking of these cities.Godzilla is a nuclear beast, affected by U.S. nuclear tests and is now toxically radioactive and upon landfall on Tokyo, rains down, literally, nuclear destruction up on the city, in a manner not dissimilar too that levied upon either of the cities, Hiroshima or Nagasaki. But its not just about that. It about the creation of the next WMD which would ultimately be used against Godzilla but poses and moral dilemma that Robert Oppenheimer himself would appreciate, as to whether such a creation should be allowed to be developed. It also looks quite seriously into establishing the potential evolution of a creature such as Godzilla and uses plausible palaeontological arguments to justify his existence.The pacing was good and though Godzilla strikes from almost the opening frame, there is a sense of an ongoing crisis rather than an impending apocalypse, with news outlets reporting throughout as plans, both military and civilian are sited.All in all, this is not just the birth of the massive and largely corny and cheap Godzilla series, it is a striking, intelligent, moving and incredibly well judged masterpiece of 50\u2032s cinema.

Tension was built brilliantly and the action rose to several crescendos and the excellent score by Akira Ifukube was not overused but brought to perfect effect when needed.The acting was first-rate as well, proving Japanese cinemas reputation. But this was my first real foray into Japanese cinema, and what a treat it was. Many would look at this and see a cheap old film and others will see a film that whist let down by some less that brilliant visual effects and the fact that a lot of people, certainly in the U.K. find subtitles difficult, as a masterpiece not only of Eastern cinema but of cinema full stop. Truly realising its narrative and spirit, its cause and message. This was about a county in mourning not only for the hundreds of thousands lost by Fat Man and Little Boy, but for the war full stop. The 1950\u2032s were a time of great political fear and reconstruction after WW2, and this is a film which taps into the brewing Cold War and fear of annihilation from human behemoths which once released can never be returned.HIGHLY recommended but not for children as they will bore, miss the point, get put off by the subtitles, black and white and quite frankly its a mature and bleak film and not the 1998 remake.

The transition between the daylight and the night was done beautifully in a Hitchcockian style, Laurie and her friend Annie drove in the evening to reach the houses where they will babysit the kids.

Even before all the prequels, Star Wars was the undisputed king of all franchises in film. So its also easy for me to imagine why people where so disappointed when the film came out. But come on, I was only six when Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace came out. I was seeing this through the eyes of a child, and couldn't pick up on the very serious problems that I now see this film has, twelve years later.So the story starts out in the familiar setting of a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. Very quickly though, it is apparent that this is a much different galaxy to the one we have become accustomed to with the original Star Wars films. CGI and Jedi Knights galore, contradictory plot points and abdominal CGI characters fill our screens instead of the retro cool Luke Skywalker and Han Solo of the original trilogy.The basic plot of this film bases around the young Obi Wan Kenobi and his master Qui Gon Jinn, who have been sent by the senate to settle a trade dispute on a planet called Naboo. Things go wrong very quickly and through circumstances too detailed to explain briefly they find themselves on Tatooine in which we see the story's genesis - the tale of Darth Vader aka Anakin Skywalker.I think there is no main problem with The Phantom Menace, just many small problems that add up and outweigh anything that could be positive about this film. When I think of The Phantom Menace, I get a feeling of nausea and a headache rushes upon me, when it really should be the opposite of that because Star Wars has always made me feel youthful and as though anything is possible. That about really sums up everything I feel about this film, however there are a few diamonds in the rough with Ep1.Liam Neeson does try his best to be subtle and wise as the Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn, however he really does say some stupid things and makes some idiotic decisions in this, which are very un-Jedi like. Sorry Liam Neeson, not enough to save the film. The Pod Races are a nice attraction and a good blend of live action sets and CGI, however it really could have all been skipped. Darth Maul, the evil assassin of which the film has its title of, is a dazzle to watch in the breathtaking saber battle at the climax of the film, but he barely says anything in the film and adds little intrigue to what the Sith even are. Another waste. There are several live action sets, which certainly help to give the film an organic sense of something actually happening, but then that is ruined as well with CGI backgrounds added. In fact, the only truly positive thing I can think about The Phantom Menace for is its score by John Williams, which is superb.

Whilst I do understand the outrage this sub-plot produces, stating that the force comes from a biological genesis rather than a spiritual one (which the original films preached about) I do now think I understand what George Lucas wanted to achieve with this one. In my opinion, the midechlorians, at least from the point of the mythology of Star Wars, poses a certain contrast to how in real life, science tries to explain religion. Jedi's in the Star Wars universe may be split half way with the midechlorians too, with half of them feeling the need to push forward a new idea about the force (Qui Gon for example goes on about it quite a lot) and others may opt for the more traditional view of the force as a spiritual energy field (Yoda and Obi Wan).In summary, I can only conclude that The Phantom Menace is a film for kids, if there ever was one. No doubt, the original Star Wars as a fantasy for kids and adults alike, but there is also no doubt in my mind that George Lucas concocted Jar Jar Binks as a marketing scheme, much like the rest of this film...and what a genius he is...look how rich he has become.

Alex is a troubled youth living in a futuristic society that has become lack of moral values and rules. Alex lives his life carefree and without regret as the leader of a small group of misfits known as Droogs. The Droogs spend most of their time high on a drugged form of milk (which in the future has become legal and sold in milk bars) as they cruise the night looking to increase their high with Ultra- Violets. These Ultra-Violets come at the misfortune of others as the gang beats, rapes, and takes anything they want. The theme, or focus, of the film is on the ideas of the truths of human nature as they relate to social problems within society and the governments role in correcting them. In the film the government uses a mind control technique known as the Ludovico Technique to cure Alex of his need for violence and sex. Their goal is to cure him and make him fit into the mold of what they think a citizen should be and act like. The theme of this film reminded me somewhat of George Orwell's 1984. Before Alex is released from prison he undergoes the Ludovico Technique of treatment to cure him of his need for violence and sex. The treatment sessions themselves were just as violent to Alex as the crimes he had been committing before prison. He was drugged and subjected to countless hours of films showing him the most perverse violent acts imaginable, to the point that just the thought of such things made him ill. After Alex is released from prison he tries to fit back into society on the straight and narrow path, but the mind-altering treatments that he had undergone push him to the brink of madness. He is unable to cope with society as he had left it before and eventually tries to take his own life. After Alex's failed suicide he becomes a martyr for the people outraged at the idea of the government using drugs and mind control to change people for the better or worse. The director, Stanley Kubrick, uses several film techniques in this movie to bring its theme to life, two of which really stuck out to me, the use of color and voice over narration. The use of color primarily in the opening and ending scenes that just showed the films credits in front of very bright changing colors. This reminded me of the use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and how during the time that the movie was being filmed our own government was experimenting with the use of LSD to alter the minds of soldiers to change them and create the perfect soldier, or how the drug was also being used by psychiatrist to alter the minds of patients. So even though the movie was taking place in the future its message reflected what was currently happening in society and the potential side effects from it. Voice over narration was equally important in this film, as it dealt with the inner workings of a character's mind. Without being able to really listen in to what Alex was thinking we could not of understood the depth of who he was before and especially after he underwent the treatments. Overall I highly recommend this film. It was a very entertaining look into society, with all of our difference and ideas of what is right and wrong, and most importantly the moral aspects of big brother using its power to alter what or who we are on the inside.

The director, Stanley Kubrick, uses several film techniques in this movie to bring its theme to life, two of which really stuck out to me, the use of color and voice over narration. The use of color primarily in the opening and ending scenes that just showed the films credits in front of very bright changing colors. This reminded me of the use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and how during the time that the movie was being filmed our own government was experimenting with the use of LSD to alter the minds of soldiers to change them and create the perfect soldier, or how the drug was also being used by psychiatrist to alter the minds of patients. So even though the movie was taking place in the future its message reflected what was currently happening in society and the potential side effects from it. Voice over narration was equally important in this film, as it dealt with the inner workings of a character's mind. Without being able to really listen in to what Alex was thinking we could not of understood the depth of who he was before and especially after he underwent the treatments. Overall I highly recommend this film. It was a very entertaining look into society, with all of our difference and ideas of what is right and wrong, and most importantly the moral aspects of big brother using its power to alter what or who we are on the inside.

Alex is a troubled youth living in a futuristic society that has become lack of moral values and rules. Alex lives his life carefree and without regret as the leader of a small group of misfits known as Droogs. The Droogs spend most of their time high on a drugged form of milk (which in the future has become legal and sold in milk bars) as they cruise the night looking to increase their high with Ultra- Violets. These Ultra-Violets come at the misfortune of others as the gang beats, rapes, and takes anything they want. The theme, or focus, of the film is on the ideas of the truths of human nature as they relate to social problems within society and the governments role in correcting them. In the film the government uses a mind control technique known as the Ludovico Technique to cure Alex of his need for violence and sex. Their goal is to cure him and make him fit into the mold of what they think a citizen should be and act like. The theme of this film reminded me somewhat of George Orwell's 1984. Before Alex is released from prison he undergoes the Ludovico Technique of treatment to cure him of his need for violence and sex. The treatment sessions themselves were just as violent to Alex as the crimes he had been committing before prison. He was drugged and subjected to countless hours of films showing him the most perverse violent acts imaginable, to the point that just the thought of such things made him ill. After Alex is released from prison he tries to fit back into society on the straight and narrow path, but the mind-altering treatments that he had undergone push him to the brink of madness. He is unable to cope with society as he had left it before and eventually tries to take his own life. After Alex's failed suicide he becomes a martyr for the people outraged at the idea of the government using drugs and mind control to change people for the better or worse.

I can't see why, but I would suspect that this is a common occurrence due to the appeal it had (I am yet to see such an 'appeal'), presented by Russell Crowe's limp-wristed war cries and his flattering Roman outfit. Ooh, yah, everyone does love an awesome sword fight, huh? Certainly, that Oscar win for 'Best Picture' will definitely oppose my argument, but that movie for me is the single dollop of mud flicked on the pristine whiteness that is the imagination of Mr. Scott. As a representative ambassador to the perpetual abundance of talent within Ridley, that film is most certainly not the one I would have presented. That position, I believe, belongs to 'Hannibal' (2001). Following the colossal success of its 1991 predecessor, 'The Silence Of The Lambs', adapted from Thomas Harris's best-selling 1988 novel, this sequel 'Hannibal' was vastly anticipated. Harris's successive novel of the same name was also hugely anticipated, and, upon release in June 1999, was met with a generally positive reception. The irrefutable delectability of the talents involved in its cinematic adaptation enticed audiences greatly. Even to the extent of an internationally record-breaking release in February 2001, garnering itself a Guinness World Record for the highest box-office gross for a film with an over- 18 rating on an opening weekend. Its success seemed inevitable - Anthony Hopkins reprises one of his most celebrated roles, a screenplay adaptation by literary masters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, John Mathieson's glorious cinematography encapsulates the fluently remarkable scenery of Florence in all its architectural perfection, and the delightful addition of director Ridley Scott and his eye for aesthetics. Of course, no-one will care about that. No-one has for ten years. And that is primarily the most infuriating concept; the gross philistinism that these critics have with their deprivation of this film's deserved reputation of meticulousness. To them, it's wiped clean off the Earth! Over-shadowed by 'Silence', of course. That's to be expected. But one can still acknowledge brilliance even if it does sit on the Second Place stand of the winners' podium. Director Ridley Scott can be credited for other, first-class, achievements, such as the captivatingly terrifying claustrophobia of 'Alien' (1979). But the immediate and unimaginative connection people make between his work and 'Gladiator' (2000) is just irritating. Of all of Scott's directional achievements, 'Hannibal' remains as his greatest. While its predecessor relied on Dr. Lecter's rather grotesque, skin- crawling interaction with FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster in Oscar-winning form) behind the safety glass of his colourless cell to get its chills from the audience, this sequel was more challenging. With Hannibal Lecter gloriously at liberty in Florence, he appears so much more suave, charming. Elegant. He becomes the man he showed himself to be when deprived of the company of his cannibalistic counterparts. It accurately follows the concept that he could be walking across the road from you and you'd be oblivious. Only one thing disturbs his freedom corrupted police Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi. Blinded by money, he foolishly stalks Lecter after learning that his alias, Dr. Fell, curator of the library of The Palazzo Capponi, is a façade. Giancarlo Giannini plays this character well, a character that can be personified as the manipulative snake in the Garden Of Eden.The screenplay for me is quite the highlight. The story of this all is rather basic, but enjoyable nonetheless. It may well be simplistic, and unarguably unrealistic at times, but it has a comfortable pace. It unravels itself gradually and lets the thing evolve nicely from there on. A story of corruption, revenge, hatred, and avarice, this film is such a wonderful experience to endure. Also, it is immersed deeply in revolting characters, their characteristics shown so clearly as to disallow any ambiguousness. What you see really is what you get. In addition to this, it is scattered with snide insults. From the spitting venom of the hideous Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, plastered in astounding, intricate facial make-up) to the sophisticated verbal assault of Lecter. Anthony Hopkins seizes this new opportunity of a free Lecter admirably, at last able to confront Clarice Starling outside of his cell. In the film's finale (a scene I treasure in my memory eternally), amidst the setting of the immaculately sartorial dining room, Hopkins has the greatest chance to really bite. The dialogue written, similar to the chastising Lecter gave Starling in 'Silence' (A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.), is spiteful. Truly. So vindictive and obvious is it, rubbing the salt directly into the wound, so to speak, that it almost seems thoughtful. The finale is the best part of the movie, where Julianne Moore really shines as Starling. Having been rather blunt earlier in the film's pursuit\/set-up, here she shows her immovable incorruptibility as Starling, showing no weakness despite the acid that is shot at her most personal features by Lecter her pride as an Agent. The script really nails that, belittling her, unpicking every fibre of her capabilities in a stunning array of composure and patronising. This is an ending that I can only stand alongside 'The Usual Suspects' (1995) for levels of sheer awe and satisfaction. Granted, 'Hannibal' may not be as good as its predecessor 'Silence' in some ways, but don't forget about it. It redeems itself, I kid you not.

Giancarlo Giannini plays this character well, a character that can be personified as the manipulative snake in the Garden Of Eden.The screenplay for me is quite the highlight. The story of this all is rather basic, but enjoyable nonetheless. It may well be simplistic, and unarguably unrealistic at times, but it has a comfortable pace. It unravels itself gradually and lets the thing evolve nicely from there on. A story of corruption, revenge, hatred, and avarice, this film is such a wonderful experience to endure. Also, it is immersed deeply in revolting characters, their characteristics shown so clearly as to disallow any ambiguousness. What you see really is what you get. In addition to this, it is scattered with snide insults. From the spitting venom of the hideous Mason Verger (Gary Oldman, plastered in astounding, intricate facial make-up) to the sophisticated verbal assault of Lecter. Anthony Hopkins seizes this new opportunity of a free Lecter admirably, at last able to confront Clarice Starling outside of his cell. In the film's finale (a scene I treasure in my memory eternally), amidst the setting of the immaculately sartorial dining room, Hopkins has the greatest chance to really bite. The dialogue written, similar to the chastising Lecter gave Starling in 'Silence' (A well scrubbed, hustling rube with a little taste.), is spiteful. Truly. So vindictive and obvious is it, rubbing the salt directly into the wound, so to speak, that it almost seems thoughtful. The finale is the best part of the movie, where Julianne Moore really shines as Starling. Having been rather blunt earlier in the film's pursuit\/set-up, here she shows her immovable incorruptibility as Starling, showing no weakness despite the acid that is shot at her most personal features by Lecter her pride as an Agent. The script really nails that, belittling her, unpicking every fibre of her capabilities in a stunning array of composure and patronising. This is an ending that I can only stand alongside 'The Usual Suspects' (1995) for levels of sheer awe and satisfaction. Granted, 'Hannibal' may not be as good as its predecessor 'Silence' in some ways, but don't forget about it. It redeems itself, I kid you not.

I can't see why, but I would suspect that this is a common occurrence due to the appeal it had (I am yet to see such an 'appeal'), presented by Russell Crowe's limp-wristed war cries and his flattering Roman outfit. Ooh, yah, everyone does love an awesome sword fight, huh? Certainly, that Oscar win for 'Best Picture' will definitely oppose my argument, but that movie for me is the single dollop of mud flicked on the pristine whiteness that is the imagination of Mr. Scott. As a representative ambassador to the perpetual abundance of talent within Ridley, that film is most certainly not the one I would have presented. That position, I believe, belongs to 'Hannibal' (2001). Following the colossal success of its 1991 predecessor, 'The Silence Of The Lambs', adapted from Thomas Harris's best-selling 1988 novel, this sequel 'Hannibal' was vastly anticipated. Harris's successive novel of the same name was also hugely anticipated, and, upon release in June 1999, was met with a generally positive reception. The irrefutable delectability of the talents involved in its cinematic adaptation enticed audiences greatly. Even to the extent of an internationally record-breaking release in February 2001, garnering itself a Guinness World Record for the highest box-office gross for a film with an over- 18 rating on an opening weekend. Its success seemed inevitable - Anthony Hopkins reprises one of his most celebrated roles, a screenplay adaptation by literary masters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, John Mathieson's glorious cinematography encapsulates the fluently remarkable scenery of Florence in all its architectural perfection, and the delightful addition of director Ridley Scott and his eye for aesthetics. Of course, no-one will care about that. No-one has for ten years. And that is primarily the most infuriating concept; the gross philistinism that these critics have with their deprivation of this film's deserved reputation of meticulousness. To them, it's wiped clean off the Earth! Over-shadowed by 'Silence', of course. That's to be expected. But one can still acknowledge brilliance even if it does sit on the Second Place stand of the winners' podium. Director Ridley Scott can be credited for other, first-class, achievements, such as the captivatingly terrifying claustrophobia of 'Alien' (1979). But the immediate and unimaginative connection people make between his work and 'Gladiator' (2000) is just irritating. Of all of Scott's directional achievements, 'Hannibal' remains as his greatest. While its predecessor relied on Dr. Lecter's rather grotesque, skin- crawling interaction with FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster in Oscar-winning form) behind the safety glass of his colourless cell to get its chills from the audience, this sequel was more challenging. With Hannibal Lecter gloriously at liberty in Florence, he appears so much more suave, charming. Elegant. He becomes the man he showed himself to be when deprived of the company of his cannibalistic counterparts. It accurately follows the concept that he could be walking across the road from you and you'd be oblivious. Only one thing disturbs his freedom corrupted police Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi.

And this privileged status has been conquered by John McTiernan, in 1988, through one &#x85; no, two masterstrokes  the casting of Bruce Willis as Detective John McClane and Alan Rickman as his archenemy, Hans Gruber. All the Oscar-nominated special effects of the world, spectacular sequences or heart-pounding gun-pointing moments would have been equally worthless if we had to deal with a one-dimensional villain or a heroic killing-machine à la Stallone or Schwarzenegger. No disrespect for Arnie, but his decision to turn down John's part is probably one of greatest blessings of cinema's history, if only for launching the cinematic career of Bruce Willis. But there's more to say in this casting that justifies the iconic status of Die Hard.Bruce Willis introduced a new kind of hero, combining the strength of a regular cop who's been doing that since eleven years, and the qualities of a regular man, with a wife and children. He's charming, but not a womanizer, he's strong but hates to risking a neck-break, he cares for his family, for innocent people and for his duty, but his wisecracking attitude doesn't befit his deeply noble nature. And he has a strange habit to talk to himself, just like we might talk to him, if we could. John McClane is what we could call a buddy-hero, one that immediately inspires sympathy. Any regular guy would like him because he's not an intrepid adventurer like Indiana Jones or the playboy who gets all the chicks like James Bond, and more interestingly, because everybody's against him, even the Police or the FBI. John McClane is the quintessential guy at the wrong place and the wrong moment, the pebble in the shoe, the pain in the ass, whom no one seems to give a break... and if only for that, we identify with him.John McClane is indeed one of the greatest movie heroes, and if this is too pompous a superlative for him, let's say one of the coolest.And for a new kind of hero, the movie needed a new kind of villain. And here comes the suave and charming Hans Gruber, a man who uses his sophistication as a rhetoric trick to hide the true evil and menacing side of his nature. At one part, no one would dare to challenge his opinion on Gruber, for a guy who could lead such a bunch of cold-blooded killers, had to be at least twice more determined and violent than the most violent of them, Carl his sidekick, to name him. As soon as his gun is pointed at you and if you don't have weapons, you're already dead, and be careful if he compliments your suits, it might mean that he'd hate to make some holes in. Hans Gruber, rightfully nominated #46 in AFI's Top 50 Villains, is the kind of villains that would have made Hitchcock very proud, and from Lecter in 1991 to Landa in 2009, a few villains of the last years would lack this mix of suaveness and cruelty.Hans Gruber's influence on villains' characterizations is undeniable and Alan Rickman steals the show in an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, his eyes language is so powerful that most of his reactions could pass for genuinely authentic.But does it take only two iconic characters to make a film? Yes and no. Yes, because once you have the characters, and you define their personalities, their interactions and dynamics will provide enough material for the script. From a memorable Now I have a Machine Gun Ho- Ho-Ho or the Yippie-Ki-Yay catchphrase, the conflict between a regular guy and a foreign mastermind is a cinematic delight. But again, Hans is such an extraordinary character that he even takes distance from his role as the big villain, admitting he borrows more of his knowledge from stuff read in Forbes, or Time. And no, because the movie still needs a story, a back-story, about McClane, his family, to paint him with the brush of realism; there's a scene where he has a breakdown with his only trust-worthy friend and partner (Sgt. Powell, played by Reginald VelJohnson) where McClane takes this unique dimension I was mentioning before. Could you imagine Arnie crying like this?There's also this constant originality in the film that makes every single scene memorable. Action is never for the sake of it, after several viewings, you understand exactly what John is doing and the whole process to save the hostages. And in the same time, we follow the Germans in that cat-and-mouse situation. John is indeed trapped like a mouse, with his vest and bare feet (another unique touch of the film) but sometimes, the mouse even when outnumbered, can use his cleverness, his reactivity, and courage to defeat the bad guys thanks to the surprise effect, and a little something that makes him such a hard nut to crack. Now, of course, the purists will criticize the Germans' accents, the unrealistic incompetence of the Deputy Chief of Police or some useless comedic relief moments, they wouldn't be totally wrong but when we're supposed to believe in a man able to fight a group of terrorist, couldn't we suspend our disbelief a little? This is not too much asking from a masterpiece of entertainment that paved the way to a new conception of hero and villains and a new generation of action movies, almost all of them can be tag-lined as Die Hard in someplace.

This is not too much asking from a masterpiece of entertainment that paved the way to a new conception of hero and villains and a new generation of action movies, almost all of them can be tag-lined as Die Hard in someplace. Indeed, Die Hard gave its letter of nobility to 'pop-corn' and 'guy' movies to a point, I can imagine, a villain saying now, in a monologue This time, John McClane won't come here to save the day &#x85; ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"31 October 2011","score":"2 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Lifeforce (1985) ** (out of 4)This 1985 sci-fi flick from director Tobe Hooper and Cannon was meant to be a blockbuster but it turned out to be a financial disaster for the studio and even the director wasn't happy when the film was trimmed down countless times. I viewed the 116-minute Europeon version, which has all the nudity and gore intact but apparently Hooper has an even longer version that has never been released. The film has a group of astronauts going into space to get a closer look at Halley's Comet but they come across three bodies including a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) who they don't know is actually a space vampire. Back in London the woman ends up breaking free and terrorizing the city by using her sexuality to suck the life out of people and turning them into zombies. LIFEFORCE certainly splits fans of the genre because many will call it a masterpiece while others call it a vile piece of trash that deserved to crash and burn at the box office. I'm somewhere in the middle because the film is certainly a head-scratcher but then again we are talking about Cannon here. From what I've read, the studio and the director thought they were making a serious science fiction movie that they were hoping would become a hit. Did any of them actually read the screenplay? We're dealing with a film about a nude female vampire who uses her beautiful naked body to force men to fall all over her and then she sucks the life out of them. Then we go a step further by having the victims turn into zombies. I think what really hurts the film is that everyone involved took such a silly, B movie idea and decided to try and pretend it was A quality material. The level of seriousness throughout this film just slows the film down so much and I really can't help but think the movie would have been so much better had Hopper not taken everything so serious and instead worked with the good elements and delivered a fast, fun movie. May does a terrific job with the space vampire because, obviously, she's quite beautiful and seeing her walking around fully nude the entire movie certainly takes care of the sexual aspect of the film. The actress did a very good job at being very luring and I thought she delivered a fine performance. You even have other respectable actors such as Steve Railsback, Peter Firth and Patrick Stewart. You even have fun zombies that just add to the camp factor of the film and one of the greatest moments happens when one of the zombies runs towards a jail cell and just explodes into dust when he hits it. I thought the special effects were extremely good for this type of movie with the zombie design very effective and I'd say that the mutated bodies are some of the best you're going to see. Hooper actually makes a very good film to look at because on a technical level I'd probably say this is his best film. However, sadly it's all taken way too serious and goes on for way too long and in the end LIFEFORCE is an interesting failure but not a good film.

It's the ultimate self parody of the slasher genre, it's an absolute masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. Every long-running horror series has that one part when things just get totally kooky (yes you, Jason Goes To Hell), but when Halloween totally loses its mind, it does so in a splendid fashion. Oh, Jason Voorhees can switch bodies right? Freddy Krueger has a daughter? Well eat our dust, Michael Myers is being mind-controlled by a bunch of Celtic druids! Of course, it all makes so much sense now. The film encounters one big problem though finding characters relevant to the original that aren't dead yet. By total lack of better, it has to center around I kid you not, the boy Laurie Strode babysat in the first one. Wow, was the dude with the boom-box from Halloween II busy? All for the better though, because at least Donald Pleasence can finally get all the attention now. He absolutely shines in this one. He's not even in it that much (allegedly because director Joe Chappelle found him boring), but every moment and every line he gets is just classic Pleasence. Everyone else in this movie has absolutely terrible dialogue (tonight's gonna be killer, hahahahahahahahahaha), but the makers seemed to have done special efforts for old Loomis. Curse is awful, but in the most entertaining of ways. I'd pick it over lackluster entries like Resurrection any day.
