How can you, when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is?''The story and themes present in Ghost in the Shell (GitS) are both striking and very relevant. GitS takes place in a more than possible future world where cybernetics and AI have become a social norm. The amazing detail given to the universe and the true to life reflection of today's society makes the themes in question incredibly applicable. The different opinions in GitS are argued with a certain potency and precision. The maturity and skill of the characters in putting across their arguments will encourage the viewer to contemplate these 'philosophical' issues from a very serious stance. The 'main' story (when I say main, it is really just an excuse to bring up these themes, which are the focus) isn't so revolutionary in terms of originality but is definitely very intelligent. A mysterious master hacker, known as the puppet master has been causing some negative repercussions in the political world of GitS. Section 9 has thus been asked to investigate. This can be seen as nothing more than the story of an extended and very standard TV episode. And to an extent, you can't argue with that. But rather than witnessing the usual, ''-enemy is introduced, -enemy makes their move, *good guys then find a way to defeat this enemy*, -enemy apprehended'' sort of arc, the story unfolds in a very intelligent manner. The movie uses this particular case to initially explore interesting notions in the GitS universe, such as social inequality, the soul or 'ghost' of a robot and corrupt politicians. The story's themes will then take over and the resulting dialogue leads to some very interesting ideas. Overall, it is a very smart and engaging version of what would've otherwise had been a standard plot. The only 'flaw' in the story of the movie is that it assumes you to have at least a basic knowledge of the GitS universe. Whilst there isn't anything vital you need to know, the huge amount of detail and history can be too much to take in at times. If anything, (if you are a fan of cyberpunk\/ sci-fi) this should just inspire you to learn more about the complex universe. Do not worry about being new to the universe; just have your thinking cap on. Sound\/ art- 10\/10The art and soundtrack in GitS are ground-breaking. A new method of animation at the time used for the film was basically designed to create a sense of depth in the different levels of animation. This resulted in some amazingly detailed backgrounds and city views. Beauty is in the detail, and with so much detail, you are really able to become fully immersed into the universe before you. The art style is basically a timeless example of how to animate a mature and intelligent film like GitS. For example, the opening credits was just converted computer code used in a creative way. It was lovely to see this clear, harmonious language between the universe and the media used to portray it. The art and soundtrack was so inspiring, that in the film are a series of scenes that are entirely composed of visuals of the city backed by a brilliant OST. I couldn't help but smile in awe at the level of detail and beauty. Characters- 8\/10This is an unfair section to mark a single film on, when in reality GitS just follows on from two whole series of character development. In reality, you can watch the film without watching the TV series'. This is sadly due to the fact that you never really see the characters personalities in the film. They just operate as speakers for the themes in the film. Despite this, the cast are able to deliver these arguments with great effect because of their own maturity and strength of character. Enjoyment-10\/10 Ghost in the Shell is an all-time classic. As mentioned, I absolutely love the detail in the universe. I want to become immersed, and I can very easily become immersed thanks to the soundtrack and artwork. You cannot help but admire what you are watching. In terms of action, GitS certainly knows how to deliver. Although not an action led film, the two action scenes actually featured are nothing short of masterpieces. There was a mixture of technology, well-choreographed combat and intense build ups. All backed up by a great atmosphere. Having all of this done in such a mature style enabled me to take everything that much more seriously which made the arguments far more engaging. Overall-9\/10Although released in 1995, the ideas presented in GitS are becoming more and more pertinent. The ground breaking media and level of detail in GitS has and will continue to inspire many films for years to come. I thoroughly recommend you to watch this film and I encourage you to look into the other GitS films and TV series' that are equally as stunning.

Of course, there are a lot of science-fiction movies that I have liked and praised throughout my entire life as a movie-goer. Some of those films includes The Terminator, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, Total Recall, Blade Runner, Minority Report and Rollerball. But, when I saw A.I. for the very first time, I was thrilled and moved. A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a film that was written and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film tells the story about a young robot child named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is brought into a world where global warming runs amok and a giant megacorporation called Mecha developed robots for humans. The young David was made by Mecha by a scientist named Professor Hobby (William Hurt) . A young couple has just received news that their only son, Martin, slipped into a coma. So, the father of the family decides to bring home a robot from the company. The little boy is named David, and in the beginning of the movie and in the beginning of his new life with his new family, David is unknowingly not accepted by his new mother, Monica (Frances O' Connor). She and David can't seem to relate to one another. After Monica receives news that Martin has come out of his coma, the father, Henry (Sam Robards) decides to bring Martin home. But, there's a sibling rivalry between Martin and David. In fact, David is programmed to show unconditional love. But, his human family isn't prepared for the consequences. After David's protection system is activated by one of Martin's friends during a pool party, he hides behind Martin for protection, leading them to fall into a pool. The human family can't seem to understand David's capabilities on what he can do. One day, Monica decides to abandoned David on the side of the road, leaving him and a robot teddy bear named Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel). Now, all alone and no one to guard him from danger, David decides to ventured out into the open world, where his objective is to find the Blue Fairy that is mentioned in the famous fairy tale, Pinocchio. Later on in the film, David meets another robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law). He, too, is also made from Mecha. So, Gigolo Joe and David team up together as they roamed around the open world of technology by trying to find the Blue Fairy that David is obsessed with. His obsession leads him to the bottom of flooded Manhattan, where he encounters a statue that resembled the Blue Fairy. As mentioned above, A.I. was written and directed by Steven Spielberg himself, but another director, Stanley Kubrick, also was in the development of making A.I. back in the 1970's. Kubrick's ideas was to have David be an actual robot instead of a actor. But, Haley Joel Osment is so good as David. He plays David so precisely through emotion and authenticity. The art-direction of this movie is great. I mean, I have never seen a future quite like this. One of my personal favorite scenes is when David and Gigolo Joe get to Rouge City. Rouge City is perhaps the best looking futuristic metropolis since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. This look of the future is so good-looking and so extraordinary that we are actually living inside this movie. Another thing that was brought up during the movie and even after the movie was the combination behind Kubrick's ideas and Spielberg's original ideas. I believe that both of their ideas worked. You have this robot child that has the ability to love, but the family that he is adopted from doesn't seem to love him. Instead, the family loves Martin, more than they loved David. Yet, robots in this future are the lower existing factor of this world. Spielberg's ideas makes the movie worked, also. The reason why is because it's obvious that in his movies, the young boy or young man questions his appearance, identity, existence and even, his love. This is one of the first of two science-fiction movies that Spielberg was involved in. The following year, he directed Minority Report starring Tom Cruise. What I like in both movies is the vision of the future. It is so optimistic, yet it is not clichéd or predictable in any shape or way or form. A.I. dares us to ask questions about technology. Can we cope with it? Can we reason with it? Can we accept robots as humans? These are questions we can't answer, yet we can see where it leads us. Those questions are just as important as anything that is original. Still, A.I. proves to be a new sci-fi classic from director Steven Spielberg. ★★★ 1\/2 3 1\/2 stars.

But with the success of Star Trek The New Generation and the 25th Anniversary to the show the original cast was given one last hurrah with the sixth Star Trek film.After years of hostiles between The Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire are set to enter into peace negotiations after one of Klingon's moons explodes and leaving the Klingon homeworld 50 years of life left. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) had been leading the negotiations and James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the Enterprise are tasked with the mission to escort the Klingon High Chancellor (David Warner) and his entourage to Earth, despite his hatred for Klingon after the death of his son. But Kirk is famed for the assassination of the High Chancellor, threatening war as forces on both sides wanting keep the status quo.Director of The Wrath of Khan Nicholas Meyer was brought in to direct co-write the sixth entry and he does an excellent job.

This is the world of the 80s, where drink driving, taking advantage of drunk girls and racial stereotypes are all just everyday occurrences. (Of the latter I can't complain too much as Gedde Watanabe does seem to be genuinely enjoying himself, bless him).Having just rewatched Pretty In Pink (and rated it a perhaps overgenerous 8) I was astounded that it not only stands up as a guilty pleasure, but a genuinely decent movie. You may have small niggles, like Andrew McCarthy's eyes continually opening so wide it looks like he's having an aneurysm, or wondering how you ever thought Duckie was straight, but it's a well constructed film with emotional pay-offs.Sixteen Candles, in contrast, has only shallow thrills. There's no real reward with the relationship between Ringwald and Schoeffling as they don't even speak until the end of the movie, and their dialogue consists of trite lines like Make a wish. It already came true. Away from the stilted romance, and Anthony Michael Hall as unlikely friend\/borderline sex pest, we get comedy sound effects to cement the overplayed comedy elements, such as a Chinese cymbal noise every time anyone talks about Long Duk Dong(!)This isn't a bad movie. In many ways, it's quite a good one. But it features two disparate elements that don't gel together all that well while I can see how it went on to be vastly improved in the guise of Pretty In Pink, the other 50% of the movie went on to be Weird Science.

The follow-up, The Breakfast Club, went for overreaching earnestness, and I received many a heated private message when I criticised it in a 2001 review. But fast-forward two years and you get the run of Pretty in Pink\/Ferris Bueller's Day Off\/Some Kind of Wonderful, three solid movies that deserve to be revisited.

Though it was engrossing, I expected much much much more. When seeing it again, months later, I enjoyed it a lot more. I should of known, being a Kubrick film, it would be out of the ordinary. I had known about the film since 1995, which took 15 months to make, and had wondered about it's progress. It actually made the Guinness book of records as the longest movie shoot. Kubrick must of really got into Tom and Nic's heads, a director who demands perfection. It doesn't feel that way when watching their performances, Nicole's, better than Tom's. He's average, nothing more. Eyes Wide Shut, is like stepping into a dream. It's one way you can take this film. It opens your eyes up to infidelity, and what makes us tic, and how we can correct our mistakes that would make us avoid cheating. We more so take the journey with Cruise, a doctor pulls an all nighter after making a respectful house call, at the death of a patient. From there he roams the streets. He goes back with a prostitute. He has second thoughts about going ahead with.... you know, but still pays her. Idiot. He wastes money again later, too. He goes to a jazz bar, to meet up with an old uni friend, now a pianist. He's told of this place, a secret, elite club, involving a sex cult, and Tom just has to go. What happens here, changes his life erratically. Eyes Wide Shut, is beautiful movie visually, especially the naked orgy scene, or Tom going off with some hot models, but you have to take it with patience, thus making the journey worthwhile. How the lengthy scenes work at the stories slow telling of 153 minutes, is truly something magical, that blindsided me. I could hardly take my eyes off the screen. Despite what I thought of it not having the best endings, quite a downer, actually, this movie really makes you think. Although it isn't Kubrick's best work and will chafe quite a few, may'be give it another viewing, just to see if it still has a much undesired effect.

Though it was engrossing, I expected much much much more. When seeing it again, months later, I enjoyed it a lot more. I should of known, being a Kubrick film, it would be out of the ordinary. I had known about the film since 1995, which took 15 months to make, and had wondered about it's progress. It actually made the Guinness book of records as the longest movie shoot. Kubrick must of really got into Tom and Nic's heads, a director who demands perfection. It doesn't feel that way when watching their performances, Nicole's, better than Tom's. He's average, nothing more. Eyes Wide Shut, is like stepping into a dream. It's one way you can take this film. It opens your eyes up to infidelity, and what makes us tic, and how we can correct our mistakes that would make us avoid cheating.

I don't necessarily hate this movie, and I don't believe it's the worst Connery 007 movie in the series. That said, it's still an incredibly weak entry and a low note for Sean Connery's end to his official series run. After George Lazenby and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE didn't perform as well as the studio had hoped (though it was still a success), their mission became to replicate the massive success of GOLDFINGER through any means necessary. All the signs are there Sean Connery in the title role, Shirley Bassey performing the main theme, James Bond returning to America to unravel a complex bit of villainy, and a more toned down film that discards a lot (but not all) of the over-the-top elements of the previous films. The result is a tonally dull and overly complex that, while mildly entertaining at times, is pretty unmemorable. Following the events of the previous film, 007 concludes his worldwide manhunt for SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld when he confronts him and apparently kills him in a plastic surgery facility. From there, he is called in to investigate a diamond smuggling ring out of South Africa in which the diamonds have never resurfaced. When people in the smuggling chain start turning up dead, Bond finds a point of contact in Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) and poses as a smuggler to infiltrate the organization.In a sense, it was good to have Connery back in the title role. But any good will the movie has from that is soon dissolved once we get into the movie itself. From the very beginning, I felt we were off on the wrong foot when it's revealed that Charles Gray has stepped into the shoes of iconic villain Blofeld. I don't have anything against Gray (though the only other time I've seen him on film was as the short-lived MI6 contact Henderson in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) but he doesn't fit the Blofeld mold. The series had gone through a few Blofelds at this point and I'd always wished they'd chosen one actor (preferably Donald Pleasance) and run with him. So, a new Blofeld and it's Charles Gray. It didn't work for me but it could've been forgiven if the rest of the movie wasn't so flawed. Let's move on to Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Bizarre as they were, my major complaint with them had to be the fact that Putter Smith (Mr. Kidd) can't act. This is because he's not an actor. It shows. His line delivery is awkward and lifeless, and it ruins any potential creepiness coming from Bruce Glover's Mr. Wint. Let's shift to some positive casting the Bond women in this movie are some of the hottest. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both gorgeous and, while Plenty O'Toole (Wood) is sort of annoying, Tiffany Case (St. John) could be considered one of the stronger Bond women of the earlier films. She's tough and independent, even if she doesn't know her associates well enough to know if she should truly trust them.Oh, one more bit of bad casting Jimmy Dean, country star\/sausage guru, as business mogul Willard Whyte. Yup.Now, I am happy that the movie attempted to tone down a lot of the over-the-top campiness of some of the more recent fare. No orbital space capsule hijackings, no phony rear projection bobsled chases, etc. The bulk of this movie handles itself with some class. Until the moon buggy chase. At one point, Bond is escaping from an industrial complex where they're filming some sort of moon landing and Bond commandeers the goofiest looking moon buggy you'll ever see, drives it through a wall, and goes bouncing off through the Nevada desert pursued by guards on strange little motor tricycles with balloon tires. As Bond careens around the desert a medium speeds, cars and motor tricycles go barreling out of control and launch off sand dunes by the guards who've apparently never operated a motor vehicle. I'm sorry, but this sequence (when combined with Wint and Kidd&#x85;mostly Kidd) ruins any credibility the movie hoped to maintain. It doesn't do the movie any favors that the plot comes across as way more complex than necessary. Around the midpoint of the film, I totally lose track of who has the diamonds and where they're going and I don't regain my bearings until Bond busts into Whyte's top-floor penthouse.DIAMONDS ARE FORVER isn't the worst 007 film but it's far from one of the best. It's decent entertainment at times but there's nothing here (aside from the moon buggy chase) that remained with me after the final credits rolled when I first saw the movie years ago. The entire final act, with an assault on an oil rig, is a dud. I'd completely forgotten all about it until I rewatched the film again not long ago. As the seventh film in the series, it gives the impression that the series began to lose some steam and the 007 hit machine might not be as invulnerable as it once seemed.

From the very beginning, I felt we were off on the wrong foot when it's revealed that Charles Gray has stepped into the shoes of iconic villain Blofeld. I don't have anything against Gray (though the only other time I've seen him on film was as the short-lived MI6 contact Henderson in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) but he doesn't fit the Blofeld mold. The series had gone through a few Blofelds at this point and I'd always wished they'd chosen one actor (preferably Donald Pleasance) and run with him. So, a new Blofeld and it's Charles Gray. It didn't work for me but it could've been forgiven if the rest of the movie wasn't so flawed. Let's move on to Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Bizarre as they were, my major complaint with them had to be the fact that Putter Smith (Mr. Kidd) can't act. This is because he's not an actor. It shows. His line delivery is awkward and lifeless, and it ruins any potential creepiness coming from Bruce Glover's Mr. Wint. Let's shift to some positive casting the Bond women in this movie are some of the hottest. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both gorgeous and, while Plenty O'Toole (Wood) is sort of annoying, Tiffany Case (St. John) could be considered one of the stronger Bond women of the earlier films. She's tough and independent, even if she doesn't know her associates well enough to know if she should truly trust them.Oh, one more bit of bad casting Jimmy Dean, country star\/sausage guru, as business mogul Willard Whyte. Yup.Now, I am happy that the movie attempted to tone down a lot of the over-the-top campiness of some of the more recent fare. No orbital space capsule hijackings, no phony rear projection bobsled chases, etc. The bulk of this movie handles itself with some class. Until the moon buggy chase. At one point, Bond is escaping from an industrial complex where they're filming some sort of moon landing and Bond commandeers the goofiest looking moon buggy you'll ever see, drives it through a wall, and goes bouncing off through the Nevada desert pursued by guards on strange little motor tricycles with balloon tires. As Bond careens around the desert a medium speeds, cars and motor tricycles go barreling out of control and launch off sand dunes by the guards who've apparently never operated a motor vehicle. I'm sorry, but this sequence (when combined with Wint and Kidd&#x85;mostly Kidd) ruins any credibility the movie hoped to maintain. It doesn't do the movie any favors that the plot comes across as way more complex than necessary. Around the midpoint of the film, I totally lose track of who has the diamonds and where they're going and I don't regain my bearings until Bond busts into Whyte's top-floor penthouse.DIAMONDS ARE FORVER isn't the worst 007 film but it's far from one of the best.

I don't necessarily hate this movie, and I don't believe it's the worst Connery 007 movie in the series. That said, it's still an incredibly weak entry and a low note for Sean Connery's end to his official series run. After George Lazenby and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE didn't perform as well as the studio had hoped (though it was still a success), their mission became to replicate the massive success of GOLDFINGER through any means necessary. All the signs are there Sean Connery in the title role, Shirley Bassey performing the main theme, James Bond returning to America to unravel a complex bit of villainy, and a more toned down film that discards a lot (but not all) of the over-the-top elements of the previous films. The result is a tonally dull and overly complex that, while mildly entertaining at times, is pretty unmemorable. Following the events of the previous film, 007 concludes his worldwide manhunt for SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld when he confronts him and apparently kills him in a plastic surgery facility. From there, he is called in to investigate a diamond smuggling ring out of South Africa in which the diamonds have never resurfaced.

That's only an abbreviation used by haters and naysayers. Its true full name is the much more appropriate, Battlefield Earth The Saga of the Year 3000. Immediately after that bombshell drops in the title screen and some epic bombastic music, the shocking subtitle appears MAN IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES. Whoa. That is serious. I did not sign up for this.A quick summary gets us oriented An evil gold-loving alien race known as Psychlos (from the planet Psychlo) subjugated Earth in a nine- minute invasion back in the early 2000's and have been mining the land for precious metals ever since. Humanity, broken and enslaved, reverted to a caveman lifestyle over the ensuing millennium. Known colloquially by the Psychlos as man-animals and rat-brains, humans are considered to be sheep-like in both their behavior and intelligence. Head Psychlo commander Terl (Travolta) fancies himself a brilliant strategic mind destined for great things but underutilized and disgraced by his position on the detestable planet. He is assisted by a lazy-eyed lieutenant played by Forest Whitaker, who in makeup in this film looks very much like the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz.Psychlos have giant heads and dreadlocks. They are bigger than humans, an effect achieved by having the actors wear stilts and giant platform boots. As a result, all the actors shuffle around awkwardly as though they have a dump in their pants. Either that, or Psychlos as a race actually have trouble with pooping themselves. If that's the case, I take back my criticism, but incontinence wasn't addressed in the film. Psychlos also have large, ill-fitting rubber hands. Terl, for reasons unexplained, actually has six big rubber fingers on his right hand. (I guess it might be a Princess Bride reference).The future humans also have dreadlocks. Most of them also have dirty faces, except for the love-interest girl. She has Clearasil skin and L'oreal makeup. The hero, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper), is known as a greener (as in the grass is always&#x85; get it? It's subtle) because he is an optimist and a modern-day Moses hoping to deliver humanity from bondage. We know he is both a hero and a bad boy because he rides his horse in slow motion. This movie is literally all jacked up. Every single shot is at an angle. In the making-of featurette the cinematographer, in praising his work, said, If we found a shot that was straight-on, we threw it out. He also threw out any shots that had good acting, dialog or logical plot developments. Not to be outdone, the editors added slow motion at random and dug deep into the Powerpoint transition toolbox to blend awkwardly from one scene to the next with 70's era wipe fades. Anyway, Jonnie gets himself captured and taken to the main Psychlo processing facility. Seeing that Jonnie's a dangerous human, Terl decides to hook him up to a knowledge machine and teach him everything in the universe so Jonnie can mine gold for him. Because that makes sense. In one of my favorite scenes, Terl takes Jonnie to a devastated library. He says, You can look at whatever you want because there's nothing here that will help you. Evil laugh. Jonnie randomly selects and reads a perfectly-preserved 1,000-plus year old pristine copy of the Declaration of Independence. Single tear. Let's take a brief detour to define John Travolta's two acting methods in this film 1) Talking through clenched teeth, and 2) speaking in a loud colonial British accent and laughing maniacally. That's it. Detour over. Terl's primary motivation is to have Jonnie lead a group of humans to a vein of gold in the mountains near Aspen. There, the revolutionary-Terl- enhanced-smartest-man-animal-on-the-planet Jonnie is to be left unsupervised with a human crew for 14 days to mine gold. Jonnie learned how to fly the Psychlo ships during his knowledge-machine session, so they leave him some ships, too. What could possibly go wrong? I guess in Terl's defense Probably not a whole lot could actually go wrong in two weeks. Maybe some of them would run off into the woods. Two weeks isn't a very long time to mount much of a resistance (it took me more than three weeks to paint one room in my house), and the Psychlos destroyed most of the human race in nine minutes, so I get why he wasn't too concerned. What he didn't realize, though, was that in two weeks Jonnie was able to do the following &#x95; Using an old one-page map of the entire United States, fly from Colorado to Washington D.C. to look around a bit. &#x95; Fly from DC to Ft. Hood, Texas, finding a secret bunker filled with fully-functional, armed and fueled 1,000 year old Harrier jets and a flight training simulator.

So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you'll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it's hilarious! After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!

After playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of' Josephine' and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for 'Daphne'.Some Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder's directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that's not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that's the very reason it's so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it's so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! But you can't talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full's of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. Some Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!

So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you're constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you're least expecting it you're hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running.
