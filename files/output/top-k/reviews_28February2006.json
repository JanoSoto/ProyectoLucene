It's MUCH better than its predecessor, though it still maintains a solid cheese core, especially notable near the end. But until then it is genuinely scary and intense. The main difference between this movie and the first is that this one takes the terror of the house seriously, in contrast to the sensationalistic, oh my god!! tone of the first film.The awesomely-named director Damiano Daminai, who from what I can tell never made another American film, brings an Italian horror sensibility to this film that works very well, in the same way that American movies now are importing a great deal of Japanese horror techniques. Like Dario Argento, Damiani uses long, slow, wide tracking shots and a steadily rising score on a scene in which nothing is happening, using that to suggest powerful invisible forces about to strike. Haunted house films share the challenge of making something that is often invisible interesting on a movie screen, and this one does a good job (like the original The Haunting) of including scenes in which nothing is really happening except people being scared, feeling a presence, or hearing a noise. Lalo Schifrin also contributes a great score (unlike for the first film) that is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann. For the first half at least, this thing is pretty scary! The intensity is ramped up by some out-of-control family dynamics. There are shocking scenes of child abuse in this film! What's more, there's the whole incest vibe going around the whole family that is really disturbing. The older brother (Sonny) and sister do end up getting it on, but what I found more bothersome was the intimations of attraction of the mother for Sonny, as well as the hints of the same kind of thing burgeoning between the two younger kids. The whole sordid family dynamic is shown in a much more shocking way than would ever be allowed today, with all the editorializing that current films seem to do. I also like the idea that the house would destroy the family by making them all lash out at each other.Alas, there is also a lot of bad to this film, but it never crosses the line into being a drag. Alright, it puts a toe over the line toward the end, but&#133;. The main problem of the first half is that the house is ridiculously active. At night, not a second goes by without something not subtle or gently creepy, but all-out exploding drawers, paintbrushes-painting-by-themselves kind of active. At one point Sonny is home alone and the entire wiring of the house seemingly goes out, an explosion rips open the cellar doors, etc., and yet when his parents arrive home an hour later no one notices anything amiss. In the last third the movie takes a heavy turn into Exorcist territory, with many of the components of that movie recycled here, and it was a big mistake. It removes the focus from the house and just puts it on Sonny, and the entire film, rather than being a distillation of haunted house movie tropes, becomes a cheap rip-off of just ONE movie.Here are a list of individual hootworthy elements That sister is a vixen! Look how she comes on to Sonny! Of course, later everyone unjustly blames her for the two of them sleeping together. The tawdry tramp! One of my favorite parts is when the repairman just stays in the cellar room that is dripping blood on him, making no attempt to exit (though the door is a mere 4 feet away). Finally, when the mother suggests that he come out of there (and what exactly was SHE doing prior to this?) the repairman is like Oh yeah, I guess that's a good idea! The actress who plays the mother is Rutanya Alda. She's good, but please, don't name your children after exotic vegetables.The mother says at dinner all we've been doing is fighting since we got here, but there have been no scenes of fighting up until that point.Someone on IMDb was very impressed with the tablecloth scene, saying it had been done in one take, but if you watch carefully I think there are two separate tablecloths, one that flies off the table and out of frame, another that comes in (from a different angle) and covers the crucifix.There's an Uber-80s element with Sonny wearing his big clunky walkman while in all stages of undress. I love how the demon talks to him through the headphones.One thing the movie tries to coast by on is that there is NO WAY this prim, uptight, God-fearing Christian would marry this nasty, dumb, abusive, church-hating schlub! During the birthday party for Sonny, note how the family is all alone, and then suddenly about 40 guests come piling in the door! The Birthday Bus arrived! Throughout there is much confusion about whether it is night or daytime, to the point where you wonder if this was intentional.Check out Mr. Booth with his bald head and freaky goatee! This is the same guy who played the Lion in The Wiz.The black cop ran into a possessed person before, in Puerto Rico! Travel enough, you'll see 'em.The house explodes as though there's four tons of TNT down in the basement! Watch for completely superfluous cracking open of head. It'll be hard to miss.Hey, there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website, Cinema de Merde, which you can find through the URL in my email address.

Why do we do the things we do? Since it does actually answer this question and resolves this human dilemma - this fact makes it, not necessarily the best film, but nothing less than the most important film of our time, or of all time for that matter. I'm not well read enough on Joan's history to know of its accuracy or not, but who cares, that is not the message of The Messenger. I also don't know anything about the personal life of the writer-director Luc Besson other than he use to be married to Milla Jovovich the star of his film. I don't know how religious or spiritual he is, or even if he completely understands what he has accomplished here, but he must already be a friend of God's or well on his way to understanding or enlightenment or having his moment with God. What he has managed to get on film is only the answer to the age old question - what is the meaning of life ! - and with not one scintilla or trace of preachiness or religiosity - just a search for truth. His Joan wrestles with such important eternal issues till understanding, conviction, and resolution through her God. Everybody believed in Jesus back then, but not every soul had it out with Him or had their moment with Him as we see Joan do in the film. There is such a wide range of opinions evident as to who Dustin Hoffman plays in this movie, from Joan's conscience to the devil. My interpretation is that Dustin played God, with, in this case, the title of, or role of, her Conscience with a capital C. Only the Holy Spirit would have an interest in bringing one to a place, that we see in the film, of conviction, repentance, submission and confession. He shows her (we should all be so lucky - but now with this film, we are) her true motivations of revenge, greed, joy in cruelty, and worst of all pride and she is convicted and says -set me free. How could an all loving God expect any more from His creations, or any less. This movie is a stunning and brilliant depiction of what our Creator wants from us - transactions - and\/or a relationship - our being hungry enough for truth and admitting it when we see it about ourselves and about God - in that we are screwed up and only He holds the keys of resolution (and paid the price, on the cross) for our sin dilemma. I haven't seen this relationship so brilliantly portrayed since Robert Duvall in The Apostle - another very important film. How one guy Luc Besson can go from making possibly the worst film I've ever seen The Fifth Element to possibly the best in The Messenger must say something of his artistry, and of his risk-taking. He was born to deliver this message to mankind in this film about an early protestant. Whether he realizes it or not his message through Milla is very Biblical. I doubt he prayed for help and guidance from God to deliver a Biblical message without being preachy, but in spite of himself he has managed to do it, by having his characterization of Joan so diligent in her quest for truth - she bypasses the stupidity, hypocrisy and deception of religion and goes straight to God herself and has her moment of getting real with God. Never before seen in a major release before, that I've seen, or can think of,off hand. This is a must see film for all. I watched the confession scene with Dustin, (who is God) several times with tears in my eyes. Then eventually before she is martyred He Himself gives her the absolution she so desires. Luc probably made a film having his character perform the way he wishes it were so - about bypassing religion for forgiveness and eternal matters etc. but based on what I've read in God's book - I would say Luc has stumbled on the right formula for having peace with God and going into eternity which we will all have to face one day. I wonder if he is well read in the Bible enough to know God has really made it just that simple. If you don't believe me read His book for yourself and see. Admit that He is God and you ain't and ask for what He offers in forgiveness and eternal life etc. - and He will give it to you. It is all such a good deal, I can't figure out why so many choose not to participate in God's program. Milla is perfect for this part and born to play this role with just the right intensity - I just hope and pray she doesn't burn out with all her vices before even reaching 40 - I'm afraid she fancies herself the next Marilyn or Gia etc. - and is bent on self destruction, but I hope she grows up and lives up to all that potential to deliver many other messages from God for us, through her many talents.Run to the video store and see this film at any cost, and then do what Joan demonstrates at the end of the film - have your moment with God and ask for what He offers - it's all free - you just have to lower your pride enough to do this.- chpnlzt at yahoo ","genre":null},{"date":"28 February 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Milla - the real - Messenger What we have here is a film about motivations.

Milla is perfect for this part and born to play this role with just the right intensity - I just hope and pray she doesn't burn out with all her vices before even reaching 40 - I'm afraid she fancies herself the next Marilyn or Gia etc. - and is bent on self destruction, but I hope she grows up and lives up to all that potential to deliver many other messages from God for us, through her many talents.Run to the video store and see this film at any cost, and then do what Joan demonstrates at the end of the film - have your moment with God and ask for what He offers - it's all free - you just have to lower your pride enough to do this.- chpnlzt at yahoo ","genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama"},{"date":"28 February 2006","score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" ...but the movie is great fun even when you know what's going to happen.I'd like to call it the B-side of Yojimbo, mainly because it revisits the same character that that movie is based on, Sanjuro, but in other respects as well, being it much less renown than that movie, not that it is any less good, making it sort of the movie that a real Kurosawa fan would know about.

The movie piles up images, intrigue, mystery and suspense and resolves it all in a very cohesive, almost perfectionist way. I mean, it is hard to find mistakes here, though we know that most of it is uncanny. I think, in this sense, Kurosawa had the talent of structuring his plot negatively, precisely by way of mistake.

It then goes to show, through a combination of Kurosawa's staging and Mifune's acting, the omnipresence of the samurai, much in the way Luke Skywalker failed to show his when he was finally a Jedi in Episode vi of the Star Wars saga. For example, in that movie, the Jedi pushes 'bad guys' away through an omnipresent power which no one sees or feels. That in itself negates the possibility of us believing the power is actually his -the Force he called it (giving it a name, and such a redundant use of it, already weakens the whole concept)&#150; apart from the fact that most of the revelations of this 'Force' are creatively deficient. Here, the samurai confronts over 200 men in a most astonishing opening fight that lasts very little time. One of the great lines is his samurai contender's 'ceasefire', who says 'Leave him. It'll take us too long to get rid of him'. The scene is a great battle scene, because of the character content it portrays, one which summarizes in just a few seconds how necessary and ingenious a fight can be within the framework of a story, far from being just merely a formulaic tool for suspense (Check out how he turns the back to the camera... cinematically more effective than attracting a sword through thin air). Finally, in this opening sequence, Kurosawa presents the exemplary subject of his film a batch of rebellious dimwits, unexperienced and weak (again, in very little time this is explained to the utmost detail), who must overcome an inevitable destiny of imperial corruption. Their only strength of course is the goodness of their cause. We are about to witness the intent of the impossible how a rebellion of just a handful of men shall try to overcome an entire 'empire'. This also reminds us of Star Wars, but sadly, again, Star Wars never makes us understand how powerful the empire is, what type of corruption it holds (what is the dark side anyways... why is it dark, just because they wear black, just because the are holding Leia prisoner? must be because the emperor is so ugly), and what qualities, strength, weaknesses, do the rebels hold? Oponents are devoid of contrast within themselves, thus that whole storyline is more or less a waste.

One severely outnumbers the other. And one is much more mischievous and astute, while goodness, as we see here, is few and far between, seems vulnerable, innocent and in many cases just plain dumb. The addition of the samurai personifies both sides and creates gorgeous shading throughout. Finally, the triumphal finale is wonderfully executed. And the final cinematic metaphors of that plight are unforgettable. There are many things that can be analyzed here. But the reception of the thematic elements is what varies and inevitably, as in all or most film except for those we call classics, it is this that will divide opinions and make some people accept one film and not another; like one film or dislike it.

And remember how you're not 10 anymore? First, a few of the steaming elements in this potent brew The movie begins with flashbacks of the previous occupants being shot in their beds. Then, a few minutes later, as James and Margot are looking through the rooms, we get the same quick flashbacks again, in case you're just too stupid to realize that these are the very same rooms where the murders took place.Yikes! What about those hideously tacky mirrors in the master bedroom! Is that the horror the title is talking about? The film's lamentable gesture toward sensuality is horribly wrong-footed. First we have Margot Kidder with a daisy in her hair (okay fine, it's the 70s) practicing her ballet moves in front of the aforementioned hideous bedroom mirrors in her panties and thigh-high white stockings. Then James Brolin, looking like the lost Brother Gibb, comes in and they make sensuous out-of-focus love as reflected in the hideous mirrors. It doesn't look like it's very fun, and the stupid daisy stays in Margot's hair the whole time.This film features not one, but two clean vomitings! Where someone pukes behind a car door, and amazingly their face is lickably clean just after! You just don't see too many performances in orthodontic headgear anymore.Huh, they sure do have a comprehensive concert lighting system deployed in that attic room! Hey, and did anyone else notice that the lights on in that attic room kind of look like eyes? Kind of like the house is, you know, watching you? That's one of the subtle and underplayed touches that set this film apart from the rest.This evil house steals petty cash! Murray Hamilton may have to worry about getting typecast as the patronizing guy who tells you to stop all that nonsense about sharks\/ghosts so as not to disrupt the tourists\/clergy. Or maybe that's just in movies that take place in a town with Amity in the name.Rod Steiger sets the monologue intensity bar at the top, then sails over it again and again! The wicked house makes crank phone calls! There's a weird thing I noticed where, in the scene where Brolin is going nuts and swings the axe at Kidder (on the floor), they are both shown in old-age makeup. It only lasts for a second, and when the attack is over, it's gone. Surely just another masterstroke of the director. That fails.The main problem with the movie is that its and then, and then, and then structure makes it feel like absolutely nothing is happening, even though it sometimes is. I think it was a mistake to structure the movie around the days in the house (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) because it adds to the feeling of tedium, it inspires feelings of It's only day 7, Jeez, how long is this going to last?, and finally, it makes it seem like SO MUCH is happening in the house that these people are plumb nuts not to leave. It also results in a bad effect from the sudden jump, about two-thirds of the way through, to the last night, with a corresponding leap in the intensity of the ghostly goings-on. It leaves an impression that the days in between were just too boring, or they were too similar to the first days, or that the filmmakers recognize that the audience would just be getting bored. The remake has the sense to limit itself to the beginning, the middle, and the end.One thing that I think is just flat-out careless film-making is that the panes of the upper eye-like windows are shown intact, many times, after those windows have CLEARLY been blown out.You do know that this story was proved to be a hoax years ago, don't you? You can do a quick search and find info on that, I don't have the interest to look it up for you. But when you think of it like that, jeez folks, cut back on the sheer amount and variety of phenomena a little bit, this is getting ridiculous.So, as for this story they invented, and how it was presented in the movie, I think a curious subtext emerges. The Brolin character, James Lutz, is presented as having converted from Judiasm to Catholicism to marry Margot, and the movie develops a lot of tension from his adjusting to his life with her and her kids. The house is on Long Island, traditionally a very WASP-y community. I'm not sure it's intended, but the actions of the house can be interpreted as a repulsive reaction to a Jew, and worse than that, a Jew who forswore his religion, attempting to enter the community. I'm sure Brolin's dunk into the blood at the end has something to do with this, but I'm so down on my religious texts I can't spell it out.The only other thing I should mention is that the director also did Cool Hand Luke.Hey, there's lots more reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website, Cinema de Merde, which you can find by using the URL in my email address.

And remember how you're not 10 anymore? First, a few of the steaming elements in this potent brew The movie begins with flashbacks of the previous occupants being shot in their beds. Then, a few minutes later, as James and Margot are looking through the rooms, we get the same quick flashbacks again, in case you're just too stupid to realize that these are the very same rooms where the murders took place.Yikes! What about those hideously tacky mirrors in the master bedroom! Is that the horror the title is talking about? The film's lamentable gesture toward sensuality is horribly wrong-footed. First we have Margot Kidder with a daisy in her hair (okay fine, it's the 70s) practicing her ballet moves in front of the aforementioned hideous bedroom mirrors in her panties and thigh-high white stockings. Then James Brolin, looking like the lost Brother Gibb, comes in and they make sensuous out-of-focus love as reflected in the hideous mirrors. It doesn't look like it's very fun, and the stupid daisy stays in Margot's hair the whole time.This film features not one, but two clean vomitings! Where someone pukes behind a car door, and amazingly their face is lickably clean just after! You just don't see too many performances in orthodontic headgear anymore.Huh, they sure do have a comprehensive concert lighting system deployed in that attic room! Hey, and did anyone else notice that the lights on in that attic room kind of look like eyes? Kind of like the house is, you know, watching you? That's one of the subtle and underplayed touches that set this film apart from the rest.This evil house steals petty cash! Murray Hamilton may have to worry about getting typecast as the patronizing guy who tells you to stop all that nonsense about sharks\/ghosts so as not to disrupt the tourists\/clergy. Or maybe that's just in movies that take place in a town with Amity in the name.Rod Steiger sets the monologue intensity bar at the top, then sails over it again and again! The wicked house makes crank phone calls! There's a weird thing I noticed where, in the scene where Brolin is going nuts and swings the axe at Kidder (on the floor), they are both shown in old-age makeup. It only lasts for a second, and when the attack is over, it's gone. Surely just another masterstroke of the director.

Blade Runner (Sci-Noir, but anyway) is one of the few, questioning another facet of human nature, again doing so without resorting to blunt explanation when eloquent ambiguity communicates much more powerfully.

It's March of 1991. Exxon has just agreed to pay $1 billion to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Rodney King is beaten by Los Angeles police officers. The Gulf War nears its end. These are serious times, and the people need a serious movie. Instead, they get Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze. Thanks, Hollywood.Wait a minute. Maybe Turtles 2 is exactly what America needed, a movie that required no thought, no emotional attachment and gave you a few quick laughs. In the first movie, the four turtles have a serious cathartic experience. They fear Splinter is dead, and have a vision of him, where he tells them he loves them all. In the second film, there's none of that mushy, gooey, completely enjoyable stuff. The filmmakers care little about things like catharsis and character motivation. The one thing that could be considered important in that sense just comes across as pointless, and is wrapped up with a single line. Leonardo, I am your father. Okay, I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea.Anyway, catharsis and character just get in the way of quick jokes and rap numbers. Yes, I am being sarcastic, but the point still stands. What's important to this movie is the Good Time Factor. 'Are you having a good time,' and almost more importantly, 'are the characters having a good time?'

It was a pleasant experience which starred many of the characters from one of my favorite horror movies, Aliens.Poor Caleb (Adrian Pasdar), he just has this wild side which gets him into trouble one night when he picks up a fine looking girl named Mae (Jenny Wright). She then proceeds to make him a part of her psychotic family, even though she seems completely sane. The bad thing is that her family members, which include father figure Jesse (Lance Henriksen) mother figure Diamondback (Jenette Goldstein)and brother figure Severn(Bill Paxton), aren't your average psychos. They have a secret which is most unholy, and now Caleb is trapped in a nightmare that he can't seem to escape from.However he has his own family, a father named Loy (Tim Thomerson) and a sister who care deeply for him and proceed to track him down and bring him back. Caleb doesn't know this at first but later finds out at perhaps one of the worse times because suddenly his other family, the evil unnatural one, knows as well. And so the movie goes on from there.The acting in Near Dark was very good. That's a splendid treat for any horror movie. Not only does it have good actors, it also includes character development which also makes for a wonderful experience. Bill Paxton was hysterical as Severn, and all the other actors added a little bit to make this one of the better horror movies of the late 80s.Still this movie has a few flaws. The ending didn't seem complete, and the cure that helps bring Caleb back from the dark side seemed to be a cop out of a sort. I think I understand what the director (Kathryn Bigelow) was trying to do. She was trying to bring family values into the movie. Sort of like a young adult who has lost their way and needs their family to bring them back around to the right way. For the most part this works. Even the psycho family had its own type of family values. They may have killed others, but they always looked out for each other. However, the ending of the film and the ultimate cure just doesn't seem to work for me. I guess it just seemed a little too easy for me.Still Kathryn Bigelow brought us one heck of a good movie. And now that I'm about to end this review, I will finally say that the movie was a unique take on the vampire with some surprising twists that gave us no fangs or facial transformations. The word vampire is never mentioned in the movie either. It is only observed as a strange virus that can be cured by a simple blood transfusion. I guess you can understand why I can't quite except that cure or the slightly rushed ending. But I still liked the movie, and will give it a very high star rating.

I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones I hear about over here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.When the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing!However, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either.

I read up on the reviews for preparation to be unbiased and fair to it.I think the problem with this movie is a tired plot and a terribly two dimensional script. Keanu's and Charlize's performance was what helped to lift it out of a 4\/10 rating for me. Jason Issac as a cross dressing flatmate was a heartwarming portrayal of how friendship does not always come in neat little packages hemmed in by our expectations. His loyalty and support for Charlize's Sara was the real cruncher in this movie for me. Nelson's initial shock and reaction on seeing Jason's Chaz in a loud dress was hilarious only because it does mirror the general population's.The other part of the movie that I find strangely revealing and therefore very endearing, was when Nelson decides Christmas should come a month early for Sara. He pops into her house via the window while everyone is having Thanksgiving and proceeds to give her twelve gifts for Christmas. Each gift and especially the last one, was obviously well thought out in relation to his feelings for her and their relationship throughout that November.I have read snippets of how Keanu is very fiercely protective, private, very loving and giving as a person to those he cares deeply about and that entire scene made me realize this is less acting the part but more a lingering snapshot of a small part of who he really is.I have so far watched Speed, A Walk in the Clouds and the Matrix Trilogy, all of which showcases Keanu as a leading man. I must say that I do catch glimpses of what looks like the real Keanu popping up every now and then. So it's no wonder that Sandra Bullock should say that she was very taken by the way Keanu looked at her just before he kissed her at the end of Speed.I think that many people are quick to rubbish Keanu's acting as wooden because they fail to notice that bit of his soul, often very obviously displayed on the screen, just because it usually isn't displayed on his face.Enjoy the movie for what it is, a simple love story with a bittersweet ending and you won't be disappointed.

The suspense is high from the get-go, with Lola's boyfriend Manni phoning her to say that if he doesn't get 100,000 deutsche marks within 20 minutes, a gangster will kill him. Immediately, Lola sets off running through Berlin in a frantic attempt to locate the money. The fun part is that we see Lola's journey three times with three very different outcomes, determined by little things that happen to Lola as she runs.Lola (the engaging Franka Potente) manages to be both an iconic, super-cool heroine, and a believable young woman who just wants to get her boyfriend out of trouble. IMDb ratings show that this is the rare action movie that appeals to girls more than to guys, probably because Lola is such a strong character. This is exhilarating film-making, with a propulsive soundtrack, a fast pace, and many flashy effects like animated and black-and-white sequences--in addition to the most stunning use of split-screen that I've ever seen. Incredibly for such a young director, these techniques are employed with great assurance. I also like how although the film is hip and sometimes amused by the crazy things that happen to people, it's never cynical. Instead, there's a sweet optimism to it, a faith in karma and love.Occasionally, Run Lola Run is a bit too clever for its own good. The rapid-fire montages that show the fates of minor characters are superficially amusing, but unnecessarily hammer home the theme that little things can have a huge effect on a person's life. However, the movie's philosophies are still ambiguous enough that there's a lot to think about when it's over. Furthermore, Run Lola Run is an extraordinarily good time; it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen whenever Lola's on it.

IMDb ratings show that this is the rare action movie that appeals to girls more than to guys, probably because Lola is such a strong character. This is exhilarating film-making, with a propulsive soundtrack, a fast pace, and many flashy effects like animated and black-and-white sequences--in addition to the most stunning use of split-screen that I've ever seen. Incredibly for such a young director, these techniques are employed with great assurance. I also like how although the film is hip and sometimes amused by the crazy things that happen to people, it's never cynical. Instead, there's a sweet optimism to it, a faith in karma and love.Occasionally, Run Lola Run is a bit too clever for its own good. The rapid-fire montages that show the fates of minor characters are superficially amusing, but unnecessarily hammer home the theme that little things can have a huge effect on a person's life. However, the movie's philosophies are still ambiguous enough that there's a lot to think about when it's over. Furthermore, Run Lola Run is an extraordinarily good time; it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen whenever Lola's on it.

The suspense is high from the get-go, with Lola's boyfriend Manni phoning her to say that if he doesn't get 100,000 deutsche marks within 20 minutes, a gangster will kill him.

When one looks at the vastness of space, the Enterprise seems to be more or less on a highway rather than exploring the galaxies. There always seems to be something in the way. Those darned cosmic clouds. I would never consider myself a Trekkie, but I have certainly spent a good part of my life devoting myself to Kirk and the boys (it breaks my heart to see him such a mess these days). This has the Serlingesque plot of dealing with real artifacts of a bygone time; much as several episodes were. Kirk gets to emote all over the place. Everything is so serious. But they win the day by making use of their earthling intellects (with a little Vulcan thrown in for good measure). I know that some believe this to be a thinking man's (or woman's) movie. I wish it weren't so simplistic. With Star Wars  stealing their thunder, Roddenberry and the other writers should have come up with a masterpiece. Either they weren't up to the task or they were trying to pander to a lightweight crowd. I don't know. I'm glad there were a few others afterward, using the original cast because if this was the legacy, it would have been a disappointment.
