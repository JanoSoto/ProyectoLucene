Stanley Kubrick directed my favorite film of all-time, 2001, another Top 10, A Clockwork Orange, and all-time classics, Dr.Strangelove..., Paths Of Glory and Full Metal Jacket. But alas EWS falls far short of those dizzying high points. It begins brilliantly with a fascinating and dreamy party where the psycho-sexual landscape is set up as precisely as a chessboard and the play is engaged between Dr. Harford and his wife Alice. The opening moves are typical Kubrick and therefore masterful, but then it devolves into a game I really didn't care about. The much talked about orgy scene looks like it came from Red Shoes Diaries. There are some great looking bodies in it (even in the altered US version --which is another story in itself), but what was intended to be shocking was less adventurous than things we've seen on HBO's Real Sex series. I didn't care about Harford and his wife. Tom Cruise does well with what he can in his role but like most of Kubrick's main characters he is an icon rather than a real person. Stanley has gotten away with this more than any other director in history, but here it doesn't work. Nicole Kidman is the best thing about the movie but she dissappears in the second half of it except to come on in time to utter what will go down as one of the most memorable closing lines ever. Kubrick's death is a huge loss for film and filmgoers. His passing hit me harder far more than Di, JFK Jr. and John Lennon, but it doesn't make EWS more than a better than average movie.

Let's get that straight right now. I have seen it a number of times and it just keeps getting better. The story line is fresh, the casting perfect, camera shots are unique, and the sound bites original. Oh yea, the soundtrack is great too. Six guys commit a robbery and you don't even see it. You spend the whole movie watching the planning of the caper and the turmoil afterwards. Harvey Keitel may have given his best performance of his career and Steve Buscemi is a classic. In fact it's Buscemi's 'Mr. Pink' (there is a great line in response to his disapproval to the color pink) weasel character that I feel is the gasoline in the Reservoir Dogs engine. He represents the voice of reason and clear thinking on one point and sneaky and scheming on the other. Michael Madsen's 'Mr. Blonde' was made for him. Tim Roth 'Mr. Orange' has his ground breaking role (I can't say what as because it ruins part of the plot). Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney are perfect as the father son mob team. What is really great about this movie is the dialog. Some of the best ever and truly original. The dialog in Reservoir Dogs flows so smoothly and naturally that it gives a more than a movie feel to it. For example the part in the bathroom with the cops standing around talking was beautiful because that is how how cops chit chat to each other about who's butt they busted or how stupid this guy was. Tarantino even had the cops talking about it with that kind of smirky ego locker room talk. That and having Roth break in and continue his description of the story right there was great. Also, the opening scene is a bona fide classic. The Madonna speech, the discussion on tipping, everything about that was great dialog. I also love the way Madsen and Keitel go back and forth at one point in the movie (I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan). If you haven't seen the movie yet be prepared because it jumps around between past and present like 'Godfather 2'. But, that is also part of the genius of it. It's bloody, so if you hate violence go rent a Disney movie instead and save yourself from stopping a great movie and complaining that this is what causes violence in youths. Wrong (that's another argument I won't get into but we can't make every movie for 10 year olds and if they happen to get a hold of it where were you when they did!). Reservoir Dogs goes on the classic list. It's a top of the shelf action movie with dark comedy and great lines to boot. One word of advice to Mr. Tarantino, stop putting yourself in your movies. You are not an actor! Stick to directing where you do your best work.

Wonderful visual aspects that you just want to tell George Lucas not to move the camera so quickly so we can look at the details more closely.  It moves from one wonderful scenery to another.  Jar Jar Binks is not as bad as everybody says, he's worse!  Why did they ever put the irritating bloke in the movie I will never understand. But having said that you do tend to get used to the annoying creature the second time round and he puts a smile on your face -)The little boy that plays Anakin is not a bad actor (no worse the Keanu Reaves anyway) but Ewan McGregor should be shot  for his lacklustre performance as a Jedi Knight, no match for Mark Hamill.  Although Liam Neeson is not as entertaining as Harrison Ford he gives a better performance then his jedi student Ewan McGreger.Without a shadow of a doubt best moment of the film is the lightsaber duel between the Jedi's and Darth Maul.  The Sith Lord is just great, popping in and out of scenes like some kind of phantom.  The choreography in the duel is just first class and it's worth watching the whole film just for this alone.  The sound is also unbelievably outstanding. When you hear John Williams score at the beginning of the movie you take notice.  The pod race is only second to the race in Ben-Hur as sometimes I thought I was in the driver's seat!Having said that most people would probably not even understand who the Phantom Menace was, let alone kids.  But George has set it up nicely for the second film.For all those people that love Star Trek I will never understand why when they have watched this kind of science fiction.  I mean who can anybody ever go back to Star Trek films?When the film started in the Odeon Leicester Square everybody clapped and cheered and some even took pictures of the first part of the film, the part that says The Phantom Menace.  You can't get that from any other movie. Star Wars is what cinema is all about - entertainment.  No need for blood, violence, swearing or sex just pure cinematic pleasure.toco!

The film's key distinction is essentially that it looks bad with lots of hand-jerky motions which only serve to make one dizzy. There is little real story to the movie and suffice to say the movie feels improvised and off the cuff and subsequently amateurish. The only facinating aspect to this movie is how in the world it could have generated so much hype. The theatre I went to was a packed house while the EWS was only half full (both were good-sized theatres).

Confidential in that, unlike in most features, there is no central character to be played by a well known Hollywood star.  Instead, the plot is driven by three cops in 1950s Los Angeles.  They are Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey).  The former two actors are both Australian (Guy Pearce was in Neighbours back in 1990) and before this film were virtual unknowns in the movie business.  The fact that two of the leads are played by someone who the audience has never seen before is what makes them so fascinating and interesting to watch on screen.  They are both absolutely breathtaking as the two very different police officers and they seem very at home in the glitzy and glamorous atmosphere of the 50s that the movie creates.  As for Kevin Spacey - he too manages to surprise us with his laid back approach to the role of Jack Vincennes who is frequently called The Big V, a movie star among cops.  The storyline deals with a multiple homicide that takes place one night in a café.  Among the victims is a bent cop who had just been fired for starting a riot in the police station.  From here the story progresses through a number of twists but it is really about the relationship between Ed Exley, the by-the-book career climber and Bud White, the loose cannon psycho who has a thing for helping women.  Even if you don't understand all the numerous details of the plot (some of which can be quite hard to pick up on the first time round), the film is still incredibly watchable and tremendously exciting - partly because of the general feel of all the corruption, scams, gangsters and betrayal that existed in 50s LA.

It was funny to see how others think of this state.  (The 'others' being movie writers.)I thought it was a funny movie with the requisite jaw dropping scenes to provide moments of horror. It vacillated between horror and comedy quite nicely.  Keeps the viewer off balance.  Betty White was a little annoying, but who didn't laugh when she fed the crocodile? Watch this movie for fun, it must not be taken seriously, after all it was made for entertainment.

As for the dialogue,i must admit there were some scenes which were next to brilliant,kudos to writer David Mckenna.As for Edward Nortons acting i can truly say it was a very well acted and well a delivered portrayal,i can see hands down why he won such critical acclaim and was also awarded the nomination for best supporting actor.All in all i think American History X is well worth a rental,movies like this do not come around everyday.
