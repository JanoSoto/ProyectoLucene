The stunts are terrifically thought out and performed, though many call the plane stunt in the pre-credits sequence unreal or impossible, yet they forget this is James Bond.  James Bond is a fantasy, and not all of the things are real.  James Bond movies take the world we live in and twist it a bit to make a great movie.  Take for instance Moonraker.  In Moonraker, they take advantage of the new space shuttles in the movie.  There are factual inconsistencies such as the fact that NASA could not launch a space shuttle just like that.  It takes major preparation to launch just one space shuttle, which includes combing the road where the space shuttle is taken down to the launching pad, test firings and numerous hours of training.  Even with this, they require a launch window, which I doubt would just happen to be there.

For those looking for a whiney anti-war film in the Vietnam tradition, this isn't it. The men portrayed in Saving Private Ryan are American soldiers of the 1940's who realize that, like it or not, they stand between the dark night of Nazi tyranny and freedom for millions. They have truly gone in harm's way. In case you are still unfamiliar with the story, Private Ryan is the sole survivor of four brothers who are serving in the military. Two are killed in the Normandy invasion, a third has been killed a short time earlier at New Guinea in the Pacific Theater. Army Chief of Staff George Marshall is so trouble by the prospect that another family will lose all of its sons to the war, that he orders a small unit of eight men to find the surviving Ryan. Marshall is haunted by the deaths of the five Sullivan brothers who all perished when the ship on which they served went down in the Pacific. Marshall is clearly not doing this as an Army publicity stunt. A letter he posseses which was written by Abraham Lincoln to a mother who made a similar sacrifice during the War Between the States also spurs Marshall into action. Ryan parachuted into Normandy with the 101st Airborne Division the night before the beach actions and, thus, will be difficult to find. The men on the rescue mission are just guys. Nothing special about them. The thing that makes them stand out is their determination to just do their job. They're not sure why Ryan is so special, but they intend to find out or die trying.This is Tom Hanks at his best. His portrayal of a World War II officer is never better than when he gives his men their last minute instructions in the landing craft. He ends by saying, And I'll see you on the beach.

That fact that it is funny, whilst being voilent, sauve and sofisticated makes it increadably enjoyable to watch. John Cusack in the lead role as Martin Blank is fantastic, the way that he goes through the motions of being a cold blooded killer to a carring boyfriend, without losing and of his personality is cleaverly done. Dan Ackroyd as the opposing hitman is darkly funny, whilst praise must also be given to Hank Azaria and K. Todd Freeman for their roles as the two disgruntled govenment agents. The only downside so far as the acting is concerned is with Minnie Driver. Though acceptable in her role, she does not give enough of a performance, so that she lags slightly behind the others in the film. The soundtrack is one the best compilations of eighties music you will ever hear, and is slotted neatly into place throughout the films, as to levetate certain scenes.

It's an intelligent film - the concept isn't novel but the setting is (and let's put in a word for the terrific design of the cubes). Sure, the characters may be stereotypes but their interactions are not so predictable (you don't expect the leader to lose control and turn nasty, for example). Similarly, the dialogue sometimes leaves a lot to be desired (too much oh my God!' and of course!) - but how would you talk in the same situation?As to the why? of it all, I don't see it as a cop-out, as some reviewers have suggested. The fact is, there IS no why, as Worth patiently explains. There IS no conspiracy, there IS no brain behind it - it's a big corporate mistake. Only those desperate for another X-Files Big Conspiracy Theory should be disappointed by this explanation.As for the characterisation, the film suffers (as does 'Seven') from not having enough time to develop its characters properly. But to do so would have generated even more talk, and would probably have got boring. Besides, nobody complained that we didn't really know who Mr Blond was in 'Reservoir Dogs'.'Cube' resembles 'Event Horizon' in its situation and the horror of its exposition - but where 'Event Horizon' just gave us a series of iconic figures to be dispatched in a 'Who's next? exercise, 'Cube' bothers to give us more. I found myself caring about the characters, I responded positively to the structural approach, I admired the production design and I was regularly surprised.
