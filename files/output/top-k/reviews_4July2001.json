[{"date":"4 July 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is full of too many tired jokes that have been featured in just about every Mike Myers movie.  In fairness there were one or two new jokes in this movie but they weren't that funny.I was looking forward to the great advances in animation that this movie had made.  To be honest I've seen better overall animation in a PC Video game.  The 3D-ish characters were well done but they overlayed on painfully obvious 2D backgrounds that resembled paintings rather than animation. This is almost comparable to what Walt Disney did in the 40's its just that he didn't use the computer to create everything.  Toy Story was a much better animation advance than Shrek as everything in it was an integrated design.If you like bodily function jokes or Mike Myers a lot (or you're under the age of 12) Shrek would be a great movie for you.  Otherwise, stay away from this one.

Shrek and a new acquaintance, Donkey (played by Eddie Murphy), go to Lord Farkquad (played by John Lithgow; the midget sized prince who is trying to be evil but is still funny), because Farkquad was the one who banished the fairy tale creatures to his land. He requests if Shrek wants to get his land back, he must get Princess Fiona, (played by Cameron Diaz), who is locked in a tower guarded by a dragon. Shrek succeeds, and on the return trip, they fall in love. Their is a surprise ending, (don't worry, I won't tell you), an ending that I don't really like, and that is the reason that I gave it the rating I did. I do suggest you see this movie however, due the overwhelmingly funny jokes and characters.
