Taking it from the beginning In the opening scene, a coalition of police forces storms a Moscow nightclub to arrest a Russian gang figure named Gazzi. Now, as any policeman knows, the first thing you do in an arrest is handcuff the perp. But in this case, despite their overwhelming numbers and armament, Major Koslova (Venora) and Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier), stand and argue with the guy for a few minutes while the other police stand by and do nothing. This, of course, allows Gazzi to get the jump on Koslova with a knife. Not the greatest police work. Then as Gazzi and Koslova struggle, she manages to get her gun free and shoot him. A few minutes later Preston thanks her for saving his life. His life? She was the one he was trying to kill.For revenge, Gazzi's brother hires the Jackal (Bruce Willis) to perform an assassination of, as it turns out, the First Lady of the U.S. In the next scene, the Jackal purchases a weapon on the internet - from some sort of eBay for terrorists, it would seem. He chooses a huge Gatling gun that fires monstrous depleted uranium bullets at an advertised 1400 rounds a minute (although if you time the actual firing later in the film, it isn't even a third of that rate). Now the question is Was he high? If you want to kill a single person the best weapon is a sniper rifle of some kind, like the one used by the Jackal in the original novel. One of those would have been infinitely easier to acquire, transport, and hide. Instead he buys a machine cannon that would be more appropriate for engaging an entire army division. Okay, dramatic license, but please.He smuggles the giant weapon to Canada, and there he contracts a local techno-hood (Jack Black) to build him a remote controlled firing apparatus. He tells the hood he doesn't want to attract any attention, and demands that he turn over the blueprints for the thing when he is finished. Then when the hood asks him or a few thousand bucks for the plans (out of 70 million the Jackal is being paid), he takes the guy out into the woods and uses him for target practice with his weapon, leaving the corpse and several hundred somewhat unusual depleted uranium bullets for the authorities to find. How's that for not attracting attention? In the book, the Jackal kills the guy in his house and hides the body, much more credibly.After the gruesome murder scene is quickly discovered, Preston and Declan Mulqueen (Richard Gere) fly up to Canada and locate the hood's shop, where they find the blueprints for the firing station that were so important for the Jackal to destroy, although after he'd killed Black, the Jackal seems to have decided the blueprints weren't worth going back to the shop for. This is a guy that is the absolute best at his trade? Mulqueen takes one look at the plans for the device, which had nothing to do with the weapon itself except to mount it and fire it, and immediately deduces the exact cyclic rate of the weapon's automatic fire. Brainy.The Jackal manages to smuggle the weapon across Lake Michigan on a pleasure boat, and as he's docked at a marina he spies Mulqueen, who appears to be searching for him (Mulqueen had not yet seen him at that point). Does he try to hide, to appear inconspicuous, to keep a low profile? No, he pulls out a gun and starts firing at Mulqueen! How's that for not attracting attention? Then he has to make a screaming getaway in his van. Great plan, for someone whose success depends on not being discovered.For her safety, Mulqueen's former lover Isabella (Mathilda May) is moved out of her house by the FBI people, who fear the Jackal may come after her. Why he might be after her is never explained (perhaps he would need a pleasantly sadistic diversion from the tedious job of planning an assassination). Rather than leave the house empty, Koslova and an FBI agent remain in it, sitting ducks. Why? At one point they realize the Jackal is probably inside the house (they were outside at the time). Do they call for backup? Do they establish a perimeter and contain him, knowing that they have him boxed in? No, of course not. They run back into the house, where the Jackal, hiding and waiting for them, kills them both. Police Work 101? In the film's climactic scene, the Jackal and Mulqueen face off in a DC Metro station in the middle of the day. The scene is a good 5 minutes long, and for the duration of it no one else (except for Isabella) appears in the station. Even assuming that all the riders had been scared away by the gunplay, it's hard to imagine that no police of any variety showed up. Maybe the director waved them out.Considering the competence of the good guys and the bad guy, it's surprising anybody won.

Credibility is strained, and Seth (Giovanni's character) should have realized that these bastards were up to no good right from his first day at the firm. Many questions are left unanswered as to how people with such a prick attitude got their positions in the first place. I was bothered by the characters of Michael the firm's leader, and his main brokerage trainer Greg. These two do not represent any positive leadership. I would hope that teens and young adults watching this film understand the way that these pricks conducted business was reprehensible.The main problem with Boiler Room is that there is such a disdain for the heads of the firm, with their deception and brain-washing business practices, that the anger you feel with them picking fights, and basically being a$$holes to most everyone around them, detracts from the suspense of the movie.

I'm one of the few people on the planet who saw Honky Tonk Freeway on its original release. Glen or Glenda is, in its own bizarre way, a favorite. I will stoutly defend the notion that there should be an honored place for films that are SO BAD that they are good--that are, in fact, mesmerizing in their awfulness. Would we want to be without Valley of the Dolls? Or The Oscar? Or Showgirls? However--there are many types of bad films, like the A-list picture that is so tedious and pretentious that you would gnaw your arm off to escape (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, anyone?). There is the treaclefest--the entire output of Frank Capra. And, rarest of all, there is The Movie For Which There Is No Excuse whatsoever. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly what we have here.Broadway playwright William Goodhart wrote what has to be one of the most convoluted and nonsensical screenplays ever. It's as if the producer went in to pitch the film as Four years later, the demon is still after Regan and Richard Burton is a new, tormented exorcist! Great, eh? and for reasons best known to God gets greenlighted. The author then promptly takes a massive hit of LSD , starts gibbering strangely, and writes the screenplay. In spite of the fact that it's incomprehensible, producer has signed Burton, Louise Fletcher (as a kinder, gentler Big Nurse), Linda Blair, Paul Henreid (a far cry from Now, Voyager), and James Earl Jones, who provides one of the film's striking moments dressed as a giant locust.The problem with all of this, of course, is that the screenplay is stuck in a kind of limbo--not bad enough to be good, and not good enough to be good--and it ends out being just boring. Even at a running time of under two hours, one longs for a pair of scissors.I really haven't got the heart to try and articulate the confused mess that passes for a plot.

After many years, I have just seen this again for the fourth or fifth time, and it is more incredible now than it was then (or on the many thens). One's appreciation for the genius of director Wim Wenders increases steadily with time, and he is on a rising curve. This time I appreciated even more how spectacularly wonderful the story was by actor Sam Shepard, and the adaptation by Kit Carson. His son Hunter Carson plays the boy, Hunter, in the film. (The boy's mother is Karen Black, whom I knew way back when she made her second picture, when she was too wild to tell.) Here, Wenders shows his deep sensitivity to children, as he had done earlier in his magnificent 'Alice in the Cities', where the child was a little girl. Wenders and Carol Reed have a lot in common that way. The performances in this film, as everyone knows, are staggering in their intensity. Wenders resurrected Harry Dean Stanton from the status of an obscure character actor to become one of the most powerful screen actors of his time (they say he's murder in person but we don't see that bit, and that's his business, and those he may hurt). No one in the world could have pulled off the central role of Travis but Stanton. His casting was the ultimate act of genius. Wenders's casting instincts are probably the most perfect of any director's in the world. He showed his casting genius again in choosing French actress Aurore Clement for Walt's wife. At one stroke, he eliminated the 'American mom' problem by using instead a softly spoken, delicately mannered French woman who is incapable of spoiling a child, being a 'mall consumer', or even thinking of entering a (pardon me while I am sick) Macdonalds. So the kid is safe, and so is the film, and there is no saccharine false sentimentality, and all that goes with those terrible American moms in all the Hollywood movies dripping in sugar syrup, or is it maple syrup? Wenders made the reputation of Ry Cooder in this film, by using his perpetually haunting music for the sound track, and of course they teamed up again years later for the wonderful 'Buena Vista Social Club'. Wenders has as impeccable taste in music as he has in everything else. (He also launched Madredeus of Portugal, not just the Cubans.) This film opens with Harry Dean Stanton walking with fierce determination in a straight line across the Mojave Desert, heading for nothing and nowhere, in a despondent act of self-immolation. But he faints from dehydration, and his brother is summoned by a local because he has his brother's business card in his pocket, although they haven't been in touch for four years. Harry doesn't really remember who he is at first, and we never do learn what he was doing for four years, nor do we need to know. The main thing is he has turned up again, against his will, and things begin to happen. The film is pervaded by the most profound air of total mystery, a mystery not just of events but of the ineffable and impenetrable ultimate mysteries life, that thing we don't understand, and love (what is it?) Every scene is haunting, every moment is pregnant with the possibilities of exploding emotion and an eruption of so much meaning that it will burst the camera (and the DVD will also warp). There isn't any way all of this can be expressed but by itself. In that sense, 'Paris, Texas' is like a person irreducible. We have the added attraction of the beautiful Nastassya Kinski to gaze at, and we can never get enough of that, can we? (Especially when she is being elusive and running through our fingers like water.) And Dean Stockwell is there, fretting about it all, wanting clarity and never obtaining it. There is so much tragedy, so much pain, so much that is irrevocable about the past, so much that is broken and cannot be fixed. But this movie is not a downer. Wenders shows us the way. His 'wings of desire' are at work, angels are redeeming the lost souls, the little boy who is so softly charming and entrancing, will not remain a lost boy. Stanton can still redeem himself. Kinski can save herself. The brother and his wife can sit in their empty house and cry dry tears.

This is personally one of the few highly anticipated films that I saw on its theatrical release that not only met but ultimately surpassed all of my expectations, successfully re-channeling my childhood romance with this iconic character & taking his epic tale to even greater heights. Spider-Man tells the tale of Peter Parker, a mild mannered teenager who constantly seeks acceptance from his peers & ultimately dreams of one day gaining the courage to confess his love to Mary Jane Watson, who is the girl of his dreams. But his life takes a remarkable turn when he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider while on a high school field trip. He miraculously gains superhuman powers that reflect that of a spider's abilities. He finds that he is able to, strangely, shoot webbing from his wrists, detect in coming danger, climb walls, & has superhuman strength and flexibility. After accepting his powers, Peter then seeks to use them for personal gain. But when he fails to stop a criminal that later murders his beloved uncle, he learns a tragic yet valuable lesson With great power comes great responsibility. Peter then vows to never let what happened to his Uncle Ben happen to anyone else & becomes Spider-Man! Spider-Man, unlike many comic to film adaptations, succeeds in revealing the true essence of the man behind the hero's mask.

Two major reasons stand out which make this film a one of a kind Firstly, the screenplay is undoubtedly one of the five funniest I've ever seen. It's similar to Juno (which people were divided on; I personally loved it) in terms of it's wittiness and while most people don't talk quite like this, it is a joy to hear the actors perfectly pull it off. Secondly, the actors are perfect. This is essentially a four person movie, and it is perfectly cast; Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have the best chemistry that I've ever seen on screen and Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher have some of the funniest lines as the best friends of Harry and Sally (you made a woman meow?!) Each scene is a little gem, from Harry and Sally's first conversation about sex on their way to New York to their chance encounter in an airport to Sally's famous fake orgasm in a restaurant. The movie is also peppered with hilarious tidbits from random couples about how they met and fell in love (At that moment I knew. I knew the way you know about a good melon.) I am not the kind of guy who hates all romantic comedies, branding them as chick flicks which bore me to tears. In general, they are not my favorite genre, but if done correctly, I enjoy them.

Some are better than others (such as While You Were Sleeping and Sleepless in Seattle) and some are weaker (such as License to Wed and others), but they all follow a rather familiar plot. Boy meets girl and after a series of improbable and funny situations, they ultimately fall in love. So how does When Harry Met Sally feel so original and fresh every time I watch it despite following this same basic premise? Two major reasons stand out which make this film a one of a kind Firstly, the screenplay is undoubtedly one of the five funniest I've ever seen. It's similar to Juno (which people were divided on; I personally loved it) in terms of it's wittiness and while most people don't talk quite like this, it is a joy to hear the actors perfectly pull it off.

Well, after watching this one, I can't say I'm as impressed as I was with the silent version, but that's probably not entirely because of the quality of the film. It's probably more because of my tastes.Erique Claudin has been working as a violinist at the Paris Opera House for the past twenty years, but due to recent pain in the fingers of his left hand, he hasn't been able to play as well lately as he used to. Because of this, he loses his job, and doesn't have a lot of money. He has been paying for the music lessons of an upcoming operatic soprano named Christine Dubois, and now it appears he no longer can unless he finds another way to make money. So, he attempts to have a concerto he has written published, but when he is convinced it has been stolen, he becomes hostile and strangles the music publisher to death! The publisher's assistant then throws acid in Claudin's face, and with the police after the former Opera House violinist, he goes down into the sewers! Now disfigured from the acid, he wears a mask and terrorizes the Opera House, doing violent things to try and make sure Christine is successful in her career! I could imagine many people watching this movie expecting a lot of horror, but being disappointed.

However, when he tries the technique on himself an unnoticed fly travels with him and the two bodies get horribly mixed up. Can he regain his humanity ?This is a good example of what makes many of the fifties creature-features so enjoyable and intriguing; on one level the story is completely nutty - a wife is beset with anguish when her husband turns into a six-foot fly - and yet it's played with such earnest sweet simplicity that it becomes touching, sad, dramatic, even philosophical. If you surrender to it, the suspension of disbelief in movies is a truly wonderful thing. If you don't, the movie can still be goofy fun. If you can't enjoy it on either level then see if you can purchase a personality somewhere. That said, the film is hardly perfect - it's a little stodgy in some places and the flashback main action takes a while to get going. Also, there's something about Owens I don't really buy - I think she's just a bit too perfect housewife and classic beauty for me. Compare her with the fabulous Geena Davis in the remake, for example. It's great to see old Vincent for once playing the good guy, and his dignified and tender performance really sells the crazy drama. Karl Struss' photography throughout is terrific and the classic reveal of the fly in all his gruesome glory is still one of the best popcorn-goes-flying moments in horror movies. Trivia - Hedison is credited as Al (his real name) here but shortly thereafter changed it to David, possibly to avoid association with this film; the irony is that this is easily his most famous and widely-screened role. Based on a short story by George Langelaan, and scripted by debut screenwriter James Clavell (The Great Escape, Shogun, etc). Followed by a predictable sequel, Return Of The Fly, in 1959, and remade brilliantly as a more mature and existential piece by David Cronenberg in 1986. Sadly, hard-working and talented B-movie director Neumann (Tarzan And The Leopard Woman, Rocketship X-M, many others) committed suicide shortly after helming this very successful minor classic.

There are also some dramatic moments Mrs. Ketchum's resolution to go and save Ash, Ash accepting his fate to save the world as the Chosen One, the mother-and-son-reunion scene at the end of the movie and of course, the romantic elements like the moment where Misty tells Melody that no matter where he goes, Ash always has her and after that goes to save Ash from the raging sea and help him prevent Armageddon. The romantic side of the story is really emphasized in the scene where Misty is trying to wake Ash up - this shows that she really cares about him. I think that Ash and Misty really love each other, though they are always denying it. In this movie Ash once again proves himself to the world, by showing us what he truly is - a hero. He is brave, selfless, always ready to help others in need and cares very much for his friends, who are always by his side, giving him strength. This particular movie really brings out the heroic side of Ash and that's what makes it so great. I was a bit disappointed that the writers didn't put a scene where Ash and Misty kiss at the end, but overall it was a fun movie, action-packed, adventurous and very humane. I rate it 10 out of 10.

With Gremlins, it didn't take long at all -- Joe Dante not only mocks his first film but completely parodies it and turns it inside out. We are treated to an endless barrage of non sequitors, in-jokes, and homages to more than a few dozen movies.

That Dante is able to switch gears so smoothly is incredible. With the main characters remaining constant, it should bring appeal from one to the other. How often does a sequel keep the core cast and the director? And dudes, this was during Phoebe Cates' adorably cute phase.
