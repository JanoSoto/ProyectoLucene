[{"date":"4 February 2008","score":"14 out of 29 people found the following review useful","review":" Although it's all been said and done here in the 'hated it' section of this laughable and amateur attempt at film-making, I couldn't help myself to write this short review. This basically because the movie stands at a solid though misguiding 7 and somehow seems to have received a couple of unfathomable, positive reviews.There are enough movies out there that are too preposterous to be anything great. But usually there are at least one or two redeeming feats that save those movies from being complete disasters. As you no doubt have guessed, Arlington Road does not have them.The main problems with this hokey and overwrought mishap are the beyond ridiculous storyline which scoffs the whole idea of suspension of disbelief, the cringeworthy and repetitive script and the dreadful, over the top acting by Bridges. But even other 'minor' flaws in the editing, lighting and shaky camera-work are not in any case less responsible for this movie turning out to be the most campy thriller with a decent cast I've seen in quite some time. Although, 'The Contract' does come to mind...But, as many have pointed out, the ending was by a nose the most insulting part of the whole ordeal. An ending not oh-well-It's-just-a-movie kind of stupid, not what-do-ya-mean-the-earth-isn't flat kinda buffoonic, but abysmally worse, you'd have to see it to believe it. But I really wish you didn't.I'm not going to denote all the flabbergastingly ridiculous plotpoints the writers somehow seemed to think are passable to a non-imbecilic audience. It would take days to do so and would require me to see it again and take notes scene by scene.Let me just say that if you thought that Basic Instinct II was better than Basic Instinct I or that you think that Madonna should be up for an Oscar, then this movie is for you. If you have any doubts considering said examples, then this movie is most definitely one to miss and you are hereby cleared to burn any copies you encounter at your local videostore or at a friends house.0\/10!

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"4 February 2008","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" To Paramount Studios went the honor of getting the first Oscar for Best Picture about two fliers in World War I and their rivalry over Clara Bow. If you have to have a rivalry, she's a good person to get in heat over as many did in real life.The two guys in heat over her are Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen who are from different sides of the tracks in their home town. Rogers is the poor kid who has a love of flying and of speed. He likes Bow, but she can only see Arlen, a rich kid who likes Jobyna Ralston who's from his own set. When World War I breaks out both men rush to the colors.Their different backgrounds don't help at first, but they gradually develop a respect and camaraderie for each other during their training. Rooming with them is Gary Cooper who was killed in a training accident. Cooper's small role gave a big boost to his career. It's modeled on the air training accident deaths of Vernon Castle and former Mayor of New York John Purroy Mitchel. Although Cooper was associated with many Oscar nominated films including two Oscars of his own for Best Actor, Wings is the only film he was in that won for Best Picture.Although Bow plays a small town good girl, the kind usually played by Mary Pickford or Janet Gaynor, she brings a lot of sexuality to her part. No doubt as to what these two guys are fighting for.Although El Brendel's twisted Swedish speech pattern is not in use for this silent film, he's still a pretty funny fellow as the recruit of German ancestry at a time when those folks were held in suspicion.The training sergeant in the film is former heavyweight contender Gunboat Smith who fought Jack Dempsey twice on Dempsey's way to the heavyweight title, once going the distance with him.Wings was director William Wellman's first great film and first film he did about aviation, a subject near and dear to the former flier with the Lafayette Escadrille. As far as cinematography goes, Wings holds its own with the more acclaimed Hell's Angels from Howard Hughes in that department.Oscar made an auspicious debut with Wings.

This movie try to deal with a nature of war as it self and does it to my mind pretty good.Well, these guys in a tank were not Russians in any manner. Maybe it is possible that some smarts is questioning his comrades towards enemies, but it's hard to consider it in USSR troops. Comradeship is a holy thing for them, holier then bible, so there is no way they could abandon one of them even when it would be an order (even if commander would gone insane to order such an action, crew would probably beat the sheet out of him rather then obey). My uncle served in action in Afganistan for soviets as commando. Although he isn't Russian and had little respect (as most Latvians) to soviets, he's never disrespected his army fellows or combating officers.Starting action was pretty made up as well, as for village blowing purposes soviets would use choppers not tanks. Tanks was used in protecting roads and securing routes. Operatons was mainly carried out by solders and armored vehicles - BTR's. Tanks could be used as support, but there is no way massive tank attack would be enforced without commandos on foot or vehicles guarding them as it was shown (well, armament has always been a virtue for soviet commanders not soldiers).But as I already said, in general this movie is totally worth to see.
