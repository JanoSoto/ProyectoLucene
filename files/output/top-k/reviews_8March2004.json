[{"date":"8 March 2004","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is an animated film that is original, funny and has an upbeat soundtrack.  The main characters are an Ogre named Shrek and a talking donkey.  Shrek (Mike Meyers) and his uninvited sidekick, donkey (Eddie Murphy) set out to rescue a princess. The princess has been locked in a castle which is guarded by a fire eating dragon.  Shrek was sent on this mission by Lord Farquaad, a very short and evil man.  Lord Farquaad is determined to become king and chose this beautiful princess to marry to achieve his goal.  Shrek agrees to rescue the princess to get his land back from the evil Lord Farquaad.  Donkey tags along because he has nowhere else to go.   Donkey has an unlikely love interest, which will play a major role at the end of the movie. Shrek holds our attention even if the plot sounds old.  Once the princess is rescued, the movie plot changes from a standard fairy tale to a whole new idea.  On the way back to Lord Farquaad's castle, donkey discovers an unsettling secret about the princess and promises not to tell.  Of course, the princess falls in love with Shrek, but that is not the secret. The princess's secret is the moral of the story and makes a good ending.Shrek is an enjoyable movie.  It has adult humor, but don't worry, young kids will not understand it.  The one liners are very funny.  The music is great.  The characters are unique and fun to watch.    Don't leave the movie before the credits roll, the fairy tale characters do an excellent version of an old Monkee's song.
