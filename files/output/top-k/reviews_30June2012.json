First off, This is a very romantic and cute movie to watch. All the romance is genuine and terrific. The chemistry is really there with the two different couples(Ledger and Stiles, Oleynik and Gordon-Levitt) and you like the characters, you dislike the bad guys and it has one of the most romantic scenes in history where Ledger's character sings to Stiles' character on the Football field.This is a classic and it's where I first noticed Heath Ledger. This is a movie where the character that Ledger plays should not be liked this much, and Ledger brought this character to such a deep level that only a great actor like Ledger could do. Only time will tell if Heath Ledger will become a Movie Icon, but I think it's fair to say with performances like this one and many others that he had, he most certainly will. I think what makes a great movie icon is the fact that the actor\/actress has to be a great actor(with a few exceptions) and they also have to have a lot of likability about them, which co-exists with good acting as well as co-exists with a certain humility about that actor\/actress. A few examples are James Dean and John Wayne.People forget John Wayne was a fantastic actor and he was such a cool guy and the same goes for James Dean as well. You could identify with Wayne and Dean through their extreme likability and great acting. Patrick Swayze wasn't the greatest actor but he had extreme likability, and I think over time he'll be a movie icon too. And to kind of give an example more about the likability factor, in Heath Ledger's last film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, 4 actors played the same character(because Heath Ledger had passed away and 3 other actors did the part to finish up the film). All 4 actors were good in their own way. The 4 actors were Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell. Now Johnny Depp will be a Movie Icon, no doubt about that, he already kind of is. But my point is, Heath Ledger was the only actor as the character in the movie, who would really let you in, really let you in to a part of his soul. The other 3 actors were great, but they had some distance to them, you could appreciate their acting, but you couldn't get into them as a person\/a human being. Ledger had always been very charismatic with all his roles, and he didn't have distance, he always let the audience in close to him, into his soul almost, into his humanity and you never quite get that from Johnny Depp, Jude Law, or Colin Farell, all great actors, but they're always a little distant in all their roles, with the exception of Farell who will let you in with certain roles he's played. I think Heath Ledger will be a great Movie Icon over time and he is also the big reason why 10 Things I Hate About You was such a great and special kind of movie. Heath Ledger let you into his humanity in this movie, and because of that, 10 Things I Hate About You wasn't just your usual teeny bop, cheesy romance movie. It had some substance, it had some real driven emotions, sincere humanity and love to it. You don't usually find that kind of substance within a film like this one, in this genre, but because of Heath Ledgers performance in particular and the other ones, 10 Things I Hate About You is a very romantic, very special and great movie to watch by yourself or with the girl or guy you love.

Let alone seeing the film as the best American political allegory ever made. What is more, Kazan has not only managed to reflect the occurrences of the Black List era but also in the prism of his personal perception and thus, successfully evaded the trap of historical banality. He has, in a way, broken down the reality to pieces and re-assembled it in front of our eyes in a magnificent form which will catch the viewer's eye. No matter how many times you have seen it.At its heart, the film is really an inner drama. A story about a character who is unable to express his emotions and, therefore, the actor must, by embracing the emotional memories of the character, find other means beside dialog to express his inner struggle. Not surprisingly, it is due to this why On the Waterfront was Marlon Brando's bravura and has now grown to be the symbol of his method. Moreover, Foster Hirsch, an American expert in film acting, has pointed out how On the Waterfront includes the best acting ever recorded on film. One can be sure that his statement doesn't merely include Brando and Eve Marie-Saint but also the real workers of the streets who were hired as extras.When it comes to political films, On the Waterfront is undeniably among the finest. Although the events portrayed in the film aren't identical of those which Kazan faced during the Black List, they are strikingly similar. Or, on a symbolic level, yes identical. For this is really a story about a man who, relying on his own personal intuition, thinks that he is doing the right thing but still gets abandoned by the community. Here lies a direct link to Kazan's experiences during the Black List how he was coerced into ratting out his former friends of the Communist Party. The way how Brando interprets the despair, which is due to the disbelief of others in his sincerity and innocence, is absolutely stunning and heart-rending. Apart from being a poignant cross-section of the Black List era, On the Waterfront also reveals more timeless issues regarding the shadows of democracy and the cruelty of capitalism. It evidences how the liberal world works and what it in reality allows. However, what is most masterful is the fashion in which Kazan associates this with the inner struggle of the protagonist. Thus, both of the film's aspects -- the social and the spiritual -- are in a constant dialog with each other and thereby form an aesthetic synthesis. For, in addition to social themes of money, corruption and power, the film drills down to problematic childhood and its subsequent consequences while processing such themes as loneliness, absolution and forgiveness.Obviously influenced by the works of Roberto Rossellini, Boris Kaufman managed to bring neo-realist touch to On the Waterfront, which was veritably revolutionary in Hollywood. Almost with laconic portrayal -- in the simplest style of the world -- Kazan achieves to depict the wonders of life. Only reality, nothing more.

Normally, I'd be disappointed with a movie that has as many tonal inconsistencies as this does, and also has such a convoluted plot. These are valid concerns, and are enough to make a lot of movies just plain suck. But in the summer of 1984, convention was thrown out the window and an unsurpassed American classic was born. Ghostbusters is enormously entertaining and one of the funniest movies ever, containing some of film's most iconic moments of all time. With vintage special effects, great characters, and large doses of Bill Murray, Ghostbusters is a movie that everyone can, and probably will, deeply enjoy.The film opens in a mood typical of a horror movie, with an innocent, elderly librarian being terrorized by some sort of ghost. Then suddenly, some great 80s music kicks in and in the next scene, we are introduced to the least scary or serious thing ever Bill Murray. This man makes Ghostbusters his own, and completely steals the show. His dry, sarcastic humor is so perfect and unique, and he can conjure up laughs with just a look. Nothing fazes him, everything amuses him, and nothing is allowed to be taken too seriously in his presence. Without him, this movie would be vastly different, and probably quite a bit less fun. Interestingly, he has great chemistry with Sigourney Weaver, and it's a joy to watch their characters interact. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis complement each other (and contrast with Murray) magnificently, playing socially awkward geeks with hilarious results. Ernie Hudson, portraying the last-minute fourth ghost buster, also gets in a few great lines. William Atherton from Die Hard also appears late in the game, playing just as great an antagonist as in said film. Adding more to the spectacle is the inclusion of Rick Moranis, playing one of his best characters ever. Add it all together and you get a brilliant comedy that is completely outrageous, yet at times quietly subtle in its humor. It's also one of the few of its kind that actually gets better with age and repeated viewings.However, there's still the matter of the utterly inane story to consider. By the climax, any remaining semblance of plot is basically thrown out the window. But the film's rather ridiculous premise actually serves to better the film. Some of the movie's most strikingly memorable moments come from the silliest concepts, such as crossing the streams, the Slimer ghost, or the colossal Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man (all of which still look fantastic, even by today's CGI standards). And it's examples like these that tell us how much fun the filmmakers were having with the whole concept from the get-go. All the ridiculous backstory with Zuul, Gozer the Gozerian, the Gatekeeper, and the Keymaster doesn't mean much; it's all about being entertaining, and Ghostbusters does this perfectly.With such a strange foundation for a film- that is, being big- budget, special effects-laden horror-comedy- there were countless things that could have gone wrong. Against all odds, Ghostbusters gets everything absolutely right. It's blast for people of all ages, and an absolute laughter riot. It has an immensely talented cast backing the superb Bill Murray, just doing what he does best, and a plethora of noteworthy scenes and one-liners.

Interestingly, 1987's Predator has only gotten more popular with age, spawning a huge franchise of sequels, graphic novels, and crossovers. It continues to receive sequels to this day! How did this happen? Well, on the surface, the film appears to be your average, explosion-happy B-movie shoot-em-up, Arnold Schwarzenegger and all. But it's more of a science fiction horror picture, something along the lines of Ridley Scott's Alien eight years earlier. It manages to pull off both genre elements pretty well, and in great style. It isn't perfect, but John McTiernan's Predator is still a smart, solid, and highly entertaining sci-fi flick.There were many factors that led to this film becoming the classic that it is today, but chief among them is most certainly the alien (excuse me, the Predator). From its ability to turn invisible to its famous spaceman dreadlocks, the creature has gained considerable repute among fans of the genre. And it completely deserves its status. The suspense for the Predator's introduction is built up in an ingeniously effective way; we get to look at its inevitable victims through its heat-vision eyes. This lets us know that our characters are being relentlessly stalked, and that there is nowhere they can hide from the Predator's wrath. It's fantastic, scary fun. Once everyone but Arnold was killed, the Predator took on a new, less subtle role. It ceased to be a mysterious, invisible killer, and became a straight-up, 80s action villain. But it's a versatile creature, and the new position suits it just as well. Surprisingly large, heavy and muscular, it's even a physical superior (by a great degree) to Arnold himself! This, of course, leads to some great fight scenes, made all the better by the removal of the Predator's mask. Its actual face&#x85; Well, as a wise man once said, it's one ugly motherf#$%er. Now the Predator is great and all, but it's not necessarily enough to make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the cast. Arnold's character Dutch is even more clichéd and undeveloped than most B-movie action stars, filled to the brim with terrible one-liners and hackneyed badassery. The same goes for Carl Weathers as Dillon. There is actually a scene in the beginning where the two of them randomly begin arm wrestling, for the sole purpose of focusing the camera on their massive arms. You'll learn quickly that subtlety is not in their nature. Also in the film is fellow future governor Jesse Ventura, playing a very boring, stereotypical tough guy. We find out later that he and Bill Duke's character were close friends, but this relationship was never developed or even hinted at while they were both alive. It's pretty hard to care about the deaths of a bunch of cardboard cutouts. Awful character development aside, the movie is still a great time. Fleshed out people aren't necessarily required when you know from the start that almost everyone is going to die. But before they do get murdered, they give some great catchphrases that many people today still remember with fondness. Chief among them are gems like I ain't got time to bleed, or Get to da choppa!

This movie is both an unconventional love story and a crime drama but it's also a story about past disappointments and dreams of a better future.Sally Matthews (Susan Sarandon) is an ambitious young woman who left her drab life in Canada to look for something better in Atlantic City. She works at a local oyster bar but is also learning French and training to be a blackjack dealer as she dreams of someday working in a casino in Monte Carlo. At the end of her working day, she returns to the run down apartment block where she lives and routinely cuts lemons and rubs the juice into her upper body to eliminate the smell of fish.Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster) is an elderly numbers runner who lives in a neighbouring apartment and regularly watches Sally's nightly ritual. In the past, he used to work for some notorious gangsters who he greatly admired but these days he takes care of the bedridden Grace Pinza (Kate Reid) who's his old boss' widow. She lives in the same building and habitually insults and humiliates him because she knows he depends on the money she pays him.Sally's past life is brought back into sharp focus when her ex-husband Dave (Robert Joy) unexpectedly turns up with her pregnant sister Chrissie (Hollis McLaren) who's the current woman in his life. Sally is angry that they've followed her to her new home but even more serious problems follow as Dave has stolen a substantial quantity of cocaine from some mobsters in Philadelphia and they're on his tail. Dave gets to know Lou and uses him to help to sell the dope.When the Philadephia mob catch up with Dave and kill him, Lou is left with the cocaine and a significant amount of money. This transforms his life as he suddenly has the means to buy a new suit and hat and be generous to Sally as they begin a relationship. Suddenly this impoverished, lonely old man who's nostalgic for the good old days and tells people exaggerated stories about his exploits and importance in the criminal world, finds himself financially well off. Even better, however, when Sally's threatened by the gangsters who think that she must have their stolen cocaine, he steps in and protects her and this makes him feel incredibly proud and exhilarated.Neither Sally nor Lou genuinely expect their offbeat relationship to be forever but it does, nevertheless, have a very positive effect on both their lives.Atlantic City is well written and skilfully balances the poignancy of its story with some moments of humour and a very unexpected ending. Its greatest quality, however, is its ability to convey so powerfully, the plight of its two main characters who are both regretful about the disappointments of their pasts and preoccupied by dreams of a better future. Their circumstances are portrayed with great sensitivity and warmth and placing them in an environment that is also undergoing a period of transformation is extremely effective.Burt Lancaster is equally as convincing in portraying Lou's pathetic nostalgia for his fictionalised past as he is at conveying his immense pride and excitement when he successfully protects Sally. His performance and that of Susan Saradon are top class and contribute massively to the success of this wonderful movie.

Then, its early scenes are marred by talking that is way too fast, but it soon settles down in terms of its dialog. There's a hilarious chase scene that literally made me laugh out loud. Then, McCrae is trapped by and over-the-hill woman, and that segment is very funny, as well.In my view, the film goes downhill when Veronica Lake comes into the picture...sort of reminding me of one of the themes of the film -- there always has to be a beautiful woman. It's almost an hour into the film when McCrae's character catches up to the poverty he is seeking to learn about (unfortunately with Lake in tow).

Here, at least, he has a slightly more central role. It may be a hasty knock-off but the sequel is a more traditional horror movie and fun to boot.Of course the Fly here - played by Brett Halsey as the son of the original transmigration inventor Andre Delambre - looks utterly silly, with a massive over-proportioned head that is unintentionally funny. What is often missed is the frequently mentioned problem of giganticism in the movie, which makes it perfectly logical I suppose. Several times characters say they've cracked the problem; the evidence here suggests not! The action has moved on about 15 years, and opens with the funeral of Helene Delambre. The movie incidentally is crisply photographed in black and white, and in no time at all we are back at Delambre Freres, scene of the original experiments. Even Michael Mark, the actor who carried his drowned daughter into the village way back in the original Frankenstein, pops up as the watchman, and Phillipe Delambre quickly expresses his determination to carry on in his father's footsteps. He, is, however, not particularly on the ball when choosing his assistants.....Along the way we get a human crossed with a Guinea Pig (yes, really!) and this time the script is clever enough to make sure the human\/fly hybrid is no accident. It is not so clever in explaining how on earth The Fly knows of the existence of the dodgy undertaker, though!So, yep, the movie may be silly once the Fly gets loose, but it remains enjoyable.

This is no life-changing deep, heavy, sob-your-guts-out movie. But it is very nearly perfectly fun! You want entertainment? This is it!Arnold Schwarzenegger is just plain charming in all his comedies. Check out Junior, Twins, Jingle All the Way (less so), and, maybe best of all, Kindergarten Cop. The man has serious comic chops! This was HIS role. And he did it perfectly. His dazed recital to his torturer of, step by step, how he was going to kill said torturer is worth the price of admission all by itself. So is his admonition to a horse which let him down (What were you thinking?). There are some brilliant comedy deliveries here, and they tell me comedy is the hardest thing of all.Jamie Lee Curtis has never been better, never sexier, than she is here. Watch her odyssey from an ignorant housewife to a competent help-meet to a master spy. She pulls it off hilariously and totally believably.My biggest surprise was Tom Arnold. Until I saw this, I thought he was Rosanne Barr's half-wit ex-husband who had used her celebrity to find his fifteen minutes of fame. But his performance here is STELLAR! Arnold and Jamie Lee are delightful, but the real sparkle in this comes largely from Tom. The biggest laughs in this movie are his. He takes good lines and delivers them to perfection.As for the plot okay, so it's totally unbelievable. It's an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie. What do you expect? A nuclear explosion killed Predator and Arnold came striding out, sweat-soaked and filthy, but alive. Verisimilitude? What's that? And who cares? He's sliding down a snow-covered slope, on his back, firing his pistol as he goes. Yeah, right!Remember Hasta la vista, Baby? Watch for You're fired.

Sometimes the formula works, like in the cases of Sleepy Hollow or Sweeney Todd. Other times, we end up with weird messes of movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland (notice, in each example, Johnny Depp is featured prominently). Fortunately, this film is an example from the former category. Featuring some excellent performances, an outstanding musical score, and typically Burton-esque visual flair, this film is one for the ages.Edward Scissorhands, as a character, is a very interesting guy. We're not quite sure if he's a flesh-and-blood human or some sort of cyborg, but we do know that he is capable of love and affection. Having been a recluse in an abandoned mansion for many years, these are acquired skills for him. He's a tragic and highly misunderstood man as well as a sort of embodiment of an emo wrist cutter's psyche. However cool a concept, I don't think Burton was trying to be subtle with the whole 'scissors for hands' idea.Nevertheless, Edward is a fantastic character. Despite his physically grotesque nature, we as an audience grow to love and pity him, and become emotionally invested in his story. Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career here. Also worthy of note are Winona Ryder and Dianne Wiest, who are sympathetic and relatable in their roles. Anthony Michael Hall plays a great antagonist that everyone loves to hate, and Vincent Price has a great cameo as the inventor (his very last performance, sadly). Depp and Ryder have great on screen chemistry, and share some truly touching moments.Backing these moments and others is an amazing soundtrack from Danny Elfman, another common Burton collaborator. These men make real movie magic together here, and add a whole new dimension of dark emotion. Through the perfectly orchestrated music we feel joy, sorrow, or rage along with these characters. It gives the film more artistic quality, and continues to resonate long after you've finished watching. I must admit, every time I watch the movie I sit through the entire end credits scene, just to enjoy more of the music.And while the film is certainly a treat for the ears, it is also very nice to look at. Costume design, makeup, set pieces, cinematography&#x85; These are elements of film that Burton and Co. have down to an exact science. The dark and distinctly Gothic look of Edward himself, the mountaintop mansion, and most of the nighttime scenes contrast beautifully with the happy and colorful suburban neighborhood setting. There is typically a lot of the color black, and a fair amount of steampunk machinery, juxtaposed with garish women's clothing and jolly Christmas season decor. It's what fans of these films expect from Burton, and he delivers it in perhaps his most stylish fashion yet. Even now it feels very original, especially when compared to his more recent, contrived outings. Dark Shadows, we're looking at you.As a work of art, as simple entertainment, or as a visual representation of Tim Burton's insanity, Edward Scissorhands succeeds. It is an excellent modern fairytale and a must-see, and I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

Even the first half of the film, which some believe is too slow, sets a great precedence for the rest of the film. In my opinion, it reveals the trust Dantes has in his friends and colleagues, even if it is a bit naive.

That would have been some household to hang around in if Laughton and Lanchester didn't take their characters too far. Personally I can't picture either one being married to the other, but who am I to say?For a two hour long picture, this one simply flew by. It was clever and entertaining, made particularly humorous by Laughton's posturing and the complicity of his butler's (Ian Wolfe) involvement in all of Sir Wilfrid's destructive personal habits. For some reason I thought Sir Wilfrid's rearranging of his pills in court would end up meaning something, but turns out it was just a clever distraction.The one character that DID rouse my suspicion was that lady Diana (Ruta Lee) in the courtroom attending her 'first trial'. I just knew she was going to figure in the resolution somehow and it became fairly transparent during the interrogation about the cruise business. Old housekeeper Janet (Una O'Connor) had it right when she called Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) a 'shiftless, schemin' rascal', so by the end of the story one has good reason to feel antagonistic toward him.I got a kick out of the closing credits when the narrator asks the viewer not to divulge the ending to prospective film goers. I'm sure the players had a great time filming this courtroom thriller, and if I had to bet, I'd say Laughton really did smoke that cigar injected with brandy.

Terrific Bette Midler and surprising James Caan made up on a screen beautiful and harmonious duo, their characters Dixie Leonard and Eddie Sparks were raising spirit for soldiers at war and they have very patriotic work. That's very right and patriotic film showing respect to army and boys who were at war. Remarkable director Mark Rydell, who I love for his masterpieces The Rose and On Golden Pond made this very vital and sincere movie that also entertainingly and funny to watch. Bette Midler is pure brilliance!!! When she sang for soldiers I was in tears. She is really genius and incredible actress.

After just finishing Mansfield Park I watched this movie and it was a horrible disappointment, especially since all the details of the story were still fresh in my mind. I honestly don't know where to start, but it is apparent that the makers of this film are unfamiliar with 1800 British decorum. The level of affection that is shown throughout the movie is completely inconsistent with how people composed themselves in that time period and would be looked at as completely scandalous for the slightest thing as kissing in public which made this adaptation completely inaccurate. The main character Fanny's temperament was completely inconsistent with her character in the book. I was completely shocked that in the movie she was so open about her affections for Edmound which was completely not the case in the book, she was very demure about it until then end of the book. Main characters were omitted such as William Price. The story line was not followed in true form at all, and it wasn't a simple swaying from the original it was a completely different story. They sexualized Fanny's relationship with Mary and her father which was shocking and disgusting. Words can't express how disappointed I was in this film, as others have said before Ms. Jane Austen would be shocked and appalled by this adaptation.

You were the genius behind Radioland Murders, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones for goodness sake! Why did you have to create a bad movie like this?! This movie reminds me of a bad episode of Goosebumps where everybody's a duck! How many men do you think play Howard the Duck? Eight. That's right, eight men played the role of Howard the Duck(One did the voice and seven wore the costume on screen). The jokes are very stupid. They all involve duck puns! What does this movie think it is, The Super Mario Bros Super Show(The difference is that this involves pasta jokes)?! Wait a minute! Did I see a female duck with no clothes on?!! I'm not lying, I'm seeing duck boobs!! It's disgusting, it's revolting, and it's not suitable for kids! It's like Daisy Duck getting tired of her cartoon career at Disney and decides to go to an Adult Film Industry! And then, there's this nerdy numb-nuts played by Tim Robbins. Now I know what you're thinking What's so bad about this guy? Well, first, when supposedly attempting to translate Howard's speech, he sounds like Donald Duck trying to speak Japanese but fails to do so! Later in the movie, he speaks to Howard again and goes Wakka-Wakka-Wakka-Wakka. WHAAAAAAAT?! I can't even understand what he's saying! He sounds like Fozzie Bear with a severe sinus infection! And get this, he dates one of the singers. Oh sure, like a girl would have the hots for a loser who impersonates Donald Duck failing to speak Japanese and go Wakka-Wakka-Wakka-Wakka like one of the Muppets. Whoever got this movie made is a real quack(No pun intended). You must be completely stupid or high if you like this movie. Bottom Line Abysmal acting, idiotic humor, or no likable characters are the reasons why you should avoid Howard the Duck.
