This leads him on an odd odyssey that shakes up his world even further.When I saw this in the theaters on the night it opened I was so bored by it I left after the much over rated sex scenes at the masked ball. I made one later attempt at seeing it when it came out on home video and got all the way through it. Other visits with the film have come on cable where I criss crossed through the films recesses in odd clips. Recently I had a long discussion with a friend who loves the film and figured I'd try it again. To be certain his remarks, probably the most intelligent I've ever heard concerning the film, made me hopeful that I had missed something. I don't think so.The film concerns obsession and what a perceived infidelity will and can do to a man or woman. Cruise's dark journey all hinges on the fact that he can't get what his wife tells him out of his mind. Seeing it again for the first time in almost ten years I see little things that I probably missed the first time out. There is real power in the early scenes of Cruise and Kidman together and even apart as Kidman's unhappiness leads to flirtations and lustful thoughts that upset Cruise's sense of the world. I don't think that the whole masked cabal thing works, even on an allegorical level since the giant set piece of people having sex and performing rites seems to have been pulled in from a Hammer horror film. Whats even more deadly to the film is its over length and snail like pace. this is a two and a half hour film that feels twice that.Personally I wish Kubrick had lived a little longer since I'd have love to hear what his take on all of this was. At times the film seems like it wants to be a black comedy, at other times a porn film.

The type that can only happen in Hollywood. Two computer animated films were released simultaneously about the world of ants. First off was DreamWorks Antz, an extremely entertaining journey into the social hierarchy of an ant colony. And A Bug's Life from those geniuses at Pixar.Any Pixar film is worth a watch because they're a delight in just about every respect. Flawless animation. Involving plots. Well defined characters. But most importantly, that shrewd level of intelligence that constantly keeps Pixar head and shoulders above other animated fare.But A Bug's Life is that rare thing. A Pixar disappointment. Its not a bad film. Pixar have never made an outright terrible film. Even the indifferent response to Cars seemed unwarranted to me.But A Bug's Life is a Pixar film that left me cold. Perhaps if I hadn't seen Antz first I might have liked it more, but somehow I doubt it. Because Antz is the type of film A Bug's Life wants to be but isn't. Its the one time where DreamWorks got one over on Pixar, instead of nipping at their coattails.Antz was a film conducted with a mind-boggling sense of detail. It convinced you there was a whole micro-sized world there beneath our feet. The failing of A Bug's Life is its story is so thin. It doesn't have the ambitious scope of most Pixar films, and its characters are some of the studio's most forgettable.ABL, it has to be said, falls into some very predictable storytelling. You can almost see the clichés being wheeled into place. The underdog hero. The comic sidekicks. The dastardly villain. There are none of the usual songs that Disney love so much, but ABL might have benefited from some.The comparisons to Antz are sadly unavoidable. Since it gets right what ABL gets so wrong, they make interesting bedfellows. Although I'm not much of a fan of Woody Allen, he was perfectly cast as the hero of Antz. A put upon ant suffering from peer pressure and his own neurosis. The hero of ABL feels like a lesser developed version of the same character.Flik, along with all the ants in his colony gather food for a gang of bullying grasshoppers every season. When Flik's bumbling puts a spanner in the works, Hopper (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the leader of the grasshoppers, demands an increase in their yearly supply.Flik refuses to stand by and watch his people work they're way into starvation, so he goes off to find help, and brings back a bumbling circus troupe of insects. But it doesn't take long for Flik to learn the truth about his would be saviours. Or for them to learn the real reason they've been brought to the colony. Even the most committed Pixar fan will probably be disappointed with A Bug's Life. A lot of people say Cars was the first fall from grace for the mighty Pixar. This isn't true. ABL was the first dip in quality for this great studio. Fortunately a rarity for Pixar.ABL is a film that cruises in neutral for far too long. Visually its a treat. Just like any Pixar film. But I preferred Antz' gritty, down and dirty aesthetic. They looked like real ants. The ones here are much too colourful and cuddly. They're much too user-friendly.The best type of Pixar film is one that opens itself up to a world of possibilities. Finding Nemo presented us with a breathtaking ocean world. The superb Toy Story 2 (also underrated in my opinion) brought Woody and Buzz Lightyear out of the confines of a kids bedroom and into the big wide world where they had one hell of a rollicking adventure!Because ABL stays in one place for so long the film suffers as a result. Perhaps if it had some engaging characters to focus on, it might have compensated. But nobody here registered with me that much. In fact as I write this, I can't even remember half of they're names. Flik is pretty disposable as a hero. So is the Ant Queen and Princess. And the circus troupe, though voiced by true talent like David Hyde Pierce and Denis Leary, is never allowed to cut loose.The only actor who gets into the show with any lasting impression is Kevin Spacey. He makes Hopper wonderfully loathsome. The type of villain you really love to hate. And his comeuppance is very satisfying (if a bit grisly by Disney's standards).What's missing from A Bug's Life is the smoothness Pixar films usually flow with. There's not a solid enough hook to hang the story from, like there was with Buzz Lightyear finding out he was only a toy. Or little Nemo getting lost in the vast depths of the ocean.

When Flik's bumbling puts a spanner in the works, Hopper (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the leader of the grasshoppers, demands an increase in their yearly supply.Flik refuses to stand by and watch his people work they're way into starvation, so he goes off to find help, and brings back a bumbling circus troupe of insects. But it doesn't take long for Flik to learn the truth about his would be saviours. Or for them to learn the real reason they've been brought to the colony. Even the most committed Pixar fan will probably be disappointed with A Bug's Life. A lot of people say Cars was the first fall from grace for the mighty Pixar. This isn't true. ABL was the first dip in quality for this great studio. Fortunately a rarity for Pixar.ABL is a film that cruises in neutral for far too long. Visually its a treat. Just like any Pixar film. But I preferred Antz' gritty, down and dirty aesthetic. They looked like real ants. The ones here are much too colourful and cuddly. They're much too user-friendly.The best type of Pixar film is one that opens itself up to a world of possibilities. Finding Nemo presented us with a breathtaking ocean world. The superb Toy Story 2 (also underrated in my opinion) brought Woody and Buzz Lightyear out of the confines of a kids bedroom and into the big wide world where they had one hell of a rollicking adventure!Because ABL stays in one place for so long the film suffers as a result. Perhaps if it had some engaging characters to focus on, it might have compensated. But nobody here registered with me that much. In fact as I write this, I can't even remember half of they're names. Flik is pretty disposable as a hero. So is the Ant Queen and Princess. And the circus troupe, though voiced by true talent like David Hyde Pierce and Denis Leary, is never allowed to cut loose.The only actor who gets into the show with any lasting impression is Kevin Spacey. He makes Hopper wonderfully loathsome. The type of villain you really love to hate. And his comeuppance is very satisfying (if a bit grisly by Disney's standards).What's missing from A Bug's Life is the smoothness Pixar films usually flow with. There's not a solid enough hook to hang the story from, like there was with Buzz Lightyear finding out he was only a toy. Or little Nemo getting lost in the vast depths of the ocean. A few nice ideas here and there (like a scarily realistic moving bird and some genuinely funny outtakes over the end credits) but A Bug's Life is by far Pixar's most disappointing film.

Everything about this film is perfect. Johnny Depp plays arguably his most bizarre and surreal character, which is a lot for him, and he portrays it perfectly. For his most bizarre character, Depp is at his most reserved. The story is ultimately one of a man who wants nothing more than to be accepted and belong in this happy, seemingly Utopian suburbia.Of course the tragedy of the story is that, nearing the completion of his invention, Edward's inventor\/father died tragically before he could finish his hands. So we see society's typical reaction to something new and bizarre. At first everyone is overwhelmingly interested by this new man and want to know as much about him as possible. We see his many unique talents (gardening, for instance) and for the first time in his life Edward feels like he belongs somewhere.At the end of the first act, we are overjoyed by his acceptance and happiness in this world. And then the introduction of Kim leads to a slow, inevitable downfall of this tragic character. The scum of the Earth is portrayed through Kim's boyfriend Jim and the combination of his jealousy of Edward with Edward's infatuation\/devotion to Kim creates some of the most painful scenes of all time. Jim takes advantage of Edward's lock-picking abilities and in an unhappy accident he gets thrown in jail, but his devotion to Kim means that he won't tell the truth; that it wasn't his fault. So now society turns. Some make up false stories of how he tried to rape them, even though it was her who forced herself upon Edward's innocence; but everyone turns their interest and adoration of Edward into spiteful fear and detestment. Everyone except for Kim, the golden light in this pathetically revolting neighborhood. We fall in love with her, just as Edward does, as she leaves her boyfriend and tries to do all she can to make Edward feel accepted.But society won't have this. They turn every small mishap into the apocalypse and want to bring down the man they all admired so dearly a few days prior. This isn't even the most tragic element of this story. The most painful scene of all time is unleashed as Edward and Kim are standing alone in a room. 'Hold me' Kim asks the man with scissors for hands; she wants comfort from the fear and chaos of the world outside but the only person who can give her this comfort is unable to because he could hurt her simply by touching her. It brings more tears down my face than I can ever remember happening. Such a painful scene in a heartbreaking film.The finale is just as heartbreaking. Kim is a very old woman, almost on her death bed, and after years of not visiting Edward in his castle on top of the hill she realizes that it is too late to do so. Her heart crumbles before us as she makes the painful decision to let Edward remember her as the adorable and beautiful young woman she was; not the old lady she has become. Probably the most painful film I've ever seen, yet it still gives me a sense of pure joy every time I watch it. Maybe it has something to do with Danny Elfman's flawlessly gorgeous score, that I've now decided is my favorite of all time. Maybe it has something to do with Johnny Depp's uniquely outrageous performance. Whatever it is, Edward Scissorhands is a film that I will always hold close to my heart, no matter how much it breaks it.

View this movie without lying to yourself about its supposed brilliant director.I've read that the opening scene is supposed to be one of the greatest in the history of movies. It may have been tough to achieve from a technical standpoint, but as a viewer I was not impressed. It may excite some easy-to-please Hitchcock fans, but there was nothing thrilling about TOE to me. The scene someone plants a bomb in a car, and then we wait for it to blow up. Big deal. That scene, as this entire movie, is just another example of the ludicrous overestimation of Orson Welles's talents. This divine director hasn't made a single great movie, yet the accolades that go along with his name just keep rolling off the tongues of various self-deluded film-critics. TOE is a typical Welles movie the camera work is ahead of its time, but the story and dialogue are banal and even idiotic at times. Style over substance, as with that piece of crap The Magnificent Ambersons, and that supposed classic Citizen Kane which might be, along with Casablanca, the most overrated movie of all time.First of all, Heston as a Mexican. You can paint him brown all you want - and then send him to 25 solariums - he does not look like one. Worse of all, he doesn't even talk like one. Heston and Leigh look like an all-American couple, from Mexico?? Heston gets attacked with acid, his wife is practically abducted by a gang member with intent to intimidate her, and then Heston and Leigh are even followed by the gang leader - and what does Heston do in the face of all this danger? He leaves his wife in a remote motel in the middle of nowhere!! WHY?? Just so Welles can have his dumb plot twists? An honest, upright Mexican cop\/lawyer\/whatever and a totally corrupt, semi-insane American one? Talk about a reality reversal. But in Welles's confused, liberal mind that is how things are in real life America the evil, and the rest of the world its victim; a viewpoint wholeheartedly supported by Hollywood's Leftists, i.e. 98% of Hollywood. (In fact, Welles's political affiliations had a LOT to do with his overblown reputation as a film-maker.) Welles's criminal cop character talks about how idealists ruin things in this world. Anyone familiar with Welles and Hollywood politics will know that he wasn't being general here at all, but was specifically referring to Communists or Socialists as the kind of idealists we should all admire and emulate. Ironically, I have to agree with the bad guy cop on this, even though I'm not supposed to...Welles's corrupt cop leaves his cane at the scene of the crime?? Isn't he supposed to be sly, cunning...? I am amazed that Welles couldn't even decide if he wanted to make a serious movie or not. TOE borders on comedy, parody even, most of the time, yet the plot is meant to be serious. Some of the characters, such as the gang boss and the corrupt cop, are straight out of a comic-book - or a cheap dime-a-dozen noir B-movie; silly caricatures so typical of 50s celluloid baloney. The dialogue may verge on the amusing at times, but because this never becomes a comedy it ends up sounding merely silly, like in those dumb John Huston\/Bogart detective films. And the highly annoying soundtrack doesn't exactly help. Henry Mancini or not, the music only lends extra goofiness to the movie.I had to also wonder why Welles gave himself a fake nose and the rest? Did he consider his oh-so noble facial features to be too divine to play a crook convincingly? I don't see what possible rational reason he could have had for this.

But this is common knowledge; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. Hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror\/thriller; Chaplin liked his comedy; Scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and Spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.But Schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. Batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. Then comes 8MM; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before Tigerland which is Schumacher's best film from what I've so far seen, in my opinion. With the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D-Day landings during Saving Private Ryan at the time when I first saw the film, I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished. My eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'I can't believe it smile' on my face. Needless to say, it was because of that film I searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. In Tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz (Farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam War.But what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. The things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the Vietnam War but egos and superegos play more of a part here, I think. The superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against Bozz whose ego is extremely large. There is also the third part of Freud's triangle that sneaks into Bozz the ID. Compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, Bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself You are all dead in this situation! barks a sergeant. Any Questions? Yeah, if I'm dead how come I can ask a question? replies Bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true ID style; that is he enjoys the punishments.Also regarding the superegos, Bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. This is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge. What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name. This is where Private Wilson's (Whigham) character steps in His uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river. Wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward Bozz and acts out.What I also liked about Tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave. While lacking in innovation, Tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look. Make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness. But, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for TV; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but Schumacher is clever he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. It's worth saying here that Spielberg said he wanted Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.While being very funny and entertaining, Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. Its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier. There are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy, if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military.

Yeah, if I'm dead how come I can ask a question? replies Bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true ID style; that is he enjoys the punishments.Also regarding the superegos, Bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. This is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge. What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name. This is where Private Wilson's (Whigham) character steps in His uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river.

But, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for TV; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but Schumacher is clever he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. It's worth saying here that Spielberg said he wanted Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.While being very funny and entertaining, Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. Its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"8 January 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In Joel Schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time. But this is common knowledge; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. Hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror\/thriller; Chaplin liked his comedy; Scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and Spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.But Schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. Batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. Then comes 8MM; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before Tigerland which is Schumacher's best film from what I've so far seen, in my opinion. With the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D-Day landings during Saving Private Ryan at the time when I first saw the film, I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished. My eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'I can't believe it smile' on my face. Needless to say, it was because of that film I searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. In Tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz (Farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam War.But what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. The things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the Vietnam War but egos and superegos play more of a part here, I think. The superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against Bozz whose ego is extremely large. There is also the third part of Freud's triangle that sneaks into Bozz the ID. Compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, Bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself You are all dead in this situation! barks a sergeant.

Benny and Joon just has this endearing quality and it was almost immediate that I recognized this quality. The trio of the main cast, Benny, Joon, and Sam, are absolutely astounding and truly hold the story together. With funny, quirky and memorable moments with a very passionate and emotional plot both from a family and romantic stand point. Best of all the chemistry is just phenomenal and the film is truly something unique and fun. It's light hearted but serious enough to make you think. Although described as comedy I think I'd have to label it a dark comedy because it definitely has this very dark undertone dealing with Joon's illness and Benny's life taking care of. Regardless of the tone, the film is fun to watch and very moving.I will steer away for a moment from the title characters and talk about Sam played brilliantly by the amazing Johnny Depp who certainly has become something of a phenomenon since this film but has always been a diverse and brilliant actor. His eccentric and touching portrayal of the strange Sam is just amazing to watch. He definitely steals the show and the rest of the cast is terrific so it really shows their acting chops to go up with Depp in this performance. His physical comedy and his performance in the park is truly astounding. Aidan Quinn is Benny, the hard working, blue collar older brother who wants nothing more than to care for his sister above all else and at the expense of his life and his romantic life. Quinn is always more of a quiet, more subtle actor and Benny is the type of character that is perfect for him. He does a terrific job and shows some real emotion in the role. Mary Stuart Masterson is really terrific as Joon, the carefree and determined girl who suffers from something of a social disorder. I am almost sure that her disease is never specifically mentioned and she does a great job of portraying both sides of her illness. She's intelligent and pretty and just a terrific character. Julianne Moore and Oliver Platt round out the cast as Quinn's love interest and best friend respectively. Small roles but important and they both do a decent job.For whatever reason I wasn't 'blown away' per se by Benny and Joon. It was cute and fun but really didn't go to any amazing depths with the characters. Most of them had a surface issue and it never went any deeper than that. It wasn't a story about a girl suffering from a potentially debilitating disease but rather the interaction between the three main characters and their wacky relationships. Depp's character was supposedly completely normal, not suffering from any disease other than being strange but it was almost an over performance because he certainly didn't appear normal whatsoever until more so towards the end. No matter how you look at it Benny and Joon is cute and fun and you won't be disappointed.

There is no doubt in my mind that this is the most suspenseful film ever made; I was on the edge of my seat every second wondering how and if they will get caught. The idea of 'killing for the sake of killing' has always fascinated me and I felt that Hitchcock perfected the idea with seemingly flawless reasoning to boot. It sounds almost sadistic, but Brandon Shaw is one of the most relatable figures I've ever seen on film. He's highly intellectual and is a very good manipulater, but his superiority complex often gets the best of him and he thinks that he can get away with much more than he is actually capable of. Hitchcock displays the flaw of such intellect in the form of Brandon constantly brushing as close as he can to getting caught, but being so overly confident in his own intelligence that he doesn't think anyone could possibly figure it out.Phillip Morgan was the perfect black to Brandon's white. Another highly intelligent boy, he was constantly second guessing himself and his weariness made it blatantly clear that a wrong had been done. This presents the fact that if you are to perform the seemingly perfect crime, it is vital that you do it alone. However this is a contradiction, because if you are intelligent enough to perform the perfect crime than the desire to share your own accomplishment will boil inside of you until you crack. So I found that the film presents the idea that there is such thing as a perfect crime, even murder, but there is no way to get away with it since one way or another you will end up making yourself available to get caught. I found this to be a fascinating idea that Hitchcock brought to the forefront of a suspenseful masterpiece. Making it all take place in one room was a phenomenal and unique idea as well and he pulled it off flawlessly. The performances were perfect all around, especially from John Dall. James Stewart was also spectacular, as always. The only thing that I felt would have made the film better was if the boys would have gotten away with their crime, but in doing so Hitchcock would have given up the entire message of the story. If you perform, and get away with a perfect crime, the need to brag about your glorious efforts will result in your own demise. No less than a masterwork and one of the greatest films I've ever seen.

They see these mechas as a sign of evolution and something different than what they've become accustomed to living with, and in turn feel the need to eradicate them in the most gruesome and disgusting way.

Somehow when they bring back his mother, her love turns him into a real boy, he cries, falls asleep and dies. You've got to be kidding me. The super technologically advanced aliens can bring back people who died, yet they can't turn him from a robot to a real boy? Alright, I got over that.

They see these mechas as a sign of evolution and something different than what they've become accustomed to living with, and in turn feel the need to eradicate them in the most gruesome and disgusting way. The performances from the entire cast are great. Jude Law delivers the second best of his career with a wonderfully charismatic portrayal of a mechanical gigolo. Frances O' Connor was surprisingly brilliant as the highly confused mother who becomes further and further lost with what to do with her life. Haley Joel Osment was also pretty good. The film would make my top list if it wasn't for the ending, which was one of the worst I've ever seen It was just 15 minutes of me loudly saying You've got to be kidding me. OK, so David is a robot but he can freeze for over two thousand years, and he can just be completely revived by aliens who coincidentally found him. Yeah his circuits wouldn't fry or anything, like they did when he ate freaking spinach. Then, aliens just randomly have the power to bring back people if they have some part of them? Um, OK. Oh wait, good news is that Teddy saved a random piece of hair from over two thousand years ago!! Damn it, Teddy, go die. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the aliens can bring people back for just one day. Great work aliens. Two thousand years in the god damn future, you have the technology to bring people back but you can't do it for more than one day? I hate you. Oh I also forgot to mention the fact that somehow David and Teddy survived but NO OTHER mechas survived. Yeah right. The worst part about this sappy love fest ending hasn't even occurred yet. Somehow when they bring back his mother, her love turns him into a real boy, he cries, falls asleep and dies. You've got to be kidding me. The super technologically advanced aliens can bring back people who died, yet they can't turn him from a robot to a real boy? Alright, I got over that.

And, even with everything it's been hyped up to be, I was still impressed. I thought it worked best when it was just focusing of Schindler, and showing his growing reaction to the horrors around him, rather than outright showing the atrocities, but you can't really fault Spielberg for showing bits like the Ghetto liquidation scene, or the shower scene, because they're so powerful without really being manipulative at all. The only bit that really falls into emotional manipulation is the final scene with the rocks, which really took me out of the movie and was obviously a personal, not artistic, choice by Spielberg.I was also very surprised at how technically superb and inventive the film was. I expected the powerful impact, but I didn't expect some rather creative shots like the piano playing during the liquidation, or the distant shadow at the top of the long staircase. It's really a beautifully shot film, which is refreshing, because Spielberg could have easily gone for a gritty, raw feel and probably still got the same effect, but the near-noir like set-up made the on-screen horrors even more unbearable, due to their glamourized feel.The acting is almost uniformly excellent, from Neeson's gradual growth over the film, to Fiennes' unredeemably evil yet almost sympathetic villain, to Kingsley's quiet nobility, and Embeth Davidtz's rather underrated turn as Amon Goeth's housemaid. It's really a shame that the film won no acting Oscars, as it truly deserved some, especially Fiennes for his tormented performance. The story is not the typical exposition-build up-climax-denouement but I liked that, as you really didn't know where the story was heading next, and it gave the whole thing a sense of danger and desperation, much like what the characters would feel.This was probably the most well-known and well-received film that I hadn't seen, and now that I have, I have to say I'm not disappointed, though I don't know how many more times I'll be watching it. It really takes a lot out of you. Furthermore, despite how much I loved it, it's probably not even in my top five Spielberg films, which is really a testament to how many superb films he's made.

His distinctive style, mostly through the camera-work, shines through here as always and it never fails to be a pleasure to watch. He makes everything so sleek and engaging that, even when the scenes are dragging a bit, your eyes remained glued to the screen. Though I do wish he would have used a soundtrack closer to the ones he used in Collateral and Miami Vice, instead of the more jazz-focused one for this but I understand his reasoning.The performances are just sensational all around. Smith delivers one of the best of the year and I commend the Academy for recognizing such brilliance. He completely immerses himself into Ali and does nothing short of absolutely becoming the man. It feels like you're actually watching him. Jon Voight undergoes one of the most amazing transformations I've ever seen. I didn't even know who he was playing until the credits rolled. Jamie Foxx also delivers an exceptional work. His emotional trauma is palpable, and I wish that Mann would have spent a bit more time on him. Most biopics go through so much cheesy sentimentality that it becomes a chore to watch by the end, but Mann goes in a completely opposite direction and presents a hard-hitting, realistic drama that doesn't pull any punches. The boxing scenes are the greatest in film history, from my perspective. Most films use slow motion and fancy camera techniques to make boxing more dramatic, but Mann just puts the camera in the ring and presents it all exactly how it is, just like he does with all of his films.

Come to think of it....yes the movie is over the top in some of its parts. There are various actions done by characters in the movie which are clearly unrealistic or exaggerated, especially throughout the last 30 minutes. Also, by characters i do not simply refer to the 4 main ones.On the other hand I have to be true to myself and realize that I (like many others apparently) didn't notice these flaws on the first viewing. And why is it that these highly apparent flaws have gone unnoticed? My explanation is that this movie is not primarily focused on reality and facts, but rather on drug sensations. As a person who never took drugs, I still felt nauseated, confused, psychologically afraid, and with no sense of time throughout the whole movie. Everything from the music, editing, lighting, camera angles, acting and continuity, made this movie a drug in itself. Its a movie which should not be compared to Trainspotting or Blow which emphasize completely different points. Being so 'high' with just watching the movie, it was very difficult for me to notice such clear flaws.Is this necessarily a bad thing? Well it depends on how the director wanted us to feel, and also on the viewer. If Arnofsky wanted this movie to be like a drug experience felt in his viewers, then I have to give this movie an 11\/10, with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' a close second. If on the other hand, his aim was to be realistic, depict drug usage circumstances and facts about drug culture, then this movie delves very little in these areas and might not appeal to you.Others criticized the movie for having too much of a simplistic message (Don't do drugs cos they're bad for you. Look, this is what'll happen to you if you become a dealer\/junky). But then again, when is it that film making has become primarily storytelling as opposed to creating a mood? It may be true however that this movie might be offensive to drug users or others who know about or are involved in the business, possibly due to some images shown and the circumstances of the characters, possibly being stereotypical and somewhat cliché. It may be the case that Arnofsky used over dramatization\/unrealistic circumstances to enhance the mood, (some may argue that this dramatization was not needed) and if so, he has managed well. (Remember Kill Bill Vol 1? Exaggerated graphic violence to create the anime mood?) Finally on a personal, subjective note I loved the movie because of the way it is packaged. I especially loved the acting, the way the director used the shots, the fast editing and sound effects, lighting, and the music!

It is the story of five teenagers each from a different social group who are trapped together in Saturday detention from seven am till four. By the end of the day they begin to realise they have more in common than they once thought and that judging a book by it's cover can be deeply deceiving.Sometimes called contrived, The Breakfast Club should not be taken at face value. In reality these five students probably would not relate in the deep and meaningful way in which they do, but it's symbolic and that should be remembered. It's a film about understanding why people are the way they are and realising that we are all human in the end.Molly Ringwald is the daddy's plastic popular princess. Everybody loves her, looks up to her, worships her, or so it's thought. The Breakfast club unveils her unhappiness with her image and the pressure she suffers, but still her own vanity and excuse less cruelty. She's a more realistic version of the stereotype too often presented as a dumb cheer leading blonde. She happens to infuriate the class clown and bad boy John Bender, portrayed by Judd Nelson who's anger is fuelled both by his oppressed affection for her and own sad home life which contrasts greatly with Claire (Ringwald) in her diamond earrings. Next is the jock, Andy (Emilio Estevez), secretly hating his father for forcing to him to constantly compete and hating himself for the cruelty he's shown in the past in order to impress his father. If there's a jock there inevitably has to be a geek, played by Anthony Michael Hall. Brain box Brian might get teased for his interest in chemistry, maths or physics and weedy nature but is secretly envied by the rest of the breakfast club who automatically assume his parents must lavish him with affection for his academic success and good behaviour, however, his very reason for being in detention makes it crystal clear that this isn't the case. And of course there is the one who doesn't fit any title or social group, the quirk. Allison (Ally Sheady) claims she considers fleeing her home because her parents simply ignore her. It is proved that how we are raised effects us so greatly, in that none of the rest have heard her talk before today. When she talks she talks a lot, adding that she is a compulsive liar.Confined to one room for the majority of the film The Breakfast Club relies on strong characters and intelligent dialogue. It's unpredictable, funny and often moving. Within it's 97 minute running time it manages to say a lot about society; family life, school life, authority and the notion of happiness. Is anyone truly happy? Can happiness in all aspects of life at once ever be achieved? The film also breathes hope in stating what can be achieved when we begin to understand each other more.The Breakfast Club addresses a fear of young people worldwide Do we really turn into our parents when we grow up? It's unavoidable says Allison, When you grow up, your heart dies. It is the sincerity and sadness with which such lines are delivered that make this film so believable and special. In a decade of American Pie type teen comedies, which, despite being somewhat entertaining, preach fairly hollow messages, it's been a long time since a gem such as The Breakfast Club has graced our screens. It is a more realistic image of teen life, not so warped by Hollywood glamour and refreshingly, although it is raised as an issue, not focusing on sex drugs and rock and roll. Seeing this film more than twenty years after it's release, baring in mind the amount of hype and discussion it received and constant references in other films and television shows I expected to be disappointed on finally viewing it. I certainly wasn't. The Breakfast Club will change how you think if you let it. At the very least, the next time you see somebody you think you've got sussed out, you'll find your mind wandering back to the jock, the beauty, the brain, the criminal and the kook and you'll wonder if what you see is really what you get.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"8 January 2008","score":"","review":" It was one of the most definitive films of the 80's and one of the first to really address the growing teen anarchy yet The Breakfast Club still rings true today. It is the story of five teenagers each from a different social group who are trapped together in Saturday detention from seven am till four. By the end of the day they begin to realise they have more in common than they once thought and that judging a book by it's cover can be deeply deceiving.Sometimes called contrived, The Breakfast Club should not be taken at face value. In reality these five students probably would not relate in the deep and meaningful way in which they do, but it's symbolic and that should be remembered. It's a film about understanding why people are the way they are and realising that we are all human in the end.Molly Ringwald is the daddy's plastic popular princess. Everybody loves her, looks up to her, worships her, or so it's thought. The Breakfast club unveils her unhappiness with her image and the pressure she suffers, but still her own vanity and excuse less cruelty. She's a more realistic version of the stereotype too often presented as a dumb cheer leading blonde. She happens to infuriate the class clown and bad boy John Bender, portrayed by Judd Nelson who's anger is fuelled both by his oppressed affection for her and own sad home life which contrasts greatly with Claire (Ringwald) in her diamond earrings. Next is the jock, Andy (Emilio Estevez), secretly hating his father for forcing to him to constantly compete and hating himself for the cruelty he's shown in the past in order to impress his father. If there's a jock there inevitably has to be a geek, played by Anthony Michael Hall. Brain box Brian might get teased for his interest in chemistry, maths or physics and weedy nature but is secretly envied by the rest of the breakfast club who automatically assume his parents must lavish him with affection for his academic success and good behaviour, however, his very reason for being in detention makes it crystal clear that this isn't the case. And of course there is the one who doesn't fit any title or social group, the quirk. Allison (Ally Sheady) claims she considers fleeing her home because her parents simply ignore her. It is proved that how we are raised effects us so greatly, in that none of the rest have heard her talk before today. When she talks she talks a lot, adding that she is a compulsive liar.Confined to one room for the majority of the film The Breakfast Club relies on strong characters and intelligent dialogue. It's unpredictable, funny and often moving. Within it's 97 minute running time it manages to say a lot about society; family life, school life, authority and the notion of happiness. Is anyone truly happy? Can happiness in all aspects of life at once ever be achieved? The film also breathes hope in stating what can be achieved when we begin to understand each other more.The Breakfast Club addresses a fear of young people worldwide Do we really turn into our parents when we grow up?

The performances are mesmerizing. Geoffrey Rush is hilariously charismatic as The Marquis de Sade, a man who lives by glorifying the raunchiest sex acts he can imagine, but is at a loss when he finds himself falling in love. It's easily one of the bravest performances I've ever seen. Rush goes to all necessary lengths and doesn't hold back whatsoever in his brilliant portrayal. Certainly one of the best performances of the year, which I'm realizing was a dynamite year for Best Actor. Kate Winslet is adorably enchanting as Medeleine LeClerc, a woman who was raised to be proper and distinguished and is able to let out her darker side through The Marquis' writing. I love watching her become more knowingly in trouble by the law, but refusing to stop helping out The Marquis. It's great to see such a pure and heroic character. Certainly one of Winslet's best performances.Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of The Abbe du Coulmier, a man of God who is forced to confront his own demons of wrath and sexual desire constantly throughout the picture. Even more struggling is bestowed upon him as the law steps in to look over him and punish him for treating The Marquis in what they deem is a very poor and loose manner. He is one of the most complex and sympathetic characters in modern cinema, in my eyes. Michael Caine delivers what is possibly his best performance as Dr. Royer-Collard a man who strives to be proper and correct, but is one of the darkest and most unstoppable villains of all time. Caine does a brilliant job of making the audience become absolutely disgusted by every one of his actions. I did feel that they went a little over the top with him at times, though. Nobody could really be that horrible of a person, even if they do think that everything they are doing is right. It's great to see all of the contradictions in his character, especially in the absolutely breathtaking ending. I was just stunned into a complete catharsis. I literally couldn't believe my eyes. Words can't describe how amazed I was by the ending. I'm going to keep this relatively short, but I do want to bring up one more thing. I adored the rustic feeling they brought to the film in the tints of the entire picture. I felt that it really brought you into the time period and made you feel like you were there watching these characters, which is something I'm usually agitated by, especially in period pieces.

Like his two preceding short films, A Phantom of Regular Size (1986) and The Adventures of Electric Rod Boy (1987), Tetsuo The Iron Man is a striking piece of hyper-kinetic visual film-making; documenting the tortuous decent into hell for a Japanese businessman, who, after a serious accident, finds that his body has inexplicably begun mutating into a mass of metal, wire and steal.Tsukamoto's principal preoccupations as a filmmaker are often focused on the themes of alienation, claustrophobia, technology (all tied to the depiction of Tokyo as a punishing maze of dehumanising dread), and most importantly, the human body. Throughout his work, Tsukamoto has looked at the self-inflicted destruction of the body, via films such as Tetsuo The Iron Man, and its bigger-budgeted follow up Tetsuo II Body Hammer (1992), as well as his ultra-violent boxing film Tokyo Fist (1995); through to the more traditional notions of natural decay, death and internal destruction with films like A Snake of June (2002), Bullet Ballet (1998) and Vital (2004). All of these characteristics are presented here, with the film showing us how easily tragedy can strike (and indeed, go un-noticed) in a built up metropolitan city, and how striving to become the ultimate human being can often involve a melding of man with machine (the natural with the synthetic).The great thing about Tsukamoto's work is that it can often be enjoyed on a number of levels; so, with Tetsuo The Iron Man, we have something that could be viewed as an abstract science-fiction film with elements of cyber-punk derived body horror; or instead, we could look at some of the deeper, more metaphorical interpretations pertaining to the ideas of guilt, fear, murder, death, sex, lust, paranoia and perhaps even notions more unsavoury than that! The accident that is hinted at throughout the film is vague and offers only the slightest hint as to what Tetsuo is really about; giving us one potential interpretation in a film that seems absolute bursting with wild ideas and vivid flights of fantasy. All we have to really hold onto is the broad notion of a character spiralling into a pit of despair; consumed by guilt and losing his mind and the trust of his wife\/girlfriend in light of this tragic chain of events! Now, I'm not pretending I know all the answers here, but I do like to theorise. Someone else might view the film and take from it an entirely different interpretation, but could still find it entirely enjoyable and entertaining regardless. The fact remains that despite the layers of personal interpretation the one thing that will always stand out - regardless of whether or not you even liked the film in the first place - is the unbridled imagination and visual flair that Tsukamoto brings to the project as it's writer, director, editor, art director, cinematographer, designer, special effects technician and supporting actor.I suppose the best way to describe Tetsuo The Iron Man is like a hyper-kinetic mishmash of Lynch's meta-film masterpiece Eraserhead (1976) and Cronenberg's dark melodrama Videodrome (1982), with an obvious stylistic debt owed to the works of Japanese punk filmmaker Sogo Ishii; who covered similar territory with his industrial-influenced, highly visual early films such as Panic High School (1978), Crazy Thunder Road (1980) and Burst City (1982). All of this, combined with Tsukamoto's background in performance art, illustration and fondness for traditional Japanese monster movies enthuses Tetsuo with a freewheeling disregard for narrative, character and logic; as our hero (played here by cult actor and musician Tomorowo Taguchi, who should be familiar to fans of Tsukamoto's work, and that of his contemporary Takashi Miike) sprouts wires from his finger tips and a pneumatic drill where there was no drill before! Some viewers have also likened the film to a live action anime, with Tetsuo having certain similarities with Katsuhiro Ōtomo's Akira (1982-1986); in which another character named Tetsuo undergoes a painful transformation from a fresh faced teen, into a horribly deformed cyber-punk killing machine.Like many films of this nature, Tetsuo The Iron Man won't be to all tastes, and will probably be better appreciated by viewers who approach it, not as a conventional film, but as a wild, audio\/visual trip. Let the images wash over you while you pick apart the sociological subtext at your own leisure; all the while marvelling at the amazing achievement that Tsukamoto managed to pull off with an incredibly limited budget and an unbelievably small crew. For me, Tetsuo is perhaps not quite as rewarding as some of Tsukamoto's other works, chiefly Tokyo Fist, Gemini (1999) and A Snake of June, but regardless, remains a fascinating and unforgettable summation of his early style and various cinematic preoccupations, whilst simultaneously offering a unique viewing experience for those of you who are genuinely interested in through-provoking, visually arresting, art-house shock cinema.

Throughout his work, Tsukamoto has looked at the self-inflicted destruction of the body, via films such as Tetsuo The Iron Man, and its bigger-budgeted follow up Tetsuo II Body Hammer (1992), as well as his ultra-violent boxing film Tokyo Fist (1995); through to the more traditional notions of natural decay, death and internal destruction with films like A Snake of June (2002), Bullet Ballet (1998) and Vital (2004). All of these characteristics are presented here, with the film showing us how easily tragedy can strike (and indeed, go un-noticed) in a built up metropolitan city, and how striving to become the ultimate human being can often involve a melding of man with machine (the natural with the synthetic).The great thing about Tsukamoto's work is that it can often be enjoyed on a number of levels; so, with Tetsuo The Iron Man, we have something that could be viewed as an abstract science-fiction film with elements of cyber-punk derived body horror; or instead, we could look at some of the deeper, more metaphorical interpretations pertaining to the ideas of guilt, fear, murder, death, sex, lust, paranoia and perhaps even notions more unsavoury than that! The accident that is hinted at throughout the film is vague and offers only the slightest hint as to what Tetsuo is really about; giving us one potential interpretation in a film that seems absolute bursting with wild ideas and vivid flights of fantasy. All we have to really hold onto is the broad notion of a character spiralling into a pit of despair; consumed by guilt and losing his mind and the trust of his wife\/girlfriend in light of this tragic chain of events! Now, I'm not pretending I know all the answers here, but I do like to theorise. Someone else might view the film and take from it an entirely different interpretation, but could still find it entirely enjoyable and entertaining regardless. The fact remains that despite the layers of personal interpretation the one thing that will always stand out - regardless of whether or not you even liked the film in the first place - is the unbridled imagination and visual flair that Tsukamoto brings to the project as it's writer, director, editor, art director, cinematographer, designer, special effects technician and supporting actor.I suppose the best way to describe Tetsuo The Iron Man is like a hyper-kinetic mishmash of Lynch's meta-film masterpiece Eraserhead (1976) and Cronenberg's dark melodrama Videodrome (1982), with an obvious stylistic debt owed to the works of Japanese punk filmmaker Sogo Ishii; who covered similar territory with his industrial-influenced, highly visual early films such as Panic High School (1978), Crazy Thunder Road (1980) and Burst City (1982). All of this, combined with Tsukamoto's background in performance art, illustration and fondness for traditional Japanese monster movies enthuses Tetsuo with a freewheeling disregard for narrative, character and logic; as our hero (played here by cult actor and musician Tomorowo Taguchi, who should be familiar to fans of Tsukamoto's work, and that of his contemporary Takashi Miike) sprouts wires from his finger tips and a pneumatic drill where there was no drill before! Some viewers have also likened the film to a live action anime, with Tetsuo having certain similarities with Katsuhiro Ōtomo's Akira (1982-1986); in which another character named Tetsuo undergoes a painful transformation from a fresh faced teen, into a horribly deformed cyber-punk killing machine.Like many films of this nature, Tetsuo The Iron Man won't be to all tastes, and will probably be better appreciated by viewers who approach it, not as a conventional film, but as a wild, audio\/visual trip. Let the images wash over you while you pick apart the sociological subtext at your own leisure; all the while marvelling at the amazing achievement that Tsukamoto managed to pull off with an incredibly limited budget and an unbelievably small crew. For me, Tetsuo is perhaps not quite as rewarding as some of Tsukamoto's other works, chiefly Tokyo Fist, Gemini (1999) and A Snake of June, but regardless, remains a fascinating and unforgettable summation of his early style and various cinematic preoccupations, whilst simultaneously offering a unique viewing experience for those of you who are genuinely interested in through-provoking, visually arresting, art-house shock cinema.
