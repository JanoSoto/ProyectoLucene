[{"date":"14 September 1998","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Lulu, as I prefer to call it, is a sentimental, yet mysterious movie. One  has to feel that this is Auster in a nutshell, covering humans dark sides  as well as their fabulous way of finding meaning.  Auster has done a good job when it comes to the actors and actresses, they  are perfect. The soundtrack is perhaps the factor that makes the darkness  of the movie even more conclusive. Whenever the CD is out, I have to buy it!  Overall, Auster did a pretty good job with Lulu. Recommended, also for non -Auster fans.
