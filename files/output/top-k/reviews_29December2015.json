The very stupid, heartless yet extremely unfunny ice flows deal in Alaska. The plane landing in Alaska skidding joke. The beginning of the film with Jason Alexander and his pants factory joke. Very stupid. The Jerry Lewis joke in France. Jon Lovit's character, very annoying. I still did not name every stupid, terrible thing in this movie yet. Not enough room here.

But no, he just believes everybody and gets manipulated by all their lies. I wish I could have jumped into the screen and told him what is going on here.

After it was clear Lime was still alive, how could he think she could end up being with him? The real hero of the movie for me is Major Calloway, played by Trevor Howard, who succeeds to convince Holly Martins to betray his friend. He succeeds in his job to catch Lime and stops the stealing of medication from the military hospitals.

With help from a grouchy old man (Eddie Albert) in a Winnebago, the kids try to reach a place called Witch Mountain they feel drawn to.This is one of Disney's best films from the '70s and a personal favorite from my childhood. The cast is excellent. Kim Richards is best known today for being a reality TV personality, but before all that embarrassing nonsense she actually had a fairly successful career as a child actor. Eisenmann also had a lot of work as a kid before moving on to other things. Both hold their own well with solid veteran actors Ray Milland, Eddie Albert, Donald Pleasence, and Denver Pyle. The vets are all terrific. It's a sci-fi family film with healthy doses of Disney cuteness. Whether or not that cuteness will be your cup of tea I can't say. The special effects are dated now, sure, but they're not bad for their time. Besides, the datedness actually adds to the charm I think.Sometimes we like movies from our youth solely because of nostalgia or because they are tied to a special memory. While that is no doubt the case for many of us with Escape to Witch Mountain, I really do think it holds up well today on its own merits. If you grew up with this, you don't need me to tell you how much fun it is. To everyone else, particularly the younger viewers weaned on CGI, Ritalin pacing, and music video cinematography, open yourself up to this movie and I'm sure you'll like it.

And, I say that as a person who never liked Hackman until he became older. Now I quite admire his acting in his maturity.I can't judge the acting of Monica Bellucci here; she plays Hackman's wife.

Very odd; I couldn't figure out if it was a message or just an odd way to hold the cigarettes.As I watched the film, I kept thinking that the suspect was hiding something...not his guilt, but the guilt of someone else. And then the end of the film comes and you say, Huh????? I'm giving this film a 5. Watch the film, get to the end, and you'll find out why...not to mention Thomas Jane's acting. How this film ever made the mint of money that it did, I don't know. Certainly not though word of mouth. And I say that as a great admirer of Morgan Freeman.

I wouldn't like to think that all LA shrinks live like that. He's also been very careful about certain details. The color red, for instance. We don't see it that often but when we do it's fully saturated, fluorescent, and stands out like nobody's business, turning a woman's lips into something almost frightening.Rush is also responsible for some extraordinary shots that needlessly call attention to themselves.

The plot is full of hidden holes, so many and so subtle that they slip by almost unnoticed.

Now he decides, on a whim, to practice in California? Without wrestling with red tape from the state and from the rabid and proprietary American Psychological Association? The difficulties aren't even alluded to. The APA wouldn't even let me become a member, let alone a fellow, although I have a doctorate in clinical psychology. They didn't like the school I'd gone to. The plot was sometimes so turgid that I was lost. (Maybe a second viewing.) The climactic confrontation involves the deployment of a nail gun and an electric drill and the circumstances destroy the movie completely, turning it into an ill-conceived and confusing action movie with thunder and lightning, tottering on the lip of a long fall, and all the other accouterments.

He hadn't made a movie in fourteen years and it's very likely that the producers kept him on a tight leash. It happens. In The Godfather, the scene in which Carlo beats hell out of his pregnant wife, using a belt, was not Francis Ford Coppola's idea.
