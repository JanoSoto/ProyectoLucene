Some people call it a reboot, but it is a sequel to the first film, it even has a recap of the what happened in the TCM, I don't know if that was just added in for continuity or if it was even in the original version. I like that the film followed the format of the first, it lacks the cheese and goofiness of TCM part 2. Even though the family is pretty sadistic, I couldn't help but laugh at what they said or how they acted with each other. The gas station attendant had some funny moments as well. The film is 1 hour and 24 minutes long, and was very entertaining, rarely a dull moment. The film is not as violent as part two was, it's mostly just blood splattering and and the odd severed head or face, we never see the chainsaw cut flesh, which is what everyone wants to see. Oh well, we have the newer films that aren't shy to show us what the title promises. Viggo Mortensen is in this film, it was neat to see his earlier work, I liked his line  Boy, they just keep getting dumber. Ken Foree is the character you end up rooting for. Leatherfaces final moment before the film ends, makes him out to be more inhuman then I once thought, then again this is the same guy who had a chainsaw rammed through him.You may ask why I gave this a 6 out of 10, well I don't think it's all that bad, it was a more enjoyable sequel than Part 2, at least from my first viewing, we'll see if that changes in time once I've viewed it a couple more times. It's not bad, and I don't get why fans of this cry about every new film in this franchise that comes out, can't you just enjoy the film, it's not art, it's a horror movie. Now I starting to lean into the hate for Texas chainsaw 3D, so I'm going to end the review now.

A romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is not normally my sort of thing but sometimes, a good girlie film such as Notting Hill can be just what the doctor ordered. Notting Hill is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones Diary, which makes it a good alternative to these movies. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor which makes this a much more intelligent movie.The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great (in fact they deliver an ordinary performance especially Julia Roberts). The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story. Nevertheless, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations to the actor (Rhys Ifans) who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role. I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to sell the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios are quite good.

That's not what makes this movie so special though. It's the story, the acting and the characters. NYPD Officer John McClane (played to hard boiled perfection by Bruce Willis) is the walking definition of a hero a regular guy who gets thrown into a dire situation and reacts well to it. McClane has flown to LA to see his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas, and meets her at the building where she works, at her company's Christmas party. They waste no time in getting into yet another spat, when suddenly a group of terrorists seizes the building..and everyone on the 30th floor. At least it seems like terrorists at first (we find out that these terrorists in fact have something else in mind). McClane slips away unnoticed by the supposed terrorists, with his gun (if not his shoes..and yes, he regrets that one later), and proceeds to wreak havoc on the terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in a performance that's nothing short of superb), and his right arm Karl, played by a really angry-looking Alexander Godunov. When McClane isn't taking the bad guys out one at a time, wriggling around in air vents and the elevator shaft, he has to deal with an idiotic deputy police chief (a classic illustration of the Peter principle), a couple of equally clueless FBI agents, and a conniving co worker of Holly's who tries to turn McClane into Gruber by telling him who he really is (up to that point Gruber didn't know his name). There's also an ambitious dirt bag of a TV news reporter played by William Atherton, who ends up giving Holly's identity out over the air.Die Hard is a rarity among action flicks in that the action is actually plausible (unlike the various sequels). The characters are believable too (yes, even that moron of a deputy police chief)..and interesting. This more than keeps things going during the short breaks in the action. All this makes Die Hard the best movie of its genre ever made.

Unlike Lucas who was a special effects visionary, Kershner instead focuses on story and characters, most notably the human face.The story takes place most likely a few years after the first film. With the Death Star destroyed Luke and the Rebel Aliance is forced to go on the run and into hiding on a remote ice planet Hoth. Meanwhile Darth Vader does everything in his power to find Luke and bring him to his Emperor in order to train him to become the next Sith apprentice. Afterwords many things happen Romance is formed in the middle of battle, Shocking revelations are discovered that change everything and new things are discovered about The Force that are almost zen like by a new character named Yoda (performed and voiced by the great Frank Oz).Everything about this movie is phenomenal. The story takes a darker and more personal turn leading to better character development. The action scenes are amazing, epic and well shot and the dialog is so memorable that its embedded into our pop culture. Anybody who knows No...I am your father. or I know should know what I'm talking about.(Give some credit to George Lucas,the late Leigh Brackett(who also co-wrote the original The Big Sleep) and Lawrence Kasdan for delivering a great script.) As for acting its just excellent. James Earl Jones and David Prowse give their most menacing combination performance that reminds us why Darth Vader is one the most memorable villains in cinema history. Mark Hamil's Luke is angsty but a little more mature from the last movie. Carie Fisher and Harison Ford share great chemistry. Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker are great comedic relief as always giving some levity to even the most darkest of times. Frank Oz does a wonderful job as Yoda who becomes Luke's new mentor in The Force. Alec Guinness returns as Obi Wan Kenobi who guides Luke to Yoda in spirit form. Billy Dee Williams stars as a new character Lando Calrissian. Elaine Baker's face and Clive Revill's voice give us a very chilling first time view of the Emperor and lets not forget the one scene wonder bounty hunter Boba Fett played by Jeremy Bullochband voiced by Jason Wingreen. (Combination performances seem to happen a lot in Star Wars Hmmm) One last thing I should mention is the amazing score by John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra which gives us one of the more memorable and chilling music pieces for Darth Vader the Imperial March. The Empire Strikes Back stands as one of the best sequels and one of the best movies of all time. See it and share it with everyone.

Gattaca represents a rare genre of intellectual sci-fi movies that contains minimal amount of action and none of larger than life stuff (usual weapons and monsters kind) This kind of genre is heavily relied on the actors and settings. Settings for Gattaca are originally adapted where the future children are not conceived naturally, but through genetic engineering. This has brought up new kind of racism perfect versus flawed Watching Ethan Hawke's role as Vincent evade the relentless pursuit of the authorities while trying to be on the Titan mission, romancing Irene (Uma Thurman), and micro-managing his samples from Jerome (Jude Law in a very impressive supporting turn) made for some the most riveting viewing ever.

The film, done on a grand scale and faithfully keeping to both the book and the period, have captured the intimacy and the connection with the characters, the commitment to the plot, brilliantly. Everything about the film is flawless; locations, sets, costumes, lighting, the deportment of the characters, the emotions transfered and the tight script. Glenn Close gave the performance of her life, and I'm sad she didn't get an Oscar for it, as the bitter, manipulative, arrogant and ultimately lonely aristocrat Madame de Merteuil. Also, John Malkovich was born for the role of Vicomte de Valmont, and I can't imagine any other actor carrying the role off with the hauteur and sociopathic finesse that he does. He is expressionless for the most part (good in this case), hell bent on winning in his quests, his perverted labours of Hercules, if you will. Michelle Pfeiffer had a tough role as the pious and broken Madame de Tourvel, the object of Vicomte's primary seduction, and whilst her performance was shaky in places she carried you along in her fall and her role was worthy of the awards she garnered. Mildred Natwick as the aged and wise (yet sadly of her age) Madame de Rosemonde was beautiful and her iconic voice delivering the fateful line of 'men only enjoy the love they feel, women only can enjoy the love they give' was poignant and tragic. Keanu Reeves and Uma Thurman (Chevalier Danceny and Cecile de Volanges) both seemed out of their depth, and playing it naively, but Uma had a complex and exposing role for one of her first and there were moments of superb acting. Likewise Reeves as Le Chevalier; he has been much criticised for his performance but his naivety was perhaps in keeping with his station and age, although delivered badly and a little too staccato in places. It is few actors, however, that would commit so dedicatedly to the brilliant duel towards the end, throwing himself around, with unpolished and unscripted realism. A good performance but not a great one, but again one of his very early roles and along with Uma Thurman a terrific opportunity to act in such illustrious company.Overall, whilst a seedy, dark, pessimistic look at the life and times of C18th French Aristocracy, it is a morality tale with some power, and is affecting. In places it isn't pleasant watching, the seduction of Cecile, for example, but there is humour and spectacle to distract in places. Historically I cannot comment on it's strict authenticity but to an uneducated eye it looks impeccably researched and delivered, and even the minor characters; servants etc perfect. The opening scene of the dressing of the two main characters gives a curtain up on the story, identifying them as rich, powerful and vain.

Lovely little role for gorgeous David Duchovny as JP Prewitt, hand model.It's like a fairytale, or morality tale, and whilst it's not rocket science it's witty and smart and gains on duplicate viewing with plenty of other jokes you might have missed.

After watching 3 hours of Kevin Costner and his team searching high and low for the truth behind the supposed conspiracy that led to JFK's assassination, I am always left with more questions than answers. This film compels me to look further for the answers. This film makes me angry that the whole truth is still not fully known &#x96; and I'm an Australian! Simply, JFK is a 'who-done-it', police procedural, thriller of the highest order. It is pure entertainment, with fine performances and a director that is clearly in love with his work. But it is much more than that. The power this film has wielded since its release has been well documented. Oliver Stone's JFK has proved to be not only riveting entertainment, but a persuasive tool in influencing US legislation. The reception to this film led to the formation of the U.S. Assassination Records Review Board. So I'm not the only one this film compels to search further for answers... Just as the road to the truth in JFK is fraught with stubborn resistance, so too was the making of JFK. Oliver Stone's movie was lambasted by some critics for supposedly re-writing history with trouble making, speculative fiction. This started before the film was even released. But, I don't believe Stone is being definitive with the conclusions he delivers here, but rather offers viewers an alternative to Lee Harvey Oswald, the lone assassin. The proportion of fact to fiction in the film is up for debate, but as time passes, I believe that the percentage of fact is proving to be ever increasing. The film is based on the book by former New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, who, played by Kevin Costner, becomes the films hero and catalyst. Costner's Garrison is genuine but bland. However, he is also stubbornly determined enough to propel the film towards its resolution. Garrison initially investigates New Orleans based links to the assassination that leads him to uncover his bigger conspiracy picture. He and his team track down the various 'bad guy' players. Amongst others, Joe Pesci plays David Ferrie, a ground level manic militant ringleader, with a frenetic mouth, even by Pesci standards. Tommy Lee Jones plays Clay Shaw (if that is his real name), a homosexual corporate type with an unflinching gravitas. And Gary Oldman shows us a frighteningly cold Oswald. Garrison gets help along the way from his New Orleans team of lawyers and investigators, and from Donald Sutherland, who with such little screen time manages to spew out more conspiracy theories than the entire Mel Gibson film Conspiracy Theory, whilst portraying a shady high level source reminiscent of 'deep throat' in All the President's Men. Other memorable performances are provided by Kevin Bacon, Walther Matthau and Jack Lemon, who all supply key morsels of information and puzzle pieces. JFK is also a film editing master-class, incorporating real documentary footage into the mix at every opportunity, and managing to implant a mountain of facts into the viewers mind. This is all done whilst keeping up a rapid pace, nothing akin to a documentary at all. We are led at this rapid pace, with all the facts in hand, to the final courtroom scene where Garrison lays his theory on the line. I must admit, even given all the evidence Garrison uses to back up his case, I can't help but feel that it is all a bit thin. There is still too much speculative logic to have me convinced in his case. In saying this, I am certainly not convinced that his case is untrue.
