Ravenous isn't too gory or too complicated with needless details, it keeps the story simple and easy to follow all while ensuring the audience can't get their eyes off the screen.

On the way they are constantly intoxicated on drink and various drugs.This film completely messes with your head. It is completely psychedelic and all over the place. The imagery is great. I love the feel of the movie. Granted, it is not all easy to follow... there were times where I was wondering what the hell was going on.There are some funny moments in it, but none that made me laugh out loud. I just found the amusing.The film stars Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Johnny plays his part well... but I think he played it as a comedy character. The way he walked and acted was very funny. And he looks great with a bald head... not! haha. Benicio did well too... he had to put on a big beer belly for this role. It makes a change for the Hollywood stars to make themselves look horrible. There were also some great cameos in the film. Other faces that appeared were Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Lyle Lovett & Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.The story was completely out there... but we have all come to expect this from Terry Gilliam. The legend that once was a member of Monty Python has made a few movies now... and most of them are weird in some way. That is not a bad thing.There are some good effects, but it is not a big special effects movie. There are a few scenes where you are seeing what Johnny sees... and it is drug fuelled. There are things moving and faces changing and people turning into creatures etc... it is bizarre. But I have never taken any drugs, so as far as I know, this is what probably happens. It is entertaining.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Quite good and amusing... but I have seen better drug related movies. I get a feeling I will have to watch this again before I can fully appreciate it.For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"20 July 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGASHmmm... now that is a trip!The movie is about a journalist and his lawyer go on a trip to Vegas to find the American dream.

She was not from the US, and didn't have much exposure to cinema other than the stuff her home country makes (which is quite a sizable chunk of world cinema, to be fair). Afterwards, dumbfounded and speechless, she merely said, I didn't know movies like that existed...The sad truth is they don't. This is a deeply affecting film of great beauty and dark, melancholy magic. It will stay with you for many years to come, if not for the rest of your life. It's definitely not as out there as Holy Mountain, but it uses that visual style much more effectively; whereas Holy Mountain is a monstrous sensual buffet that ultimately leaves the first-time viewer bewildered and scourged, this is a finely-crafted gourmet meal that does a much more surgically-precise job on the soul. You still get the bizarre circus imagery, the lurid back-alley scenes, the jabs at Catholicism, the hallucinatory nightmare sequences - but you also end up caring about the characters, and their world. Though it's fairly simple on paper (Freudian slasher flick, basically), the story is the ultimate organizing force here, and all the great surreal visual elements that make this a true Jodorowsky film are fully ready to serve it and its themes. The music should also get an honorable mention, since it's responsible for carrying many magical moments in the film Felix and Concha's Dejame Llorar duet (which translates to let me cry) is devastating - perhaps because it is both lurid and heartbreaking at the same time.I am not sure if NOT calling this a horror flick is the right attitude - I would be very happy if hundreds of unsuspecting, stoned teenage gore-hounds across American white suburbia were exposed to this.

This movie is far from such an idea. It is about farm life in 1916 and four individuals whose lives' intercede, connect, divide, and ultimately become devastated. The characters are a poor man (Gere), his little sister (Manz), his girlfriend (Adams), and the farm owner they work for (Sheperd). These personalities are not so much developed in the film, but rather are revealed through their actions and choices. The story is simple, the poor man uses his girlfriend to romance and marry the farmer (who is ill and dying) as an attempt to inherit his money and property. The love triangle takes a nasty turn as the woman falls in love with the farmer and horrible truths are unveiled. All the while, the little sister becomes the audience's observer and narrator. What makes this film considered special by critics is Terrence Malick's method of storytelling. He incorporates small scenes of dialog, many beautiful shots of the plot's setting, and a voice-over to fill in the gaps. Though this concept breaks the norm of traditional narrative, it can be a two-edged sword. Too many b-roll shots of nature can make a film dull and a lot of voice-over can grow daunting. It is that balance which makes a movie good. The strong advantage of this movie is its cinematography. Every single shot is truly a work of art, especially with the fact that most of this film was shot outdoors with natural lighting. The early morning and late evening scenes during the twilight hours are simply breathtaking. The long sequences of the farmers at work in the wheat fields are equally beautifully composed and collaged, showing us a time in America that has long been forgotten. My personal favorite scene takes place during a locust infestation. The farmers desperately trying to fight against the impossible foe is a true visual feast-particularly when they rise out of the ground like a flood. The music helps set a mood of loneliness and wonder in the open spaces of Texas. Ennio Morricone is definitely one of the world's greatest film composers. The disadvantage is how the movie was edited. Frequent scenes of dialog are interrupted by extra shots of the sky, fields, farm workers, and animals. The prevalent dissolves and fade to black transitions hint to the work of an amateur rather than a filmmaker who has a sense of direction. The ending particularly leaves me cold and uninspired-almost as if the screenwriter did not know how else to take the movie further, much less how to end it. This is hardly surprising since director Terrence Malick improvised most of the movie on-set rather than plan everything in advance. Improvisation can only go so far. Fortunately, the pacing is fine. Only people who have goldfish span attention would find this film boring and pretentious. This though does not make up for the initial issue. Aside from the poor editing, the sound mixing for the dialog was not well recorded. I could hear the tractors, the screeches of the birds and locusts fine, yet when actors spoke on scene, they were dwarfed by the surrounding SFX. Even the raspy narration by Linda Manz became incoherent on occasion. Days of Heaven certainly has that old epic feeling that rivals Gone With The Wind in terms of cinematography and scope, but it falls flat on a bad ending, poor editing, and sound. I understand why the critics love this movie. It is truly beautiful to watch and the story is not all that bad. But like all Malick films, it can't deliver solid cohesiveness.

A tragic theme, perhaps, but too often true. While the altered ending is less downbeat, it just wasn't Williams' original story. Oddly, Roger Ebert's review doesn't even mention the change in the ending, even though he does mention other changes forced by the censors at the time.

This film at its core is about these two characters and how they spend what is probably one of the best days of their lives together. They wander around the town, from place to place, doing activity to activity while engaging in natural and insightful conversation. The conversations they have are a deep look into who these characters are and how well they work together.Richard Linklater's unique vision shines through in this project, as the camera follows them around as they wander a city completely foreign to them. It intensely focuses on the development of these two characters and it also documents a realistic connection between two human beings over the span of one day.

Oh wait, a remake has been attempted in Hindi in a movie called Bichchoo, starring Bollywood's very own Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. Once you see Leon you will laugh your a** out watching Bichchoo. In fact, I think the guys would have been better off making Bichchoo as a true parody like Scary Movie or somethingThen there is Mathilda enacted by Natalie Portman in her debut movie. She is 12 and has the emotional leanings of an 18 year old. Her falling in love with a seemingly 40ish Leon is awkward, at least to eastern sensibilities. But no concession has been given to her age in showing her love and hatred and for that you have to hand it out to the makers.All in all, a great GREAT emotional drama. It is NOT an action flick or a thriller. So set your expectations right.

He and his assistant, Mitch (Rock Hudson) fall for the same woman (Lauren Bacall) but Kyle somehow wins her with his charming personality. I say 'somehow' because after this, you see very little of his charm--mostly the actions of a boorish, sulking jerk. He immediately takes his wife for granted and you feel for the lady. As for Mitch, he can't stay--as he is carrying a torch for this now married woman. And then there's Marylee (Dorothy Malone), Kyle's rather obnoxious sister. She's in love with Mitch but Mitch tells her he's not interested. When Mitch doesn't reciprocate, she decides to destroy herself and everyone around her. And then, there's Kyles 'man problem'*...what's to become of that? Does this all sound like a bit of fluff--like just another soap opera? Well, yes, but it is a very glossy and pretty soaper--thanks to director Douglas Sirk, who made a name for himself by making what was essentially high-quality trash. Films like Magnificent Obsession**, All That Heaven Allows and Imitation of Life** were all about rich, bored and screwed up pretty folks. In many ways, these films are a lot like forerunners of shows like Dallas and Dynasty. In other words, they appeal to a certain niche--and if you like this sort of thing, Sirk was great in creating them. He did, however, make MANY films that did not fit this mold--though today he is most known for the soaps. As for me, I am not a huge fans of soaps. This doesn't mean they are bad--just not the sort of genre that usually appeals to me. Additionally, there wasn't any subtlety about this film (except in what I mention below*)--it was loud, crass and bigger than life (particularly in regard to Malone's character). I also think it plays better if you see it as a comedy and not a drama--especially since Malone's and Stack's characters are so ridiculous and over-done! But, in an odd way, it IS entertaining...I will give it that!Oddly, despite all this, Sirk and his melodramas have been adored by the French New Wave writers and directors--and perhaps that is why the film has been released as part of the much-heralded Criterion Collection. For me, I just cannot see what they see in this--it's just a soaper...and a rather trashy one at that for its time. *Because it was the 1950s, the script really didn't know what to do with Kyle. Sirk envisioned the man as a closeted homosexual. However, they couldn't put that in American films at that time due to the Production Code, so they talked about him having some 'problem' that prevented the couple from having kids. Talk about cryptic and silly! The viewers might have thought he was impotent or had poor sperm motility or was chronically constipated or had major Freudian issues or goodness knows what!! Having him being clearly gay would have improved the film tremendously and made sense of some of the plot.**These were remakes and especially in the case of Imitation of Life, the original was much better.

Murnau (Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horrors, Sunrise), this German silent film was one in the book listing the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I knew nothing about the plot or title meaning, but I was keen. Basically this film tells the story of a respected, experienced and happy Hotel Doorman (Emil Jannings), he is proud of his position at the famous Atlantic Hotel, with his responsibilities, and dressed in his fancy decorated general-like uniform. One busy rainy night he takes a short break, having carried heavy a suitcase from the wet weather, and he is seen by his Manager (Hans Unterkircher) not performing his duties in that short time, so the next day the Doorman arrives for work and is surprised to see another man in his place, he has been replaced. The Doorman learns that he has been demoted and reassigned to the less strenuous but ultimately degrading position of washroom attendant, but this decision is also because he is considered too old and not the best image to represent the hotel. He tries to hide this demotion and new position from friends and family, but eventually he is discovered, he feels dire shame, his friends think he has been lying about having his former position the whole time, taunting him, while his family shun him due to their shame. The Doorman has no choice but to continue this job, despite feeling great grief, and he uses the bathroom he works in to sleep in, but he finds kindness in the Night Watchman (Georg John) who gives his a coat to cover himself with, but he continues to fall deeper into despair. The only title card that appears at this point says that in real life the story would end with the old man dying in sadness, but the story takes an improbable turn. The Doorman inherits a fortune from a Mexican millionaire, who died in his arms in the bathroom, he later returns to the hotel he worked a happy man to dine with great amounts of food, he is joined by the Night Watchman. The final moments of the film see The Doorman respected once again, now as a rich and valued man, he and the Night Watchman get ready to leave in their horse and carriage, and they are approached by a beggar who asks for money or food, and taking pity on him the men allow him to ride with them in the carriage. Also starring Maly Delschaft as The Doorman's Daughter, Max Hiller as the Daughter's Fiancé, Emilie Kurz as the Fiancé's Aunt, Olaf Storm as as Young Guest and Emmy Wyda as a Thin Neighbor. I suppose the title meaning is to do with the slightly unfathomable and not fully explained happy ending, this was put in on insistence by the producer, probably so audiences would not complain, this could easily be seen as a dream sequence. The film is filled with great black and white imagery, including city backgrounds and hotel interiors, good costumes, Jannings is a wonderful character to sympathise with, and there is no need for any written dialogue because all the visual emotions grab you, a fantastic classic silent drama.

Thank goodness films like this occasionally get made.I know it sounds as if I just contradicted myself, but just because it was a bomb, didn't mean that it's not a fine film. And the strength of this film are the performances. The strongest of the performances is by Glenn Close, who plays the lead male's sister who has lesbian inclinations. She's been treated unfairly her whole life and suffers for most of it. A strong, strong performance. Next is Meryl Streep. Just about as good as always as the psychic wife of the male lead.Then we come to Jeremy Irons. Hmmmmm. I have mixed feelings here. Irons' character here is so despicable that you know he will get his comeuppance before the movie ends. Is it wise to be that obvious? To play it that hard? I think not. So I'll reserve judgment here simply because, typically, Irons is a wonderful actor.In supporting roles, the most notable are those of Winona Ryder as the daughter and Antonio Banderas as her poor lover. Both do great jobs. I enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the parents of Streep, but they didn't get enough screen time.Now as to the script. It's good...perhaps a tad slow in a few places. But character development is rather thorough. The story is of a relatively poor young man who falls in love, but works to strike gold in order to marry a relatively rich girl. He does, but she dies. So, eventually he marries her sister (Streep), who doesn't talk...by her own choice. She does talk with him, however, and for a while they have a happy life. But he is a bitter shell of a man who has become a patrone who treats pretty much everyone harshly, always insisting he is boss. You know, as I mentioned earlier, that he will get his comeuppance, but it's cleverly done here in a way that combines personal tragedy with the history of so many South American countries.Although it's never made clear in the film, the country depicted is Chile. A special note should be made of the makeup used to age the main characters. It's done very well here...a much better job than in a lot of films.I recommend this film IF you like serious movies.

So I'll reserve judgment here simply because, typically, Irons is a wonderful actor.In supporting roles, the most notable are those of Winona Ryder as the daughter and Antonio Banderas as her poor lover. Both do great jobs. I enjoyed seeing Vanessa Redgrave and Armin Mueller-Stahl as the parents of Streep, but they didn't get enough screen time.Now as to the script. It's good...perhaps a tad slow in a few places. But character development is rather thorough. The story is of a relatively poor young man who falls in love, but works to strike gold in order to marry a relatively rich girl. He does, but she dies. So, eventually he marries her sister (Streep), who doesn't talk...by her own choice. She does talk with him, however, and for a while they have a happy life. But he is a bitter shell of a man who has become a patrone who treats pretty much everyone harshly, always insisting he is boss. You know, as I mentioned earlier, that he will get his comeuppance, but it's cleverly done here in a way that combines personal tragedy with the history of so many South American countries.Although it's never made clear in the film, the country depicted is Chile. A special note should be made of the makeup used to age the main characters. It's done very well here...a much better job than in a lot of films.I recommend this film IF you like serious movies. Otherwise, it may bore you. I found it rather compelling.

However, this, it is a masterpiece.I was not even alive when this movie was released. I didn't know of it until maybe four years ago. Since then, I have seen this movie multiple times and honestly, I don't get tired of it. This is among the most powerful stories ever told in a film. Ever. This movie is simply about friendship. The friendship that takes form over roughly 20 years in a Maine prison. One man, is in prison for murder. He is guilty. However, his friend, is not guilty. An innocent man is placed in prison for two life sentences for a crime he did not commit.Red (played masterfully by Morgan Freeman)is the guilty man, while Andy Dufresne (played wonderfully by Tim Robbins) is the innocent man.The two of them show remarkable chemistry. They pull this off simply by talking to each other throughout the movie. Usually when I see a trailer for a movie today, there's explosions, or a natural disaster or gang wars or something. This movie consists almost 99.9999999% simple talking. And its done to perfection.With a well done script, terrific acting, and a very good ending, this movie will forever be among the greatest ever.There are countless moments in this movie where you feel moved, inspired, or you feel that you've learned something.I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. A true masterpiece.
