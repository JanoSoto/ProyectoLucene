He and his buddies quickly learn that there's nothing fun about war as they experience all the horrors that come with it. This film and director Lewis Milestone both picked up Oscars and I'm sure most important to the studio is that this is still considered one of the greatest anti-war pictures ever made. There's no question that there's a lot of energy, passion and terror built up in the film but I think at times it crosses over into some preachy moments that really don't work too well but more on that in a second. There's no question that the greatest strength to this film are the tremendous battle sequences, which were considered great at the time but when viewed today they're all the more impressive. It's clear that the director and studio weren't too worried about the production code because they go all out in the grit and this includes some rather graphic battle sequences where we see body parts separated from the bodies and of course there are some violent gun battles. The battle scenes are certainly among the greatest ever shot and there's a beautiful sequence inside the trenches where the men get up against the wall to do battle while the camera glides over their heads and prepares for battle. This is followed by another terrific sequence where the other side goes to jump down in the trenches and the fights that occur are so realistic you feel as if you're watching a documentary. That documentary term fits the film well because these sequences look so real that you really do feel as if you're watching the real thing. The performances for the most part are pretty impressive, although I'd say that Ayres comes off just Luke warm. He handles some of the later stuff quite well but there were a few sequences where he just didn't work for me and this includes one very preachy sequence where he talks to an enemy soldier he has killed. For my money it was Louis Wolheim who stole the film as a veteran soldier trying to teach the new kids the ropes. As I mentioned earlier, the one issue I had with the film is how preachy it was at times. I think less could have been more as the message is quite clear and to me there really wasn't a need to push the issue. It's funny that this film was such a hit in America since it was showing the German side of the war and I also find it quite ironic that Hollywood would make a film like this. Then, less than a decade later, another world war would strike and they went back to the message that dying for your country is good, which is the exact opposite of the message here.

Everything in the movie is still memorable to this day. The memorable characters we all know and love, including Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Rafiki, Mufasa, Scar, and the Hyenas, are still the characters we know from our childhood. Also, Hans Zimmer's incredible music score is breathtaking and exhilarating, and it helped tell the story. Speaking of that, the story is an example of what happens when Shakespeare's Hamlet has lions! It's thrilling, funny, breathtaking, heartbreaking, and it has a message that's truly uplifting. But the best part of the whole movie, is the beautiful and memorable songs brought to us, by Elton John and Tim Rice. Everyday, almost everybody sings to Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, Just Can't Wait to Be King, and the forever-classic Can You Feel the Love Tonight?. I hope that all audiences will enjoy a movie like The Lion King, for the characters, the songs, and it's beautiful heart.

Big is a brilliant example of the right guy in the right role. I think Big was always going to end up OK, but with Tom Hanks as Josh Baskin; the child in an adult's body, it ascended to all time greatness.As mentioned above 13 year old Josh Baskin makes a wish at a fairground on an old attraction named 'Zoltar', that results in him aging two decades or so overnight &#x96; Charlie Sheen seems to have made the same wish judging by his recent photos &#x96; but in Josh's case being a teen 30 something isn't that easy. How did the 90210 kids manage to pull it off? His parents obviously don't understand how the rosy cheeked boy vanished and why the rosy cheeked Tom Hanks type ended up in their living room so they call in a kidnapping and the cops show to pick up the trail. The only person who knows Josh's true identity is his still 13 year old friend Billy, an obnoxious boy with poor judgment.You know, the Lindsay Lohan type&#x85; 'what she's in her 20s!'.Now expected to be a contributing member of society even though he still wants to play with toys, collect baseball cards and peek at girls (even when he hasn't the first idea what to do with them), Josh moves to New York and takes a room at a seedy inner city hotel. But staying there long enough to track down the Zoltar machine requires money, so Josh gets a job at&#x85; a toy store. Awesome. Though it must be said it is in the IT department not the actual store.Once in New York and getting' paid Josh indulges in the things every teen would when given incredible riches &#x96; $187! &#x96; pizza, toys and novelties. His 'youthful' exuberance and upbeat attitude bring him to the attention of several in his new workplace, the boss (Robert Loggia), the aggressive businesswoman with aspirations of climbing the ladder Susan (Elizabeth Perkins) and her male counterpart and current squeeze Paul (John Heard). (Also worthy of note is a brief role played with smarmy brilliance by the hilarious John Lovitz, who only wants Josh to slow down so he doesn't have to try harder.) Of course Josh is promoted to some sort of executive role as a 'toy tester and developer', a role that he is uniquely suited to and attacks with gusto. His newfound promotion is accompanied by a new bigger salary &#x96; Josh moves into a plush apartment furnished with décor a kid would choose if they had Dakota Fanning's change purse &#x96; and more attention from Susan.Now a little more content and settled into this 'easy being an adult' thing, Josh seems to forget his recent past, including Billy and his family.Will he forego his teens and twenties and fast-track his way to middle age, or will he find a way back to his bunk bed and pet hamster? Hanks' performance carries the film, you can really believe at times that he is a trapped kid, and there are frequent reminders of his 12-ness in any case that are both charming and hilarious &#x96; a scene in the toy store between Josh and the boss stands out instantly.The new extended cut includes a heap of previously unseen stuff that I think was wisely cut, mainly depressing and negative things that would bring what should remain a buoyant film down. Let's just say there are enough examples of how hard it is to be a young boy trapped in an adult world without being shown that Billy grew up in an abusive household&#x85; There are funnier films from the 80s (Coming to America), there are more memorable comedies from the 80s (Back to the Future, ET) but there are no films more charming and likable from the 80s.

I'm not going to tell everyone it doesn't have its flaws- I can picture Crowe sitting there and smiling to himself after writing You had me at hello- but this is anything but a bad film. Jerry Maguire features an unusual central romance, with Cruise and Zellweger's characters getting together more out of convenience than love (on his part anyway). The relationship is handled with maturity and honesty by all involved. Cruise is terrific throughout the whole film but it is his moments with Zellweger and her character's son where he truly shines. Zellweger herself, oft maligned, also puts in a great performance and in my opinion she has never looked lovelier. But it is the relationship between Cruise's Maguire and Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr's Rod Tidwell that is the film's real selling point. It's a relationship built on loyalty, trust and friendship. The film has its twists and turns (and it is too long) but it is the bond between agent and star that keeps the film afloat and ultimately gives it a happy ending.Oscar Note I don't know what the reaction was like at the time but popular opinion nowadays is that Gooding didn't deserve the Oscar. Bill Macy and Ed Norton are often cited as being robbed, and I can't deny that they were excellent in their respective roles, but I believe Gooding to be more than worthy.

The film has its twists and turns (and it is too long) but it is the bond between agent and star that keeps the film afloat and ultimately gives it a happy ending.Oscar Note I don't know what the reaction was like at the time but popular opinion nowadays is that Gooding didn't deserve the Oscar. Bill Macy and Ed Norton are often cited as being robbed, and I can't deny that they were excellent in their respective roles, but I believe Gooding to be more than worthy. You'd be hard pressed to find a more electric, entertaining and effective performance in any film.

I wasn't feeling very well and couldn't sleep. As I recall my mother recommended this film. I was not into slow moving dramas but because I was a pre-adolescent male I developed a quick crush on Patty McCormack. She is so cute and proper. How could you not just want to hold her? But then the plot unfolds and your preconceptions of this cutie are ripped away. She is so evil. I hated that she made me fall for her and then shredded my reality. I knew this was 'just a movie' but she was so good in the role that I lost myself in the illusion. And then that ending came. Wow! I didn't like that at all. I was very upset and my mother could see that. She tried to engage me in conversation but I declined and went to go lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. I didn't sleep that night. I was haunted forever. When the movie was repeated later that year I declined to watch it. I couldn't take that trip again. Many years later, more like decades, I watched it again. Some of those old memories came back but I could distance them. This film is really quite a gem. For me, it has lost nothing of the disturbing quality - which is entirely its whole intention. Patty is still cute as the dickens --- and then she kills. The shell of very grim despair covers this film. None of the characters are flawless though and I ended up with a new perspective that the little girl ended up being a product of the dysfunctional environment. It's a bit of a difficult film to categorize. Is it horror? I was horrified. But compared to today's definition of horror it doesn't quite gel. It is definitely a stage drama but keeps waltzing out of generic drama every time it creeps back into horror. It most assuredly plays on the psychological. Hey, I might actually know someone like this -- and I'm not talking about ONLY the little girl here. Even today I do not think this is something I would invite just anyone to watch. It will disturb younger kids and even some adults. I would think most teenagers would not have the patience to sit through this. It has been compared to Hitchcock in some aspects, but I usually have a good time with Alfred. It is a disagreeable film. It is not fun. But it is powerful and has continued to concern me for over 40 years. The last film to do this for me was Lynch's Blue Velvet - but he didn't have any cute little girls in that.

Yes, the dialogue is often laughable but I think Verhoeven's having the last laugh &#x96; he intended his film to turn out this way. Whatever problems it has, SHOWGIRLS is an entertaining film &#x96; just like the rest of Verhoeven's canon.

Supposedly Herman Melville's masterpiece novel was completely impossible to turn into a film script. Supposedly director John Huston was too tyrannical and stubborn during the filming of Moby Dick and spent a lot more time and budget than he was allowed to. Supposedly none of the actors playing the most crucial roles deliver good performances and don't bring any justice to their characters as described in the book. These are just a few of the coarse criticisms I've encountered on the movie Moby Dick, but let me immediately assure you that this is all sheer nonsense coming from sour people that simply cannot accept that classic books sometimes CAN be turned into classic movies. Right from the phenomenal opening sequences, when narrator Richard Basemark appears over a hill, addresses to the camera to say Call me Ishmael and then wanders onwards towards a little seaside town called New Bedford, you just know that this will be a masterful and continuously captivating motion picture with stunning photography, an intelligent screenplay and dialogs that almost resemble poetry. The story of Moby Dick is already widely known, I presume. The adventurous Ishmael and his newly found friend Queequeg sign to board a whaling ship named Pequod, of which the commander is the infamous, feared and heavily traumatized Captain Ahab. There's good fortune to make in trading whale oil, but Captain Ahab also has a different reason to sail the Pequod around the world with all of its crew members on board. Ahab is hunting down a humongous and devilish white whale named Moby Dick. This insatiably monstrous whale was already responsible for the loss of Captain Ahab's leg and he has since then developed a deep hatred towards the animal. So deep that his only last remaining mission in life is to kill the whale, even if that means sacrificing the ship, his own life and that of his crew members. The first mate Starbuck still attempts to revolt against the self-destructiveness of the Captain, but Ahab is so charismatic and powerful that the entire crew blindly follows him in his personal vendetta. Moby Dick is a landmark of a film, as far as yours truly is concerned, and there are countless of sequences that qualify as genuinely brilliant and unforgettable. The entire intro, for example, where Ishmael is subjected to a bizarre kind of initiation ritual in the small New Bradford pub where all sailors and whale hunters gather to drink and sing songs about the sea. Or the truly fantastic cameo appearance of Orson Welles, who portrays a local priest and recites the biblical story of Jonah from a church-throne shaped like a ship! That speech was so mesmerizing that I looked up the actual Jonah story on Wikipedia! If Orson Welles had taught religion class back when I was in school, I definitely would have paid more attention. Once the Pequod has left the New England harbor, the film is simply a never-ending series of exciting action sequences (the whale hunting footage! The typhoon!), although with plenty of psychological interludes and truly baffling monologues and dialogs from the main protagonists. In spite of the often heard comment in the first paragraph, I personally thought that Gregory Peck gave a staggering performance as the robust and obsessive Captain Ahab. Admittedly he looks a bit young for the role, especially when he mentions at one point that he has been sailing around the world for over forty years, but his facial expressions and angry charisma are as good as genuine. The supportive performances in Moby Dick are all impeccable, notably Leo Genn as the deeply religious and concerned first mate Starbuck (the ideal character to name a chain of successful coffee shops after!) and Harry Andrews as the boisterous but always enthusiast second mate Stubb. The fake whales and special effects are very impressive, especially considering the period of release, the colors and photography are dream-like and John Huston's direction is righteously surefooted and tight.

Given these criteria, it's hard to imagine a 50s sci-fi film better than Forbidden Planet. From the moment you see the C-57D cross your screen, you know that this is not your typical B-movie flying saucer dangling from a string.Forbidden Planet is visually striking in fact, it's nothing short of astounding, given the constraints of the time. Of course they were backed by MGM dollars and an intention to make a real movie, not just Saturday matinée fare, but still, the scope of the visuals here is breathtaking. Watch the scene in the belly of the Krell machines. Or the C57\u2032s crew fighting the invisible yet illuminated ID monster. The melting of the white hot laboratory door. These scenes could hardly be done any better today even with the use of CGI. Beyond the quality of the effects, this film is the absolute epitome of mid-century Populux futurism. Gorgeous cantilevered structures, boomerang furniture and radiating disks. And Robbie the Robot what can I say about Robbie? He is simply the coolest robot that has ever been conjured on film or paper.The story is based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, though how closely it parallels, I really can't say. The character of Morbius, played by Walter Pidgeon, is certainly Shakespearean, given the highs and lows of his accomplishments and tragedy. A young, and not very comedic Leslie Nielsen, plays Commander J. J. Adams, captain of the C-57D. He and his crew have been dispatched to check on a deep space colony on Altair IV which hasn't been heard from in years. Adams and his shipmates (including Doc Ostrow, played by veteran character actor Warren Stevens) discover that the only remaining members of the colony are Dr. Morbius and his daughter Altaira, played by heavenly sprite, Anne Francis. Without getting too deep into the plot, things get complicated when a crewman is murdered and secrets of the planet's ancient but extinct civilization come to light.The acting isn't particularly strong, with the exception of Walter Pidgeon, who always captivates me. The story more than compensates, and has me riveted every time I watch. The last forty minutes of the film are particularly suspenseful.The soundtrack deserves an honorable mention as well.

It started with a question whats so special about this movie to top IMDb. It ended with much than just an answer. It made me get up from my bed, start my notebook and share my happiness with you all. I have never done this before. To acclaim the screenplay, acting, direction would need more than just words of English dictionary.

OK then. Believe it or not, despite missteps, this adaptation mostly works and will finally interest teenagers in Shakespeare which certainly isn't a bad thing. It's better than Gnomeo and Juliet Thankfully! Baz Luhrmann makes the film visually stunning, and manages to fill it with gripping action scenes and touching romantic moments. A mixture of a music video, teen romance, gritty urban drama and Shakespeare, this will be a bit jarring to many (Myself included) but the ambition of the movie is to be admired. Claire Danes is OK but a bit annoying, while Leonardo DiCaprio owns the movie. The cinematography is stunning, and the film never stops being lovely to look at.It's not perfect though. Elements of the play such as the scene where Lord Capulet is angry with Juliet and Romeo and Mecrutio's friendship are poorly handled, and the endless visual dazzle, beautiful as it is, can send the film into style over substance territory. The presentation of Romeo and Juliet and other things in the play is beautifully updated for modern audiences and while the repeated action scenes can leave drama in the sidelines, the tragic ending still has a lot of emotional punch. It's not the best Shakespeare movie of all time, but I can't dislike an urban drama which still channels Shakespeare so effectively.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2011","score":"","review":" Romeo and Juliet set in a modern day urban environment with modern updates to all of the events but still with the original dialogue.

(A couple examples I'll search hither, you thither and Let's tarry not!) It also tries in vain to give credibility to the film, justifying some of the more silly stuff to come.With the costume budget already blown the Warlock escapes to 1988 via some magical portal or something, somehow dragging Redferne along with him to Los Angeles. Why not Boston? Why LA? Well that's where they make movies silly! The Warlock has been charged with the task of finding the three missing parts of the Devil's Bible which are conveniently all located in America. By Devil's Bible contains various nasty spells and secrets, and by re-combining the three parts the Warlock can learn the true name of God and as a result can un-make existence.This is bad for us, but apparently good for the Devil and the Warlock, who gets a promotion if he is successful, and will be recognised as the Devil's son.The first stop on the Warlock's round trip of evil finds him visiting Kassandra with a K (Lori Singer) and her gay flatmate.Kassandra is one of those cinematic reminders that hearkens to a time when every actress didn't actually have a tit job or major plastic surgery (sorry Lori, just the facts). After the Warlocks visits pausing only to suck the tongue out of the gay roommate and to put a spell on Kassandra that ages her 20 years every 24 hours off he goes. Of course Redferne shows up shortly afterwards &#x96; still rocking the 1600s togs &#x96; and using a witch-locating sat-nav device he sets off on the trail of the Warlock with Kassandra in tow desperate to get her 20 years back. (She wasn't that hot to begin with, it wasn't the 20 years that was holding her back.) The ensuing chase is pretty straightforward; a visit to Amish country alerts the Warlock to the pursuit, and then it's on to Boston for the finale which takes place in a graveyard.Richard E Grant does his best with a role that requires him to spout ludicrous dialogue in an earnest fashion, Kassandra is essentially supposed 'comic relief' and a counterpoint to the serious business (in theory anyway) going on around her.Julian Sands fares a little better, he is creepy at the best of times. He also doesn't have as many inane lines and gets to do hammy Warlock stuff that basically consists of pointing at things, squinting and pursing his lips while he waits for the shonky (even for the 80s!) special effects to kick in. And where else do you get to have a convo with a young boy before cutting away to reveal that you have not only killed the boy but plan to drink his boiled body fat to give you the gift of flight! It turns out that in this case it isn't just Red Bull that gives Warlock's wings! Warlock is actually worth a look if only for the fact that they never take it all too seriously &#x96; whether they thought that at the time I am not sure &#x96; it is basically a chase movie used as an excuse to show some Warlock-ey stuff, with a couple of British guys speaking British-ly as they chase each other all over the America countryside. If nothing else it's better than 10,000 Twilights.But so are a lot of things.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 \/ 10.
