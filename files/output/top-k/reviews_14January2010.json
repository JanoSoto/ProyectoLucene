I always thought it was criminally underrated as well. Now let me just state, I did enjoy Bean's Holiday quite a bit, but I was kinda disappointed with it, considering it's suppose to be the last of Bean. Yes it still has too many adapted scenes, from his T.V show, but what I enjoyed about this movie, was the movie itself. Bean is a little different in this one. He's not quite as mean-spirited as he is in the t.v show, in fact he has a big heart, which we rarely see in his t.v show. What really makes a lot of the movie is Rowan&Peter MacNicol's chemistry, together. Rowan of course is the goofy one, with Peter playing the straight man. They play off one another so wonderfully, and give many hilarious moments together. Some may have disliked the changes to having Bean speak a bit in this film, and while they do have a point, I thought it added a little bit of spark to the film, it was different, and gave the film laughs. With so much vulgar comedies out now a days, Bean is a refreshing change of pace.There are a few vulgar moments, but it's all good-natured. The funniest of the scenes in my opinion, had to be when Bean goes to turn the taps on, and splashes water on his pants, to where it looks like he's Peed himself. I won't spoil the rest, but rest assured, it's a screamer. What I also enjoyed more about Bean, then Bean's Holiday was it's much more like the t.v show, then the sequel was. Bean's Holiday never really felt like Bean, besides Bean had the most important ingredient in the ending, we got to see Teddy!. Bean is light-hearted, with great slapstick all around. I'll take anything of Bean I can get, which is why I enjoyed Bean's holiday, more than I should have.Performances. Rowan Atkinson is terrific as Bean. He's added another pro to his Bean shtick, speaking!. I thought having him speak, would ruin a lot of the experience. Thankfully it gave the film a lot of laughs. Peter MacNicol is a very multi talented person. Here he plays a wonderful straight man, with some of the film's funniest lines. He was just as big a key as Rowan was. Pamela Reed does fine with what she had to do as the wife. Burt Reynolds has a hilarious cameo, as the general. Andrew Lawrence is actually decent as Kevin. As I have stated in many review, I hate kid actors, but he was rather likable. Harris Yulin is a likable character actor. Here he is great as Mr.Grierson. Tricia Vessey is highly unlikable as Jennifer. I found it very hard to garner any sympathy from her. Richard Gant is hilarious as the detective, and stole many of the scenes he was in. Sandra Oh and Larry Drake have small roles.Bottom Line. Bean is the perfect family entertainment. Fellow Bean fanatics will find much to enjoy, and people who aren't too familiar with Bean's humor, this would probably be a good starting point for you. Highly recommended.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2010","score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I have always enjoyed Bean.

Robert De Niro teams up with director Tony Scott and Wesley Snipes to make one good thriller. Even though The Fan can't compare with the likes of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance and Top Gun, it is a still a promising thriller with some pretty big flaws. It is not a masterpiece and nor will it ever be but will be remembered as a movie that tried but could not reach the finish line. The critics were very harsh on this film but that's what they are born to do, criticize on every single piece of work. Five point six is too low for a film like the fan, a six point two would have been more like it. The end is clichéd and ruins the whole point of the film. The movie is predictable yet entertains you a little bit to stop you from taking the disc out. If you are a thriller lover then this movie is no disappointment because it will entertain you. The violence is limited and that's is a good thing but language is high.(MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!!!)Number one fan Gil Renard whose obsession is focused on a San Francisco Giants all-star outfielder Booby Rayburn. While the newly signed baseball star is having trouble getting his favorite uniform number from a competitive teammate Juan Primo, Gil is having career troubles at the knife company that his father founded, and people can bet that his proximity to high-quality stainless-steel blades will be a factor in the suspenseful plot. Gil confronts Primo in a sauna and explains to the ballplayer that he believes Rayburn's decline in play is directly the result of Primo's competitiveness, since Rayburn took over Primo's spot at center field, but did not let him use his lucky number of 11 on his jersey.

Quite a while before watching either film, I knew they were both very popular spoof movies from Mel Brooks, and were released the same year, over a decade before I was born. Brooks' spoof of 1930's Universal horror movies came into theatres in late 1974, and this western spoof of his came into theatres early that year. These were apparently his two most successful films. Young Frankenstein is an excellent flick, and after watching it, I may have expected to like its direct predecessor more than I did. The 30's Universal horror spoof is the stronger of the two, but this one is still good.In 1874, a new railroad is under construction in the Old West, and it eventually turns out that quicksand is in its way. Because of this, the construction must be taken in a different direction, and an evil state procurer named Hedley Lamarr plans to have it built through an area of land where a town called Rock Ridge currently stands, where everybody's surname is Johnson! First, he will have to find a way to drive all the townspeople out, so he sends in a group of henchmen to raid the town! After the sheriff of Rock Ridge is killed, the residents demand that Governor William J. LePetomane send them a new one. Hedley then gets an idea. He convinces the governor to appoint Bart, a black convict, as the new sheriff of the town, another scheme to try and get all the townspeople (all white) to leave. So, Bart rides into town and is obviously not welcomed by the town's racist residents. With the help of a town alcoholic named Jim (a.k.a. the Waco Kid), the new sheriff tries to win over the townspeople, while Hedley continues his attempts to bring down Rock Ridge! With a white worker named Lyle on the railroad trying to get the black workers to sing a spiritual song, the quicksand scene, and finally the tell them I said 'ow' gag, this spoof begins well. Occasionally, there are some pretty lame gags, such as the elderly woman being punched repeatedly by intruders, and cowboys sitting around a fire, eating beans, and farting. I also felt like I should have found a medieval executioner in the Wild West funnier than I did. However, most of the film is pretty funny, sometimes hilarious, and other highlights include the meeting in the church after the raid, Mel Brooks himself as the idiotic sex-crazed Governor William J. LePetomane (with the meeting adjourned gag and such), Bart's escape from gunpoint, Gene Wilder's first scene as Jim, and Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp. As usual, there are too many to mention. The first scene with Mongo is kind of annoying, and it seems like this character will really hurt the film, but fortunately, this quickly changes, as Mongo has some really funny scenes as well. The movie gets surprising towards the end, but in a good way.This hit 70's comedy from a renowned parody filmmaker may be slightly overrated, and too silly and crude for some viewers, but for the most part, I can understand its wide appeal. It's sometimes too silly and juvenile even for me, and may have been ahead of its time in that regard, but it doesn't get like this often enough to ruin it. I strongly suggest you don't watch Blazing Saddles if you can't take filth, political incorrectness, irreverence and immaturity in comedy, though far more shocking and raunchy comedies have been made in more recent years. However, if you like lunacy and edginess in your comedy, can take risqué humour, and are in the mood for some good laughs and a clever parody, this could easily be right up your alley. It's not the best spoof movie ever made, but Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have done SO much worse in the past several years, and I shouldn't even be comparing them!

It's sometimes too silly and juvenile even for me, and may have been ahead of its time in that regard, but it doesn't get like this often enough to ruin it. I strongly suggest you don't watch Blazing Saddles if you can't take filth, political incorrectness, irreverence and immaturity in comedy, though far more shocking and raunchy comedies have been made in more recent years. However, if you like lunacy and edginess in your comedy, can take risqué humour, and are in the mood for some good laughs and a clever parody, this could easily be right up your alley. It's not the best spoof movie ever made, but Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have done SO much worse in the past several years, and I shouldn't even be comparing them!

Quite a while before watching either film, I knew they were both very popular spoof movies from Mel Brooks, and were released the same year, over a decade before I was born. Brooks' spoof of 1930's Universal horror movies came into theatres in late 1974, and this western spoof of his came into theatres early that year. These were apparently his two most successful films. Young Frankenstein is an excellent flick, and after watching it, I may have expected to like its direct predecessor more than I did. The 30's Universal horror spoof is the stronger of the two, but this one is still good.In 1874, a new railroad is under construction in the Old West, and it eventually turns out that quicksand is in its way. Because of this, the construction must be taken in a different direction, and an evil state procurer named Hedley Lamarr plans to have it built through an area of land where a town called Rock Ridge currently stands, where everybody's surname is Johnson! First, he will have to find a way to drive all the townspeople out, so he sends in a group of henchmen to raid the town! After the sheriff of Rock Ridge is killed, the residents demand that Governor William J. LePetomane send them a new one. Hedley then gets an idea. He convinces the governor to appoint Bart, a black convict, as the new sheriff of the town, another scheme to try and get all the townspeople (all white) to leave. So, Bart rides into town and is obviously not welcomed by the town's racist residents. With the help of a town alcoholic named Jim (a.k.a. the Waco Kid), the new sheriff tries to win over the townspeople, while Hedley continues his attempts to bring down Rock Ridge! With a white worker named Lyle on the railroad trying to get the black workers to sing a spiritual song, the quicksand scene, and finally the tell them I said 'ow' gag, this spoof begins well. Occasionally, there are some pretty lame gags, such as the elderly woman being punched repeatedly by intruders, and cowboys sitting around a fire, eating beans, and farting. I also felt like I should have found a medieval executioner in the Wild West funnier than I did. However, most of the film is pretty funny, sometimes hilarious, and other highlights include the meeting in the church after the raid, Mel Brooks himself as the idiotic sex-crazed Governor William J. LePetomane (with the meeting adjourned gag and such), Bart's escape from gunpoint, Gene Wilder's first scene as Jim, and Madeline Kahn as Lili Von Shtupp. As usual, there are too many to mention. The first scene with Mongo is kind of annoying, and it seems like this character will really hurt the film, but fortunately, this quickly changes, as Mongo has some really funny scenes as well. The movie gets surprising towards the end, but in a good way.This hit 70's comedy from a renowned parody filmmaker may be slightly overrated, and too silly and crude for some viewers, but for the most part, I can understand its wide appeal.

First, because unlike many documentaries, this one provoked action. People saw this film where Morris was trying to make positive social change...and WHAM, it happened! This is something almost all other documentaries cannot hope to achieve. Because of this film, a wrongly convicted man was released from prison. Second, like MR. DEATH, this film was a major improvement over many of his earlier films because it kept a very tight focus. The subject matter was clear and the film was a logical presentation of the facts.

Sean Connery reprises the role of 007 and Terrance Young would again handle directorial duties.The plot involves an attempt by S.P.E.C.T.R.E, the criminal organisation Bond's previous adversary Dr. No was affiliated with, to steal a Russian decoding machine by playing the East and the West against each other. A beautiful Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova, played by the lovely Daniela Bianchi, is unwittingly used by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in order to lure Bond into the trap of having him steal the devise so that they can steal it from him.From Russia With Love is first and foremost a spy thriller. Almost none of the clichés that riddle later instalments, and indeed the previous one, are to be found here. The villain does not reside in some extravagant lair and there is no easily-escapable-death-trap into which Bond is placed. Instead, for the most part, we have villains who are human rather than cartoony and sets which while impressive are not overly grand. Blofeld makes his first appearance here, although you never see his face, and it is rather hard not to have a little chuckle at the cat stroking mastermind with the hindsight of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers but you can hardly blame From Russia With Love for being spoofed later down the line. The plot is reasonably complex and is not just an excuse to move from one action scene to another. In fact, upon re-watching the early Bond films recently I was surprised to see how little action there is. Cleary the series started out as a somewhat reasonable attempt at being serious, even though there are quips and laughs to be found, and From Russia With Love is the best example of this. The action that is delivered includes a well executed gun battle at a gypsy camp and a North By Northwest inspired helicopter attack.Much of the film takes place in Istanbul and is set at night or within buildings, which makes a stark contrast to the bright and breezy Jamaica setting of Dr. No. The third act, however, sees Bond and Tania travelling on the Orient Express whilst being stalked by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent Red Grant, played to perfection by Robert Shaw. He is a hulking monster of a man and when he and Bond come to blows it is one of the few times in the series you genuinely feel 007 could be in danger. Grant is a great henchman and is one of the more memorable Bond baddies, even without having a somewhat silly characteristic such as metal teeth or throwing a bowler hat to make him stick in the audiences mind. As previously mentioned, he and Bond have a great fight aboard the Orient Express and it is easily one of the best fight scenes in cinema history. Watching this scene is a refreshing reminder that Bond was indeed brutal a long time before Daniel Craig put on the tuxedo. The entire build up to the fight is a master class in creating tension and showcases acting, directing and editing at its finest. This is not just good for a Bond film, it's good, no scratch that, GREAT, for any film. Much of this has to do with the inspired and somewhat groundbreaking editing techniques employed by Peter Hunt and it is no coincidence that Hunt's turn as directing Bond, with On Her Majesty's Secret Service, also has some of the best and most brutal punch ups of the series.Having a great supporting cast is essential to a film of this nature. With much of the dialogue consisting of exposition you need actors who can pull it off without boring the audience and From Russia With Love is no exception. From Pedro Armendáriz, who plays Bond's contact Kerim Bey in Istanbul, to Rosa Klebb, the slimy SMERSH defector who is brilliantly played by Lotte Lenya the film is full of wonderful performances. Daniela Bianchi also does a great job in her role and although saddled with some of the usual 'silly woman' dialogue the Bond films have in abundance, she manages to stand out from the crowd as one of the more memorable Bond girls. This film also marks the first appearance of Desmond Llwellyn as Major Boothroyd AKA 'Q', replacing Peter Burton from Dr. No.The opening titles are really the only bone I have to pick with the movie. Surprisingly, considering the high calibre of the rest of the film, I really don't like From Russia With Love's titles at all. The idea of projecting the credits onto the bodies of belly dancers may have sounded good in the board room but it just looks rather cheap on the screen.I cannot recommend this film highly enough, to anybody from thriller fans to the connoisseur of classic cinema, From Russia With Love is about as good as it gets in all categories. As entertaining as they are I urge you to forget about the jet packs, invisible cars, spaceships, piranhas, ski chases and underwater lairs of later instalments and treat yourself to a solid spy adventure which proves that Bond doesn't need gadgets and gimmicks to be the best screen spy in the world, he just is.

This fact almost destroys Four Rooms, an anthology seemingly organized by Tarantino picking some of his favourite up-and-comers of his generation at the time. Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell has since faded into obscurity, but two of the directors on the bill, El Mariachi's Robert Rodriguez and the man himself, Quentin Tarantino, are now two of my personal favourite working directors. Four Rooms has too many weaknesses to fully recommend, but the final two segments almost fully redeem it.The stories are mostly unconnected, save the presence of Tim Roth's Ted the bellhop character. As such, each segment should be reviewed individually.The movie opens with Anders' The Missing Ingredient. A coven of witches convene in the honeymoon suite with a cauldron and nudity at their disposal, attempting to revive a fallen comrade. When one of them fails to obtain their sacrifice of semen, she must get it from the only man in sight...the bellhop.This segment is by all means godawful. The only good thing I can even say about it is that it makes the next one look good in comparison. Ione Sky as the main witch has that girl-next-door look to her essential to her role, and is perhaps the only good thing about the segment. Madonna has a nothing role with an annoying goth daughter, who seems like she should have had a more important role but is instead throwaway. Of the other witches, only Lili Taylor is memorable in any way. The effects used are right out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and don't fit at all with the rest of the film. If you ignore this segment, the movie is likely all the better for it.Rockwell's piece, The Wrong Man, has a very interesting setup, but fails to be consistent. Ted is given the wrong room number to deliver ice to, and ends up in the hands a gun-toting jealous husband (an excellent David Proval), who has his wife gagged up and is smoking out the man named Theodore she's been sleeping with.The segment definitely has its moments, such as Ted yelling for help out of a bathroom window or Proval's gun-waving antics, but it digresses a little too much. A heart attack twist at the end is a major groaner, and Tim Roth hams it up far too much in his role here. The music is also quite horribly used. Not nearly as bad as the first part, but The Wrong Man doesn't add much to the movie.The saving grace comes in Rodriguez's The Misbehavers, the direct precursor to Spy Kids. A smooth Spanish thug (a hilarious Antonio Banderas) wishes to attend a party with his wife, and pays Ted $500 to keep an eye on his children and make sure they don't misbehave. Through Vapo-Rub and dead bodies, of all things, Ted has his work cut out for him.The Misbehavers is actually the high point of the entire film. The ending is simply hilarious, the setup is very well detailed. And, unlike the cleaner Spy Kids movies, its pretty damn dark. Banderas is absolutely excellent, as are the children.This leads to the final story, Tarantino's The Man from Hollywood. Fed up with the crazy night, Ted calls his boss and complains that he's quitting. A call comes in from the penthouse, and he is convinced by her that he must fill their request, as an important customer from Hollywood is staying there. Ted caves and finds himself in the middle of one of the most eccentric bets straight out of Hitchcock.While not as memorable as The Misbehavors, Tarantino's bit is very entertaining. It has that traditional Tarantino swagger. Tarantino himself plays the man from Hollywood, making the dialogue a little more annoying but at the same time all the more stylish. Marisa Tomei is excellent in her short role. And Bruce Willis has a cameo. Whats not the love? The ending is simply amazing as well.The only thing left to address is Tim Roth, the most uneven part of the whole picture. As the only character in all stories, being under four different directors must be difficult to maintain consistency. As such, Tim Roth gives us two horrible performances (The Missing Ingredient and The Wrong Man), one brilliant one (The Misbehavors) and one very strong one (Man from Hollywood). While his 50s-sitcom performance in Missing Ingredient fits in with the general badness of that segment, his performance is arguably the worst part of The Wrong Man. His timing in The Misbehavors is the stuff of legend, as is his role at the end of Man from Hollywood.If you switch on halfway through, Four Rooms is a delightful little hodgepodge movie. Its a shame two poor segments distract from that. For simplicity, here's all four rated individuallyThe Missing Ingredient 10% The Wrong Man 30% The Misbehavors 90% The Man from Hollywood 85%At least you leave it feeling good, despite sitting through some drudge at first.

While his 50s-sitcom performance in Missing Ingredient fits in with the general badness of that segment, his performance is arguably the worst part of The Wrong Man. His timing in The Misbehavors is the stuff of legend, as is his role at the end of Man from Hollywood.If you switch on halfway through, Four Rooms is a delightful little hodgepodge movie. Its a shame two poor segments distract from that. For simplicity, here's all four rated individuallyThe Missing Ingredient 10% The Wrong Man 30% The Misbehavors 90% The Man from Hollywood 85%At least you leave it feeling good, despite sitting through some drudge at first. ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"14 January 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Short story anthologies can often suffer from being only as strong as their weakest link. This fact almost destroys Four Rooms, an anthology seemingly organized by Tarantino picking some of his favourite up-and-comers of his generation at the time. Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell has since faded into obscurity, but two of the directors on the bill, El Mariachi's Robert Rodriguez and the man himself, Quentin Tarantino, are now two of my personal favourite working directors. Four Rooms has too many weaknesses to fully recommend, but the final two segments almost fully redeem it.The stories are mostly unconnected, save the presence of Tim Roth's Ted the bellhop character. As such, each segment should be reviewed individually.The movie opens with Anders' The Missing Ingredient. A coven of witches convene in the honeymoon suite with a cauldron and nudity at their disposal, attempting to revive a fallen comrade. When one of them fails to obtain their sacrifice of semen, she must get it from the only man in sight...the bellhop.This segment is by all means godawful. The only good thing I can even say about it is that it makes the next one look good in comparison. Ione Sky as the main witch has that girl-next-door look to her essential to her role, and is perhaps the only good thing about the segment. Madonna has a nothing role with an annoying goth daughter, who seems like she should have had a more important role but is instead throwaway. Of the other witches, only Lili Taylor is memorable in any way. The effects used are right out of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and don't fit at all with the rest of the film. If you ignore this segment, the movie is likely all the better for it.Rockwell's piece, The Wrong Man, has a very interesting setup, but fails to be consistent. Ted is given the wrong room number to deliver ice to, and ends up in the hands a gun-toting jealous husband (an excellent David Proval), who has his wife gagged up and is smoking out the man named Theodore she's been sleeping with.The segment definitely has its moments, such as Ted yelling for help out of a bathroom window or Proval's gun-waving antics, but it digresses a little too much. A heart attack twist at the end is a major groaner, and Tim Roth hams it up far too much in his role here. The music is also quite horribly used. Not nearly as bad as the first part, but The Wrong Man doesn't add much to the movie.The saving grace comes in Rodriguez's The Misbehavers, the direct precursor to Spy Kids. A smooth Spanish thug (a hilarious Antonio Banderas) wishes to attend a party with his wife, and pays Ted $500 to keep an eye on his children and make sure they don't misbehave. Through Vapo-Rub and dead bodies, of all things, Ted has his work cut out for him.The Misbehavers is actually the high point of the entire film. The ending is simply hilarious, the setup is very well detailed. And, unlike the cleaner Spy Kids movies, its pretty damn dark. Banderas is absolutely excellent, as are the children.This leads to the final story, Tarantino's The Man from Hollywood. Fed up with the crazy night, Ted calls his boss and complains that he's quitting. A call comes in from the penthouse, and he is convinced by her that he must fill their request, as an important customer from Hollywood is staying there. Ted caves and finds himself in the middle of one of the most eccentric bets straight out of Hitchcock.While not as memorable as The Misbehavors, Tarantino's bit is very entertaining. It has that traditional Tarantino swagger. Tarantino himself plays the man from Hollywood, making the dialogue a little more annoying but at the same time all the more stylish. Marisa Tomei is excellent in her short role. And Bruce Willis has a cameo. Whats not the love? The ending is simply amazing as well.The only thing left to address is Tim Roth, the most uneven part of the whole picture.

It's a good thing that Jamie Lee Curtis returned, but the best they could do with her was put her in a robe and have her run and scream all the time. Talk about waste of talent. One thing I did like however was how the setting was changed to a hospital, which I think was a pretty smart move. Michael Myers wading through those long, white corridors, it just looks right. Perhaps he gets too much exposure this time around, but that didn't really bother me much. Another thing I liked was the climax, which really should have ended it once and for all. How dead does a villain need to be to not resurrect? Anyway, this isn't the worst sequel, but probably not the best either.
