He brings about a style that is completely of his own, and the lasting effect can still be seen today in modern day Halloween costumes, or horror related hoopla. The shots are done wonderfully, they are dark and scary, giving the audience a true sense of horror. I think that its important to pay attention to minor details such as sound and lighting in a film such as this. Those little details bring together the whole picture for the audience, and create a true sense of what is trying to be portrayed. This film certainly gambled with its special effects and paved the way for many many years of horror movies to be made its its image. People enjoy being scared, they enjoy the excitement that comes along with it. A lot of time and dedication and attention to detail has to all come together on behalf of the crew and actors to create the magic.

The challenging roles he takes on put his abilities to the test every time, but every time he pulls out one of the most incredible performances any of us could ever imagine. Such is the case of My Left Foot, the film for which he won his first Oscar. My Left Foot is the story of Irish author and artist Christy Brown, who suffers from severe cerebral palsy. His condition is so bad that the only part of his body he can completely control is his left foot, hence the name of the film. The story follows his story from when he was a child misdiagnosed with mental retardation, to his adult life where he celebrates his talent but also struggles with the idea of acceptance into society because of his condition. Needless to say, it is a very powerful film.The amount of empathy evoked from the character of Christy Brown is uncanny. I could not feel more sorry for him at times in the film. The life he leads is extremely difficult, and not for conventional reasons like an abusive home life or neglect by society because of his condition. In fact, his family is actually very supportive of him throughout the movie and they care for him and love him. The artistic world accepts him despite his condition, and gives him plenty of honor and praise for what he has overcome to make art. Instead, what Christy struggles with is true acceptance as just a human being instead of a handicapped study of human integrity. His desire is to move past just platonic love and experience something more sincere and real in his life instead of people just accepting him because they feel they have to out of respect. Unfortunately it is difficult for Christy to communicate this clearly, both in a figurative and literal sense. He doesn't know how to appropriately communicate these feelings efficiently to people, but he also has a hard time saying anything because of his disease. That is one thing to keep in mind. You have to listen close to everything Christy says because if you just casually half listen it will all sound like mumbling. But back to my main point, it was this inner struggle that kept the character of Christy Brown both fascinating and extremely empathetic.I have the feeling that Daniel Day-Lewis' role in this film is one that will be talked about and studied for years to come. It is just every single definition of the world incredible. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding roles I've ever seen put on screen and Day-Lewis captures it all so perfectly. He is impressively consistent with his physical mannerisms which are very specific and very large, as it is the defining visual characteristic of Christy Brown. Through the movie, Christy's condition slowly improves with help of doctors and his family, so that made the character even more difficult to pull off, as he had to change his level of deficiency throughout the film. There is a very distinct difference in how badly the cerebral palsy affects Christy's speech and movement at different time periods in his life, and Day-Lewis pulled it off wonderfully. And so behind the physical tribulations necessary to make this portrayal work there was an incredible amount of mental characteristics to master as well. Behind the sad exterior of this character was a very complex and very human interior. The film makes a big point that Christy Brown was more human than so many other people, which is something hard to understand when looking at a man who is hardly self sufficient and can barely even talk right. But there is so much personal emotion behind the physical ailment that it required even more work for Day-Lewis. But miraculously he pulled it off and did a mind blowing job at it.My Left Foot is a great movie. It had so many fine elements to it, but nothing compared to Day-Lewis' portrayal of Christy Brown. This film was one of the more fascinating and compelling character studies I've seen, so I have to give it a lot of credit for really grabbing hold of my emotions and delivering to me an unforgettable experience.

He doesn't know how to appropriately communicate these feelings efficiently to people, but he also has a hard time saying anything because of his disease. That is one thing to keep in mind. You have to listen close to everything Christy says because if you just casually half listen it will all sound like mumbling. But back to my main point, it was this inner struggle that kept the character of Christy Brown both fascinating and extremely empathetic.I have the feeling that Daniel Day-Lewis' role in this film is one that will be talked about and studied for years to come. It is just every single definition of the world incredible. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding roles I've ever seen put on screen and Day-Lewis captures it all so perfectly. He is impressively consistent with his physical mannerisms which are very specific and very large, as it is the defining visual characteristic of Christy Brown. Through the movie, Christy's condition slowly improves with help of doctors and his family, so that made the character even more difficult to pull off, as he had to change his level of deficiency throughout the film. There is a very distinct difference in how badly the cerebral palsy affects Christy's speech and movement at different time periods in his life, and Day-Lewis pulled it off wonderfully. And so behind the physical tribulations necessary to make this portrayal work there was an incredible amount of mental characteristics to master as well. Behind the sad exterior of this character was a very complex and very human interior. The film makes a big point that Christy Brown was more human than so many other people, which is something hard to understand when looking at a man who is hardly self sufficient and can barely even talk right. But there is so much personal emotion behind the physical ailment that it required even more work for Day-Lewis. But miraculously he pulled it off and did a mind blowing job at it.My Left Foot is a great movie. It had so many fine elements to it, but nothing compared to Day-Lewis' portrayal of Christy Brown.

The challenging roles he takes on put his abilities to the test every time, but every time he pulls out one of the most incredible performances any of us could ever imagine. Such is the case of My Left Foot, the film for which he won his first Oscar. My Left Foot is the story of Irish author and artist Christy Brown, who suffers from severe cerebral palsy. His condition is so bad that the only part of his body he can completely control is his left foot, hence the name of the film. The story follows his story from when he was a child misdiagnosed with mental retardation, to his adult life where he celebrates his talent but also struggles with the idea of acceptance into society because of his condition. Needless to say, it is a very powerful film.The amount of empathy evoked from the character of Christy Brown is uncanny. I could not feel more sorry for him at times in the film. The life he leads is extremely difficult, and not for conventional reasons like an abusive home life or neglect by society because of his condition. In fact, his family is actually very supportive of him throughout the movie and they care for him and love him. The artistic world accepts him despite his condition, and gives him plenty of honor and praise for what he has overcome to make art. Instead, what Christy struggles with is true acceptance as just a human being instead of a handicapped study of human integrity. His desire is to move past just platonic love and experience something more sincere and real in his life instead of people just accepting him because they feel they have to out of respect. Unfortunately it is difficult for Christy to communicate this clearly, both in a figurative and literal sense.

I understand that the movie was suppose to representative of the time and the changes that were occurring in America. Although I like unpredictable movies,The ending to the movie really kind of disturbed me. To think peoples intolerance would result in senseless murders of people who did nothing to them. The most interesting scene would be when their high with a prostitute. The cameras flash quickly and their a lot of splices that were interesting enough to catch my attention. They do a great job of making you understand their on a lsd\/drug trip, kind of makes you feel disoriented, like you are in it. I would of liked to have seen a better sound track, I think it would of made the film more interesting. Having seen Dennis Hopper in some of his more recent films before his death, it was very interesting to a younger version. If my professor hadnt of pointed him out I think I would of missed him. My professor informed us that this one of the first films after the hayes code ended to explore subjects like they did. So that alone makes it an important film in my opinion.

If in many high school themed movies there's always a shy and lonely character who gets abused by everyone in the school and sometimes in the family we owe this characteristic to Carrie White, the main character played by Sissy Spacek. And if we sometimes identify with the tragedy of the character, with a possible chance for revenge the ones who are bad to us, you gotta recognize you have a part of Carrie inside of you. I don't know how Stephen King idealized this story or his motivations but all I can say is that it works, it scares yet it makes you look at life with a different perspective. Carrie had a hard religious education at home with her mother (Piper Laurie, excellent) that looks more the devil himself than a woman who preaches the Gospel. And the teenage girl doesn't know how to behave herself during classes at school, or even taking a shower when she finally had her first period (a scene meant to be more dramatically sad than scary, except for the music) and she gets mocked by her colleagues all the time. The film evolves into a dramatic story but there's a catch. In the middle of the drama we find out that Carrie has special powers, she can move or break objects with the power of her mind, and that's something she can't control quite right and no one knows she has this ability. I'll won't spoil more things, I'm gonna let you see for yourself, but by this time you can possibly know what's the horror in this story.I must admit I had a total dislike over this film when I watched a few years ago; now I understand why it's an effective and powerful film, and why it was relevant in 1976 and still is today. DePalma released Carrie on the same year of many great classics whose major themes were We're mad as hell and we're not gonna take this anymore!. Carrie White is no different than Howard Beale (Network), Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver), Rocky Balboa (Rocky) and the Woodstein team (All the President's Men). Strange mixing of films some might think but if you look back to all these characters and their struggle to challenge everything and everyone, is quite similar from one to another. In the scene where Carrie stood up and says to her mother that she'll go the prom with a boy for the first time in her life you can see the exactly same thing when Howard Beale shouted the most famous movie quote of that year. Gladly all these films were great, and were recognized with nominations and awards, and survived to tell how the American society felt at that time, and Carrie even while being a horror movie knew how to be a important piece of filmmaking.As I mentioned in the beginning most films today has some qualities and characteristics that appeared here for the first time and the way DePalma presented the story was excellent, including homages to his idol Hitchcock (the music by Pino Donaggio reminds some parts of Bernard Herrmann's theme in Psycho, and by the way Herrmann was the original composer of the music of the film but died a few months before the filming begin). Not only the music, but the editing is also great, and one of the most awaited moments is the prom night, there are thousand of things in that scene that keeps you thrilled all the time, no matter how many times you watch. And at last the great casting composed by Spacek, Laurie, John Travolta, Amy Irving, William Katt, Nancy Allen and Betty Buckley, all wonderful.

That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not.But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record.I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why Dick Steel was a handle I used - dropping the last e in Steele for more bite during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods.Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes!Like all comedic films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny.Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation.

However, so many of us have questions about what happens once the film ends.If I could describe this film to someone who has never seen it, I'd say that this film is the essence of the 80s. The original script was written by Louis Venosta. I met with Venosta myself, and asked if I could write the sequel. This was back in 2006, long before the RZA was involved or even mentioned a remake.If you have access to Youtube, please check out THE LAST DRAGON fan commentary, which was created by myself and a writing partner.Venosta did not intend for Leroy to be such a sensitive character. He envisioned more of a serious fighter. Berry Gordy is the person who is actually responsible for the humor, and the sensitive character that is possessed by the protagonist, Bruce Leroy.The actor who played Leroy, Taimak, has his own unique story, which is compelling and you'll understand why he deserved the role. You can read it on Kung Fu Cinema, google THERE IS ONLY ONE BRUCE LEROY and you'll find my interview with him.As I mentioned, I sent a script to the RZA in California, back in 2007. I wrote a separate story about a modern day protagonist based in New York City. The title of the story is MASTERNEVER AND THE FLOW OF DEATH. I mentioned in my letter that the Last Dragon had been one of my influences. I'm not saying that the RZA did not already want to remake the movie, but he has never mentioned it over the years.After I met with Louis Venosta, I realized that a new story needed to be made.Reason being is that the LAST DRAGON, is a metaphor for the 80s. A time when people would really loose themselves in alternate personalities. Hip Hop was still in its infancy and there was a mixture of rock, rap, r&b and pop. Back then, more people wanted to be like Micheal Jackson, then Kanye West.So now, the remake has been announced and Samuel Jackson has been asked to play the role of Sho'nuff. Although he has agreed, he has mentioned that he has never seen a script. I've heard that in Hollywood, once you announce a film and if nothing happens in a year, the project is dead.Having that been said, I would encourage everyone to please read my book. I've placed the book and soundtrack online. You can find it by googling MASTERNEVER AND THE FLOW OF DEATH.When I met with Taimak, he intimated that he had a role in the upcoming film, but would not say what it was. So the film is more of a sequel and not really a remake. Most of us want closure and hopefully this is what we will get in the remake. As I mentioned, I don't think a remake is necessary. Elements of the film, will be impossible to reintroduce. For one, the music supervision is excellent. The 80s soundtrack is timeless and that kind of music does not exist now.It is fitting that I mention The Last Dragon soundtrack because, while I was on this very message board four years ago, I began my journey to write the sequel.We're ready for a new story.

His portrayal of his character is classic, it is so intriguing to watch. He is so very cool, and is so effortlessly. The way he dangles his cigarette loosely on his lips, and his calm, almost cold demeanor is very rich for supporting the character he was portraying. This movie sheds new light on the glorious P.I. movies, which have not lost their popular touch even in todays cinematic area. I think this movie sets off a new craze on the whole idea of being a P.I. and all the darkness that surrounds it. The shots are done in a way that gives you a feel of doom and gloom. The darkness gives you a good feel of the mood and setting of the story being portrayed. A lot of the scenes are dark, cold, and wet, which do well in complimenting Bogart's dark, sleek, powerful character. The film is the first of its kind and is certainly a Bogart Classic.

Joanna is a white women who brings home her new African American doctor fiancé. The surprise and well disacceptance by Joanna's family carries the comedy scenes in this movie, and that's the best parts of the movie. There's time where the witty banter and comments back and forth well make you laugh out loud. A little more action would of definitely held my attention more, im not talking car chases and exploding bombs here, but maybe a car ride, outings, something to brake up the manonity. For example like the scene when Tracey (Matt) backs into the car. The ending of a father realizing that all that matters is if his daughter is happy, and who gives a hoot what others think, touched my heart. Katherine Hepbirn, is of course fabulous in this movie, as always. I had heard of Sidney Poitier before but couldn't recall having seen any of his work.

Joanna is a white women who brings home her new African American doctor fiancé. The surprise and well disacceptance by Joanna's family carries the comedy scenes in this movie, and that's the best parts of the movie. There's time where the witty banter and comments back and forth well make you laugh out loud. A little more action would of definitely held my attention more, im not talking car chases and exploding bombs here, but maybe a car ride, outings, something to brake up the manonity. For example like the scene when Tracey (Matt) backs into the car. The ending of a father realizing that all that matters is if his daughter is happy, and who gives a hoot what others think, touched my heart. Katherine Hepbirn, is of course fabulous in this movie, as always. I had heard of Sidney Poitier before but couldn't recall having seen any of his work. I must say he did do a great job portraying John. His dry sense of humor throughout the movie helped to make his character very realistic in my opinion.Definitely worth the watch, especially since its so worthy It has even been updated and remade.

The effects are very, very good and the story is too. I also think that Bill Paxton is a great actor and he is great in Twister. This movie has a lot of negative comments, but in my opinion its a good film. Don't let people put you off this film because you might enjoy it like I did. I did think though that the script wasn't that good. I liked the story, but the script was lazy. It's still a good movie though and well worth watching.I had to buy it on DVD because I really liked it. £7.00 was a bit of a rip-off, but I couldn't resist. I'm gonna watch it tonight again with a nice can of coke.Stay tuned for more reviews!

It's the most successful independent film of all time and one of the most popular horror icons. It's been referenced, spoofed, parodied and payed tribute to in many, many movies and the internet. It's spawned six sequels, a reboot, a remake and a sequel to that remake. But enough on that.On to the movie. It starts out in the Myers house. 6 year old Michael Myers murders her older sister Judith, for some reason, and even though this is poorly done you can still feel a little chilled.The film's protagonist is Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. (Yeah, you didn't know that.) Some people say she doesn't get enough development, but I think it's done perfectly. Laurie Strode, this spunky, smart teenager who also smokes weed. But then, she begins to get stalked by Michael Myers. From driving along the side of the road, to simply looking straight at her from ten meters away and then hiding behind a hedge.But then night comes... and then Michael stops playing around.Now, there are only four deaths in this, but Halloween says that horror films don't have to have many deaths to be scary, and there isn't much blood at all. Really, there is just suspense.The music is brilliant, and basic too, but still pretty creepy. Especially in the chase scenes, when most of the time John Carpenter is just hitting the same note on the piano over and over in a pattern. It's beautifully directed too. It leaves us scared of the dark, always turning around to check what's behind you, always checking all the closets fully before using them, checking the back seats of cars, leaving us scared to go around corners, always locking our doors, always hiding...And that is horror. That is Halloween.Rating 8\/10 Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is... magnificent!
