TRUE ROMANCE (1993)** 1\/2 out of *****Much of Tony Scott's True Romance seems as though it were crafted by a real geek. The film's hero, Clarence, is a quintessential loser -- every year on his birthday he goes to see a movie and all 364 other days are spent working at a comic book store. Mere coincidence, then, that its writer is Quentin Tarantino? (A man who used to work as a video store clerk and watch three to four movies a day before hitting the big time as a director with 1992's Reservoir Dogs.)Most of True Romance doesn't seem very real at all. It's a harsh movie, but that doesn't bother me at all. It's when the character -- a self-confessed geek -- picks up a gun and goes on a killing spree at a brothel in order to free his call girl wife that the film seems to exaggerate just a bit. (Travis Bickle? Yes. A geeky nerd? No.) It seems like the sort of dream that Quentin Tarantino may have had years ago. In the real world, this all just seems a bit odd.But the characters aren't living in our world. They're in Quentin's. I originally read the script for True Romance and thought it was splendid -- but soon found that Tony Scott's direction betrayed the darkness of the screenplay, creating a sort of half-good\/half-bad movie that leaves the audience wanting more. Sure, True Romance has its good parts, but the people who tell you it's the best film ever are part of the True Romance cult. It's nothing more than a good movie with a fine script and bad direction. Scott (Top Gun) has made some fine movies, but in terms of actual direction, this is one of his lesser ones.Why? Well, for starters, the story is rather dark and grimy and bleak. Scott forces his audience into liking these characters so much that he betrays the grim tone for a happy look. The problem? Well, the characters are rather corrupt and the story is rather dark and the outcome is potentially unmerited. Scott changed the ending to the film, making it happier, which Quentin Tarantino admits works for the story. But, as he says on the DVD commentary, had he filmed the movie, it would have been a lot different. And when Quentin says that, I think he means better.Don't blame the cast. These are top-notch actors in Oscar-worthy roles. But somehow, given their characteristics, they never come across as anything more than caricatures -- exaggerated molds of real people. Clarence is played by Christian Slater, and he meets and falls in love with Alabama (Patricia Arquette), soon finding out she's a hooker. Their romance is something I would expect a soap opera writer to craft -- they meet, he falls for her, she falls for him (hooker with a heart of gold!), they sleep together (in a scene reminiscent of that criticized love sequence from Top Gun), and he risks everything to free her. In less than twenty-four hours. Is something a bit odd here? It's like a geek's wet dream.The supporting cast is to die for Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Brad Pitt. They all do well in their roles, but seem to be boasted on the posters for promotional value. Hopper and Oldman have the most scenes, but die early on. Kilmer's face is never seen, and his body only appears in two sequences. Walken is in a single scene during the entire film, and Gandolfini is introduced (and executed) quite late into the movie. Bummer. It's basically the adventures of Clarence and Alabama.Nothing wrong with that, except that their story copies from everything in sight -- most notably, Bonnie and Clyde. To be fair, I understand what Quentin meant to do with his tale, and his original ending (although depressing) was much more suitable given the content of the movie. Quentin tried to add a dark streak to the clichéd romance-on-the-run genre, and Scott mistakenly made yet another happy-go-lucky (although very violent) road romance with two very simplistic, innocent, fake characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. This is the stuff Charlie Kaufman hates.The whole way through the movie, I felt as though I were staring at comical shadows of potentially real people, waiting to break through their boundaries and convince us all that they are more than just clichés. This script was sold early on in Quentin's career so that he could film Reservoir Dogs with the income. He was reportedly never very happy with the outcome of True Romance, a film he had hoped to direct, and I don't blame him. From the very opening credits, I could tell this film was taking the wrong path given its source material. Maybe I shouldn't have read the script first. Maybe I had preconceptions. But it's still not a very well made movie. Blame Scott.How some people love this movie is still beyond me.

Their romance is something I would expect a soap opera writer to craft -- they meet, he falls for her, she falls for him (hooker with a heart of gold!), they sleep together (in a scene reminiscent of that criticized love sequence from Top Gun), and he risks everything to free her. In less than twenty-four hours. Is something a bit odd here? It's like a geek's wet dream.The supporting cast is to die for Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, James Gandolfini, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore and Brad Pitt. They all do well in their roles, but seem to be boasted on the posters for promotional value. Hopper and Oldman have the most scenes, but die early on. Kilmer's face is never seen, and his body only appears in two sequences. Walken is in a single scene during the entire film, and Gandolfini is introduced (and executed) quite late into the movie. Bummer. It's basically the adventures of Clarence and Alabama.Nothing wrong with that, except that their story copies from everything in sight -- most notably, Bonnie and Clyde. To be fair, I understand what Quentin meant to do with his tale, and his original ending (although depressing) was much more suitable given the content of the movie. Quentin tried to add a dark streak to the clichéd romance-on-the-run genre, and Scott mistakenly made yet another happy-go-lucky (although very violent) road romance with two very simplistic, innocent, fake characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. This is the stuff Charlie Kaufman hates.The whole way through the movie, I felt as though I were staring at comical shadows of potentially real people, waiting to break through their boundaries and convince us all that they are more than just clichés. This script was sold early on in Quentin's career so that he could film Reservoir Dogs with the income. He was reportedly never very happy with the outcome of True Romance, a film he had hoped to direct, and I don't blame him. From the very opening credits, I could tell this film was taking the wrong path given its source material. Maybe I shouldn't have read the script first. Maybe I had preconceptions. But it's still not a very well made movie. Blame Scott.How some people love this movie is still beyond me.

Though I didn't collect all the toys, I did like the cartoons (or what I can remember from them), with Skeletor being at the time one of my favorite animated villains. But by the time the motion picture came out, I had already seen movies like STAR WARS, THE LAST STARFIGHTER and KRULL. Now that was stuff that really impressed me when I was a kid. So, even when I was rather young at the time MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE came out, it didn't impress me much. I remember thinking something along the lines of What's with all this running-on-earth-crap? Where's Eternia?. So over the years I kinda forgot about it. Until recently when I was at my parent's place and found a copy of it. So, back at my place, I popped this baby into my good ol' vcr and thought Let's see what we make of it now. And yep, it's a pretty bad film. It's cheesy & silly, to say the least. But strangely, after a while, you just accept the silliness and go with it. The story is yet another take on the 'good vs evil'-concept. Skeletor wants to absorb all the powers of the universe. In order to do that, he needs a key which has been transported to earth together with He-man and his friends.The special effects & make-up are more or less okay, maybe cheesy at times, but hey, it was the 80's. Some things were just very bad about this movie the annoying little midget-troll (obviously inserted for some comic relief), the key-gadget made these really stupid synthesizer-sounds, the fact that Julie gets re-united with her parents (which were DEAD, by the way) at the end of the movie (really bad move, scriptwriters), Robert Duncan McNeill just can NOT act (and he's not the only one in this movie),etc...And what about Mr. Goldilox, Dolph Lundgren? Well, I think at the time it was a good decision to cast him as He-man. This was to be his break-through roll, possibly lifting him to Schwarzenegger-heights. Sadly, MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE failed miserably at the box-office. Though that wasn't Lundgren's fault, but when it comes to being a good actor, well, the fact that you can read in the end-credits that he needed a speech-coach AND a drama-coach to pull this one off, proves enough, doesn't it? By the way, notice that he has almost no lines in this movie. And perhaps the most unforgivable thing At the end of the movie, when he raises his sword and shouts the most famous words I Have The Power, you can see that his lip-movement isn't synchronized. Slightly hilarious, I call that.On the good side Frank Langella is awesome as Skeletor. His lines are good and you truly believe he's evil. Classy B-queen Meg Foster, with those oh so mesmerizing eyes, is also excellent as the icy-cold Evil-Lyn. This movie features also one of the coolest bounty-hunters I've ever seen Saurod (that lizard-guy with the pulsating throat and the neat helmet. Pity that he doesn't do much and dies quickly). JameskletskopTolkan was also very enjoyable as detective Lubic. And that's about it. Not even Courteney Cox' performance is memorable, but she had me laughing every time she came on simply because she was in this flick, looking young and 80's. Oh yeah, the floating platform fight was kinda groovy too. Though the scene was executed rather poorly, it was fun seeing an action-figure of Lundgren on a board flying around. Goofy stuff.While MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE isn't a good film at all, it still manages to entertain on a spectacular, cheesy sorta level. And it's a must see for kids, I believe.

The shots in the filmed seemed very modern, and the montages were amazing. This film also had a lot of symbolism along with the theme of youth rebellion. I also feel that this film can be linked to Lacan's theory of the symbolic order and the imaginary in a culture. Ben represents the imaginary trying to break into the symbolic order but is being held back. The soundtrack for this film was also amazing, and I feel that Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel was the perfect song for this film. This song's first line Hello darkness my old friend describes what Ben is going through perfectly. He is trapped and wants to break free from the darkness.Water is a huge symbol in this film. I feel that it symbolizes Ben feeling trapped by his family and his life in general. He doesn't want to become like his father and mother, but he feels that it is inevitable. This forces him to rebel throughout the film, and do exactly what people don't want him to. Water is found in many of the scenes in this film, and it always represents the same thing. When Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft) confronts Ben about not seeing her daughter anymore, it is raining out. Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell her daughter everything that has happened between the two of them. She is trapping him emotionally, but he is able to break free. Water also is present when Mr. Robinson (Hamilton) confronts Ben about sleeping with his wife. Ben is also being trapped here. Ben's parents also get him scuba gear for his birthday. This to me represented them not wanting him to escape, or break free. He is able to stay under the water now, and that's where they want him to be.This film can also be loosely connected with Lacan's theory of the symbolic order. This theory can be used for many films, and this film had many of the elements of this theory in it. First of all, Ben is in the imaginary and is trying to break into the symbolic order. He desperately wants to be accepted for what he is, but he can't be accepted. At the bar in the hotel, for instance, the waiter doesn't hear or see Ben when he wants to order a drink. This is because he is not in the literary world, and is stuck in the imaginary. Mrs. Robinson has no problem ordering a drink in the bar because she is in the symbolic order and can be heard. The only way that Ben is recognized in this film is when he calls himself Mr. Gladstone. He is pretending to be in the symbolic order, and is momentarily heard and recognized. Ben isn't heard throughout the film, and I feel that this is why he thinks that he falls in love with Elaine (Ross), because she is the first person that actually hears him. Elaine is also going through the same thing, and they are able to understand each other because they are both in the imaginary.I felt that this film was amazing. The shot framing in many scenes were great and the montages where very innovative. The story was also unbeatable. My favorite part of the film was when Ben and Elaine get on the bus to run away from everyone, and they both realize that they didn't actually love each other, and made a huge mistake. I thought that was a great ending to the film. My link to Lacanian theory may have been far fetched for this film, but I felt that it had many of the elements of this theory. All-in-all I felt that this film was flawless, and is one of my favorite films of that period in New American Cinema.

Die Hard though features a hero who is markedly more human and real than his rival action hero's. McClane is an ordinary guy and he damn near gets killed in this film and gets the hell beaten out of him, He takes a pummelling the likes of which Schwarzengger never received in the 80;s. He got a scratch at most.So what makes Die Hard the single greatest action movie ever, and I'm talking action movie with an action hero and plenty of action, a proper lads movie. This is easily the best. The basic premise is basic. Terrorists take over a building and Bruce Willis in the right place at the right time (or wrong?) is on hand to stop them. Yet the film has a brilliant script. This is chock full of witty writing (The two agent Johnson's, the idiotic police chief, the slimy co-worker Ellis), set-ups and pay-offs and great little touches. Die Hard also features some scenes that are hilarious. It's just funny and combined with the direction of John McTiernan, this is a thrill ride start to finish and unsurpassed in its combination of action and humour.Furthermore Willis is superb and also it must be noted can act, and is allowed to. It can be argued that Arnold, Jean Claude, Steven and Dolph are not great thespians, and it'd be a well granted argument. Doing the simple stuff is not a problem, but stretching the acting muscles reveals that those muscles are not nearly as defined as the bicep, tricep and whatever-cep, muscles! Then there is Sly Stallone who can act given the chance, yet aside from First Blood his action movies don't allow him for more than 6 lines of dialogue or much in the way of stretching. Willis however rejuvenates the action hero character by giving him personality, following on from Mel Gibson's Riggs (Lethal Weapon), the year before. He has personality, he speaks and he emotes. He's not cool as ice, he is a real guy in an extraordinary situation. Willis delivers a great performance here, one of the best in an action man movie, because he's human, and charismatic. Similarly the rest of the cast are great. Generally a lot of action movies aren't too concerned with the co-stars acting talents, because the leads aren't much kop, but Die Hard loads the film with good actors, everyone delivering. This makes for a more exciting movie when the actors are so convincingly real. Alan Rickman is superbly slimy and cool as Hans Gruber, the super slick German terrorist whose icy demeanour is only ever pierced by the annoying and troublesome McClaine. Then we have number 1, baddest bad guy henchman ever, the big blond fella Karl played by Alexander Gudonov. Not forgetting Bonnie Bedelia, Reg VelJohnson, Paul Gleason, Robert Davi and Grant Bush. McTiernan is one of the masters of crafting an action scene. Sadly when recounting his work, he hasn't hit the bull's-eye on enough of his movies, yet in Die Hard and Predator he emerged as one of the action king directors of the decade, along with Jim Cameron, Walter Hill and Richard Donner to name a few. The action here is superb and not forgetting in a setting that could have caused problems creating enough varied and well choreographed action scenes. Above all this has scale, it's big. it's the equivalent of the big bloated blockbusters of today that rise past 150 million dollars in cost, yet lack the skill of this film.Die Hard features quality in all departments from the cast, the crew to the superb score from Michael Kamen, and thus far no other action film comes close to this ones entertainment and repeatability. ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"30 January 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" At the end of the 80's, that were all about shirtless muscle bound supermen taking on hundreds of foreign terrorists single-handed, Die Hard came out and changed the course of the action genre, whilst still having a shirtless and muscular (although not in Arnold or Dolph standards) hero, taking on a group of foreign terrorists single-handed.

He got a scratch at most.So what makes Die Hard the single greatest action movie ever, and I'm talking action movie with an action hero and plenty of action, a proper lads movie. This is easily the best. The basic premise is basic. Terrorists take over a building and Bruce Willis in the right place at the right time (or wrong?) is on hand to stop them. Yet the film has a brilliant script. This is chock full of witty writing (The two agent Johnson's, the idiotic police chief, the slimy co-worker Ellis), set-ups and pay-offs and great little touches. Die Hard also features some scenes that are hilarious. It's just funny and combined with the direction of John McTiernan, this is a thrill ride start to finish and unsurpassed in its combination of action and humour.Furthermore Willis is superb and also it must be noted can act, and is allowed to. It can be argued that Arnold, Jean Claude, Steven and Dolph are not great thespians, and it'd be a well granted argument. Doing the simple stuff is not a problem, but stretching the acting muscles reveals that those muscles are not nearly as defined as the bicep, tricep and whatever-cep, muscles! Then there is Sly Stallone who can act given the chance, yet aside from First Blood his action movies don't allow him for more than 6 lines of dialogue or much in the way of stretching. Willis however rejuvenates the action hero character by giving him personality, following on from Mel Gibson's Riggs (Lethal Weapon), the year before. He has personality, he speaks and he emotes. He's not cool as ice, he is a real guy in an extraordinary situation. Willis delivers a great performance here, one of the best in an action man movie, because he's human, and charismatic. Similarly the rest of the cast are great. Generally a lot of action movies aren't too concerned with the co-stars acting talents, because the leads aren't much kop, but Die Hard loads the film with good actors, everyone delivering. This makes for a more exciting movie when the actors are so convincingly real. Alan Rickman is superbly slimy and cool as Hans Gruber, the super slick German terrorist whose icy demeanour is only ever pierced by the annoying and troublesome McClaine. Then we have number 1, baddest bad guy henchman ever, the big blond fella Karl played by Alexander Gudonov. Not forgetting Bonnie Bedelia, Reg VelJohnson, Paul Gleason, Robert Davi and Grant Bush. McTiernan is one of the masters of crafting an action scene. Sadly when recounting his work, he hasn't hit the bull's-eye on enough of his movies, yet in Die Hard and Predator he emerged as one of the action king directors of the decade, along with Jim Cameron, Walter Hill and Richard Donner to name a few. The action here is superb and not forgetting in a setting that could have caused problems creating enough varied and well choreographed action scenes. Above all this has scale, it's big. it's the equivalent of the big bloated blockbusters of today that rise past 150 million dollars in cost, yet lack the skill of this film.Die Hard features quality in all departments from the cast, the crew to the superb score from Michael Kamen, and thus far no other action film comes close to this ones entertainment and repeatability. ***** ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"30 January 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" At the end of the 80's, that were all about shirtless muscle bound supermen taking on hundreds of foreign terrorists single-handed, Die Hard came out and changed the course of the action genre, whilst still having a shirtless and muscular (although not in Arnold or Dolph standards) hero, taking on a group of foreign terrorists single-handed.

Not trying to lean too far to either, the movie stays at a safe plane, even incorporating a vague plot involving two grifters, Gordon and Abigail Craven, posing as Uncle Fester and a renowned psychiatrist (Christopher Lloyd and Elizabeth Wilson) who are in cahoots to rob the Addams of their fortune and house. The problem arises when Craven seems to go against his take-the-money-and-run attitude and when the Addams themselves appear to enjoy every minute that they're being taken advantage of. It suits the dark humor well, because since the Addams live in an alternative universe of their own creation in which dark is light, repugnant is beautiful, pain equals pleasure, death is life, and chaos equals order, it leaves the door open for many of their Gothic eccentricities to pull the rug over Lloyd and Wilson over and over again. It's clever, although its only problem is the needing to introduce the characters we all know setup which like in all movies based on comics or television shows, looks obvious.But despite this, everyone is uniformly excellent. Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston lend their looks to embody their cartoon counterparts and are the romantics at the heart of this decidedly perverse story. Christopher Lloyd is also great in his representation of Uncle Fester. But hands down the one who walks away with the entire movie is Christina Ricci who plays Wednesday as if she were living the role day by day. There's a sadistic gleam in her eyes and her voice that not many child actors have and I think that any other actor of the time that this film was made would have been unable to fit into this difficult part. Other than that, the tone of the movie is perfect as dark as it wants to be, but never letting its Gothic setting drown it in an inescapable mire.

In 1823 Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) claims, while being in a hospital, he had murdered Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and tells a young priest the story about him and the superstar of the classic period. 40 years earlier, Salieri is the court composer of Kaiser Joseph II. (Jones), young Mozart (Hulce) appears in Vienna. He is a nervy, foolish, voluptuous contemporary and laughs provokingly and grossly - but above all he wants to prove that he is the greatest composer of all time. After a short time, Mozart is introduced to the Kaiser, rewrites a quick authored composition by Salieri into a little, ingenious masterpiece, which later slips into The Marriage of Figaro. He casts Katerina Cavalieri (Ebersole), Salieri's favorite student, for this opera in the lead role. And, to complete his luck in life, he marries Constanze (Berridge) and becomes the teacher of the Kaiser's niece. Salieri, meanwhile, starts to be more and more impressed by the divine music of Mozart and gets obsessed with the idea to murder his rival. In his life he only sees the sense to destroy the muse who seems to be predestined by God in creating such a terrific music. Salieri fights, intrigues, not only against Mozart, but also against God who apparently does not hear the desperate entreaties of making himself, Salieri, the divine musician on this Earth. That's why he burns the cross and tries everything to let Mozart die.Forman stages a story of insanity &#150; the insanity of Mozart and the insanity of Salieri, which are so contrary as are both characters. On the one side, you see the young, agile, in love with life Mozart, who thinks he is the greatest composer of his time. He is a lunatic showing that he does not work as a musician, he lives the music. He composes every single note in his mind, hears a whole score before writing it down. He is a person who tries to escape his dominant father, who faces life so unpractically that he has found the happiness in his wife, Constanze. She loves him unquestioningly and sees to do everything so that their little family can exist and survive. Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge are playing their roles enthralling and wonderfully convincing. On the other side, there is Salieri, a self-obsessive man, who has the same dream as Mozart, but inwardly doubts his own skills and talent. In prayers, he obligates God as an ally to make his dream come true. Salieri lives in the condition of extortionate, egocentric insanity. He puts himself the claim to absoluteness. A staunch ascetic who works hard and intransigent. And then Mozart appears, a goofy clown, a ridiculous twit who makes supernatural music. Ravished by Mozart's music and ravingly jealous and envious at the same time, he starts to develop grim hatred and obsessive thoughts of murder. F. Murray Abraham plays the fictitious character Salieri grandiosely complex which makes it to one of the psychologically most interesting figures in cinema's history and got him the Oscar for Best Performance of the year.The music also plays a sustaining role. There is probably barely another picture who incorporates given original material that perfectly makes Mozart's music a piece of the entire film in such an obliging way. It even takes the effect of being written only for it. In the course of the plot, one will see the core scenes of four Mozart operas The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute, and the staging of them are perfectly arranged and choreographed. Also captivating is the scene shortly before Mozart's death, when Mozart lies in the bed, composing a requiem in his head and telling Salieri to write down the notes to it. At the same time, music builds up for the viewer in the background, making it a seven minutes scene of impressing cinematic magic. Here is the genial mastermind of music, sick and bed-bound, and there is the clerk, staggering between awe, admiration, envy, despair, fantasies of obliteration, who holds the magnum opus, who sees the notes which he has written down but hasn't created, who sees how Constanze locks it in a cabinet after Mozart's death the next morning because she thinks that this composition has killed her husband. Salieri looks at the notes behind the glass door for the last time, a divine requiem, which, after all, is responsible for the death of Mozart. He succeeded in letting him die. Yet God took revenge on Salieri Wasting away in a hospital, his music is forgotten, but Mozart's creation remains immortal. Forman's Amadeus is an epic, where everything fits, a subtle, prudential composition, just like Mozart's operas. It's a dramatic, but at the same time comical production. Decors, the costumes, the baroque splendor of the absolutism, the cast, the music, the dialogs - everything is ingeniously attuned to one another. One does not have to be fond of classical music to appreciate this film. Some even say, through Amadeus you can get really enthusiastic about Mozart's music. But above everything the film is a story of a struggle The insanity of an egotist against the insanity of a genius. And this Story is told in an immensely enthusing way. The question, if it complies the facts of the historic biographies of both lead characters correctly is completely unimportant because after all Amadeus is a cinematic, opera like drama and not a document on history.

Murray Abraham plays the fictitious character Salieri grandiosely complex which makes it to one of the psychologically most interesting figures in cinema's history and got him the Oscar for Best Performance of the year.The music also plays a sustaining role. There is probably barely another picture who incorporates given original material that perfectly makes Mozart's music a piece of the entire film in such an obliging way. It even takes the effect of being written only for it. In the course of the plot, one will see the core scenes of four Mozart operas The Abduction from the Seraglio, The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute, and the staging of them are perfectly arranged and choreographed. Also captivating is the scene shortly before Mozart's death, when Mozart lies in the bed, composing a requiem in his head and telling Salieri to write down the notes to it. At the same time, music builds up for the viewer in the background, making it a seven minutes scene of impressing cinematic magic. Here is the genial mastermind of music, sick and bed-bound, and there is the clerk, staggering between awe, admiration, envy, despair, fantasies of obliteration, who holds the magnum opus, who sees the notes which he has written down but hasn't created, who sees how Constanze locks it in a cabinet after Mozart's death the next morning because she thinks that this composition has killed her husband. Salieri looks at the notes behind the glass door for the last time, a divine requiem, which, after all, is responsible for the death of Mozart. He succeeded in letting him die. Yet God took revenge on Salieri Wasting away in a hospital, his music is forgotten, but Mozart's creation remains immortal. Forman's Amadeus is an epic, where everything fits, a subtle, prudential composition, just like Mozart's operas. It's a dramatic, but at the same time comical production. Decors, the costumes, the baroque splendor of the absolutism, the cast, the music, the dialogs - everything is ingeniously attuned to one another. One does not have to be fond of classical music to appreciate this film. Some even say, through Amadeus you can get really enthusiastic about Mozart's music. But above everything the film is a story of a struggle The insanity of an egotist against the insanity of a genius. And this Story is told in an immensely enthusing way. The question, if it complies the facts of the historic biographies of both lead characters correctly is completely unimportant because after all Amadeus is a cinematic, opera like drama and not a document on history.

In 1823 Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) claims, while being in a hospital, he had murdered Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and tells a young priest the story about him and the superstar of the classic period. 40 years earlier, Salieri is the court composer of Kaiser Joseph II. (Jones), young Mozart (Hulce) appears in Vienna. He is a nervy, foolish, voluptuous contemporary and laughs provokingly and grossly - but above all he wants to prove that he is the greatest composer of all time. After a short time, Mozart is introduced to the Kaiser, rewrites a quick authored composition by Salieri into a little, ingenious masterpiece, which later slips into The Marriage of Figaro. He casts Katerina Cavalieri (Ebersole), Salieri's favorite student, for this opera in the lead role. And, to complete his luck in life, he marries Constanze (Berridge) and becomes the teacher of the Kaiser's niece. Salieri, meanwhile, starts to be more and more impressed by the divine music of Mozart and gets obsessed with the idea to murder his rival. In his life he only sees the sense to destroy the muse who seems to be predestined by God in creating such a terrific music. Salieri fights, intrigues, not only against Mozart, but also against God who apparently does not hear the desperate entreaties of making himself, Salieri, the divine musician on this Earth. That's why he burns the cross and tries everything to let Mozart die.Forman stages a story of insanity &#150; the insanity of Mozart and the insanity of Salieri, which are so contrary as are both characters. On the one side, you see the young, agile, in love with life Mozart, who thinks he is the greatest composer of his time. He is a lunatic showing that he does not work as a musician, he lives the music. He composes every single note in his mind, hears a whole score before writing it down. He is a person who tries to escape his dominant father, who faces life so unpractically that he has found the happiness in his wife, Constanze. She loves him unquestioningly and sees to do everything so that their little family can exist and survive. Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge are playing their roles enthralling and wonderfully convincing. On the other side, there is Salieri, a self-obsessive man, who has the same dream as Mozart, but inwardly doubts his own skills and talent. In prayers, he obligates God as an ally to make his dream come true. Salieri lives in the condition of extortionate, egocentric insanity. He puts himself the claim to absoluteness. A staunch ascetic who works hard and intransigent. And then Mozart appears, a goofy clown, a ridiculous twit who makes supernatural music. Ravished by Mozart's music and ravingly jealous and envious at the same time, he starts to develop grim hatred and obsessive thoughts of murder. F. Murray Abraham plays the fictitious character Salieri grandiosely complex which makes it to one of the psychologically most interesting figures in cinema's history and got him the Oscar for Best Performance of the year.The music also plays a sustaining role.
