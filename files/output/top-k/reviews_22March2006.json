All the characters are wonderful, and extremely likable, plus Reese Witherspoon is simply incredible in this, and Matthew Broderick is amazing!. It's extremely well made and written, and I thought Reese was robbed of an Oscar nomination, as she truly deserved it in my opinion, plus the ending is especially well done, as I loved it!. It's also very, very clever, and while I know Reese's character Tracy Flick was supposed to be annoying, I just couldn't help but love her as she was so funny and convincing, plus I laughed my ass off near the end when Broderick throws his drink at the back window of a limo Tracy Flick was riding on!. This should be even higher then 7.4 in my opinion, and it's pretty unpredictable throughout, plus Chris Klein is great as the dumb jock. Jessica Campbell is awesome as Tammy(Klein's sister), and it also has some good Drama in it as well, plus the opening was really cool too!.It really is one of the smartest Comedies you will watch, and I can see why this was a huge hit with everyone, plus I really felt sorry for Matthew Broderick's character. It was also funny when Reese tore all the presidential signs off the wall down, and It's extremely witty as well, plus it was so imaginative as well!. I really liked what happened to Broderick's character at the end, as it was very satisfactory in my opinion, plus it also works very well as a dark Comedy as well. This movie may not be for all tastes, but it certainly was for me, and the most sympathetic character in the film is a tie between Mr. McAllister's(Broderick) and Tammy's(Jessica Campbell), plus another scene that cracked me up was Klein's speech as he read it too fast, before anyone could understand what he was saying. This is an absolutely brilliant Comedy, that's really smart, and very funny, with a wonderful story, and outstanding performances, and if you haven't seen it, please do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is superb!. Alexander Payne does a superb! job here with wonderful camera work, awesome angles and keeping the film hilarious and at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is outstanding!. Reese Witherspoon is amazing as always and is incredible here as the obnoxious over achieving student, she is stunningly gorgeous, hilarious, had a character that will irritate most people, made some hilarious faces, deserved an Oscar nomination (in my opinion), as I just found her to be hilarious, but she will grate most people's nerves, she was truly incredible, this is one of her finest performances(Reese Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Matthew Broderick is amazing as the teacher, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, and you will feel sorry for his character at times, and with what he had to put up with from Reese's character, his chemistry with Reese was also on, I loved him!. Chris Klein is fantastic as the dumb jock, he was actually very likable, had some funny lines, and had lots of charm and charisma, I really dig this guy!. Jessica Campbell is excellent as Tammy, she was different but in a very good way, as she was very likable, as I felt for her character, as she was probably the most sympathetic out of the bunch. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall if you haven't seen it, please do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 March 2006","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This is an absolutely brilliant Comedy, that's really smart, and very funny, with a wonderful story and outstanding performances!.

It's extremely well made and written, and I think this is one of Nicolas Cage's best films, plus the ending will make you think. I will admit it did have me almost crying on several occasions,because sentimental movies tend to get to me like that, and I thought the changes that Cage's character made were just perfect, plus Don Cheadle has a small but pretty cool role here as well. This should be a lot higher then 6.5 in my opinion, and It's the perfect Family film as well, plus all the characters are extremely likable.However if your not into this mushy kind of stuff, you probably won't like this one either, but if you are(like me) I'm positive you will love it, plus It's also a brilliant fantasy film as well. I was expecting this to be a good but not a great film, however it turned out to be much more then that, and Makenzie Vega is surprisingly very likable and cute as the young daughter, plus I loved the script in this one as well!. One of the biggest reasons this film works so well though is the relationship between Cage and Leoni, and while I didn't think much of Leoni before because I hadn't really seen her in anything, I am now a huge fan of her's due to her amazing performance in this film, plus Cage managed to crack me up several times throughout the film.

I was expecting a fictional story which involved them all to develop, but this never happened. Ultimately this mystery was partly solved in the final credit sequences which explain that the film's characters were developed during a series of improvisational workshops in which all the principal members of the cast participated. (I understand that the DVD includes additional extras which usefully expand these explanations, but I have not seen these.) This unusual, but in my opinion largely successful, approach has generated a great deal of controversy among the users of IMDb as fifty comments on this film, ranging from highly enthusiastic to extremely critical, have so far been posted. Viewer ratings are widely spread through the whole range from 1 to 10, and show that the film is most highly regarded by young women whilst it has least appeal for young men. I am not clear whether the cast were assembled for the first such workshop in time to contribute to the decision to locate most of the action for this film in a Los Angeles strip club. There have been many films such as Steamed or First Wives Club that largely comprise dialogue between a group of women; usually with the link that they all attended the same school or college at some time in the past, and clearly almost any venue where women characteristically meet together could be used for a film of this type. If this decision was made by the film's promoters before the cast list was assembled, it would be interesting to know the reason for it - the average age of a successful actress is very different from that of the typical pulchritudinous 18 to 25 year olds who most frequently perform in these clubs. Another problem is that all the principal characters are, for obvious dramatic reasons, shown as somewhat dysfunctional. In practice I am sure that many of the performers in strip clubs are perfectly normal, if somewhat uninhibited, local housewives who find that an occasional session 'at the club' provides an easy way for them to keep fit which not only saves the costs of belonging to a health club but in addition enables them to make a little money through part time earnings. Since the operator of the Blue Iguana is shown as a somewhat unpleasant character this singularity is easily explained, but the film might have been more credible if it had been planned as a true documentary rather than a pseudo documentary. If on the other hand the strip club venue was selected by the chosen cast at their first workshop we can have much more fun considering why this was their choice. I recall a comment by one reviewer after seeing the film Striptease' that Demi Moore made stripping seem like an Olympic sport. A psychologist might tell us that most women have the occasional urge to flaunt their charms in this rather blatant way but are held back by propriety, and so an opportunity to do so in the guise of another character would be very appealing; a casting director might point out that a successful role in such a part could provide cast members with a career plus which would significantly increase the probability of landing other very rewarding parts in the future; a health consultant might simply comment that playing such a physically demanding role would clearly be very beneficial to any actress whose recent work had left her a little jaded; a marketing consultant might comment that any film featuring strippers can be counted on to generate a lot of interest; and a gossip columnist might unkindly associate this choice of part with an attempt to recover lost youth. We can easily postulate several other possible motives for the choice - my point here is simply to note that a film structured to provide so much food for thought is challenging enough to have the potential to be a very good film, whether it finally succeeds is a matter of individual judgement.What is the viewer left with after watching this film? Certainly some exceptionally well rounded characters very competently played by the cast member concerned. On this basis I would rate the film as worth 7 on a 10 point scale, although with less competent acting there might not have been enough 'meat' to warrant a rating of more than 3. Full marks to the cast and Director for creating a number of quite memorable cameos (it would be unfair to single out any individual cast members for special mention although naturally some of the parts are much stronger than others). These cameos make it a rewarding film to watch, and it deserves to have been much more successful than it was. The main weakness is its lack of a coherent storyline and its very inconclusive ending, although I personally believe that both these could have been made much less significant by more effective work on the cutting room floor.One warning - this film is certainly not a celluloid version of strip club entertainment in the way that, for example, 'Mondo Topless' was. Those whose primarily interest is in the venue should visit a real club and not watch this film. Although it shows plenty of nudity (which often appears rather self-conscious as camera angles almost always limit it to toplessness), and the dancing is extremely well portrayed; this is not presented in the progressive and provocative way that regular visitors to such clubs would probably expect.

Ultimately this mystery was partly solved in the final credit sequences which explain that the film's characters were developed during a series of improvisational workshops in which all the principal members of the cast participated. (I understand that the DVD includes additional extras which usefully expand these explanations, but I have not seen these.) This unusual, but in my opinion largely successful, approach has generated a great deal of controversy among the users of IMDb as fifty comments on this film, ranging from highly enthusiastic to extremely critical, have so far been posted. Viewer ratings are widely spread through the whole range from 1 to 10, and show that the film is most highly regarded by young women whilst it has least appeal for young men. I am not clear whether the cast were assembled for the first such workshop in time to contribute to the decision to locate most of the action for this film in a Los Angeles strip club. There have been many films such as Steamed or First Wives Club that largely comprise dialogue between a group of women; usually with the link that they all attended the same school or college at some time in the past, and clearly almost any venue where women characteristically meet together could be used for a film of this type. If this decision was made by the film's promoters before the cast list was assembled, it would be interesting to know the reason for it - the average age of a successful actress is very different from that of the typical pulchritudinous 18 to 25 year olds who most frequently perform in these clubs. Another problem is that all the principal characters are, for obvious dramatic reasons, shown as somewhat dysfunctional. In practice I am sure that many of the performers in strip clubs are perfectly normal, if somewhat uninhibited, local housewives who find that an occasional session 'at the club' provides an easy way for them to keep fit which not only saves the costs of belonging to a health club but in addition enables them to make a little money through part time earnings. Since the operator of the Blue Iguana is shown as a somewhat unpleasant character this singularity is easily explained, but the film might have been more credible if it had been planned as a true documentary rather than a pseudo documentary. If on the other hand the strip club venue was selected by the chosen cast at their first workshop we can have much more fun considering why this was their choice. I recall a comment by one reviewer after seeing the film Striptease' that Demi Moore made stripping seem like an Olympic sport. A psychologist might tell us that most women have the occasional urge to flaunt their charms in this rather blatant way but are held back by propriety, and so an opportunity to do so in the guise of another character would be very appealing; a casting director might point out that a successful role in such a part could provide cast members with a career plus which would significantly increase the probability of landing other very rewarding parts in the future; a health consultant might simply comment that playing such a physically demanding role would clearly be very beneficial to any actress whose recent work had left her a little jaded; a marketing consultant might comment that any film featuring strippers can be counted on to generate a lot of interest; and a gossip columnist might unkindly associate this choice of part with an attempt to recover lost youth. We can easily postulate several other possible motives for the choice - my point here is simply to note that a film structured to provide so much food for thought is challenging enough to have the potential to be a very good film, whether it finally succeeds is a matter of individual judgement.What is the viewer left with after watching this film? Certainly some exceptionally well rounded characters very competently played by the cast member concerned. On this basis I would rate the film as worth 7 on a 10 point scale, although with less competent acting there might not have been enough 'meat' to warrant a rating of more than 3. Full marks to the cast and Director for creating a number of quite memorable cameos (it would be unfair to single out any individual cast members for special mention although naturally some of the parts are much stronger than others). These cameos make it a rewarding film to watch, and it deserves to have been much more successful than it was. The main weakness is its lack of a coherent storyline and its very inconclusive ending, although I personally believe that both these could have been made much less significant by more effective work on the cutting room floor.One warning - this film is certainly not a celluloid version of strip club entertainment in the way that, for example, 'Mondo Topless' was. Those whose primarily interest is in the venue should visit a real club and not watch this film. Although it shows plenty of nudity (which often appears rather self-conscious as camera angles almost always limit it to toplessness), and the dancing is extremely well portrayed; this is not presented in the progressive and provocative way that regular visitors to such clubs would probably expect.

Gosh! the governess was very tasking for me, although it was refreshing to see a woman like the Jewish governess Minnie Driver plays here, exist and hold her own within that time frame. She is sent to go work as a governess in the home of Tom Wilkinson's character (who inadvertently falls in love with her) and sooner than later she becomes the center of the household for more reasons than one.

Her character Gracie Hart is an FBI agent who is lured into a beauty pageant by her partner and interim boss (played by the ever alluring Benjamin Bratt) to help foil the plot of a recent terror threat the Bureau received regarding the next Miss United States pageant (not to be confused with the Miss America pageant). And if you've seen the way Gracie Hart was just introduced to the audience in the scenes prior to the announcement that she will now be the new Miss New Jersey, then you know that whoever has the task of turning her into a beauty queen sure would be needing tons of therapy after-wards (and that is if they succeed). The scenes play out in such a funny manner that if you do not laugh as Gracie is being transformed into pageant material then, maybe something is wrong with your funny bone. Anyways, if you study the characters very well as they are introduced to the audience when Gracie finally completes her transformation, it won't be too hard for you to figure out where the terror threat came from. But if you're one of those people who can still enjoy films without over-analyzing it, then sit back, relax, enjoy and be shocked by the surprise twist and ending. There is one scene that did bother me though, when the queen was crowned and one of the runner-ups (who turned out to be a lesbian) had an outburst.

Al Pacino is riveting, portraying with equal skill his character's bossy, sarcastic exterior and his hopeless, despairing interior. Not to mention...is Al Pacino blind himself? He plays the part so consistently, it's hard to believe that he's not.The plot revolves around a boarding school student named Charlie (Chris O'Donnell), who is hired (by the officer's niece) as a weekend companion to look after blind ex Colonel Frank Slade, while the niece's family go off on a Thanksgiving vacation. This doesn't turn out to be quite the easy, uneventful money making job the not very affluent young Charlie has anticipated, as he is caught up in Frank's plans for a whirlwind fast and fun trip to New York. And also, alas, in Frank's suicidal intent.The plot moves along quite sprightly, with the New York weekend involving limousines, a ritzy hotel, fancy dining, an assignation with a prostitute (for Frank), a wild Ferrari drive with a blind man at the wheel, and an incredible tango demonstration. Pacino deserved his Best Actor Oscar for that tango alone. Definitely one of the most immortal dance scenes in cinematic history. Enrollment in tango classes must have increased dramatically right after this movie's release. My only complaint is a sexual situation the movie might have done without (though the R rating gives ample warning), in the form of some remarks made by Frank at a relative's dinner table, though I suppose this did serve to dramatically highlight his crude nastiness. As for the hooker, it's made pretty clear that for Frank, this is merely second best sex, not the sort of relationship for which he truly longs but believes to be unattainable.Frank's world weariness is well conveyed, having lost his sight as the result of a stupid accident. The suicide attempt scene is gripping, especially as it highlights the relationship that has emerged in such a short period of time between the blind colonel and his young student companion. By the way, Chris O'Donnell is also excellent in his role here.As a tremendous fan of Dead Poets Society, I especially liked the whole boarding school plot line, which reminds me somewhat of that film. Charlie finds himself in trouble with school officials for not snitching on his rich, snobbish, despicable, cowardly, disloyal classmates. Personally, like many other reviewers, I see no reason why Charlie should not have tattled to start with on these creeps (in truth, no friends of his), but I guess the point is well taken that Charlie refuses to sell out his own ideals, whether we agree with them or not, for the sake of a scholarship.Fabulous movie, especially this unusual relationship between Frank and Charlie, that begins with Frank bellowing orders at his paid escort and ends with such a touching friendship, each party needing the other. And a wonderful ending with Frank going to bat for his young friend at the school's hearing, and putting those creepy classmates in their place with his dramatic speech. Also, a potentially interesting woman for him to pursue! But best of all, Frank's endearing and touching thaw in the closing scene toward the two children, his niece's kids, to whom he has previously acted so bearlike. Some have complained that the end ruined the movie, but sometimes it's nice to see such a moving and hopeful personal transformation. Drama need not necessarily end gloomily to be effective, and Scent of a Woman shows it.

It was at the Valley Theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was presented in Todd-A-O with Stereophonic sound which is now known as Surround-Sound. Nothing new! Surround-Sound was first used in Walt Disney's Fantasia and was revitalized in the first Cinerama Movie This Is Cinerama, but Todd-A-O which was the creative genius of Mike Todd was to rival Cinerama without those annoying lines down the screen. Years later, one of our theaters was showing Cinerama Movies and sure enough, they showed South Pacific on the giant Cincerama Screen, and - it fit the screen and was still a glorious movie to see! When Josh Logan was casting South Pacific, the first person he wanted to play Nelli was Elizabeth Taylor. He stated in his autobiography that she was so right for the part, and could sing, but when she came to the audition to sing in front of Rogers and Hammerstien, our Liz's vocal cords froze and that was it. No Lizabeth Taylor to play Nellie. Then Doris Day was considered, but they were afraid that she would turn it into a Doris Day vehicle, whatever they meant by that. At the time Mary Martin was too old despite Hedda Hopper stating that proper make-up could make her look younger, but then one day Mitzi Gaynor went to see Josh Logan, and she said, I know you probably think I can't play the part, but I'd like to audition for Nellie Forbush! So, she did, and Josh Logan asked someone, What do you think of Mitzi Gaynor in the lead? And the answer was, Oh! She'd be very good, if you can get her to do the things she should be doing instead of the things she's doing. And, of course, you'll have to police after her! What was meant was her to stop using the Gaynorism's; bugged eyes and all that, and that she smoked cigarettes like a chimney and would always be stamping them out wherever she was1 So, then came the rest of the cast Rozanno Brazzi could sing, but they replaced him with Tozzi. John Kerr couldn't sing so they used Bill Lee, and Juanita Hall could sing, but her voice was no longer a musical comedy voice, but a night club voice, so they dubbed her also, then Josh Logan started to think, Well, if everyone was being dubbed, why couldn't we use Elizabeth Taylor in the first place? Then someone gave Logan some advice and said, Please Josh! Don't film this movie in Technicolor or it will look like a picture post card that you can flip over and write, Having a wonderful time! Wish you were here! Then at the premier, women were talking during the film about who sang for who, and the one asked, I wonder who sang for Mitzi Gaynor, and Mitzi Gaynor turned around and said to them, Frank Sinatra! There are many newcomers in this film, but no one seems to see Ron Ely who later would play Tarzan on the T.V. series, but the movie is great and, again, it's just too bad that this film, like others of its time, cannot be enjoyed on the large theater screen with stereophonic sound the way they should be.

At the time Mary Martin was too old despite Hedda Hopper stating that proper make-up could make her look younger, but then one day Mitzi Gaynor went to see Josh Logan, and she said, I know you probably think I can't play the part, but I'd like to audition for Nellie Forbush! So, she did, and Josh Logan asked someone, What do you think of Mitzi Gaynor in the lead? And the answer was, Oh! She'd be very good, if you can get her to do the things she should be doing instead of the things she's doing. And, of course, you'll have to police after her! What was meant was her to stop using the Gaynorism's; bugged eyes and all that, and that she smoked cigarettes like a chimney and would always be stamping them out wherever she was1 So, then came the rest of the cast Rozanno Brazzi could sing, but they replaced him with Tozzi. John Kerr couldn't sing so they used Bill Lee, and Juanita Hall could sing, but her voice was no longer a musical comedy voice, but a night club voice, so they dubbed her also, then Josh Logan started to think, Well, if everyone was being dubbed, why couldn't we use Elizabeth Taylor in the first place? Then someone gave Logan some advice and said, Please Josh! Don't film this movie in Technicolor or it will look like a picture post card that you can flip over and write, Having a wonderful time! Wish you were here! Then at the premier, women were talking during the film about who sang for who, and the one asked, I wonder who sang for Mitzi Gaynor, and Mitzi Gaynor turned around and said to them, Frank Sinatra! There are many newcomers in this film, but no one seems to see Ron Ely who later would play Tarzan on the T.V. series, but the movie is great and, again, it's just too bad that this film, like others of its time, cannot be enjoyed on the large theater screen with stereophonic sound the way they should be. Even though enjoyable on T.V., it just isn't the same when seen in the movie theater! What a shame!

The source of such aura is the rumor that this film was the personal favorite of the Master of Suspense himself. Wheter this is true or not, it is not hard to believe that this flawless mixture of film noir and thriller could be really the favorite of the legendary British filmmaker, as it contains the theme and elements Hitchcock loved in the stories he put on film.Loosely based on a story by Gordon McDonell, the plot focuses on Charlotte Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), a young high school girl tired of the monotony of her suburban life in Santa Rosa. One day, she receives a telegram announcing the visit of her favorite uncle, who is also nicknamed Charlie (Joseph Cotten). They have always had a special relationship but this time, a sinister shadow will cover their lives as the young Charlie will discover that her favorite uncle is probably a psychotic serial killer.The film contains many of the aspects of the suspense that Hitchcock mastered through the years. It is no mystery that Uncle Charlie is the murderer, as it is stated almost from the beginning that he is really the Merry Widow Killer; the suspense lays in the fact that the rest of the characters have no idea of what kind of man Charlie is. And even when the young Charlie begins to suspect, the love for her uncle clouds her vision.The Master of Suspense handles the tension between the two Charlies with excellent technique. Presented as equal but different at the same time; the two Charlies represent two extreme sides of human nature that coexist in modern society. The excellent performances of Cotten and Wright are of high importance for the success of this film, as the two opposite forces in the conflict.Joseph Cotten creates a haunting Uncle Charlie; as charming as deadly, his character may not be as well remembered as Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, but he contains the same power as the memorable Motel owner. Teresa Wright also shines in her role, with a very emotional performance as the young girl who must face the reality of the world, a world that is scarier than she thought, with horrors a lot closer to home than she ever imagined.Shadow of a Doubt plays with the idea of the All-American Family with subtle yet sharp irony, and moves into the dark side of the suburban society and its dubious morale. How can this apparently perfect and happy environment create a serial killer? Uncle Charlie is the absolute representation of evil, and Hitchcock made him not a stranger nor a foreigner, he made him a charming member of the typical American family.Hitchcock made the bold move of portraying the dark side of the U.S. society in a time when most American filmmakers where trying to offer happier tales as a escape from the grim reality of of World War II. However, the film has it's small dose of the witty dark humor always present in the master's works; one has to wonder if the characters of Charlie's father Joseph and his friend Herb Hawkins, as well as their morbid fascination with bizarre murders are not based on Hitchcock himself.Shadow of a Doubt is one more of the perfect works of art the Master of Suspense's legacy. A movie filled with haunting images and witty social cometary, it truly deserves to be seen and be known for what it is, and not only, as the Master's favorite. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 March 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Shadow of a Doubt is a movie surrounded by a particularly special mystique a bit different from Alfred Hitchcock's other better known works.

You take tough guy Bogart and match him with Hepburn and the sparks fly. The acting is subtle and restrained. We know who these people are and they give that to us. There is no macho posturing, no abject silliness. These are two people stuck in a place with everything they brought. Throw in the fact that they cannot escape and must do what they must do. You see the frightened, hesitant duo, slowly melt into each other. There is dignity everywhere. What is said, is said correctly. Bogart's character could have been moody and angry, but he wasn't raised that way. He is actually a little hesitant to approach this woman. She speaks in that cautious way of hers, making little pronouncements about who he is and what he should do. But she never takes on that firebrand thing that she often did in other movies. The journey down the river is an archetype, done so many times. But it's not the journey. It's the affection developing between two very kind people who also get to a side that shows their strengths when the chips are down. This is a beautiful movie in every respect good writing, terrific acting, and, of course, John Ford. What can I say?
