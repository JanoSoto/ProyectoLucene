Yesterday was Halloween, but after Halloween I know Christmas is around the corner. I've always thought of November as the fastest passing month, but December is kind of long as you're waiting for Christmas and normally are busy with things like final exams. I'm also already seeing a couple of Christmas things out already in stores. To me, Thanksgiving isn't much of a holiday at least decoration wise. It doesn't seem important to decorate for Thanksgiving, only Halloween and Christmas. I saw how a friend set up a Christmas tree today so I thought now that Halloween is over I might as well get into the Christmas spirit. I saw this movie on an old VHS tape at my parents house. I'll tell you, watching movies on VHS takes you back to the time before DVDs and Blu Rays when you'd hear a number being dialed after pressing play, see old previews, see advertisements to Disney World, hear the words Coming Soon on Video Cassette, and hearing, And Now Our Feature Presentation. Since this was on VHS, it includes the 1-800 Spank Me Number, which we heard was deleted in later releases as the number was a sex hotline and there were expensive phone bills to people who called it out of curiosity. I haven't tried calling it, but I wonder if Disney bought that number, or if it's still a sex hotline? I think that's funny how a Disney movie would accidentally put a phone number in that ended up being an inappropriate number, lol. But, now to talk about the movie. We've been reading stories about Santa Claus for years, even singing songs about Santa Claus. We get an idea of who Santa Claus is in this movie. I mean, in this movie it seems like anybody can become Santa Claus if something happens to the current one, as that responsibility ends up falling under Tim Allen, Scott Calvin. None of the elves seemed to care about what happened to the last Santa Claus, or how there's a new one and just expect him to take the responsibility of being Santa Claus. Other things this movie shows us about Santa Claus. They do a good job of showing how he looks, but we don't often times think of Santa Claus as being fat as he's supposed to be in this movie. We also don't think too much about what Santa Claus eats other then other then milk and cookies, and sometimes holding a candy cane, and being in images with Coca Cola. This movie shows all the sweets Santa likes to eat. We also see how the elves are in this movie and reindeer, along with the North Pole. We see other things like to how Santa gets down the chimney and in houses without a chimney. We also see how the North Pole is and other things showing how Disney defines Santa Claus. It might be different than the way we read about Santa Claus in books or sing about him in songs. Well, here are some of the things about the movie. One, the North Pole might not look like we'd imagine the North Pole. It looked more like a really big toy room. If it were done nowadays, it would have been like all special effects for the North Pole. The elves also reminded me of the lost boys in the movie Hook even though they're not all males. I thought of how this movie is a little like Hook where Peter Banning played by Robin Williams becomes Peter Pan even when it's not his intention, as in this movie Scott Calvin played by Tim Allen becomes Santa Claus out of what he intended. Other things about this movie, well I'd say the first 1\/3 of the movie is good, second 1\/3 isn't too interesting but still watchable, and last 1\/3 of the movie is good. There are still somethings that didn't seem too well thought out. Also, Tim Allen was great as Scott Calvin in this movie. This isn't the only Christmas movie he's been in. He was in Christmas With The Kranks a decade later. So, it's cool to see him as Santa Claus. This movie also gives you a feeling of Christmas, with the Christmas music and seeing fires in a fireplace around a Christmas tree. But, I felt like while watching this that the other human characters in this movie. While they're not unlikable characters, they just aren't interesting characters, making some scenes slow. I'd give this film a 7\/10. Of all the Christmas movies it seems like the most popular ones are Home Alone.

They had no idea how to properly use them, and this film is proof of that in my opinion. I'm all for some great drama in an action movie, but the storyline is awfully clunky & heavy-handed. There are some decent action scenes for sure, but it forgets one main ingredient...fun! This movie suffers from the same problems that Exit Wounds suffered from! (Even with some of the same cast from that film) Andrzej Bartkowiak tries to make this film hip, funny, and action-packed with poignant drama. He doesn't have the skill to pull this off, and the cast certainly doesn't help. There is plenty of cringe-worthy dialog that is supposed to come across as cool, but ultimately fails. The family drama wears thin on you quickly as well.. As I said...there are some good fight scenes. That doesn't mean they are without issues though. For some reason, Jet uses wires in certain fight scenes! Why? He has so much natural ability. He uses that natural ability in many of them, but the wires were a bit of a buzz kill. I also got annoyed at the X-Ray of bones breaking. I didn't need to see that! It was pointless and ruined a lot of the impact for me. I will give this movie credit for something. I've never seen anyone kick somebody's ass like Jet Li did, while being hung upside down and hand-cuffed. That was rather creative. The acting isn't great. Jet tries his hardest, but is let down by the mediocre material. Listening to Jet use the word Brother was amusing at first, but the novelty wore off eventually. His chemistry with Aaliyah was awkward and unconvincing. I didn't buy their relationship. His best fight scene is the prison escape. Aaliyah is certainly beautiful and doesn't embarrass herself....i'll say that. She handled her part adequately, but she was out of her element when it came to being emotional. Delroy Lindo is on auto- pilot! He seems to be going through the motions in a big way. His son dies and all he can say is They killed my boy! with half-assed emotion. Anthony Anderson plays the unfunny comedic relief as usual! Nothing more to say about him. DMX is barely in this movie! Thank god for that. Isaiah Washington is OK in his role. This was one of Jet's misfires that he made in the states! He isn't used to the best of his ability by a long shot. Boring story, decent, but underwhelming fight scenes, and unlikable characters sink this one. I can only recommend this to Jet's die-hard fans.

Jet tries his hardest, but is let down by the mediocre material. Listening to Jet use the word Brother was amusing at first, but the novelty wore off eventually. His chemistry with Aaliyah was awkward and unconvincing. I didn't buy their relationship. His best fight scene is the prison escape. Aaliyah is certainly beautiful and doesn't embarrass herself....i'll say that. She handled her part adequately, but she was out of her element when it came to being emotional. Delroy Lindo is on auto- pilot! He seems to be going through the motions in a big way. His son dies and all he can say is They killed my boy! with half-assed emotion. Anthony Anderson plays the unfunny comedic relief as usual! Nothing more to say about him. DMX is barely in this movie! Thank god for that. Isaiah Washington is OK in his role. This was one of Jet's misfires that he made in the states! He isn't used to the best of his ability by a long shot. Boring story, decent, but underwhelming fight scenes, and unlikable characters sink this one. I can only recommend this to Jet's die-hard fans.

They had no idea how to properly use them, and this film is proof of that in my opinion. I'm all for some great drama in an action movie, but the storyline is awfully clunky & heavy-handed. There are some decent action scenes for sure, but it forgets one main ingredient...fun! This movie suffers from the same problems that Exit Wounds suffered from! (Even with some of the same cast from that film) Andrzej Bartkowiak tries to make this film hip, funny, and action-packed with poignant drama. He doesn't have the skill to pull this off, and the cast certainly doesn't help. There is plenty of cringe-worthy dialog that is supposed to come across as cool, but ultimately fails. The family drama wears thin on you quickly as well.. As I said...there are some good fight scenes. That doesn't mean they are without issues though. For some reason, Jet uses wires in certain fight scenes! Why? He has so much natural ability. He uses that natural ability in many of them, but the wires were a bit of a buzz kill.

Trouble is, how do you pick a film to watch when most horror films have no interest to me whatsoever? But where there's a will... This Robert Rodriguez effort is very much a film of two halves but one which has attained a cult following over the years. It's not big or clever but if all you're after is a lot of fun mixed in with liberal amounts of gore then you could do much worse. It is delightfully silly and assuming you don't take it seriously then the movie actually offers a pretty decent diversion from fending off those pesky trick-or-treaters.Brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Ritchie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) are racing for the Mexican border after violently robbing a number of banks and taking a hostage (Brenda Hillhouse). But Seth has a better plan - instead, he hijacks the RV of former preacher Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his two children (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and together with the terrified family, sneak over the border to rendezvous with Seth's contact Carlos (Cheech Marin) at a biker's bar called the Titty Twister. There is just one small problem - they are unaware that the bar is home to a vampiric cult who feast on the unfortunate patrons and it's going to be a long night...For a film with a clearly limited budget (which is why I assume Marin plays three different roles), From Dusk Till Dawn is another example of Rodriguez putting every dollar on screen. The action, when it does come, feels very reminiscent of his earlier Desperado (which is never a bad thing) but man, does it take a while to get there. The first half of the film feels like a different picture altogether - it's tense and perhaps more interesting than the second half which is explosive, gloriously over-the-top and as seedy as the Titty Twister itself. It makes you forget the excessive amount of set-up in the same way that anyone who watches the original The Italian Job can only remember Minis racing around Turin. Clooney and Keitel are typically charismatic as Seth and Jacob respectively and I enjoyed their battle of wills while Tarantino delivers probably the creepiest performance of his career. Lewis is also good but underused and the same can be said of the smoking hot Salma Hayek who proves that no-one can do sexy Latino as well as she can - even when she tries drinking your blood.Anyone looking for subtlety or context will be disappointed with From Dusk Till Dawn which is as stupid as sticking a pumpkin on your head and igniting your hair. But sometimes stupid works and there's no question that the movie is much greater than the sum of its parts. It's a lot like Tremors or Bubba Ho-Tep - movies which don't so much scare as amuse with its otherworldly beings chasing our heroes. If I were being picky then I could say that a bit more scope would have been nice and the two sequels seem completely unnecessary. It also isn't remotely frightening - which doesn't seem in keeping with the Halloween spirit but then again, neither is a toddler dressed like a Minion asking for sweets. It's too slow to be a full-on action flick and not scary enough to be a proper horror but From Dusk Till Dawn finds an interesting middle ground to occupy instead of disappearing between the cracks. It's bloody, bonkers and quite unlike anything else out there but it's worth the watch if you're not a genuine horror fan like me.

They include isn't This a Lovely Day?, Cheek to Cheek, No Strings, The Piccolino, and the title song Top Hat, White Tie and Tails. Just listening to the score is a joyful experience in itself.Mark Sandrich's film takes the elements that made THE GAY Divorcée of the year before so popular - a Hollywood English setting (to go with an Italian setting), a series of jokes at the expense of the stuffy Brits, and a supporting cast boasting Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and - and rehashes them into another memorable musical confection. The plot once again revolves around a comic misunderstanding involving Astaire, Everett Horton and Rogers, which leads to some amusing comic routines that normally end up with Everett Horton suffering in one way or another. He ends up with a black eye at one point. Yet the plot is not really significant what matters are the song-and- dance sequences involving the two stars. They ooze style as they glide across the dance-floor, no more so than in The Piccolino sequence towards the end of the film. David Abel's camera sweeps across the set in a series of slow pans, that dissolve into aerial shots of the dancers accompanying the stars, and dissolve back once again into close-ups of Astaire and Rogers. The sequence creates a dream-world in which dancing is the only thing that matters.TOP HAT gives plenty of opportunities for comic relief that prove just how good Blore and Everett Horton actually are. Everett Horton is especially adept at the double-take as he continues a conversation until he realizes just what his interlocutor has actually said. He pauses, stares for a moment and then tries to continue the conversation, albeit haltingly. Blore's eyework is especially memorable when engaged in one of his frequent arguments with Everett Horton, he has the habit of looking down at the ground and rolling his eyes, as if unable to fathom just what a chump his employer actually is. His most memorable moment comes in a sequence where he talks to an Italian police officer whom he thinks does not know English. He rolls his tongue round a series of gorgeous insults, but his mood abruptly changes when the officer replies to him in perfect English.

In the movie version we see Christine more as a victim than a murderer . So what does Christine really want ? Well, mostly Arnie Cunningham's unconditional love which unfortunately turns into jealously and possession . Christine also desires to be respected much like a lady would want to be treated . She does not want to be touched inappropriately . She does not want cigar smoke and ashes dumped in her lap . She does not enjoy being slapped or called names . But most of all, she does not want anything to come between her and Arnie . Christine will protect her lover from harm and take her vengeance out on those who bully Arnie or attack her . Poor nerdy Arnie Cunningham, never gets any respect from anyone until he meets up with Christine . He never had a date and is bullied by everyone including his mom . When we first meet 20 year old Christine she is nothing more than a pathetically battered up old wreck of a car . She is waiting for her prince charming to come along and revive the life that still lives in her . And of course that's exactly what happens after Arnie spots her while on his way home from school after a very bad first day . Christine is driven back to Arnie's house but not allowed to park in the driveway . His domineering mother does not want that old piece of junk anywhere near her nice neat home . So it's off to Darnell's garage which will become Christine's new home where her total restoration will take place . Once Christine becomes brand new again is the beginning of what I would call a most bizarre love triangle . She does not want to be second best . If necessary she will use her powers to eliminate the competition . Christine is also a victim too . One night Arnie's tormentor's sneak into Darnell's garage and nearly pound her into rumble with sledgehammers . She is torn to pieces inside and out . This scene suggests Christine has just been brutally gang raped, mutilated, and beaten within an inch of her life . So do we have any compassion for her assailants when it's payback time ? Certainly not, as we want revenge too ! Unfortunately, there are only three scenes where Christine does her thing . I would have preferred a higher body count as was in the book . During the grand finale, Arnie's best friend Dennis and ex girlfriend Leigh challenge Christine to a duel to the death . Only this time Dennis brings a bulldozer with him which makes the climax a bit predictable .There is a touching scene after Arnie is mortally wounded and dies in Leigh's arms . Christine dims her lights and turns her motor off for a brief moment of silence to show her sadness for her now deceased lover, Arnie . But the fight is not over yet . Christine desperately tries to kill Leigh in the garage but is unsuccessful . The inevitable does happen as Christine is crushed and flattened by Dennis's superior bulldozer . After her death Christine winds up in the junkyard the next day and is compressed into block of scrape metal . I would have liked to have seen some extra scenes added about the relationship between Arnie and Christine . The newest DVD version includes some of the deleted scenes that were missing in the original movie .This movie could have been a lot better if the main characters where better developed . In the end, Christine is little more than a standard revenge movie with the novelty of a killer classic car instead of a maniac wielding an ax . Christine is neither Jason, nor Freddy Kruger , nor Michael Myers . She won't give you nightmares either . I would love to see either a sequel or better yet, a prequel to Christine .

There is a world of difference between the two . In the movie version we see Christine more as a victim than a murderer . So what does Christine really want ? Well, mostly Arnie Cunningham's unconditional love which unfortunately turns into jealously and possession . Christine also desires to be respected much like a lady would want to be treated . She does not want to be touched inappropriately . She does not want cigar smoke and ashes dumped in her lap . She does not enjoy being slapped or called names . But most of all, she does not want anything to come between her and Arnie . Christine will protect her lover from harm and take her vengeance out on those who bully Arnie or attack her . Poor nerdy Arnie Cunningham, never gets any respect from anyone until he meets up with Christine . He never had a date and is bullied by everyone including his mom . When we first meet 20 year old Christine she is nothing more than a pathetically battered up old wreck of a car . She is waiting for her prince charming to come along and revive the life that still lives in her . And of course that's exactly what happens after Arnie spots her while on his way home from school after a very bad first day . Christine is driven back to Arnie's house but not allowed to park in the driveway . His domineering mother does not want that old piece of junk anywhere near her nice neat home . So it's off to Darnell's garage which will become Christine's new home where her total restoration will take place . Once Christine becomes brand new again is the beginning of what I would call a most bizarre love triangle . She does not want to be second best . If necessary she will use her powers to eliminate the competition . Christine is also a victim too .

Every man who declares himself free to his friends has to make a slave out of his wife and employees to keep up the illusion and prove it; and the wife to be free in front of her bridge club has to command her Help, Husband and Heirs. It resolves itself into a battle; whoever wins, the other one loses. For every general in this world there has to be 6,000 privates. - James Jones (From Here to Eternity) You and me might change the world. It wouldn't show up until a hundred years after we're dead. We'd never see it. But it'd be there. - James Jones (From Here to Eternity) Based on a 1951 novel by James Jones, Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity (1953) stars Montgomery Clift as Robert Prewitt, a private stationed at a US Army barracks in Oahu, Hawaii. As he refuses to fight in an upcoming, regimental boxing match, Prewitt is subjected to abuse by his fellow soldiers. Prewitt is wise to their motives, but accepts this abuse with cynical indifference.Jones' novel was preoccupied with characters who refuse to betray their ideals and convictions. Prewitt's a bit of a pacifist &#x96; a hard head as his superiors call him - and so refuses to fight. First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) likewise refuses to pursue a promotion, much to the chagrin of his lover, Karen (Deborah Kerr). Karen is herself torn between fidelity to her husband, Captain Dana Holmes (Philip Ober), and her own personal happiness. Encapsulating their dilemmas is Private Maggio (Frank Sinatra), who refuses to break when put in solitary confinement. All are seeking freedom from confinement and control. These are themes typical of Jones, whose best novels (From Here to Eternity, Some Came Running, The Thin Red Line) find characters rebelling against systems, tradition and assigned roles. The marriage, the army, the corporation, the workplace, the church, the school...Jones' heroes are often outcasts who rebel against venerated American institutions. They resist conformity and compliance &#x96; both inside and outside the military &#x96; a resistance which always leads to marginalization and then self-destruction.How to reconcile freedom and individualism with authority and patriotism was the obsession of many great post-war novels. Prewitt and Maggio themselves anticipate the heroes of Cool Hand Luke and other anti-establishment films\/novels of the era (The Sand Pebbles, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, A Thousand Clowns etc). They're hard-headed, they're rebels, they refuse to budge. But like Karen, whose promiscuity is a reaction against her imposed domestic lifestyle as an Army wife, they can't really articulate why; they unconsciously lash out.From Here to Eternity was made with the support of the United States Army, and Fred Zinnemann's always been a bit of a sell-out anyway, so the film never really tackles Jones' themes. Jones was anti-military, anti-war, anti-establishment, whilst Zinneman's busy sucking on the teats of the Production Code. For Zinnemann, all bad military behaviour is a result of bad eggs (who are weeded out and punished), all brutal men get their comeuppance, bad captains resign, bad boxers are demoted and the death of Maggio is his own fault anyway (he falls off a truck). Jones' cynical portrayal of soldiers (always knee deep in booze, sex, violence and bad language) and officers (ruthless careerists who toy with lives) is also toned down. This country's Army is why I hate this country, Maggio says in Jones' novel. What did this country ever do for me? Give me a right to vote for men I cant elect? You can have it. Give me a right to work at a job I hate? You can have that too! They say I'm a citizen of the greatest, richest country on earth, that if I don't believe it I should look at Park Avenue. Carnival prizes! All carnival prizes! They shouldn't teach their immigrants' kids all about democracy unless they mean to let them have a little bit of it! Me and the United States is dissociating our alliance as of right now, until the United States can find time to read its own textbooks a little! It's rage like this which Zinnemann's film goes to lengths to avoid.Still, Zinnemann gets some things right. Jones, whose war trilogy moved from WW2's prelude to aftermath (Eternity, Line, Whistle), had no time for jingoism, contrived heroism, and his grunts were always consigned to a drudgery at sharp contrast with the high adventure promised by recruiting posters. Zinnemann captures all this well. He also coaxes fine performances from Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed, the latter two floating about like noirish femme fatales. Zinnemann's cutting, sense of place, time and compositions are also a head above most melodramas from the era.7.9\/10 - See Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running, a marginally better James Jones adaptation from the 1950s.

He carried the series and was the only redeeming quality (aside from Michael). I like Paul Rudd, but he really wasn't good in this. Maybe it was because this was his first screen role. He plays a grown up Tommy from the first film who finds the answers surrounding Michael Myers' motives and invincibility. He also finds the baby of Michael's niece, whom he must protect. He teams up with Loomis to protect the baby and save Laurie Strode's adoptive family. I thought Michael's curse was a bit cheesy, but it did fit. Only watch this movie for the deaths and Loomis.

Though the scene STILL is stupid when the captain (or general, whatever) curses at a young boy about the A$$ and how even a young boy would want such a filthy watch after being inside many men's anuses for a long time.I mean, Tarantino's just some director I don't like or care about - he claims he's against drugs and violence... THEN DON'T MAKE FILMS ABOUT THEM! You may be just condoning or giving ideas about drugs and violence! You're definitely part of the Hollyweird group aren't you??I'm all-round just THANK everything that is holy, sacred, and beneficial that I didn't see this film when I was younger! 1994 definitely was the big year for many good movies, but Pulp Fiction is certainly NOT one of them! It shouldn't have even been nominated for ANYTHING, not even Best Picture! IMO, The Lion King should've been nominated in it's place instead! A film that's all the more likable, fun, entertaining, relatable, family-friendly, and beautifully put together, it's ART! But guess not, since Hollyweird has got such a FETISH for pure violence, murder, sexual immorality, and biased anti-Christian propaganda.Pulp Fiction is just PAINFUL to sit through; Tarantino's a HACK! And I've never liked or will ever like any of his films!

I went to see it at the Salem Mall, Dayton, Ohio. I was 10 at the time and I will never forget this theater experience. This movie scared me so much, it made Friday the 13th look tame. To me both movies scared me; but something about H3 made my skin crawl. The movie starts off in Northern CA., a man Harry Grimbridge is running for his life with a Halloween mask in his hand. A car is approaching fast, and he is just looking for help. Grimbridge finally finds a gas station, the attendant rushes him to the hospital. Once there the guy, Essex Smith, asks the Dr. if he could go. Harry Grimbridge is finally in the hands of Dr. Challis ( Tom Adkins). Grimbridge hears the commercial advertising for Silver Shamrock Halloween masks. Grimbridge tells Challis they are going to kill all of us, referring to the commercial. Dr. Challis just chalks it up as a crazy old man talking gibberish. Once Grimbridge is in a room, a man dressed like a business man comes into the hospital. He finds Grimbridge and proceeds to pull his skull apart by the nose. Challis is alerted to this by hearing the nurse Agnes scream, he tries to stop the man; but can't. He watches in horror as the man sets himself and the car on fire. The next day Challis meets Ellie( Stacy Elkin), Grimbridge's daughter. The mystery begins to start especially when the Sheriff tells Ellie some crazy man probably on drug's killed him. She nor Dr. Challis believe that's the case. Ellie and Dr. Challis team up and tells him she is not going back until she finds out what happened to her father. Ellie keeps a journal of her father's whereabouts. She explains to Challis she believe he ran into trouble in Santa Mira, because he didn't show up for a dinner date with a friend. She and Challis take a trip to Santa Mira, home of the Silver Shamrock mask company. It's a predominately Irish community and it's a very suspicious town. There they meet the CEO so to speak Conal Cochran, who is not to be trusted. Ellie and Challis find a motel nearby and pose as a married couple. There they can have privacy and talk without alerting anyone close to Cochran. Meanwhile once they are shown their room Challis investigates further. He finds out Ellie's dad was at the same motel, Cochran is not who he claims to be, plus the community is under strict curfew, surveillance cameras watch your every move; and Cochran doesn't hire locals. Challis also checks in with Teddy an Assistant at the Medical Examiner's office. She tells Challis it is strange there is no bone fragments found in the accident. She explains something should have shown that there was a human in the car. Challis and Ellie now know something happened to her dad at the factory. As soon as Ellie and Challis settle in to the motel more people arrive. A sales lady who is From San Francisco, Marge Gutman; and A top salesman, Buddy Hempfer, with the family in tow. Marge meets her fate because she needs to return an order, instead she is a victim of a misfire. Ellie and Challis are like W.T. F. when they hear about Guttman and wonder what a misfire is. As the movie proceeds we learn that Cochran's top employee's are Assassin droids; and will kill anyone who gets in Cochran's way and expose what he really is. Ellie get's kidnapped, Challis tries to find her, then he discovers what some of the employees are. Cochran gives Challis a video demonstration what he has planned for the children with the masks. The other sacrificial lamb are the Hempfer family. After seeing the video Challis discovers what Cochran has planned and tries to stop it. In the end he rescues Ellie, gets even with Cochran, and escapes. Meanwhile Teddy from the M.E.'s office finally puts the puzzle together; but eventually meets her demise with one of Cochran's assassin droids. While driving to the closest town he realizes Ellie is really quite, he asked if she's O.K.,, then all of a sudden Ellie's arm tries to strangle Challis. Ellie has been killed and replaced by an android replica. Challis has to fight it off, kill it; and run to nearest place, which is the gas station we see at the beginning of the film. He calls the T.V. stations to get the commercial off the air, 2\/3 are off and we are left in limbo on the 3. In conclusion, I loved this film it scared me then and it still gives me the creeps today. This film has nothing to do the Michael Myers, but it can stand on it's own. This is a movie you will enjoy regardless of what the critics said back in 82. So check it out, if you like classic horror flicks from the 70's and 80's this film will creep you out.THX, Kris L.

In this case, we are all a part of art that we watch, we admire, we criticize but, foremost, discover. This assumption proves particularly suitable for Stanley Kubrick's 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY inspired by a short story by Arthur C. Clarke.What strikes viewers most about the film are the questions that the theme provokes and answers that we are likely to find in ourselves. But...nothing ready on a platter! Not much is given to us except for thrilling experience of a journey, a titled odyssey. The central theme-ODYSSEY the location-SPACESHIPS\/THE UNIVERSE. In that respect, it seems inevitable to quote Roger Ebert who rightly pointed out in his review that Kubrick's genius does not lie in how much but how little. Almost everything is left to us, which makes it a very difficult screen achievement and, simultaneously reflective, such a philosophical statement about a man's place in the universe (Ebert).From the first sequence titled Dawn of Man, we see apes with an obvious aspect of imprisoning our vision within a certain framework. Nevertheless, soon, we discover that these apes begin to think. A sort of Cartesius' Cogito Ergo Sum or rather an inner existence that blends with the outer reality. Something driven by some supreme power? While we begin with dawn of man, we don't end with twilight of man. Here, rather, one could quote Steven D Greyfanus who observes that the movie makes a point about our existence and consciousness which are not self explanatory. Questions arise when a black monolith appears a challenge for the apes...some mystery which will appear more times in the movie. Is it some limitation that emerges from it? Or rather some superior reality to discover only when man drowns in it?Steven D Greyfanus interestingly claims that 2001 A Space Odyssey doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness &#x97; it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer. The movie is a challenge in itself, a challenge to rise above any ready made concepts of what a movie should be like, what it should look like, what it should evoke but encounter something new, even in the genre itself. To develop this point a bit, Greyfanus goes deeper comparing this odyssey to classical Odyssey by Homer...while in the mythology, the destination is clear, it is home, in the film, it is unknown. For can any man grasp the indefinite reality of the universe and its mystery? Roger Ebert memorably notes the film is not about a goal but a quest. The characters are the heroes of this quest. Mind you that many of them, in particular Dr Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) or Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) in the star sequence are the characters who rely solely on the intellect. In a truly unforgettable 'communication' with the on-board computer HAL 9000, there is, however, an intense desire for meaning, a quest for reasoning, search for answers. At the same time, there appears intense care not to allow any 'violation' of the mission's goals. But...at one point, man breaks a certain limit and goes too far. The realms of technology are going, the realms of human mind are going, what is left if the gravity of mind does no longer occur sufficient? The infinite that goes with Jupiter (not only the name of the planet but, for some reason deliberate or coincidental, the name of the Roman god).At that moment, we may all agree with Roger Ebert who says that it is a transcendent film and a silent film.Primarily, 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY relies on visuals and music. There is not much dialog and if it appears, it is reduced to the maximum minimum, almost to a pseudo computerized interaction. There is not much 'humanity' in the language, not to say feelings. Even the 'Daisy' song or 'Happy birthday' that parents sing to their son seem to lack the basic enthusiasm and result in something artificial, robot-like. Visuals and music! The former is a unique achievement that helps us all experience the film in an unforgettable way. Seeing the movie on the big screen recently, I felt its intense effects to a grand scale. Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Music, however, is an even more inspiring aspect.What a terrific choice of CLASSICAL MUSIC! Not only is it an undertone of a unique human ability, but there is another greater undertone to that. Let me quote Roger Ebert again. He observes that any music score would go with conventionalized methods of evoking action and would underline the storyline. The classical music, however, exists outside the action. It is an ever present companion of man on his journey to the unknown, on his way to hear deeper, more profoundly. The waltz by Johann Strauss THE BLUE DANUBE seems to evoke a dance in the universe, outside of any gravity and within a greater power. Meanwhile, Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Richard Strauss marks the crescendo of emotions within phases of discoveries.The absolutely unpredictable finale brings everything to an uncommon conclusion, after all. You feel as if you have just started to watch this film. Time is not important but far more thought provoking is the fact that this art does not resort to pessimism of nothingness but appears to celebrate, inside us and outside us, the infinite mystery of human life.Prepare for something hard, sometimes vague and very odd, but worth enduring till the end.

Even the 'Daisy' song or 'Happy birthday' that parents sing to their son seem to lack the basic enthusiasm and result in something artificial, robot-like. Visuals and music! The former is a unique achievement that helps us all experience the film in an unforgettable way. Seeing the movie on the big screen recently, I felt its intense effects to a grand scale. Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Music, however, is an even more inspiring aspect.What a terrific choice of CLASSICAL MUSIC! Not only is it an undertone of a unique human ability, but there is another greater undertone to that. Let me quote Roger Ebert again. He observes that any music score would go with conventionalized methods of evoking action and would underline the storyline. The classical music, however, exists outside the action. It is an ever present companion of man on his journey to the unknown, on his way to hear deeper, more profoundly. The waltz by Johann Strauss THE BLUE DANUBE seems to evoke a dance in the universe, outside of any gravity and within a greater power. Meanwhile, Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Richard Strauss marks the crescendo of emotions within phases of discoveries.The absolutely unpredictable finale brings everything to an uncommon conclusion, after all. You feel as if you have just started to watch this film. Time is not important but far more thought provoking is the fact that this art does not resort to pessimism of nothingness but appears to celebrate, inside us and outside us, the infinite mystery of human life.Prepare for something hard, sometimes vague and very odd, but worth enduring till the end.

I don't know what single word might best describe it, but the one that immediately comes to mind is creepy. Everything about the picture tends to horrify the viewer, established with the opening scene as we see the images of passing skeletal trees against a sky of night time darkness. We learn that a middle aged woman (Alida Valli) is on her way to dispose of a body in a nearby river, another failed experiment at the hands of a gifted surgeon named Genessier (Pierre Brasseur). From there, things take an even more frightening turn, as the story explores Genessier's obsession to restore the face of his daughter, horribly disfigured in a car crash for which he was responsible.The story uses some of that pseudo-scientific babble I love to come across in these types of films, that stuff about a 'heterograft', whereby radiation is a requirement to biologically modify a host body to receive a donor transplant. Because radiation is too intense in the required dosage, exsanguination is deemed the next best available strategy for the type of procedure explained by Professor Genessier to his attentive audience. Funny, but none of that was going on when the good professor got down to the real nitty gritty of his work on daughter Christiane (Edith Scob).You know, it's hard to describe, but there was something of an ethereal beauty in both the masked and newly engineered face of Christiane following the operation. Didn't you think for a moment that the new face of Christiane would be that of victim Edna Gruber (Juliette Mayniel)? Instead, you had this beautiful face appear, rather astonishingly to convey success for the questionable transplant operation. It's best described by the professor - There's something angelic about you now in a cautious appraisal of his daughter's beauty. However things take a disastrous turn as the operation proves fruitless; the girl's body rejects the new face and the mask is required once again.But you know what I found to be truly outrageous? What was with that police scheme to insert Paulette Merodon (Beatrice Altariba) into the professor's den of horror? There didn't seem to be any control in place to monitor the girl's movements, and she could have been another goner in the doctor's twisted scheme of things.Well I don't know if modern day viewers of a young age would be affected by the story as much as I was. I think the real terror for them would be watching Christiane use that ancient contraption known as a dial telephone. And then, as if to totally confuse the present day techie, boyfriend Jacques has to answer the phone without benefit of caller ID. Oh, the horror! Well in any event, I thought this film was a genuine creepfest, heartily recommended to genre fans, particularly as I mentioned earlier, to fans of classic horror films of the Forties and Fifties where the mad scientist reigns.

It's best described by the professor - There's something angelic about you now in a cautious appraisal of his daughter's beauty. However things take a disastrous turn as the operation proves fruitless; the girl's body rejects the new face and the mask is required once again.But you know what I found to be truly outrageous? What was with that police scheme to insert Paulette Merodon (Beatrice Altariba) into the professor's den of horror? There didn't seem to be any control in place to monitor the girl's movements, and she could have been another goner in the doctor's twisted scheme of things.Well I don't know if modern day viewers of a young age would be affected by the story as much as I was. I think the real terror for them would be watching Christiane use that ancient contraption known as a dial telephone. And then, as if to totally confuse the present day techie, boyfriend Jacques has to answer the phone without benefit of caller ID. Oh, the horror! Well in any event, I thought this film was a genuine creepfest, heartily recommended to genre fans, particularly as I mentioned earlier, to fans of classic horror films of the Forties and Fifties where the mad scientist reigns. In iconic fashion, the evil doctor gets his in the end here, as we learn the answer to that age old question - who let the dogs out? ","genre":"Drama, Horror"}]
