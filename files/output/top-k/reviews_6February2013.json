[{"date":"6 February 2013","score":"","review":" I was probably 12 the last time I saw it. After work I saw it on the animation\/kids DVD section at Target for 5 dollars. So I picked it up, remembering that I enjoyed it and thought it'd be a nice addition to my DVD collection. And now I can say that it is definitely in my top 5 favorite animated films, and one of my favorite movies ever.As a kid, I loved the whole idea of a little kid running into a gigantic alien robot and having to keep him a secret, very similar to E.T., except Hogarth's alien friend is over 50 feet tall and difficult to keep secret. When I saw it back then on VHS, I enjoyed it just as much as any other animated movie I liked at the time. But I didn't really grasp how wonderful the film truly was because I didn't fully understand what truly makes a movie great. It was a cartoon, so I didn't take it seriously as watching Lord of the Rings with my dad for the first time, and treated it as such a good, fun animated movie, but not on par with something live-action and teen\/adult oriented. Now having watched it again at the age of 21, there is so much this film does, so simply and subtly in fact, that it is basically perfect.You already know the synopsis for the film, but what about the characters in the film? The best thing about all of these characters, Hogarth, his mom Annie, the agent Kent, the junkyard artist Dean, and of course the Iron Giant. The relationships between these characters are so enjoyably real and seamless, their personalities meshing, connecting, and clashing as they interact with one another. Hogarth's relationship with his mom seems like a very real mother\/son relationship, and the fact that he doesn't have a dad isn't shoved in your face like most Disney movies would with dead parents not being present. It very subtly presented with a brief picture of his dad on a picture frame towards the end of the film, but by then you've already got the picture that he only has a mom and why. And the fact Kent is so hellbent on finding the giant and is constantly prying Hogarth's brain to get him to spill the beans is just hilarious at times. Hogarth absolutely does not like this guy, and has a very funny way of getting back at Kent, which I won't ruin for you. With Dean and Annie, you don't get any forced, this is awkward, kind of like you but can't say it scenes, in fact you don't see them together too much, but any moment you see them together, you can tell that they have a genuine attraction towards the other. Last but certainly not least is Hogarth and the Giant.Hogarth runs into the giant out of sheer curiosity as to what took their satellite disk one night, and is obviously terrified and yet memorized at first. Eventually he has to save the giant from being shocked to death from being tangled in some power lines but shutting the power down at the station. He loses track of the robot after that night, but decides he wants to go out an try to capture evidence that there really is a gigantic alien robot in the woods. Sure enough he runs right into him, and so their friendship begins. And through simply trying to teach him to speak and trying to lead him to a safe hiding place, you see that the giant is actually something of a curious little kid, learning and adjusting to this new world. You know he came from some faraway advanced planet, but we really don't know why or what things he is capable of (until towards the end), but you're just so drawn into how through so few words and sentences, this Iron Giant is such a wonderful character.Brad Bird and everyone who took part making this film truly put a genius effort into bringing the giant to life. Through his limited facial expressions (eyebrows, small-big bright eyes, adjustable mouth and iron teeth) and voice work by Vin Diesel, they truly make you feel for this curious, little kid giant, and the personal turmoils he has when comprehended the death of a deer, or whether or not he has a soul of his own because he has a personality and feelings. My personal favorite scene is when the giant thinks Hogarth is dead, how he gasps in shock, how his hand trembles after touching his limp body, how he just starts to whimper and cover his face in sadness, it's just perfect. The Iron Giant himself is one of the best animated characters in history, with a team of amazing artists behind him to turn a what might have otherwise been a generic robot into a genuine, connectible, and memorable character.Ultimately the moral in the end is killing is bad, and take time to love what you have around you always. People bash this film so badly for the fact that it's a robot and should not have feelings, and all the political references and connections it has in this film, and I do not believe that's any reason to bash it whatsoever. I could go on scene by scene narrating the movie and explaining what I love about each scene, but I want to let you all watch it for yourself.The Iron Giant is a solid 10\/10 for me, with amazing animation, wonderful and lush characters with supreme voice actors, such as Jennifer Anniston as Annie or Harry Connick Jr. as Dean, and a simple easy to follow story that is pieced and scripted together so well, that it just comes out perfectly. As I said before, one of my favorite movies ever, and for many a good reason.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 February 2013","score":"","review":" I was probably 12 the last time I saw it.

Filled with Brilliant performances from James Dean,Natalie Wood,Sal Mineo and the rest of the cast,great direction and writing,Rebel Without A Cause is one of the all time great classics of cinema and is one of my favorite films.Set in Los Angeles,California in 1955,Rebel Without A Cause tells the story of a troubled teen named Jim Stark(James Dean)who is a good kid,but is always getting into trouble making Jim and his parents moving to different cities. While Jim is new in town,wants to make a fresh start and not get into trouble,Jim unintentionally gets into it with a bunch of bad local kids while at the same time forming relationships with two other troubled teens Judy(Natalie Wood)and Plato(Sal Mineo). Together Jim,Judy and Plato deal with love,tragedy,death and the complications of being a teenager.Rebel Without A Cause is a classic that came out a month after James Dean's death and immediately made an impact with young audiences in 1955 and was the film that made James Dean a movie icon and was a film,in my opinion,that helped reinvent and revolutionize the Teen film genre. One of things I love about the film is that while the fashions and style are of the 1950s,the feelings of the teenagers and themes in the film are timeless. The teenage years,while fun,can also be complicated and confusing and RWAC puts in the forefront where we can relate to the characters Jim,Judy and Plato. Jim Stark is a classic character that we can all relate to because while the film is called Rebel Without A Cause,and while Jim is a rebel,at the same time isn't really a rebel in the traditional sense of the word,because he's not telling his parents to leave him alone or getting into trouble with other kids because he wants to,Jim just wants his parents to understand him and as for trouble with other kids I don't think Jim is looking for trouble it's just that trouble finds him. The film also gives viewers glimpses into Jim,Judy and Plato's home lives and why the characters do the things they do. Jim's parents love him,but don't understand him,Judy's parents are tough and distant and Plato's home life is the most tragic because his parents are never around. Jim,Judy and Plato are complex,three-dimensional characters that we can relate to because they are trying to find their way in the world while trying to figure out themselves and who they are and the three characters form a friendship because of their home lives and discover they're rebels who actually have a lot in common and not so different. The way the film depicts teenagers and their relationships with their parents is powerful and relevant as it was in 1955. What I also love about the film is that(with the exception of the first 17-20 minutes)the whole entire film takes place in one 24 hour day which raises the stakes and the situations even higher for Jim who has to deal with bullies,parents and the classic chickie run all within one day. I believe the reason the film is set one day is because in one single day anything can happen and no one can prepare for it. The screenplay by Stewart Stern(With the Story by Nicholas Ray and the Adaptation by Irving Shulman)is well-written and memorable giving the characters great dialog,multiple dimensions and amazing realism,with some of the dialog ringing true today. The ending of the film is tragic and gut-wrenching and adds to the film's greatness and status as a classic. While watching Rebel is always a treat,it's sad to watch the film knowing what happened to the three lead actors. Dean was killed in a car crash the year the film came out,Wood tragically drown and died in 1983 and Mineo was stabbed to death in 1976. James Dean is one of my favorite actors and he truly is an icon,but sometimes I always wondered what if Dean lived longer. Who knows Dean probably could've done more films and probably given greater performances than the three feature films he was in,but with Rebel,East Of Eden and Giant we were given three flawless performances that add to the greatness,mystery and iconic stature of Dean who's time on earth was short,but,his impact on the world of acting and cinema is long and Dean will always and forever be one of the greatest actors of all time. The whole cast is wonderful. James Dean is simply excellent and masterful as Jim Stark bringing an intense,dark sadness. Although he was excellent in his other two films East Of Eden and Giant,this role is my favorite James Dean performance and his greatest and most iconic performance. Natalie Wood is brilliant and beautiful as Judy,Jim's love interest and has great scenes and chemistry with Dean. Sal Mineo is amazing as the disturbed and unstable Plato and has great scenes with Dean and Wood. Jim Backus and Ann Doran do wonderful jobs as Mr. and Mrs Stark,Jim's parents. Corey Allen is great as Buzz,Judy's boyfriend and Jim's rival. Edward Platt is effective as cop Ray Fremick,a sympathetic cop who helps Jim. Dennis Hopper(R.I.P) doesn't have many lines,but does well with his role as Goon. Frank Mazzola(Crunch)Marietta Canty(Crawford Family Maid)and Jack Grinnage(Moose)give good performances as well.Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent,with Ray making great use of the widescreen cinematography and using great angles and camera movements. Great direction,Ray.Leonard Rosenman score is wonderful and adds to the intense,dark and tragic tone of the film. A great score.In final word,if you're a fan of James Dean,Teen films,Coming Of Age films or cinema in general,you'll love Rebel Without A Cause a classic film that will stand the test of time and should be in any movie lovers collection.

But still its nice watching a nostalgia movie even if you're not part of the generation that's represented in this movie. Teen movies always tend to be period pieces of the time that they were made in but what makes this movie work for me is the relatable story and characters. No matter what generation you're part of you'll always find something that you can identify with.The story follows the single night of a bunch of high school graduates spending their last night before they head off to college in 1962. Curt Henderson (played by a very young Richard Dreyfuss) cant decide whether he wants to go to college or not and while driving with his friends sees a very beautiful blonde girl and spends the rest of the movie trying to find out who she is before he decides to leave.

(The film's star, Sean Connery, had a few years earlier starred in Just Cause, another film cobbled together from themes and motifs taken from others). The film's theme of a reclusive but kindly older man assisting a teenage boy with his academic studies seems to have been borrowed from Mel Gibson's The Man without a Face. The reclusive writer William Forrester bears similarities to the character played by James Earl Jones in Field of Dreams. (Both characters seem to have been inspired by J. D. Salinger, although while Salinger was a native-born New Yorker, Forrester is originally from Scotland- a detail presumably inserted to suit Connery, who has never had much of a gift for accents). And the character of Jamal, another academically gifted but troubled young man from a working-class background, recalls Gus Van Sant's own Good Will Hunting. Jamal Wallace is a black New York teenager whose academic brilliance and talent for basketball win him a scholarship to a prestigious private high school. His relationship with Forrester, who lives in a flat in his neighbourhood, is initially a difficult one- the two first meet when Jamal acts on a dare from a schoolfriend to sneak into the apartment- but eventually the two become friends. Forrester, who has published nothing since his one and only much-praised novel came out in the fifties, is impressed by the young man's talent for writing and agrees to tutor him in this respect. Plagiarism may be frowned upon in academic life, but not so in Hollywood. Indeed, it is often positively encouraged in the film industry, and the results are not always bad. Sommersby, for example, is a good film, in my view at least as good as The Return of Martin Guerre from which its plot was blatantly lifted. Similarly, Finding Forrester is, if not as good a film as Sommersby, at least an interesting one, and its interest is not diminished by the fact that it contains elements borrowed from other films, because it succeeds in giving those elements a new twist. Van Sant and his scriptwriter use them to comment on race relations in American society, a theme not present in any of the films mentioned above. The film's main antagonist is Jamal's literature teacher, Professor Crawford. (It would appear that in America the title professor can be applied to schoolteachers; in Britain it is reserved for the most distinguished university lecturers). Crawford, himself an unsuccessful writer embittered by the failure of his literary ambitions, is a covert racist who refuses to admit that a black student, especially a black student from a poor background, could have any talent for academic work. To his way of thinking, Jamal's natural sphere is the basketball court, not the classroom, and he takes any opportunity to belittle Jamal's written work. This highlights a problem prevalent in Britain as well as America, the tendency on the part of some white teachers and others in authority to assume that the talents of people from ethnic minorities can only lie in certain directions, generally sport and music, and to overlook the other gifts that they might possess. The film, in fact, can be seen as the story of how Forrester helps Jamal to define his own identity, free from the preconceptions of Crawford and of white society in general. Towards the end of the film Jamal misses two free throw shots in a vital basketball game, and the possibility is raised that he may have done so deliberately in order to confound the perception that black men are good at sport and not much else. There is a fine performance from Connery as Forrester, testy and obstinate but basically a kindly, decent man. This was to be Connery's penultimate film before retirement; his last was to be The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen from three years later. From an actor nearing the end of his career to one at the very beginning. This was Rob Brown's first-ever film, and he initially only auditioned for a part as an extra. He ended up, however, being cast in the leading role, despite having no previous acting experience, even as an amateur. It was a brave move on Van Sant's part to cast an unknown 16-year-old, but it is one that pays off; Brown is able to bring to his part the sort of freshness and immediacy that are often missing from those films (too many to mention) where teenage schoolchildren are played by established actors in their late twenties. (Or in some cases thirties). There is also a good performance by F. Murray Abraham as Crawford. The film is partly about challenging preconceptions, and it also overturned one of my own, namely that Van Sant is one of the most overrated directors currently working in the industry, although it must be admitted that this preconception was based upon some strong evidence. I found Good Will Hunting, for example, long-winded and boring, despite a good acting contribution from Robin Williams, My Own Private Idaho and The Secret Language of Cranes were confusing and self- consciously artsy, and that awful version of Hitchcock's Psycho can serve as an object lesson in how not to remake a classic movie. When I saw Finding Forrester on television recently, however, I was glad that I resisted my initial impulse to switch channels as soon as I saw the director's name in the opening credits, because this was the first Van Sant film I actually enjoyed. It combines a provocative look at racial issues with a touching coming-of-age drama about the friendship between a young man and an old one.

So naturally, you'd think I'd like the 1940 mystery Rebecca, the only film in his career to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, right? Wrong! In fact, I don't think the Academy Awards are a credible source to find the greatest films of all time since a couple of them don't even hold up well. I'll go even further by saying that after the two times I've seen this particular film, I've been very underwhelmed by what I saw. Rebecca tells the story of a young woman (Joan Fontaine) who meets and falls in love with a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). These two get married within a few weeks and he takes her to his massive mansion with a great number of employees where they'll spend their honeymoon together. The housekeeper (Judith Anderson) doesn't seem to be very fond of the new bride. And as this couple spends more time there, she begins to become haunted by the memory and presence of his first wife. She becomes haunted to the point where her husband seems to be affected by the memory of his wife as well. From what I just described, the plot wouldn't sound like a Best Picture Oscar winner, would it? Regardless, critics and audiences seem to declare this as a very good film. While I admit that this film is far from terrible and admit to being invested in the film's first couple minutes, it later became too silly and redundant for my taste. But what do I like about Rebecca that is worthy of mentioning? Well, the black and white cinematography is pretty sharp and it serves the underlying dark tones of the widower's castle-like mansion well. The performances by Laurence Olivier and Judith Anderson are very strong and their characters enrich the drama as they're supposed to. I found that Franz Waxman's musical score had the right tone for this type of dark story that was being told. For me, Rebecca goes downhill when the newly married couple gets to the mansion since the film then operates on a mechanical, repetitive narrative rhythm and sticks to it seemingly for the rest of the film. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again. The couple has a strange conflict, but then everything's okay again.

For that matter, the conflicts or parts of the picture where the couple suspects something unusual is happening in the mansion weren't that exciting.

It's not that the movie is bad, it's because it shows so many signs of greatness yet falls short mostly because of two odd decisions Arnold and the PG-13 rating. The story was surprisingly compelling for an Arnold film, but this movie should have never cast Arnold if they wanted to focus on story and character. Since they did cast Arnold, it was mind boggling to me that the action was so toned down and lame, especially when compared to his past sci-fi flicks like Total Recall and The Running Man.So after nearly 13 years since I first saw it in the theaters I decided to watch it again, and have the same problems I did the first time through. Whose bright idea was it to cast Arnold? Whose bright idea was it to make it PG-13? These decisions kill the movie.I never paid much attention to ratings and their effects on movies, particular the action genre, until 4 years ago when I watched Taken and felt something was missing from the action scenes. While Taken was still a great action flick with cleverly edited fights to avoid the R rating, the action in The 6th Day is watered down as hell. The action scenes are drawn out and boring as if they were never supposed to be there in the first place, just added in because Arnold was the lead. The nags I have with this film- An uncensored Michael Rooker could have been just as awesome as Michael Ironside in Total Recall.- Arnold's character was a combat seasoned war veteran, yet we didn't see him in any meaningful fights and only saw him break one guy's neck in the tamest way possible. He also spent most of his time fighting the woman, which was odd. There should have been one hell of a bloody battle between him and Terry Crews, but we got nothing.- The guns are plasma based and while they look cool at first, ballistic based weapons would have been far more satisfying. The plasma gun allowed them to keep in line with the rating and avoid bloody bullet holes and traditional gun violence.

He also spent most of his time fighting the woman, which was odd. There should have been one hell of a bloody battle between him and Terry Crews, but we got nothing.- The guns are plasma based and while they look cool at first, ballistic based weapons would have been far more satisfying.

As much as I can't stand those awful Ewoks, the worst part about this Star Wars is a script that sucks the life out of the main characters..especially Han Solo (you get the sense that being in carbon freeze for who-knows-how- long softened his brain). Luke's no fun anymore either. Hamill tries too hard to sound like Alec Guinness as Obi Wan did in the first one, and it doesn't work. Then there's the emperor, who is not just evil, but obviously a narcissistic a-hole who loves to hear himself talk. In several scenes he says pretty much the same annoying stuff (telling Luke that Luke now serves him, blah blah). I think the audience got the point the first time he said it. There are basically two parts to this one. The first is Han Solo's rescue from Jabba the Hut, which is great once it gets going. The problem is that it seems to take forever and a day to get going. Then there's the attack on the new Death Star, with three different scenarios the actual attack with the fighters, the raid on the forest moon to get the shield down, and Luke's confrontation with Vader and the emperor. The scenes with the fighters attacking the Death Star were certainly involved. George Lucas threw everything but the kitchen sink in effects-wise, to the point where I felt bombarded by it all.

Lucas (and Richard Marquand, who directed) were obviously going for full-on drama in the Vader\/Skywalker\/Emperor confrontation, where Vader is as conflicted as Luke, if not more so.

At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. One could say Raging Bull is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. Being cautious to call this a sports drama, boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In Raging Bull, you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it affects the rest of life of DeNiro. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey, he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles ever done by him. This movie is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Joe Pesci. What I liked most about the movie was the depiction of a person who did not hit the deserving note in life even though he carried enormous talent just because of the work ethics he carried.

The film begins with a ship coming into port and a couple sailors, Clarence (Frank Sinatra) and Joe (Gene Kelly), are out on the prowl for some 'dames'. Just like in On the Town (another musical from MGM where the two are sailors on the prowl), Kelly plays the ladies' man and Sinatra plays the very shy guy--and you almost wonder if On the Town was meant to be a sequel. Joe is so sure of himself that he promises to get Clarence a girl. Unfortunately, on the way to find women, they meet a cute runaway kid (Dean Stockwell) and they take him home. Soon, his guardian, Susan (Kathryn Grayson) arrives and Joe wants to leave. But Clarence is infatuated with her--and Joe decides, reluctantly, to stick around and help Clarence with Susan. However, to impress her, Kelly makes up a HUGE lie involving her getting an audition with the famous pianist, José Iturbi.

Baldwin nonchalantly gives us the narcissistic essence of his character, and Parker is a riot acting as if she's being asked to commit murder instead of something she's done a million times.The end shouldn't come as any surprise.

Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker, David Paymer, Charles Durning, Julia Stiles, and Rebecca Pidgeon star in State and Main, a 2000 film written and directed b David Mamet.Macy is the director, Walt Price, of a film shooting on location. For reasons not disclosed, they've been run out of one small town and now are in another one in Vermont. With him are his writer, Joseph Turner White,(Hoffman), heretofore a playwright, his stars (Baldwin & Parker), and various other assistants, cameramen, etc.The name of the film is The Old Mill and the exciting thing about this town is that it actually has one. Well, it had one - they find out it burned down. This is actually the least of their problems. The female star refuses to bare her breasts, though someone comments that most of America can draw them from memory; then she holds them up for $800,000. The male lead likes underage girls and gets in a car accident with one in the car. Unfortunately, the writer is a witness, and due to the influence of a townswoman, Ann, he has fallen for (Pidgeon) he wants to maintain his integrity.The Mayor (Durning) is willing to turn over the whole town to them seemingly for free until someone finds out it would cost $6 million to build a set of the town, so all the playing up to the Mayor seems to be for nothing. And an attorney, ex-fiancé of Ann's, is ready to extract revenge on the company by legal means. Meanwhile, the wife of someone on the crew is having a baby, White can't type because he caught his finger in a fish hook, and the Price keeps asking for the scene where the horse dies. When White says, You know you can't kill a horse, the director's angry answer is f--- me. I'm sure some of this is very true to life, especially the director being hounded from all sides constantly and having to put out a million fires. Also the cover-up of the accident I'm sure has happened. The movie captures the awe that townspeople have when Hollywood types come in to make a film, as well as the self-indulgence of the actors.Most of the time, the film was pretty funny. It's not Mamet's best by any means. It's a light story with some very good performances, particularly by Macy, who plays a determined director who pretends to be nice to perfection, and Hoffman, who walks around in a dream world on his first film.

This thanks to the Nine Old Men and their long experience with Uncle Walt.The movie is utterly charming although, I have to admit, it isn't perfect and it also has a silly side to it. The silly side is the fact that the cats are going to heir Madame's fortune. I mean, what use animals would have of money? No matter how clever they are, animals are animals. They don't know what money is and they don't understand the concept of money.Having that said, Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is a loving, kind-hearted eccentric old lady and if you don't take the mentioned silly side of the film too seriously (and it's important not to), it makes for a very rewarding movie experience.Many characters are great fun. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille is not only a very nice old lady but also funny. The very elderly and eccentric lawyer Georges Hautecourt is truly amusing, I wish more elderly people could be as playful as him. The butler Edgar is much fun either, except when he goes crazy and his intentions become darker at the ending. The hound dogs Napoleon and Lafayette are so stupid that they are hilarious.

NO is the first film in the James Bond series and introduced the world to a character who would go on to spawn one of the most successful franchises in film history. I had only seen DR. NO once a long time ago when TBS would run their annual 007 marathons I remembered little about it, so I figured it was time to reacquaint myself with it (and the rest of the series). The first 007 movie is actually better than I originally remember. I'm sure it's because I was in my teens and, unless a Bond movie feature a gimmicky villain and an abundance of action with clever gadgets, I wasn't interested. DR. NO is a great film in that it came before the franchise turned to camp and novelty to draw its audience. No, better yet DR. NO is an actual spy film. The film opens with the murder of a British agent and his secretary in Jamaica. The agent, Strangways, has been investigating allegations from the Americans that a signal has been emanating from the region that interferes with their missile launches. With a moon-orbit mission launch on the horizon, it is vital that the source of the signal is discovered. Enter James Bond, agent 007 of the British Secret Service. He travels to Jamaica and teams with CIA agent Felix Leiter and local fisherman Quarrel to gather information on the mysterious Dr. No and his base of operations on Crab Key.What I love most about DR. NO and the second film, FROM Russia WITH LOVE, is that they feel the most like genuine espionage films. The majority of the film is 007's investigation into the death of Strangways and the missile-toppling signal. The action scenes are, for the most part, small and brutal. Fist fights and an occasional shootout, with only a single major action sequence in the end of the film. At this point, Bond isn't a renowned action hero and spends more time determining friend from foe than gunning down henchmen and making spectacular escapes from dangerous situations. The first film is completely devoid of the usual gadgets we've come to associate with the franchise, though Q does make an appearance. This Q isn't yet Desmond Llewelyn, who would go on to inhabit the role in the next film and continue until 1999. Major Boothroyd (Q's real name) is instead portrayed in this one film by Peter Burton and the only device he provides 007 is his brand new Walther PPK. No laser watches or hidden transmitters in this movie. DR. NO is much more grounded without all the craziness. As I mentioned, I love that this film follows Bond on his mission, learning of his enemy bit by bit and dodging assassins at every turn. We don't even meet our villain face-to-face, the titular Dr. No, until the final act of the film. Being a Bond movie, our villain has a quirk to make him a bit more threatening metal hands. A genius nuclear physicist, he is a man of evil intentions who wants to remind the world that shunned him of his power. Dr. No is played by Robert Wiseman, who gives the villain an unnerving calm demeanor while carrying a major chip on his shoulder. He's not amused with 007 antics but he won't let the agents interference deter him from his master plan.DR. NO introduces us to most of the conventions that would become commonplace in the series. Bernard Lee is the first (and arguably the best) M, and Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny adorable flirtations with 007 are here from the start. Of course, the movie also introduces the concept of SPECTRE. SPECTRE, an evil organization intent on world domination, will become Bond's #1 enemy over the course of the Connery films and, despite disappearing from the films in 1973, establishes themselves as the most iconic of Bond's adversaries. DR. NO also features one of the most legendary Bond women in the entire series Ursula Andress as Honey Rider. The shot of Rider rises from the ocean water in her white bikini with a knife at her side is an image that defined the role of Bond women in the future beautiful and exotic with a hint of danger. Andress is absolutely gorgeous and set a standard for the women in 007's life. This is, of course, Sean Connery's first time filling the shoes of James Bond but you'd think he'd been doing it for years. He's a natural and, with guidance from director Terrence Young, made Bond what he is today.The film holds up incredibly well despite having been released fifty years ago. The exotic locations and set design are fantastic, and the plot is engaging even when it slows down. There is a bit of dragging in the middle of the film but it picks right back up when Bond and Quarrel arrive at Crab Key, which soon culminates in the reveal of our main villain. DR. NO might not grab some people as a great 007 film because it came at a time when there was less camp and more espionage, but I respect it for being a fun thriller and jump-starting one of my favorite series.

The duologue's are realistic enough & I still loved the line that HAWKE used to convince JULIE to spend the day with him in Vienna .If you haven't seen the film it is worthwhile just to hear this line and to discover what is the basic art of making any sensible romantic movie .

I saw this movie when it came out in 2001 and just watched it again for the first time since. When I first saw it, Tom Wilkinson blew me away, and his performance was just as amazing tonight. How does one capture the subtlety of being a normal human being confronted with the murder of a son? Much consideration is given to actors who portray extreme characters, showing their range. But the most difficult and amazing thing to do as an actor, in my opinion, is play someone who is not so. Not to be average or boring, but to be so real and so believable that it opens up a world of empathetic truth due to the foundation of reality it creates. Watch it. He masterfully embodies the character, in this circumstance, to a level beyond believable. He is so good in it that it speaks volumes beyond the themes of the film. Sissy Spacek is also deserving of high praise. Somehow they both capture, to me, what a marriage really would look like in that situation. High praise of course to Todd Field for his superb direction. If anyone cares about acting, or telling a great story, I recommend this film with all of my being.

Johnny Depp plays William Blake, who gets hired to be an accountant for a metal company in a town called Machine in 1876.

With nowhere to go, Blake hooks up with a woman, only to have her hubby walk in on them and kill her and wound him. Blake kills the guy and has to flee, since it turns out that this guy is the corporate CEO's son (and the CEO is more concerned that Blake stole a horse than that his son got murdered). Out in the open, Blake meets up with an Indian named Nobody (Gary Farmer), who calls him stupid white man. That's when the movie really starts to seem metaphysical.I thought that this movie was quite good, although it's definitely not for everyone. All I can say is good filmmakers make mistakes, because otherwise they wouldn't be taking risks. Jarmusch tries to grow here but misses. Still, despite some patches which don't work, especially Lance Henrikson's character being a cannibal, this does achieve a poetic quality (as it should, since the main character is named William Blake) not unfamiliar to the genre. Of course, it helps to have actors like Depp and Gary Farmer, who takes the noble savage stereotype and makes it real.

The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama.The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld.The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character.Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime\/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention.

But in It's a mad mad mad mad world, they did meet and these people did everything within their power to make sure that they get to the money first before the other party.Getting an all-round comic cast, with numerous cameos from stars like Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, and others, must have been a mountain climb for producer and director Stanley Kramer, who got the script idea from William Rose, whose initial idea was first based on a bunch of characters in Scotland, but Kramer later pushed for the movie to have an American setting. The movie's name changed from Something a Little Less Serious to Damn Thing After Another and then it was named It's a Mad World gotten from a 1605 comedy Titled A Mad World, My Masters. It was later on during production that the pair (Rose and Kramer) added two more Mads, to the movie title.The movie plot was about a man (who was wanted by the police for robbery) who had a nasty car accident and in his final words told complete strangers who gathered to help that there is $ 350,000 buried under a big W in Santa Rosita State Park in Santa Rosita Beach. With this information the group at first tried to see if they could share the money equally but after 17 different sharing scenarios and no one agreeing, everyman set off on his own to go claim the money for himself. The main star in the movie is Spencer Tracy who played Captain T. G. Culpeper.The scenes that were glued to my mind in this movie were the scene where Dingy and Benjy were stuck in an airplane, and they had to pilot it because the real pilot was drunk and got knocked out (by leaving the steering stick of the plane to get a drink). The other scene that stood out or got glued to my mind is the scene where couple Melville and Monica got trapped in a hardware store and Melville ended up wrecking the place all in failed attempts to get out.Here is a movie that I can bet you if you do get to watch, you will like and you will come to love the dialogue.

With this information the group at first tried to see if they could share the money equally but after 17 different sharing scenarios and no one agreeing, everyman set off on his own to go claim the money for himself. The main star in the movie is Spencer Tracy who played Captain T. G. Culpeper.The scenes that were glued to my mind in this movie were the scene where Dingy and Benjy were stuck in an airplane, and they had to pilot it because the real pilot was drunk and got knocked out (by leaving the steering stick of the plane to get a drink). The other scene that stood out or got glued to my mind is the scene where couple Melville and Monica got trapped in a hardware store and Melville ended up wrecking the place all in failed attempts to get out.Here is a movie that I can bet you if you do get to watch, you will like and you will come to love the dialogue. One thing though the movie is known for its length it is over 2 hours 30 minutes long but for me, it was worth the fun.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"6 February 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I like this movie for one thing; it is definite that when you are done watching you will walk away with some scenes glued to your mind. The idiotic dialogue and the way the characters are made to be so greedy that it seemed too out of place that a group of people with such insatiable greed will ever meet. But in It's a mad mad mad mad world, they did meet and these people did everything within their power to make sure that they get to the money first before the other party.Getting an all-round comic cast, with numerous cameos from stars like Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, and others, must have been a mountain climb for producer and director Stanley Kramer, who got the script idea from William Rose, whose initial idea was first based on a bunch of characters in Scotland, but Kramer later pushed for the movie to have an American setting.
