Aged 73 at the time of filming, his deep voice resonates and rumbles out of the screen magnificently, punctuated with heavy breathing, completely dominating the screen whenever he speaks. There is a scene in which he woos Jane Fonda as they sit on a log; it is hard to imagine any woman not falling for the aging Peck as his words pour forth to her like poetry. This is the voice I imagine God speaks with.Peck's character is world-weary, and he engages everyone around him with detachment and some irony; except, watch for the scene towards the end in which he takes General Arroyo's black horse out for a ride in the country. The pure joy on Peck's face is delightful, genuine and pleasing to see.And speaking of the horse one of the most spectacular and shocking animal moments in screen history has to be the shot of General Arroyo shooting his horse in the head, near the end of the film. The timing of the sprawling horse is flawless, the effect electrifying.Jimmy Smits is excellent as General Arroyo, and it is interesting how the general becomes more sympathetic as the movie moves along.Sadly, though, the parts don't come together to make a great whole. Yes, Old Gringo is beautifully filmed, but it goes on for too long, and furthermore, it is tiring to have to work out, through the first half-hour, who is fighting for which side, and who are the Mirandas.Worst of all is the presence of Jane Fonda. She's not bad, but look if you want to look skinny, hang around fat people. If you don't want people to notice that your acting is wooden and uninspiring, don't appear in a movie with Gregory Peck. I think an actress like Kate Capshaw (who plays a similar character in the 1987 TV-movie version of The Quick and the Dead) would have played Ms. Winslow much more appealingly.A final question is Peck already dead when he is executed at the movie's end? His eyes are first looking at Arroyo, then moments later facing forward at the executioners. Hard to say.Old Gringo is worth watching to see Gregory Peck still eat up the screen in this, the winter of his career; but have the fast-forward ready.

Instead of meeting their host &#x96; the peculiar U.N.

Shortly after, they're being murdered one by one in imaginative methods that resemble the lyrics of the 10 Little Indians nursery rhyme. After discovering they are the only ones on the island, the continuously shrinking group realizes that the killer must be one of them and becomes extremely suspicious. It's a downright beautiful and enchanting version, massively benefiting from René Clair's surefooted direction and the devoted performances of a terrific ensemble cast; including the almighty Walter Huston, Richard Haydn and C.

Thelma (Gena Davis) is married to a man who likes his wife to stay quiet so he can watch football. One day they decide to break out of their normal life and jump in the car and hit the road. Their journey, however, turns into a flight when Louise kills a man who threatens to rape Thelma. They decide to go to Mexico, but soon they are hunted by American police. This original story is one that tests the bounds of freedom and happiness. Thelma & Louise is a sweet and cheerful film that fails at the end and drags on a little too long but will keep you completely entertained and if you have an analytic mind it will call you to decide if your life is fulfilled and free. First off, Susan Sarandon and Gena Davis have wonderful chemistry together and work beautifully here. Both of them give dramatic and funny performances to portray ordinary women stuck in their lives. At times they also have fun with their roles. Ridley Scott directs this fun film with a fun energy to it. He doesn't make it seem too realistic, but visually tells a good story that writer Callie Khouri would be proud of. She creates a dazzling original story that not many writers would think of. If it were little more violent it would feel like a Tarantino flick. Khouri develops Thelma and Louise well at first, but once they hit the road she doesn't quite make us grasp for them due to carrying on the story a little too long. It's still a great story. The film overall tests us to ask ourselves if we're satisfied with life and how in order to survive in this world you must be happy and have friendship.

I suppose that's the best summary of my experience, watching Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem For a Dream' for the second time. This stylish drama has a great deal to give in terms of style and story. Basically, the film's about four people dealing in their own way with an addiction. Harry (Jared Leto), his companion Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion are heroin fiends, trying to scrap enough money together to escape from it all. Television is Sara Goldfarb's (Harry's mother, Ellen Burstyn) drug, and thinking she's going to be on a game show, she is determined to lose weight and begins a pill-diet.On the surface, addiction is central in this film. But honestly, I think 'Requiem for a dream' isn't about addiction, but rather about trying to get away from it all, alienation, an escapism which creates a division between the real world and the dreams. All four drug-addled characters strive to escape from reality, which they almost seem to achieve but then fall back into the real world. Sara wants to lose weight so she can wear her red dress and feel younger again. Aronofosky covers these interesting human themes with the motive of drug addiction, and that makes it a very sad film. This film stays with you, and Aronofsky gives you this lasting impression with the great climax. The naturalistic plot of deterioration has a shattering climax, enhanced by the soundtrack. Everything comes together, it is a climactic mix of drama, horror, sadness, relief, acceptance.Aside from the story, 'Requiem for a Dream' is even more about atmosphere. extreme close-ups of the characters' sweaty faces, long tracking shots and time-lapse photography create an atmosphere of mystery, sadness and tragedy.

I suppose that's the best summary of my experience, watching Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem For a Dream' for the second time. This stylish drama has a great deal to give in terms of style and story. Basically, the film's about four people dealing in their own way with an addiction. Harry (Jared Leto), his companion Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion are heroin fiends, trying to scrap enough money together to escape from it all. Television is Sara Goldfarb's (Harry's mother, Ellen Burstyn) drug, and thinking she's going to be on a game show, she is determined to lose weight and begins a pill-diet.On the surface, addiction is central in this film. But honestly, I think 'Requiem for a dream' isn't about addiction, but rather about trying to get away from it all, alienation, an escapism which creates a division between the real world and the dreams. All four drug-addled characters strive to escape from reality, which they almost seem to achieve but then fall back into the real world. Sara wants to lose weight so she can wear her red dress and feel younger again. Aronofosky covers these interesting human themes with the motive of drug addiction, and that makes it a very sad film. This film stays with you, and Aronofsky gives you this lasting impression with the great climax. The naturalistic plot of deterioration has a shattering climax, enhanced by the soundtrack. Everything comes together, it is a climactic mix of drama, horror, sadness, relief, acceptance.Aside from the story, 'Requiem for a Dream' is even more about atmosphere. extreme close-ups of the characters' sweaty faces, long tracking shots and time-lapse photography create an atmosphere of mystery, sadness and tragedy.

I re watched it on 2m x 2m screen, with sound system and all that stuff, and you know, it's not that cool anymore. I know it sounds kinda stupid. This picture was one of my favorite (probably the favorite) when i was 10- 12 years old. Whats not to like! A absolutely calm, cool, muscular Sylvester Stallone at his very best (not as good as Rocky although) in a superb shoot em up flick, with some macho one liners, revenge, simple love and lots, tons of action action action - it's was a blast so say the least.At 28 years, i can safely say, Rambo First Blood Part II aged already a lot. There are action flicks, that you can still safely watch 20 - 30 years after they release, like Speed, Die Hard, Predator - they are timeless. Rambo First Blood Part II sadly isn't one of them. It was cool to simply remember the old scenes, words, moves and etc. but sadly it's look and most important feels very old, it's absolutely unrealistic, which kinda threw the suspense and all coolines down - the reason why Speed still works as hell is that it's absolutely realistic and suspenseful with great acting all the way long, and Rambo II is not acted very well, it's a macho 80's kinda stuff slick, that sadly does not clicks like it use to be.Overall, because you have all probably have seen this click, i will give it 10\/10, just because of the memories, it forever will be one of those flicks that i used to watch when i was a kid.

It spans through his life from childhood to his death.The film is on for over 3 hours, but I made the big mistake of watching it with a 2 year old around... there was a lot of pausing and a lot of noise. I did understand the film, but I have to admit that it was a nightmare to get through. It literally took me over 6 hours to watch!The story was harsh in places. He went through so much in his life that made him stronger. What I liked about this is he was not the perfect man. He made mistakes and paid for them.The story is very long, but it was entertaining. There were moments where I thought it was dragged out a bit. I know this is a classic but to be honest, it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I didn't really know what to expect. I had not seen anything about this, apart from the fact it is widely known as a classic. I don't think it deserves to be called a classic, but it is a good movie.One of the great things about this film was the acting. The performances were really well done. The movie starred Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago. Omar did a brilliant job. His character was so full of feeling and emotion and that comes down to the fantastic job by Omar. Other great performances were done by Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness. I was a little disappointed that Alec wasn't in it more. I am a fan of his work and wished he had a bigger part.There are not many effects in this, but there are a couple of scenes with blood. The blood looked so fake. Some of the make up was really well done, but then on other parts it really let slip. But the film was made in 1965, so I don't expect it to have amazing effects. For it's time it was perfect.

I did understand the film, but I have to admit that it was a nightmare to get through. It literally took me over 6 hours to watch!The story was harsh in places. He went through so much in his life that made him stronger. What I liked about this is he was not the perfect man. He made mistakes and paid for them.The story is very long, but it was entertaining. There were moments where I thought it was dragged out a bit. I know this is a classic but to be honest, it was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I didn't really know what to expect. I had not seen anything about this, apart from the fact it is widely known as a classic. I don't think it deserves to be called a classic, but it is a good movie.One of the great things about this film was the acting. The performances were really well done. The movie starred Omar Sharif as Yuri Zhivago. Omar did a brilliant job. His character was so full of feeling and emotion and that comes down to the fantastic job by Omar. Other great performances were done by Julie Christie, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness. I was a little disappointed that Alec wasn't in it more. I am a fan of his work and wished he had a bigger part.There are not many effects in this, but there are a couple of scenes with blood. The blood looked so fake. Some of the make up was really well done, but then on other parts it really let slip. But the film was made in 1965, so I don't expect it to have amazing effects. For it's time it was perfect.

No matter. The comedy rises above plot. The horsemanship is so good; the costumes and sets are wonderful. The special effects are woven into the story to great effect.

He brings the nameless boy to the hospital. It turns out to be Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack)'s child Brady. The Langs moved in two months ago and it's the first time Michael had talked to them. He teaches a course in American Terrorism at George Washington University. His FBI agent wife was killed leaving him alone with their son. He's dating Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis). The Langs seems to be good people until he starts suspecting them of being terrorists.There is a fictional past St Louis bombing as part of the story which is a thinly veiled reference to the Oklahoma bombing. It hits a little too close to the mark. It needs more differentiation to move away from the feel of ripped-from-the-headlines. The movie starts off slowly with the suburbia. It picks up a little bit of speed with some paranoia and darkness underneath. Bridges and Robbins do a pretty good job selling it. However it gets bog down with a lot of conspiracy theory investigation. The conspiracy is too big and way too complicated. It's also very annoying to have a stupid FBI agent. It's an easy cliché which adds nothing interesting. It would have been so much better to keep to the loner terrorist from everyday life. Doing the reverse is a fun exercise but not much more. The problem is that the filmmakers never ask why. It's a lot of convenient convoluted plot to do something that is questionable at best.

I've always liked William Hurt (and he up to par as usual) but have felt rather indifferent about Andie MacDowell so it came as a nice surprise that she has a pretty good singing voice. Jean Stapleton played the 'friend' and keeper who took care of Michael as he waited for his new 'mission' to arrive. You can't not like her here. I've also never thought much of Robert Pastorelli, though I am sorry for the way he ended but for me Pastorelli just didn't have any grip. He seemed suited for Murphy Brown but in every other role he just never seemed to be convincing, this was no exception either. John Travolta is at his best in these types of roles where he plays charming, sassy, irreverent Vinny Barbarino sorts of characters. Michael is an angel with one final mission on Earth and while here he wants to enjoy good food, beer, cigarettes, dancing, even fighting and carnal delights before he returns for the final time to heaven where Earthly delights will only be a fond memory. Travolta plays Michael with a sort of slovenly, disheveled charm, a sparkle in his eye and shows he can still bust a move or two on the dance floor as well ! His quirky angel is a lot of fun, and you can't help but like him as he drinks, smokes and dances his way through his journey. When he gives his last miracle to save the dog Sparky and starts to sicken, it's hard not to feel a little tear in the corner of your eye because you know there won't be more hijinks to make you chuckle. Anyways, if this movie comes on on a slow night, take a chance and watch it like I did because it will keep you entertained much better than many cheesy reality shows, and maybe surprise you.
