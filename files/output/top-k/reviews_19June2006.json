The problem isn't that it's a bad movie, just a weak one.Newman stars as Professor Michael Armstrong, an American scientist of some repute who had been working on an anti-missile system. Given the film is set at the height of the Cold War, his work is naturally looked upon with interest by the Eastern Bloc, so when he suddenly flies to East Berlin and announces he is defecting to pursue his project for the glory of socialist democracy, he is greeted with open arms. His girlfriend and assistant, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews), is upset by his betrayal but opts to stand by her man.From the nondescript fuzzy-blue titles sequence to the dopey musical score to the true reasons for Armstrong's defection, Torn Curtain is a film of dull compromises and obvious disengagement by the central players. No screen actor ever combined intensity and charisma as well as Newman, yet here you get neither. His Armstrong is a cold fish who stares at the ground a lot and stoicly ignores his girlfriend's unlimited devotion.Hitchcock is even more of a surprise; he seems brought down by the grayness of the locale in which his film is set. There are remarkable moments in this film, and remarkably prosaic ones, too. Take the opening, aboard a cruise ship where Armstrong is preparing to give a conference. Usually Hitchcock films whisk us right into something unusual or exciting. Here you get tedious exposition, lame jokes, and a force-fed tryst between Newman and Andrews as frosted and artificial as Andrews' bouffant hairdo.They do say their lines well enough, and Andrews, an actress of limited range, struggles gamely with the lame material she is given. So docile is she that when the East German authorities taking Armstrong away confront her with the question What are we going to do with you? her reply is What do you suggest? Lorena Bobbitt she is not.Wolfgang Kieling is the only performer who sticks out here; playing a security man named Gromek who watches over Armstrong with attempted joviality. He's equal parts bully and puppy dog, a bit sad for the way he holds onto stray bits of outdated American slang and tries them out on the professor, having no idea of how lame he comes off. Gromek's not one to underestimate, though, as Armstrong discovers in a confrontation that is the film's best moment. At one point, facing down Armstrong and a knife-wielding woman, Gromek tells Armstrong Tell the cookie to put that down. She's going to cut your fingers off. We lose Gromek shortly after, and the film never finds anything as interesting to occupy us thereafter.Most of the other performances are flat, not that I blame them; if Newman can't shine, why should Hansjorg Felmy? The worst is turned in by Lila Kedrova, one of two 1965 Oscar winners in the cast (Andrews being the other). She overplays the role of a hard-luck countess as if she was being paid by the grimace. She's laughing! Now she's crying! Now she's squealing with joy! Eartha Kitt chewed less scenery playing Catwoman. I blame Hitchcock, who could have told Kedrova to tone it down, especially opposite Zombie Paul. Instead he just lets her spin, another sign he didn't care.Yes, there are good scenes, when you get past the long stretches of nothing between them, scenes that stick out in your memory. Hitchcock was always great at scenes. Problem is, he was usually great at movies, too, but Torn Curtain is one time he couldn't seem to give a rip. It's hard for a viewer to feel much different.

","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"19 June 2006","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Let's be clear from the start I don't see Batman Returns as a Batman movie at all. I see it as a pure artistic expression on its own, a very personal projection from one of the most gifted directors in Hollywood.We're all fed the optimistic line that we all have the power to be happy, but the world around us is still consumed in agonizing suffering. The best we can do is ignore such suffering, and try to think that the optimistic view does apply, even when in reality it only applies to some of us.This movie shatters such idea. The world is not a perfect place, and not even one where everybody can make do and learn to live with what they are given. The three main characters here are deeply wounded people, who cannot integrate to society and be happy like everybody else _even if they tried_.Batman is split because of the traumatic death of his parents. He enjoys the privileges of a rich man, has respectability through his Bruce Wayne mask, and somehow such respectability translates into a respectable pursuit punishing evil, taking the side of good, becoming part of what makes society good, even if he has to remain hidden.In the case of Catwoman the trauma is deeper. She, as a secretary who is not given any respect for her idea and as someone who comes from a small town into the big city, is a marginal. Unlike Bruce Wayne, she has no fortune, her life is not at the center of normalcy, and she finds herself abandoned--by her boyfriend, by her family, by the executives. In one very poignant scene, she is left to clean the table after the all-male executives leave.The imagery of abandonment continues (the calls from her mother reflect a difficult relationship, with little affection and much control; her boyfriend doesn't even have the spine to tell her directly he is leaving on his own). Abandonment plus marginality equal failure. Catwoman, even in her mousy avatar at the start of the movie, is a raging volcano. She makes that much clear in the final scene she has gone beyond the level of rage that allows a person to try to adapt to normal society (I just couldn't live with myself, so don't pretend this is a happy ending!), and what is left for her is to be more radical than Batman she will fight against the evil doers, but she won't take sides with the nice-and-proper. That makes her special and, in some ways, greater than Batman. She doesn't try to pass revenge as justice, no she acknowledges it is revenge, and does not repent.The Penguin is by far the most disturbing character and the reason why many people hated this movie. What happens when you're born in such a way that there is no chance whatsoever to be normal? Unlike Catwoman or Batman, for the Penguin there is not the choice of pretending to be like other people--he is, evidently, too different.You're just jealous because I'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask, that marks the Penguin's reality. What could an intelligent (the Penguin's level of speech is amazingly elevated for someone who grew up in the sewers and as a freak in a circus, and attests to his intelligence) person for whom all possibilities of social integration are denied do? For the Penguin, society is the enemy. In truth, he has little (or no) choice.As Batman is the vigilante and Catwoman the avenger, the Penguin is the terrorist. He symbolizes the plight of those people who, for a reason or another (physical differences, religion, race, politics, language) are deemed absolute marginals in many parts of the world. And, as the terrorist doesn't blow himself or herself up for nothing, but because from his\/her point of view there is nothing left but to kill and die, because for them life is hell and the hurt is so great the only way to pay it back somehow is by his\/her own destruction and the destruction of those inflicting the pain, the Penguin has deep motives and, in spite of his hideousness and evil intentions, it is very difficult not to feel sad for him.That is a feeling most people would rather not have. We're much more comfortable thinking in terms of good and bad, so that we can put ourselves cleanly in the camp of goodness. Yet, here we have a deformed man who orders to kidnap children to kill them (No! It's a lot!) and who plans to blow up a whole city, yet we cannot fail to somehow understand his motivations and feel sad at his death.That feeling makes us, who live comfortably in our little worlds isolated from the brutality of the lives of most people in this planet, feel bad. But that is Burton's master blow, too. Because in that moment when we understand a little, when we feel a little sorry for such an individual, we almost grasp what is behind so much of the pain and suffering in the world. Because the world is not black-and-white, it's much less comfortable than that.The imagery of abandonment is much more present with the Penguin from the moment when he's dumped in the river to the last moment when all his circus minions leave. Catwoman rejects normalcy by rejecting the possibility of a life with Batman; the Penguin embraces marginality (I am NOT a human being, I am an animal!) to the last, expected conclusion.In fact, this movie is a psychosocial study on marginality and abandonment, and the violence they generate. This is a subversive movie, because it makes us think beyond the terms of bad vs. good, and makes us realize how, in the grand scheme of things, we cannot judge others unless we have lived in their shoes.

The three main characters here are deeply wounded people, who cannot integrate to society and be happy like everybody else _even if they tried_.Batman is split because of the traumatic death of his parents. He enjoys the privileges of a rich man, has respectability through his Bruce Wayne mask, and somehow such respectability translates into a respectable pursuit punishing evil, taking the side of good, becoming part of what makes society good, even if he has to remain hidden.In the case of Catwoman the trauma is deeper. She, as a secretary who is not given any respect for her idea and as someone who comes from a small town into the big city, is a marginal. Unlike Bruce Wayne, she has no fortune, her life is not at the center of normalcy, and she finds herself abandoned--by her boyfriend, by her family, by the executives. In one very poignant scene, she is left to clean the table after the all-male executives leave.The imagery of abandonment continues (the calls from her mother reflect a difficult relationship, with little affection and much control; her boyfriend doesn't even have the spine to tell her directly he is leaving on his own). Abandonment plus marginality equal failure. Catwoman, even in her mousy avatar at the start of the movie, is a raging volcano. She makes that much clear in the final scene she has gone beyond the level of rage that allows a person to try to adapt to normal society (I just couldn't live with myself, so don't pretend this is a happy ending!), and what is left for her is to be more radical than Batman she will fight against the evil doers, but she won't take sides with the nice-and-proper. That makes her special and, in some ways, greater than Batman. She doesn't try to pass revenge as justice, no she acknowledges it is revenge, and does not repent.The Penguin is by far the most disturbing character and the reason why many people hated this movie. What happens when you're born in such a way that there is no chance whatsoever to be normal? Unlike Catwoman or Batman, for the Penguin there is not the choice of pretending to be like other people--he is, evidently, too different.You're just jealous because I'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask, that marks the Penguin's reality. What could an intelligent (the Penguin's level of speech is amazingly elevated for someone who grew up in the sewers and as a freak in a circus, and attests to his intelligence) person for whom all possibilities of social integration are denied do? For the Penguin, society is the enemy. In truth, he has little (or no) choice.As Batman is the vigilante and Catwoman the avenger, the Penguin is the terrorist. He symbolizes the plight of those people who, for a reason or another (physical differences, religion, race, politics, language) are deemed absolute marginals in many parts of the world. And, as the terrorist doesn't blow himself or herself up for nothing, but because from his\/her point of view there is nothing left but to kill and die, because for them life is hell and the hurt is so great the only way to pay it back somehow is by his\/her own destruction and the destruction of those inflicting the pain, the Penguin has deep motives and, in spite of his hideousness and evil intentions, it is very difficult not to feel sad for him.That is a feeling most people would rather not have. We're much more comfortable thinking in terms of good and bad, so that we can put ourselves cleanly in the camp of goodness. Yet, here we have a deformed man who orders to kidnap children to kill them (No! It's a lot!) and who plans to blow up a whole city, yet we cannot fail to somehow understand his motivations and feel sad at his death.That feeling makes us, who live comfortably in our little worlds isolated from the brutality of the lives of most people in this planet, feel bad. But that is Burton's master blow, too. Because in that moment when we understand a little, when we feel a little sorry for such an individual, we almost grasp what is behind so much of the pain and suffering in the world. Because the world is not black-and-white, it's much less comfortable than that.The imagery of abandonment is much more present with the Penguin from the moment when he's dumped in the river to the last moment when all his circus minions leave. Catwoman rejects normalcy by rejecting the possibility of a life with Batman; the Penguin embraces marginality (I am NOT a human being, I am an animal!) to the last, expected conclusion.In fact, this movie is a psychosocial study on marginality and abandonment, and the violence they generate. This is a subversive movie, because it makes us think beyond the terms of bad vs. good, and makes us realize how, in the grand scheme of things, we cannot judge others unless we have lived in their shoes.

Once the belle of the city, homecoming queen, etc., Birdie is now licking the wounds of a painful marital separation. She has brought her young daughter Bernice with her and both of them are quite puzzled by life and what it may hold for their future. Fortunately, Birdie's mother welcomes them with open arms and lots of love. Then, too, Justin (Harry Connick, Jr.) is delighted that Birdie is back in town. Will the two distraught females, Birdie and Bernice, learn to look forward instead of dwelling on the past?This slow, understated movie may be a difficult watch for the action film crowd. It is definitely a character study and, in that, it excels. Bullock gives an excellent portrayal as the prom queen who learns that life is not an endless picnic. She also looks utterly beautiful throughout the film. The young actress playing her daughter is also quite good as the troubled and confused child of a broken home. Rowlands and Connick, Jr. lend ample support. No, please don't look for car crashes or chase scenes. Instead bask in the film's simple pleasures, such as fishing on a quiet lake or dancing at a county fair. Those who like romance will be satisfied but the growth of the female characters is worth much more. Ladies, send the men off to the bowling alley and invite your friends over for a girlie get-together. This film is definitely one that women will enjoy while holding hands and celebrating the joys of ya-ya sisterhood.

Amazingly so because it relies so little on special effects or make-up. You see Boris Karloff in the beginning while he's still in his coffin in his Mummy wrap. Then at the end there are special effects ever so briefly in the final battle with Karloff.Other than that this film relies entirely on the mood and suspense created by director Karl Freund and the performance of Boris Karloff as the tortured soul Im-ho-tep.In 1922 I'm-ho-tep's secret unmarked tomb is found and when young assistant Bramwell Fletcher utters an ancient Egyptian spell, the Mummy gets up and walks out, leaving a stark, raving mad Fletcher.Fast forward ten years, a mysterious man named Ardath Bey tells another expedition where to find the tomb of Princess Ank-sa-namen. Her mummy is raised and put in the Cairo Museum. But that's only the beginning of Ardath Bey\/Im-ho-tep's plan. It also involves Zita Johann the daughter of the Governor of the Sudan who is Egyptian on mom's side. She's a collateral descendant of the princess and feels drawn to Karloff. She's also drawn to young David Manners and that could put a crimp in Karloff's plans.Boris Karloff probably had his most challenging role here. It's a terribly complex part. We are repulsed by Karloff's scheme, but at the same time the audience feels terribly sorry for what he's been through. While Johann is in a trance, Karloff narrates a flashback sequence to her telling how he was buried alive after she died because he tried to use Egyptian black arts to raise the princess from the dead. What a terrible hurt the man must have felt, and the audience feels it too.The mood is helped in large part by the great orchestrations of James Dietrich of Tschaikovsky themes. Also interpolated in the film background score is the popular ballad Beautiful Love. It creates an aura of unredeemed sadness throughout the film.There is a lot of similarity between The Mummy and that other Universal horror classic Dracula. But Bela Lugosi's Dracula is hardly as sympathetic a figure as Im-ho-tep as played by Boris Karloff. Also Edward Van Sloan as Professor Muller plays the same kind of role in The Mummy as he did as Van Helsing in Dracula.The remakes of The Mummy used a lot of gimmicky special effects to achieve what Boris Karloff did with sheer talent.

Also Edward Van Sloan as Professor Muller plays the same kind of role in The Mummy as he did as Van Helsing in Dracula.The remakes of The Mummy used a lot of gimmicky special effects to achieve what Boris Karloff did with sheer talent. Personally I still think this version has the power to frighten and entertain.

Prima Ballerina Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo) feels despairing about her dance career and wants to be alone. Rude, selfish, unpleasant industrial magnate Preysing (Wallace Beery), Kringelein's employer, is in the hotel to negotiate a merger that will save his business, but which is failing. He employs stenographist Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford), with whom the Baron flirts&#151;he calls her funny one. The Baron owes a great deal of money and is under pressure to steal the ballerina's pearls. He is hiding in her room when she declares her unhappiness and her intention to kill herself, and steps out of hiding and they fall in love. Meanwhile Kringelein, staying in the best suite in the hotel, is having a good time, and the right people are wonderfully nice to him and Preysing is beastly. The Baron decides not to steal from his gentle, vulnerable new friend, and instead tries to steal Preysing's pocketbook while he's distracted by the process of acquiring Flaemmchen as a mistress, but Preysing sees him and kills him with the telephone. She rushes to Klingelein, who asks her if she loved the Baron. Yes, she says, and he answers, so did I. And they go off to Paris together. Maybe the most brilliant part of the movie is at the end, when the Baron's body is taken away by a hearse from the trade entrance, watched by the employees including two men wearing white coats and carrying sides of beef. And as somebody takes the Baron's sausage dog Alphonse away an employee sweeping the floor pushes dust aggressively at the little dog. Klingelein and Flaemmchen leave for Paris together, the ballerina leaves for Vienna without knowing her new beloved is dead, and cars roll up discharging new guests. The saturnine Doctor Otternschlag repeats his earlier line, nothing ever happens. The acting is very good of its sort&#151;both Garbo and John Barrymore are at the peak of their public emoting, to modern tastes perhaps a bit over the top. Does Barrymore ever play a man who is not doomed? And Wallace Beery is phenomenal as a blustering germanic boor&#151;it's so easy to dislike him. Crawford is edgy and surprisingly modern, and Lionel Barrymore plays his strong suit as a rumpled, simple, and lovable fellow. The whole piece is a big sentimental crowd-pleaser, very well-knit-together.

You can see it all around you. It has inspired remakes, and sequels. It has been turned into a Warner Brothers cartoon, it has been quoted and misquoted in countless books and films, commercials and lists. I am willing to go as far as saying that there is not a person in the United States that has not either heard, quoted, or seen a scene from this film,. Whether it be the timeless, Here's lookin' at you kid, or Louie I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship scene. We have all heard it&#133;the question to ask is why has this film stayed on our screens and in out hearts.The answer is believe lies in two places, the first is the acting. Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are truly legends in Cinema. There faces and careers are known to all, they were part or Hollywoods Golden age and forever will remain there frozen for all time, and that without a doubt helped the popularity of the movie. But more than that is their chemistry, which is reflected whenever they are together on the screen. When Rick takes Ilsa at the end and tells her that should she choose not to go with Victor on that plane, she will regret it, that maybe it will not be today or tomorrow but soon, and it will be with her for the rest of her life. In that moment you see some amazing acting by two truly great actors. You feel the bond and love between them, and the realization that despite that they must do what they have to. A moment like that is so rare and in my opinion audiences realize that.The second reason I think the film has endured is that it deals with a complex story, or stories rather, all wound together in this time period that truly shook the world (World War II). At the start of the film you see Rick and Ilsa, two lovers that while in Paris are broken apart. The scene then moves forward, Rick is now closed, interred within himself, heartbroken.

Well, in a year that gave us Goodbye, Mr. Chips, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, Stagecoach, and Ninotchka, this is the movie that many say is the best film to come from the best year of film. All of the other movies I mentioned here (as well a couple more) were nominated for Best Picture of 1939, and I have seen each of them (except Ninotchka). Goodbye, Mr. Chips told a heartfelt tale of an educator and the lives he touched during his tenure at a boys' school. Wuthering Heights was a sweeping romance with a memorable performance by Sir Laurence Olivier. Stagecoach had action and thrills under the deft direction of John Ford, while becoming a star-maker for a man known as The Duke. And The Wizard of Oz is quite possibly the most magical film of all time, immortalizing Judy Garland as the young Dorothy Gale and influencing nearly every fantasy film made ever since. And let us not forget some of the other memorable films released that year, like Gunga Din, Beau Geste, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. So, what is it about Gone With the Wind that makes it stand above the rest of the best? Was it because it was in color? No. The Wizard of Oz was also in color (well, mostly). Was it Clark Gable's signature performance as Rhett Butler? Interestingly, despite the fact he was practically the only (and obvious) choice for the role, no. He didn't win Best Actor this time around (it was his third nomination in five years); that honor went to Mr. Chips himself, Robert Donat. What about Victor Fleming's direction? Well, he did take home the Oscar, but he was also one of three men to helm this movie. Was it the script, the sets, the cinematography? Again, all very well done. And, though this may not the first film to that comes to mind, Gone With the Wind was a ground-breaker in visual effects, as it was one of the first movies to make extensive use of matte paintings for both interior and exterior sets, and to great effect. And let's not forget the Burning of Atlanta sequence. As many people know, this was done on the old RKO Studios backlot by burning down old sets (Did you know that the final structure shown in this scene was the gate to Kong's lair in King Kong?). With clever editing and visual mixing, the result is frighteningly effective.But enough about the big picture (so to speak). What is it about Gone With the Wind that makes it stand out? To be sure, it was everything I have mentioned to this point, with one more ingredient thrown in to kick it up a notch. Enter Vivien Leigh. After an exhaustive world-wide search for the right actress to play Scarlett O'Hara, she was the one who won the part. And she was the one took home the Oscar, too. As the conniving, bitchy, manipulative, money-hungry, débutante who wears her heart on her sleeve for the wrong man, Vivien Leigh delivers a performance unlike any ever seen before and few have delivered since. And, as Rhett Butler, Clark Gable gives us a rogue, a scalawag, and a mercenary, while also a gentleman, a romantic, and a doting father. I seriously doubt that any other man could have pulled it off (though Timothy Dalton did try years later on TV -- But that's another story). The end result is a mixture of some of the best on-screen chemistry ever concocted.The supporting cast does a wonderful job here, too. From Olivia de Havilland to Leslie Howard to the first Black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel, many of the performances of Gone With the Wind are both memorable and well-cast, with one or two exceptions. For example, I thought Carroll Nye had the look and attitude of Frank Kennedy (Scarlett's second husband), but I didn't feel his performance was all that convincing. By the way, if you are a fan of the old Superman TV series, look for George Reeves as one of the Tarleton twins (he's Stuart) at the beginning of the movie. Sure, it's a chick flick. Yes, it's four hours long. But if you call yourself a movie fan, even in passing, then Gone With the Wind deserves a viewing!

People just don't break into song-and-dance numbers in the course of their daily lives. Unless they are Bob Fosse, when suddenly doing so not only makes sense, but makes you wonder how we can go through life NOT singing and dancing.What this movie is, is simple Bob Fosse unveiling his life, his knowledge, and a detailed explanation of his creative process, for future generations to evolve. This film is part biography, part self-exploration, and part legacy. It is the legacy part that is overlooked by almost everyone. If you ever dreamed of becoming a choreographer, this is the ideal place to start, because you'll watch, over and over, as Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder as the fictionalized Fosse) puts his stamp on a dance number, a process so unique and brilliant that it could easily be classified as its own form of dance rather than a subset of modern dance. If three words could sum up Fosse's style of choreography it would be make it sexier. Then make it even sexier. Then, when you're done, you need to make it even sexier. The Airotica number exemplifies this, and served as the inspiration for Paula Abdul's Cold Hearted video.The movie brings Fosse's inner circle and personal life to the screen, pulling absolutely no punches. Some call this film a form of narcissism, but it's hard to see how a man looking for self-given glory would portray himself falling apart physically and personally, the years obviously having taken a toll, as well as the emotional baggage that comes with abandoning family life (and a brilliantly played daughter by Erzsebet Foldi, in what would be her only film before she retired) for a girlfriend with some side dishes for variety. The women hate Gideon's infidelity, but love the man so dearly they know not to question or challenge it.Throughout the film, we are treated to vignettes that comprise the mosaic that is the life of Fosse. Metaphors abound, and the music blends effortlessly into a film that can make two hours seem like two minutes. This is not a film that could have been written and will not be enjoyed by those of simple intellects. So much of the plot exists in the abstract, and it is up to the viewer to find what is often an incredibly subtle symbolism. Simply put, this is a well-constructed film.

Fosse's daughter makes a cameo in the film, as does the film editor. The comedian who appears as the subject of a movie is based on Lenny, a previous Fosse film.Joe Gideon is what everyone should be no matter what they do someone who doesn't copy others, but develops their own vision and then methodically, sometimes maniacally, makes it happen. He lives in the moment, and squeezes everything he can out of each moment. This is evidenced by Gideon's brilliant work, but also by his rapidly deteriorating health caused by living in the party moments as well as the serious ones.The ending number is for the ages, putting a spin on the sappy endings that musicals are famous for.Your life is lacking until you have seen this film.

I love it every time.Weaver's performance was absolutely great. How can we compare today's chick's action movies with these old-school classics? It's not a fair comparison. Back in the days, the actresses were chosen for their ability, unlike today, where cuteness and hotness rule who's in and who's out. It's a skill vs beauty contest, and my vote goes to skill.
