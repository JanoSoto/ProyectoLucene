To be honest it is not a bad movie but after you watched Dear Frankie and expected a similar quality you get disappointed. It tells about the story of a displaced and lonely kid's friendship with a socially undeveloped man in his late 30s. First of all the kid(played by 1989 born Nicholas Hoult) doesn't perform well. It doesn't just fit there you know. I could not find the spirit of a displace,lonely,socially inept kid in his performance. This movie advances in double voice-over which gives us the opportunity to read both Marcus(the boy)'s thoughts and the man(Hugh Grant as Will)'s thoughts but at some point you just feel that there is too much voice-over! It just passes there in Will's flat and you start asking questions Why the heck don't I see somewhere else? Why don't I see something more private into Marcus's relationship with his mother? Why the heck Will doesn't date with Susie(the friend of Marcus's mum). Well I am sort of a viewer who questions the plot always and I these question just left there.Plus the story of a displaced kids should have been covered with a tag like the best comedy of the year This is supposed to be real life not just some comical crap! I would suggest you see Dear Frankie(a movie which is really under-rated-voted by around 3500 people only so far) then decide whether About A Boy is really good.

Ten years after the first movie, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) ends up in a mental institution because of her ravings about the end of the world. Her rebellious son John (Edward Furlong) lives with foster parents. The movie begins the same way as the first with a T-800 (Arnold) coming back in time, except this time Arnold is the good guy assigned to protect John Connor from the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). If this was the plot of the film, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as successful. Cameron was smart enough to make the movie about the mission to prevent Judgment Day, so it gave us something fresh (although some scenes are recycled). Terminator 2's greatest merit is that it has some of the best action sequences ever filmed. Since Cameron had a much larger budget on this movie, the action scenes are much more impressive than in T1. My favorite one is when Arnold and the T-1000 meet for the first time; the expressions on their faces are so intense! The movie was a breakthrough in CGI effects; The liquid metal scenes are still impressive today. Plus, Linda Hamilton has much more to work with here than she did in T1, and I commend her for getting into such great shape (she had 1% body fat or something). Patrick, while not as menacing as Arnold, still delivers a chilling performance as the T-1000.Despite all the praises I can give this film, I still think the first movie is slightly better. First of all, I just did not care for the characters in this film as much as I did in the first. Why? Because the sense of danger in T2 just wasn't as great as it was in T1. This can be attributed to two factors 1. Arnold was a scarier villain than Robert Patrick, which probably has more to do with his size rather than his acting ability. Arnold was a predator; Kyle and Sarah were in constant danger. It also has to do with the fact that the T-1000 disappears for about 30-40 minutes in the middle. The Terminator's feeling of desperation was all but absent in the sequel. 2. The T-800 and the T-1000 seemed pretty evenly matched up until the last twenty minutes of the movie. As a result, it feels like John and Sarah's chances of success are pretty good. In the first movie, it felt like Reese and Sarah had no chance of defeating the Terminator, which really helped build up the suspense. In T2, John and Sarah have a nearly invincible hero on their side; the audience knows that no matter how many bullets hit him, he won't get hurt. The appeal of the action in this film is more about Arnold kicking ass and special effects, not fear. The movie does not lack suspense entirely though, it's still very exciting.The Terminator was also better paced than T2. (SPOILERS) After the Terminator and John free Sarah from the mental hospital, the movie just shuts down for a little bit too long. My only other criticism is the corny friendship between the Terminator and John Connor. Edward Furlong's performance isn't very good, which can partially be attributed to some stupid lines. This might sound shallow, but even his voice got on my nerves after a while. He is tolerable most of the time though. In my opinion, the love story in the first film was more touching and dramatically satisfying. Still, T2 is a thrill ride that is necessary for any fan of action flicks.

Not to be confused with the later, weaker Nazi-hunting potboiler Boys From Brazil (though the real-life Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal is a character in both), Odessa File benefits from a very involving opening and a clever, cathartic twist of a closer, though the two-plus-hour film gets soggier than sauerkraut much of the time in between.Are we speaking German in this movie, or English? Director Ronald Neame can't seem to make up his mind, and it's a bit disconcerting to hear an old German army vet give a speech in accented English before his comrades break into a Teutonic sing-along. Voight often seems lost in a film where he is bounced around like a pinball, his gaze like that of a deer in the headlights, albeit a righteous deer. A lot of the actors around him similarly feel unmotivated, even the great Maximilian Schell who plays Miller's chief prey, a former camp commandant named Eduard Roschmann. Efficient though Roschmann may be, there are some gaping holes in the Nazi secondary Miller more stumbles through than exploits.The Odessa File also has one of the oddest movie scores, fronted by a credit theme which, as all taut thrillers must, features Perry Como and a children's Christmas chorus. I kid you not. The incidental music is electronically processed '70s drivel that seems more suited for Logan's Run, and was the brainchild of none other than Andrew Lloyd Webber, apparently wanting to try something different while waiting for inspiration for another libretto to strike then-partner Tim Rice.But the film does deliver in the suspense department, setting up a nicely paranoid atmosphere wherein the sweet woman sent by the police to look after your girlfriend could be a spy helping a team of killers track you down. It may oversell the reach of the real ODESSA, a Nazi relocation group, in West Germany, but the screen treatment is at times quite gripping and believable, and of course features Nazis as bad guys, which seldom fails for entertainment.You understand a bit of the mania behind Miller's actions, if not exactly his methods, when you see in flashback the way Roschmann handles his captives at Riga. Even after Schindler's List and other films have presented the same material in more graphic fashion, there's a lot of power in the scene of a woman looking at her husband before the door of a deadly truck closes over her face, or a moment when Roschmann toys with a man awaiting execution for a giggle.If it's not as good as Forsyth's book, the film suffers from the same faults. The improbability of the scenes grows more apparent with repeat viewings, but a first-timer will likely be too involved much of the time to pay this much mind. And, like the novel, Odessa File the movie has a good heart. And what an ending! Don't let anyone spoil that for you, if you are the least bit tempted about seeing this; see it for yourself.

What makes a movie great is when all the elements come together so beautifully, from the casting, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, etc., that it works virtually flawlessly both as a whole and as individual elements. The Hustler is one of those films. You could argue how you could have made it differently but you would be extremely hard pressed (or delusional) to claim you could have made it better. As anyone who has seriously acted or otherwise participated in a film or play will tell you, once enough of the right elements have come into play, the film or play will take on a life of its own and all the strengths will make each other stronger and better, the rare phenomenon of a group of individuals working on the highest common denominator, as opposed to the too frequent degenerating into the lowest common denominator. The casting is great with not a single weak performance anywhere from a young Paul Newman when he was at the peak of his craft, down to Jake LaMotta (the real Raging Bull) who plays a bit part as a bartender. The acting is so often brilliantly understated you might think you are watching a documentary, especially since the film is shot in stark black and white. The unflinchingly honest realism is one of the underlying elements that gives this film such great life. None of the characters or situations are glamorized, including the love between Eddie (Newman) and Sarah (Piper Laurie). They are two lost souls who are drawn together by their shared angst and alcoholism yet develop a true, powerful love that is heartfelt and realistic. They don't magically make each other perfect but they do bring each other some happiness and relief from their loneliness. Jackie Gleason is perfectly cast as Minnesota Fats, partly because he was The Great One, Jackie Gleason, but also because he really knew the game of pool. Probably Holloywood's greatest all time pool player, in real life he hustled full grown men when he was an eight year old kid. Incidentally, both Newman and Gleason did their own pool shooting in the movie, adding to the movie's realism. George C. Scott plays Bert Gordon, the powerful, dangerous hoodlum who controls the money and action for both Eddie and Fats. Scott gives such a fine performance you could easily imagine he would have been a real life Bert Gordon if he hadn't been an actor. If you want light, shallow fare, then The Hustler is not for you. But, if you are looking for a great, honest movie that will haunt you as you remember many of the moments in dark poolrooms, where everyone smoked and drank too much back when they were socially encouraged and viewed as relatively harmless; a film that neither preaches nor glamorizes, it just shows what is, powerfully and unapologetically, so you are forced to draw your own conclusions as you see that everything has its price and that even for the supposed winners, there are no magical, happily ever after scenarios where everyone and everything is beautiful and perfect, but rather flawed and struggling to find an elusive state they will probably never achieve, then you will truly enjoy The Hustler, a great film.

The ending, when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead, still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw this movie.Incredible. Go see it.

I saw it somewhat often until I made the transition that all typical males make from the cute family movies to the shoot-em-up action movies as I grew up. Now I'm 17 years old, and I saw the movie again, and I think I actually enjoyed it even more than when I was a kid. While teenage males are probably the least likely people to want to watch this sort of thing, it just goes to show you that as long as you see it with an open mind, this movie, albeit short, will take you on a ride of laughs and tears (and even some awwwww moments when the cute poses of the animals are shown).The best part about this movie is the good balance between funny, sad, and cute. Not one of these elements takes away from any other. Just because there are funny moments does not mean it makes the plot any less serious or emotional. Milo and Otis's friendship and perseverance is admirable and the viewer cannot help but love these two animals. The fact that this movie includes cute poses of the animals (i.e. Milo and Otis taking care of the egg while still at the farm) doesn't hurt either =).This movie is good for both kids and adults alike. If you are a kid, you will probably like this movie for it's humorous and tear-jerker moments alone. If you are an adult, you will enjoy this movie just as a kid would, but you will probably enjoy it even more because you can't help but appreciate all of the effort that went in to the making of this movie (which took 4 years), as well as the simpleness and enthusiasm of the narration.The reason I gave this movie a 9 and not a 10 is because I felt that at the end, they should've included an extra scene (with no narration\/dialogue, maybe even as the music at the end was playing) of Milo and Otis and their families back at the farm (even if it was only for 30 seconds or so). If they had included an extra scene like such, I feel the movie would've had a more satisfying closure. Oh and speaking of music, the main theme song is clever and catchy.All in all, this is a great movie for any ages, and it just goes to show you that kids don't have to watch stuff like Spongebob Squarepants to really enjoy something. This movie is as close as you'll get to nature and peacefulness without actually visiting a river or whatever of your own with no humans around.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 January 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I first saw this movie and loved it when I was just a little kid.

Fast, furious, wacky, and hilarious.In fact, this movie is, in many respects, the movie the first should have been. The plot once again revolves around the Pink Panther diamond. The chief suspect is once again Sir Charles The Phantom Lytton. And, of course, Peter Sellers is once again on the case as the one-of-a-kind Jacques Clouseau.Class act David Niven has been replaced by the equally classy Christopher Plummer (Murder by Decree, The Sound of Music, Dragnet). His portrayal of Sir Charles is more dashing and youthful than Niven's. In this film, his character is also more likable, simply because he's working alongside Clouseau rather than against him.And Inspector Clouseau, the underdog, is now, finally, the hero. He's been demoted to bumbling Parisian street cop by his slightly crooked boss, Chief Inspector Dreyfus (played hilariously for the second time by Herbert Lom.) Then the president of Lugash specifically requests Clouseau be restated in order to find the Pink Panther diamond, which has been stolen from a museum. The return of the Pink Panther diamond is Clouseau's responsibility.The film is divided between Clouseau's quest to find Sir Charles, whom he blames for the Panther's disappearance, and Sir Charles' quest to find the Panther and by doing so clear his name. Clouseau's adventure is filled with more slapstick than in either of the previous two films, and good slapstick, at that. Peter Sellers plays Clouseau in the way that only he could, with results that are guaranteed to make any comedy fan laugh. Meanwhile, Sir Charles' side of the story is filled with action and international intrigue, in a plot that's absurd and confusing, but to be expected from a Pink Panther film. Graham Stark, who played Clouseau's partner in A Shot in the Dark, now appears as Sir Charles' put-upon underworld informant.All is finally right with the Pink Panther universe. Sir Charles is finally likable. It's okay to empathize towards Clouseau. And there's humor in the romantic cat-and-mouse game between Sir Charles' new bride and Clouseau. Lady Lytton is played by Catherine Schell (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), and is, interestingly enough, not the ex-Mrs. Clouseau, one of the earliest cracks in the series' fragile continuity.
