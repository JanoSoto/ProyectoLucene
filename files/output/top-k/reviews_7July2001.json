It poked fun at Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Nightmare On Elm Street and so on, and it did it with compassion and care.  The writers really did their homework and thus we were presented with a film that not only was entertaining and funny, but it was smart and witty.  You could infinitely count the number of movie references in the film and and some of them were so subtle that it took you a moment or two to realize that they were making fun of whatever movie it was making fun of.  This cheap ersatz of a film, this charlatan, this sheep in wolves clothing is not only a terrible film, it does a terrible injustice to all that the first one stood for.  It angers me when films like this are made as irresponsibly as this one was because it suckered me into the theater based on memories of last year.  I actually put The Wayans and Kevin Williamson ( creator of the Scream franchise ) in the same category after Scary Movie.  Now, my perception of the Wayans is that they are all one hit wonders.Scary Movie 2 has one big problem, and that is they decided to make fun of movies that weren't as iconoclastic as the ones they made fun of in the first one.  When you are satirizing films like The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill, you alienate perhaps your core audience that didn't really like those movies all that much in the first place.  There were some clever references to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist at the beginning and those were the best jabs in the whole film, but what about the rest of this debacle?  Why do I want to watch The Haunting and Hollow Man all over again when I didn't enjoy it in the first place?  There are many horror fans out there and this film is not commensurate with the abilities that the Wayans showed in the first one.  There are only so many times you can get by with fart, puke, pee, poo and sex jokes before you enervate your audience.  I was enervated after the first fifteen minutes.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  But it never did.  For every reference I could pick out and comprehend, there were long, painful stretches of film when I just didn't understand what they were trying to say or do.  What was the point of Chris Elliot's character?  Was he an amalgamation of every creepy character that has ever appeared in a haunted house film?  Was he a pastiche of butlers or chambermaids from haunted house Hammer films?  What was he?  I have seen a lot of horror films in my day but never have I been privy to a more repulsive and useless character than him.  He just wasn't needed, and if he was, then how about giving him more to go on than just a small and deformed appendage?  To give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville\/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage\/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial.  I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes.  But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere.  There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger.  It is horribly done in here and there is no payoff.Back in the 10th century, the charlatan and the mounteback, two unsavory types, used to sell bogus panaceas, cure-alls, at bargain prices.  They called this their nostrum, meaning literally, our remedy.

To give a little credit, as I said, the beginning with James Woods and the Amityville\/Exorcist scene was clever and there is one brilliant homage\/satire that starts with the bouncing ball from The Changeling that turns into a wonderfully directed spinoff of the Nike basketball commercial.  I was very impressed and entertained for those two minutes.  But then for that clever scene, there are dozens of others that go absolutely nowhere.  There is another embarrassing scene with Tori Spelling spouting off sexual profanities to an invisible miscreant that has his way with her against a wall that is supposed to be a send up of A Nightmare On Elm Street when Tina is attacked by an invisible Freddy Krueger.

Mick, who has recently been embarassed when he and an assosiate named Jacko fail to capture an enormous crocodile, agrees to come with Sue to America.  While Sue works on a story about the third in a series of bad movies, Mick is appearing as an extra, and discovers that this film may be part of a smuggling plot.This film involves Lethal Agent III, a third (and worst) in a series of unsuccessful Lethal Agent films.  Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles is the third (and worst) in a successful series of films about Crocodile Dundee. It seems rather a silly big time span from CDLA is from CDII. Thirteen years, while the time span from CDI and CDII is two years- in the late eighties.Before I saw the preview for this film, I was beginning to wonder how many ideas Hollywood where going to rip off or remake or sequel, as the boys up there seem to just be running out of ideas.  My question was answered when I saw this. CDII was satisfying and was a well end to the series, but if they would make such a sequel, it would have to be around 1990.The plot is silly, as well.  The plot of a foreigner coming to America raises a smile and still helps us realise how messed up we are, but it is a bit unoriginal by now.  It gets slightly predictable near the end, and just when the plot starts getting somewhere interesting, the film ends.  And I never heard any children laughing throughout the film, only a few adults chuckling.I'll give it credit for a few things.  It keeps the original cast (as old as he may be, Paul Hogan is the only Crocodile Dundee), and the acting is not bad.  The plot isn't great, but if you relax and don't take it seriously, it won't be as bad and maybe even mildly entertaining.  It also preaches to children a moral you usually don't see No sex before marriage, and (mild spoiler) at the end of the film, Mick finally weds Sue. As well, the climax on the movie set is fun and enjoyable to watch.However, no matter how seriously you do or don't take it, there is one plot hole you can't overlook.  In one scene of Lethal Agent III, where Mick is posing as an extra, a monkey refuses to do his job, so Mick whispers a few things in his ear and he astounds everyone by pouring a mobster a drink. Well, there are no monkeys in Australia.  And that scene looks like a reject scene from Ace Ventura Pet Detective.  And Australians have never seen a drive-through before?The plot etc. is a throaway for critical adults, but don't think about showing it to your kids yet.  The language is quite strong, and young Mikey even looks after a rollerblading woman telling his father that she has a nice a**.  In fact, she earlier tried flirting with Mick and called him gay (which of course he responded saying I'm usually quite happy).  Mick and Jacko visit 'The Cowboy Bar' which turns out to be a gay bar.  As they leave the bar, junkies on an acid trip drive past with guns and try to rob them, but of course they beat 'em up with ease. The word a** is used as is some television profanities.  And parents will object to Mike Tyson's cameo meditating in the park in a Buddha position.Since it is really not for kids, adults can view it if they don't take it seriously.

From classic films and cartoons, this footage shows the image of African-Americans that the white media constructed for decades. Dancing wildly or alternatively lazy, eyes popping out of their heads and stupidly eating watermelon. For a brief moment, Spike Lee is showing the audience, rather than telling us and the result is incredibly powerful. In these moments, Bamboozled reminded me of Marlon Riggs's 1991 documentary, Color Adjustment. Using similar material, Riggs showed the way that the mediated images of African-Americans helped to maintain the political status quo. Riggs relied on the primary sources and on traditional talking-heads documentary style to make his point. And I can't help but feel that his approach was far more effective in its subtlety than Lee's in his bombast.Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is a low level television executive at a floundering network. His boss (Michael Rappaport) thinks that Delacroix's work has been suffering because it hasn't been black enough and he sets him to creating a truly black show. In his frustration, Delacroix plots a revenge by suggesting a revival of the minstrel show with one major twist -- the show would feature black actors in blackface. He brings in two street performers (Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover) as his stars and he assumes that the show will never actually make it on air. But much to his chagrin and the dismay of his assistant Sloan (Jada Pinkett), the show is a massive success. Spike Lee's criticism is against black performers and image makers who allow the negative representations of their people. The film is a harsh indictment not only of Delacroix, for letting down the African-American community, but of talented tap dancer Manray (Glover), who prostitutes his talent towards the negative depictions of his people. The hubris of Manray and Delacroix is juxtaposed with the guilt and better judgment of Womack (Davidson) and Sloan. Strikingly, the film actually takes its strongest stand against the brilliant artist Manray, suggesting that his was the greater betrayal.Delacroix is doomed from the beginning in Lee's loaded didactic script. He's Harvard educated, wears ugly suits, and speaks with a goofy accent. It's unclear whether the accent is an example of a horrible performance or a horrible decision by the director, or possibly both. The accent is annoying in ways that distract the viewer from his true character flaws. I can't image that Lee meant for me to forget Delacroix's reprehensible actions to concentrate on his stupid voice. It certainly pulled me out the of the movie and directed my antagonism at the filmmaker who didn't have any better ideas, rather than at the character of a TV executive whose ideas were evil.Lee's script (always the downfall of a Spike Lee movie) goes off in too many directions. It touches on Delacroix's father, a comedian who plays what appears to be a modified version of the old Chittlins Circuit. Naturally the father doesn't think much of Delacroix. And it touches on the Mau-Maus, a group of rappers\/revolutionaries who naturally don't think much of Delacroix. And the script finally makes Pinkett's Sloan into a school marm of a woman who's the overly-erudite symbol of all of the wrong done to both blacks and women. Sloan's character plays like Lee's response to perpetual criticism that he can't write for women. It's worth pointing out that he still can't.The movie's failings are made all the more unfortunate by the importance of its lesson. When Lee steps back and teaches the audience about lawn jockies, Amos and Andy, Mantan Morland, and other negative racist depictions, he's doing a great service. Among the film's documentary moments are pieces of brilliance, including a touching scene in which the two minstrel performers burn cork and add water, following the traditional recipe for face-black. But for every time Lee educates us, he bashes us over the head with references to his own movies (even though Bamboozled is shot on digital video, it has moments clearly borrowed from Mo' Better Blues and Do the Right Thing) or, even worse, he makes too-obvious references to Network (Including a repeated misquoting of the famous mad as hell and I'm not going to take *this* anymore line). Lee never lets anything, however powerful, rest on its own merits.Wayans is just horrible playing a character who wouldn't have been compelling even in an In Living Color sketch. And Pinkett is forced to suffer through Lee's dialogue and several awkward, seemingly improvised scenes with Mos Def as her Mau-Mau brother. But as the performers, Davidson and Glover are excellent, with Davidson giving the film its only true center of regret, and Glover combining acceptable acting with his outrageous tap dancing skills.I wish I could recommend Bamboozled. I wish I could say that its message and material were of sufficient merit to make the movie required viewing. But probably the Marlon Riggs documentary (Color Adjustment, if you've already forgotten) should be the required text. Spike Lee continues to need lessons in trusting the intelligence of his audience. The alternative is a film like this film, an important idea unsalvaged by a bad execution. This is a 4\/10.

But for every time Lee educates us, he bashes us over the head with references to his own movies (even though Bamboozled is shot on digital video, it has moments clearly borrowed from Mo' Better Blues and Do the Right Thing) or, even worse, he makes too-obvious references to Network (Including a repeated misquoting of the famous mad as hell and I'm not going to take *this* anymore line).

But as the performers, Davidson and Glover are excellent, with Davidson giving the film its only true center of regret, and Glover combining acceptable acting with his outrageous tap dancing skills.I wish I could recommend Bamboozled. I wish I could say that its message and material were of sufficient merit to make the movie required viewing. But probably the Marlon Riggs documentary (Color Adjustment, if you've already forgotten) should be the required text.

From classic films and cartoons, this footage shows the image of African-Americans that the white media constructed for decades. Dancing wildly or alternatively lazy, eyes popping out of their heads and stupidly eating watermelon. For a brief moment, Spike Lee is showing the audience, rather than telling us and the result is incredibly powerful. In these moments, Bamboozled reminded me of Marlon Riggs's 1991 documentary, Color Adjustment. Using similar material, Riggs showed the way that the mediated images of African-Americans helped to maintain the political status quo. Riggs relied on the primary sources and on traditional talking-heads documentary style to make his point. And I can't help but feel that his approach was far more effective in its subtlety than Lee's in his bombast.Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is a low level television executive at a floundering network. His boss (Michael Rappaport) thinks that Delacroix's work has been suffering because it hasn't been black enough and he sets him to creating a truly black show. In his frustration, Delacroix plots a revenge by suggesting a revival of the minstrel show with one major twist -- the show would feature black actors in blackface. He brings in two street performers (Tommy Davidson and Savion Glover) as his stars and he assumes that the show will never actually make it on air. But much to his chagrin and the dismay of his assistant Sloan (Jada Pinkett), the show is a massive success. Spike Lee's criticism is against black performers and image makers who allow the negative representations of their people. The film is a harsh indictment not only of Delacroix, for letting down the African-American community, but of talented tap dancer Manray (Glover), who prostitutes his talent towards the negative depictions of his people. The hubris of Manray and Delacroix is juxtaposed with the guilt and better judgment of Womack (Davidson) and Sloan. Strikingly, the film actually takes its strongest stand against the brilliant artist Manray, suggesting that his was the greater betrayal.Delacroix is doomed from the beginning in Lee's loaded didactic script. He's Harvard educated, wears ugly suits, and speaks with a goofy accent. It's unclear whether the accent is an example of a horrible performance or a horrible decision by the director, or possibly both. The accent is annoying in ways that distract the viewer from his true character flaws. I can't image that Lee meant for me to forget Delacroix's reprehensible actions to concentrate on his stupid voice. It certainly pulled me out the of the movie and directed my antagonism at the filmmaker who didn't have any better ideas, rather than at the character of a TV executive whose ideas were evil.Lee's script (always the downfall of a Spike Lee movie) goes off in too many directions. It touches on Delacroix's father, a comedian who plays what appears to be a modified version of the old Chittlins Circuit. Naturally the father doesn't think much of Delacroix. And it touches on the Mau-Maus, a group of rappers\/revolutionaries who naturally don't think much of Delacroix. And the script finally makes Pinkett's Sloan into a school marm of a woman who's the overly-erudite symbol of all of the wrong done to both blacks and women. Sloan's character plays like Lee's response to perpetual criticism that he can't write for women. It's worth pointing out that he still can't.The movie's failings are made all the more unfortunate by the importance of its lesson. When Lee steps back and teaches the audience about lawn jockies, Amos and Andy, Mantan Morland, and other negative racist depictions, he's doing a great service.

Often things that are different are misunderstood, and ultimately rejected as awful.

(Don't feel too bad if you did think that though, for the first few seconds I thought they were too.) The ending is really getting a lot of people's panties in a whirl.  Sure they could have ended it with David staring at the statue forever.  That would have made it mythical and people would have walked away going Oh, how profound!.  But to end it that way would have been too obvious, and in my opinion a copout.  Stanley Kubrick was never about following traditions in film, and it definitely shows in AI.

But whenever I hear his name, I always think of The Goonies.The Goonies is one of those movies that always brings out the kid in me. Everytime I watch it, I fall in love with it all over again.  This isn't the usual teensploitation flick, filled with glamorous, ultra-cute teenagers with whom you can't relate.  These are characters you can relate to.  The kind you could swear lived right down the street from you.  It's hard to not become attached to them and their circumstances.  So when they fall head-first into the adventure of a lifetime, they take you along for the ride.The awesome thing about this movie is that you feel like a member of the group all the way thru the movie.  You feel like one of the goonies.  All the way from the beginning to the end.  It all starts when they find a mysterious treasure map in Mikey's (Sean Astin) attic.  This then triggers a chain of events which eventually puts them into an adventure of Indiana Jones-esque proportions.  As they dodge the many pitfalls and problems that come their way, you find yourself rooting for them, and almost feeling like you're a part of the action.  Never will there be another movie as fun as this one.The acting in this movie is top notch, considering the majority of the actors and actresses were pre-teens at the time of filming.  Like I said, these characters are everyday characters you swear were ripped straight from your childhood.  Sean Astin is great as Mikey, a teen in his early, and awkward, pubescent years.  He's kind of the all-round average guy, but is the glue that holds the group together, thus being the hero.  Josh Brolin is great as his older brother, Brandon.  He does everything you picture an older brother to do picks on Mikey and his friends and acts like a toughguy, while at the same time adding some guidance and looks out for his younger bro.  Chunk, my favorite character, is played brilliantly by Jeff Cohen.  I never fail to laugh at him bumbling around and shooting his mouth off.  Corey Feldman is in top form here as Mouth, playing the part of the cool guy (as usual).  Jonathan Ke Quan is hilarious as Data, a child genius with all kinds of quirky little inventions to help his friends out along the way (yet not very skilled at using them just yet).  Kerri Green is great in being the pretty face of the movie as Andrea (Andy for short), and is a possible love interest of Brandon.  Martha Plimpton is good as Andy's friend, but doesn't have too many lines.  She does provide good chemistry between her and Mouth, though, hinting at a possible relationship in the future.

I'd say they do a sufficient job at being as scary as possible in their given roles as a family of hot-headed criminals out to find a stash of treasure, thus bumping heads with the kids and posing much of a threat.This movie might not carry the same worth with others as it does with me, given it's nostalgic value.  So I must admit that my views may be a little biased.  But, I feel that this film works on all levels at providing comedy, adventure, and thrills galore.  If you're looking for a fun movie to watch, I HIGHLY recommend giving The Goonies a chance.

The first half hour or so seemed just fine, until you realize that it has been half an hour and the movie hasn't really begun yet.  Character development was rushed to the point that you don't like or care about anyone (except Teddy).  If the movie had ended after the second act, it would not have been that bad, but then came the third act.  This part was totally unnecessary, and nothing more than annoying.  As soon as the third act began, I thought that it would be a quick wrap up, but it went on for what seemed like an hour.  Every time I thought they were going to wrap it up, there was a new development.  It was as though the film makers realized that they had no ending, so they just kept adding stuff so that they wouldn't have to face that fact.  I can only assume that the Federal Government stepped in and forced them to end the picture.  This film was not art by any means, it was an experiment to see how much people will take before they start rioting and tear down the theatre (believe me, I considered it...)  Please avoid A.I., those are two and one half hours of your life that you will NEVER get back.
