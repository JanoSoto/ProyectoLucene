He takes off his helmet looks at the dent where the bullet was  and then.... that's right... he gets shot in the head and dies.The nervous breakdown Hanks house in the battle.The inability of the interpreter character to be a hero and save someone's life....during the final battle scene. More affecting perhaps because some of the film does resort to cliche's.  But not here.  When you really want it to.  When you hope it will.   It doesn't, making the scene more powerful.Bravo.Please stop letting your kids see violence in movies.  Sex and language is one matter and isn't going to hurt them.  Violence particularly realistic violence (not slapstick or cartoon) is having an effect on young children.  DON'T BRING THEM TO VIOLENT FILMS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE...

Lawrence Kasdan, the director, did an excellent job in making sure that the film was almost true to life. The cinematography of the movie was top-notch. The first half of the movie is pure Western magic, which had me in awe. The second half of the movie, however, while still highly accurate, was not all that interesting. Overall, the movie did an excellent job in portraying Wyatt Earp the man, not the legend. The acting was pretty good. Kevin Costner portrayed Wyatt Earp, and his display of Wyatt's transformation was effective, although I felt that he was a little too wooden in the second half of the movie. Dennis Quaid gave a lot for this movie; he lost 42 pounds to play the role of Doc Holliday. His portrayal of Doc will be drawing comparisons with Val Kilmer's portrayal in Tombstone for years to come. I recommend this movie, but I give a warning. This is the type of movie in which you should know something about the material before you see the film.

I have no trouble believing he is the character he portrays as is always the case.  I only need to remember back when I thought he WAS Hannibel Lector to remind me of how gifted and versatile he is.

There was also no mention about being asexual or laying eggs, the only one that comes close is the one about baby godzilla and that was a dream a child was having in the movie, there was nothing about how the baby came to be. The original monster didn't accidentally detroy some thing with his tail, he destroyed it on purpose plus most of the movies he is saving the town from another monster then leaving. With this new movie I just don't get it. The plot was bad, the acting ok, I have to ask. Did the wirter see ANY of the original movies and if so WHY so drastic of a change to the main character? I can only hope that if there are any more in the making that they are better and more closer to the original.

The face on the old is smaller, the mouth is smaller and not filled with teeth like a dinosaur, the tail is shorter fatter rounded at the end not a sharp point, he was not a flame thrower but had a nuclear breath (which he used as an jet engine to fly, the new one didn't use his very often) the walk is also wrong it was more like some thing from Jurassic Park. There was also no mention about being asexual or laying eggs, the only one that comes close is the one about baby godzilla and that was a dream a child was having in the movie, there was nothing about how the baby came to be. The original monster didn't accidentally detroy some thing with his tail, he destroyed it on purpose plus most of the movies he is saving the town from another monster then leaving. With this new movie I just don't get it. The plot was bad, the acting ok, I have to ask. Did the wirter see ANY of the original movies and if so WHY so drastic of a change to the main character? I can only hope that if there are any more in the making that they are better and more closer to the original. If not I would rather they not be made, as in my opinion this new movie is an insult to the orginal GODZILLA and the people who made him.

While I was watching this version I had that in mind(maybe that was a mistake), there is no comparison except for the name. The special effects are good, don't get me wrong, but you need more than that to make a great movie. There are some major differences between the two.

Not only is the film hard to understand but it doesn't even make any sense. How would the  Bad Guys know his every move, the movie itself was an impossible scenario. Then the end is even worse, why in the world would the U.S. Marshals care one bit about this case and how were they notified. The very end only lets you down. Another problem with this film is hidden information like the sum of money and what happened to the code. And the best for last the stupid holes in the plot. For instance why did Jimmy lie about his sister and why did he talk about her in the first place. The only people that should enjoy this film will be the absent minded. If you are looking for a good mystery rent a Hitchcock film.

I found it very boring and slow.  I fast forwarded a bit to see if it would get better but, it never did.  There was not much acting and definitely not any good acting. The dialog was monotonous.  It had a good story, the boys deciding whether or not to leave their home town.  I came from a small town and almost all of my friends left after graduation.  But, the way it was told made me have to fight to stay awake.  I think the supporting characters could have been developed more and the boys could have had more interesting things to say. I asked for my money back.

There are many good things in this film, including poignant performances by Hopkins, Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor, and suitable ones by Pitt and Claire Forlani, and a few touching scenes. However, what is good about the movie is dragged out over three lugubrious hours, with many scenes that seem to take for-ev-er. Had director Brest not allowed his ego to overrun the project and had he kept the best stuff in while trimming the fat, this could have been an extremely effective 120-minute entertainment. As it is, however, I was afraid someone in the audience would eventually yell at the screen, DO SOMETHING!, and equally afraid that audience member would be me.
