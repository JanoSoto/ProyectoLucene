This hybrid of chick-flick romance and male sports weepie is the epitome of formulaic Hollywood movie-making, a film made solely to generate box office receipts by appealing to the most bathetic elements in these genres. The plot and writing are so predictable that there were several occasion when I was able to say an actor's next line out loud before s\/he did and hit it right on. Kelly Preston and Kevin Costner are well matched in that both are mediocre actors on their very best days; the wonderfully wooden Costner received yet another Razzie nomination for Worst Actor of the Year. At least he looks like a ballplayer, having played at the University of Southern California, a traditional collegiate baseball powerhouse. This also probably has much to do with his predilection for making baseball movies.There were several highly unrealistic aspects in this film. Costner insists that his regular catcher, played by John C. Reilly, start the game, but then he continually shakes off his pitch calls. This is not the sign of a battery that is in sync. Kelly Preston's character makes a reference to when the Tigers and Yankees play in the series. Certainly not the World Series, since both teams are in the American League. Yet she hardly seems to know enough about major league baseball to be referring to a league championship series. The Yankees manager sends to the plate a rookie without a single major league at bat as the potentially final out to break up a perfect game? Puhleeze! The ridiculous hand injury & hospital scene has already been noted by a previous commenter.The film did feature the wonderful Brian Cox, a highly talented but criminally underutilized actor who deserves to be in far better films than this one. And also Vin Scully, the best play-by-play baseball announcer in the country, bar none. I had frequent opportunity to listen to his broadcasts of Los Angeles Dodgers' games when I was growing up, and he's still the best. These two are the only bright points in an otherwise thoroughly dismal film that drags on for well over two hours. And throughout it all, Sam Raimi was at the helm?! What was he thinking?! I have to believe that he made the same mistake David Lynch did with Dune (1984) -- he made the movie the way the producers wanted it made. After Dune, Lynch swore he would never concede artistic control over a film again. Let's hope Raimi has similarly learned his lesson. For Love of the Game is definitely the low point in Raimi's directorial career.As a sports movie, this one never really takes the bat off its shoulder as it goes down on called strikes. On the other hand, the gooey romance that constitutes half the film may lend it some redeeming utility as a date movie for those who are tired of only getting to first or second base and want to finally hit a home run.

Though many great books have been written, most will forever remain on the shelf and off the screen.  `Siddhartha The Movie,' for instance, will never come into being.The cost of bringing a particular piece of fiction to life is one such consideration.  The amount of dialogue and narration also influence a novel's adaptability.  And, of course, the story's public appeal comes under consideration.  If such guidelines are heeded to strictly, the success of the film lies only in the hands of its director.   If not, movies such as the adaptation of Louis de Bernieres' Corelli's Mandolin come about, in which seventy pages and a few main characters are entirely absent.  It goes without saying that `Captain Corelli's Mandolin' failed as film.  `The House of Mirth' should not have.Edith Wharton's 1905 The House of Mirth has all the makings of a good screenplay.  It is a period piece, and one with a limited number of settings, all of which are described in full detail; it is rich with fast-paced, well-written, subtly emotional dialogue and a limited-omniscient narrator who sees things almost always in chronological order (with a few carefully-placed flashbacks here and there); it is also a piece filled with entertaining dynamic characters and powerful, yet relevant, central themes and conflicts.  A trailer for the film could refer to the story as either `a forbidden romance' or `a young woman's emotional journey.'  And yet, supported by a barrage of marketable possibilities, Terence Davies' 2000 film, `The House of Mirth,' proves to be little more than two hours and twenty minutes of heavily concentrated tedium.  It is, beyond a doubt, far more painful to watch than a balding Nicolas Cage attempting to play a mandolin.The film opens, closes, and does most everything in between, as the novel does.  The problem arises, however, in that apart from plot the movie is entirely independent of Wharton's creation.  The effort which the writer put into the formation of characters, tone and theme seem to have been thoroughly ignored by those responsible for `Mirth.'  This is not an uncommon occurrence, sacrificing character development and even characters in order to fit in the maximum amount of plot.  Even established director Chris Columbus did it in his first `Harry Potter' film, so afraid that audiences would react badly to the absence of a scene that the movie was wildly from setting to setting, sprinkling meaningless dialogue and special effects where needed.  `Mirth,' in this sense, is quite similar to `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' though without giant trolls and magical fight sequences.  And so, without computer-created marvels to add necessary flare to the film, `The House of Mirth' is simply an empty shell and a poor excuse for a movie.The film follows Miss Lily Bart, played monotonously by Gillian Anderson, through her fall from artistocratic prosperity to impoverished disparity. This transition, however, is all but suppressed by Mr. Davies' apparent ineptitude in subtlety.  Lily, as Wharton portrays her, is a beautiful, intelligent, money-hungry `girl,' capable, through an almost superhuman ability to manipulate men, to get whatever she desires from the opposite sex.  Attesting to Wharton's skill, Lily's character is a complex one, and at her deepest layer lies the insecurity one would expect from any other unmarried twenty-nine year-old with no parents and large debts.  Mr. Davies, astoundingly, picks up on this hidden side of Lily and decides to make it a bit less hidden.  The result is the teary-eyed, heavily breathing Lily, which Anderson, armed with her trademark grimace, accurately portrays throughout the film.  This butchering of Bart, while perhaps somewhat helpful to the moviegoer incapable of making personal conclusions, leaves very little room for the change of self that the character must later undergo.This transformation comes as a result of a change in social and economic status, brought on by antagonists Bertha Dorset and Gus Trenor, plays, respectively, by Laura Linney and Dan Akroyd.  In an effort to bring realism into the film, Davies avoided relying on social stereotypes to create his characters.  This, however, was an unfortunate decision since Wharton relied heavily on the method, exaggerating her characters in an almost Dickinsian manner.  The result is a collection of bland, unremarkable characters with the capability to speak only in soft, stilted tones, among which lie the Lily's two adversaries.  Bertha, a cruel, catty adulteress, only appears uncomfortable, not condescending, during her scattered appearances, and is made remarkably likeable by Ms. Linney, who is clearly out of her element. Akroyd, on the other hand, fails to even create a character of Gus with line delivery reminiscent of a high school staging of Shakespeare.  Mr. Akroyd does not do the character, who Wharton portrays as a kind of contemporary Jabba the Hut, justice, having apparently lost the will to play an unflattering character somewhere between `Blues Brothers 2000' and Brittany Spears' `Crossroads.'  Like so many of his fellow SNL cast members, Mr. Akroyd should stay with comedy, or at least at home.Amid this downward spiral of Lily's life and Akroyd's career lies one of the most finely crafted romances contained in Wharton's writings.  It is between Miss Bart and Laurence Seldon (Eric Stoltz) and is filled with passion, pain and social commentary.  It is, in fact, the central story of the piece, beginning in the first chapter and enduring through the changing settings. It is odd, therefore, that Davies chose to downplay it as much as he did. He seemingly brings it up only often enough to keep it in the audience's consciousness, so that he may call upon it again to improve the denouement. Any passion which Wharton envisioned between the two characters is absent completely.  Instead, the relationship becomes the meaningless chatter and sudden kisses of an uncomfortable Anderson and overacting Stoltz.  Seldon, as the actor apparently understood him, is devoid of the charm and insight Wharton awarded him, and is instead a slick haired man with a top hat that speaks too softly and with the vocal inflection of Adam West.  Holy bad actor, Batman; Stoltz showed more emotion as pot-smoking `Bud' in `Fast Times at Ridgemont High' than as the unbearably gentile Laurence Seldon.Anthony LaPaglia, as the foul-turned-friendly Mr. Rosedale, shines as the one and only actor who apparently understood the lines he had to deliver. He shows both greed and compassion beautifully and asserts himself as a strong, versatile actor, despite Davies attempts to reduce his character. However, not even a game of Quidditch could save this movie and, sadly, his energy and depth are forgotten as soon as he leaves a scene.Throughout the film, relationships, events, and even characters are casually mentioned having never been prior introduced.  This is characteristic, however, of a short adaptation of a long book.  It is inexcusable, however, in an almost two-and-a-half hour movie, where time constraints arise only as the result of poor direction and scarce editing.  The deaths of Lily's parents, and with them a much needed explanation of Lily's mindset, could have easily replaced on of the two minute long scenery shots.  At one point, the audience is entreated to the result of a camera's tour of an empty house, with Mozart playing in the background.  Slow pans and slower fades also lead to the slow tone of the film, along with Davies' decision to replace Whitman's clever, fast pace dialogue with scenes comprised entirely of Ms. Anderson's far-off glances and heavy breathing.  The resulting tone contrasts dramatically with the rapidity of most period pieces about high society, such as that which worked so well for Robert Altman's `Gosford Park.'It is a sad fact that the last half-hour of film, when Anderson's acting and such tone and timing are appropriate to Lily's situation, has the semblance of a good film.  It is too little too late and only makes clear what the film could have been the whole time and yet clearly wasn't.  By the end of the film, I was left tired and depressed, though this was entirely independent of the film, or Lily's, ending.  `The House of Mirth,' was, in all truthfulness, the most boring and painful movie I have ever seen.Most films have something, not matter how insignificant, to offer their viewers.  In `Deep Blue Sea,' for example, a movie about a sea lab of good looking people being attacked by giant super-intelligent sharks, Samuel L. Jackson gets eaten.  Unfortunately, `Mirth' is without offerings, and neither Akroyd or Anderson are devoured by fish.At the end of `The House of Mirth,' Terrence Davies credits himself as having `written and directed' the picture.  This byline tells it all. `The House of Mirth' is not based on an Edith Wharton novel.

This butchering of Bart, while perhaps somewhat helpful to the moviegoer incapable of making personal conclusions, leaves very little room for the change of self that the character must later undergo.This transformation comes as a result of a change in social and economic status, brought on by antagonists Bertha Dorset and Gus Trenor, plays, respectively, by Laura Linney and Dan Akroyd.  In an effort to bring realism into the film, Davies avoided relying on social stereotypes to create his characters.  This, however, was an unfortunate decision since Wharton relied heavily on the method, exaggerating her characters in an almost Dickinsian manner.  The result is a collection of bland, unremarkable characters with the capability to speak only in soft, stilted tones, among which lie the Lily's two adversaries.  Bertha, a cruel, catty adulteress, only appears uncomfortable, not condescending, during her scattered appearances, and is made remarkably likeable by Ms. Linney, who is clearly out of her element. Akroyd, on the other hand, fails to even create a character of Gus with line delivery reminiscent of a high school staging of Shakespeare.  Mr. Akroyd does not do the character, who Wharton portrays as a kind of contemporary Jabba the Hut, justice, having apparently lost the will to play an unflattering character somewhere between `Blues Brothers 2000' and Brittany Spears' `Crossroads.'  Like so many of his fellow SNL cast members, Mr. Akroyd should stay with comedy, or at least at home.Amid this downward spiral of Lily's life and Akroyd's career lies one of the most finely crafted romances contained in Wharton's writings.  It is between Miss Bart and Laurence Seldon (Eric Stoltz) and is filled with passion, pain and social commentary.  It is, in fact, the central story of the piece, beginning in the first chapter and enduring through the changing settings. It is odd, therefore, that Davies chose to downplay it as much as he did. He seemingly brings it up only often enough to keep it in the audience's consciousness, so that he may call upon it again to improve the denouement. Any passion which Wharton envisioned between the two characters is absent completely.  Instead, the relationship becomes the meaningless chatter and sudden kisses of an uncomfortable Anderson and overacting Stoltz.  Seldon, as the actor apparently understood him, is devoid of the charm and insight Wharton awarded him, and is instead a slick haired man with a top hat that speaks too softly and with the vocal inflection of Adam West.  Holy bad actor, Batman; Stoltz showed more emotion as pot-smoking `Bud' in `Fast Times at Ridgemont High' than as the unbearably gentile Laurence Seldon.Anthony LaPaglia, as the foul-turned-friendly Mr. Rosedale, shines as the one and only actor who apparently understood the lines he had to deliver. He shows both greed and compassion beautifully and asserts himself as a strong, versatile actor, despite Davies attempts to reduce his character. However, not even a game of Quidditch could save this movie and, sadly, his energy and depth are forgotten as soon as he leaves a scene.Throughout the film, relationships, events, and even characters are casually mentioned having never been prior introduced.  This is characteristic, however, of a short adaptation of a long book.  It is inexcusable, however, in an almost two-and-a-half hour movie, where time constraints arise only as the result of poor direction and scarce editing.  The deaths of Lily's parents, and with them a much needed explanation of Lily's mindset, could have easily replaced on of the two minute long scenery shots.  At one point, the audience is entreated to the result of a camera's tour of an empty house, with Mozart playing in the background.  Slow pans and slower fades also lead to the slow tone of the film, along with Davies' decision to replace Whitman's clever, fast pace dialogue with scenes comprised entirely of Ms. Anderson's far-off glances and heavy breathing.  The resulting tone contrasts dramatically with the rapidity of most period pieces about high society, such as that which worked so well for Robert Altman's `Gosford Park.'It is a sad fact that the last half-hour of film, when Anderson's acting and such tone and timing are appropriate to Lily's situation, has the semblance of a good film.  It is too little too late and only makes clear what the film could have been the whole time and yet clearly wasn't.  By the end of the film, I was left tired and depressed, though this was entirely independent of the film, or Lily's, ending.  `The House of Mirth,' was, in all truthfulness, the most boring and painful movie I have ever seen.Most films have something, not matter how insignificant, to offer their viewers.  In `Deep Blue Sea,' for example, a movie about a sea lab of good looking people being attacked by giant super-intelligent sharks, Samuel L. Jackson gets eaten.  Unfortunately, `Mirth' is without offerings, and neither Akroyd or Anderson are devoured by fish.At the end of `The House of Mirth,' Terrence Davies credits himself as having `written and directed' the picture.  This byline tells it all. `The House of Mirth' is not based on an Edith Wharton novel.  It is a weak and heartless attempt at a movie and was most likely adapted from Sparknotes.com rather than the original source.  If an adaptation is a reflection of how one person understood a novel, then it is clear the Terrence Davies did not understand The House of Mirth.  Read the book.`The House of Mirth' is rated PG (Parental guidance is suggested for young children) for its lack of adult concepts, such as sex, violence, and character development.

When they finally get a decent dancer to perform (Billy as an adult) it lasts 15 seconds.  Extremely frustrating. Ballet was my first career effort, starting when I was 5.  I danced every opportunity I had, in my room as a child, on the streets, in restaurants, in class .. whenever and whatever..I would make up any dance form or steps if I did not know ones to do.  Even after I gave it up as a career path, I still loved dancing in social settings and didn't quit going to dance night clubs until it was too embarrassing because of the age gap between me and the others around me. That love for dancing is what is attempted to be conveyed in Billy Elliot but it is pretty unconvincing when the actor is physically graceless and there is (what I presume is) a double who is a rather mediocre dancer himself and the choreography is pretty terrible.  The scenes of the teacher refining Billy's movements before his tryout were laughable as Billy could barely raise his leg for positions in which his leg was supposed to be parallel to the floor...no evidence of dance genius here.  (Even the little girls in the dance class were better dancers than Billy..though how that was possible, with such a poor teacher, is another weakness of the film.) It was impossible for me to suspend disbelief throughout. Though Jennifer Beals had an uncredited double doing her dancing for her at least the dancer was good, the choreography fun (and at times exciting) to watch and the editing well done.  I feel Billy Elliot does a great disservice to the effort to communicate what the love for dance means.  And the rest of the film...well others have already commented on its shortcomings.  But what I found really did the film in for me was the dozen or so sappy endings. There were so many of them, one right after another, one more of a tearjerker than the last.... it amazes me that this film got as strong reviews as it did.

The studio took a chance on a script from this minor actor and sat stunned as it became a huge success.  Gee, kind of sounds like the plot of the movie!Rocky was not only the quintessential boxing movie, it was also the story of a man reaching for his dreams; and a surprisingly tender love story.  Stallone was tailor-made for this part and he brings many layers to it.  People often underestimate Stallone's intelligence and talent because of his voice and some of his career choices.  Rocky showed a Stallone with tremendous skills and promise.  Unfortunately, Stallone seemed to be more like Rocky at the beginning of the third film living it up and taking the easy fights.  When Stallone is challenged, like in Cop Land, he can surprise you.The film is filled with great character performances, including Burgess Meredith as the cranky trainer Mick, and Burt Young as the course, but caring Pauley.  Carl Weathers' Apollo is a cinematic Ali and makes a great contrast to Stallone's Rocky.This movie is as much about emotion as it is about achieving your dreams.

The first three Rocky's make a fine trilogy  The challenger who goes for the title and misses it by a hair, the rematch and the struggle to find the one element needed to capture the gold, and the downfall of the new champion and the rediscovery of what it took to rise to the top.  After that, the series is reduced to jingoism and caricature.  The same is true for Rambo.  In First Blood, he is a weary and lost veteran who is pushed to the breaking point.  In the subsequent films, he is just a cartoon supersoldier, blowing up tanks and helicopters with arrows and fighting armies alone.There is talk of yet another Rocky and Rambo.  Hopefully, Stallone will let them stay retired and look for something more challenging.  You can never recapture lightning in a bottle.

On the one hand we have a boxer, who took the bribe to go down, but he didn't do his part and tries to get away with the money, without getting killed by the mobsters. On the other hand we have two mob hitmen who have serious troubles getting rid of the dead body on the backseat of their car. Then we have the bored wife of the mob boss overdosing. Then we have two wannabe armed robbers in a restaurant. Finally we have two guys caught by homosexual rapist cop and his also perverted brother. Many people say that the films were hard to follow. I had no any troubles at all with that, and I'm telling you I am not a rocket scientist. Of course if your favorite movie is The fast and the furious - that's another story. SPOILERS I would like to add a little about the violence in Reservoir dogs - all the guys in the movie are criminals, so what did you expect? And anyway, the blonde guy is obviously a cyco, and it's much more believable that he is about to cut someone's limb or ear, or hose, or finger. Anything, instead (for example) explaining to everyone that he is Napoleon and the next year he will repeat his russian invasion, or stopping every one of three men, telling him how did he shoot the poor albatross.

Oh, and should I mention Braveheart (an english soldier cuts off the throat of Gibson's beloved),Apocalypse now (Sheen shoots with his gun an innocent woman just because he is in a hurry) or The godfather (the last part, where Michael's people kills his enemies and he actually becomes Don Michael).

I saw Reservoir dogs years ago. Not when it was released, maybe four or five years later... But it stuck with me since the first moment till the end. Wow. It was like BANG! I loved the movie. Now I see many people comparing the dogs with the pulp. I think that isn't right. I mean - the stories, the situations, the characters are completely different. SPOILERS Dogs - we have actually four main characters - mr. Orange, mr. Blonde, mr. Pinc, mr. White. Plus Nice Guy Eddie and Joe who are also important, though not that much. And we have a single story about un undercover cop, whose intervention failed a heist, and the other guys wandering what went wrong, and trying to find the rat. SPOILERS Pulp - well, it's a little more complicated. On the one hand we have a boxer, who took the bribe to go down, but he didn't do his part and tries to get away with the money, without getting killed by the mobsters. On the other hand we have two mob hitmen who have serious troubles getting rid of the dead body on the backseat of their car. Then we have the bored wife of the mob boss overdosing. Then we have two wannabe armed robbers in a restaurant. Finally we have two guys caught by homosexual rapist cop and his also perverted brother. Many people say that the films were hard to follow. I had no any troubles at all with that, and I'm telling you I am not a rocket scientist. Of course if your favorite movie is The fast and the furious - that's another story. SPOILERS I would like to add a little about the violence in Reservoir dogs - all the guys in the movie are criminals, so what did you expect? And anyway, the blonde guy is obviously a cyco, and it's much more believable that he is about to cut someone's limb or ear, or hose, or finger.

I do not think that Schindler's List is the greatest film of all time (although I am absolutely delighted that it is rated at #4 on the IMDb list and was #9 on the AFI list of the greatest films ever in the last century) but it is certainly one of the top three greatest war films of all time.  It was more than poetic justice that Steven Spielberg was finally vindicated when he was named as the Best Director of 1993 and this film the very best of that year.  What made it special for me personally (since I am an Anglophile) was that the top four acting roles went to Brits Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler; Ralph Fiennes as Goeth; Ben Kingsley as Stern; and Caroline Goodall as Emilie Schindler. The fact that it was filmed in black and white with stunningly effective cinematography enhanced the film's uniqueness although it was obviously an Oscar bid by Spielberg, who had agonized over whether to have the project helmed by Roman Polanski before he himself took on the burden.  (How ironic that only recently Polanski was justly honored for his great work for directing The Pianist, which I think is the best film since Titanic).  I can understand why there is a continual debate about the significance of this film, but it cannot be denied that it is a necessary work of art and a very valuable history lesson, particularly now that we are once again a nation at war with anti-Semitic totalitarianism.  I support anyone's right to free speech, but I am truly appalled that many Americans want to deny that there was even a Holocaust, or wish to forget what happened in the past, and find personal satisfaction in condemning this movie as overrated or mere Jewish propaganda to downplay any other horrific crimes committed by other nations in times of war throughout history.  I was not at all surprised when Titanic became such a huge hit (the biggest in fact since Gone With The Wind) that even schoolchildren began doing book reports on the subject and the entire movie-going planet seemed to erupt in Titanicmania.  Common sense will tell anyone willing to take the time to think about it that the Holocaust was the Titanic at least five thousand times over, and to be honest, I would rather drown in freezing ocean water two miles deep in the dead of night than face death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. I still think it was ridiculous that James Cameron asked for a moment of silence for the victims of history's most celebrated shipwreck at the end of his Oscar acceptance speech, when Steven Spielberg merely (and politely) asked that the nation's schoolteachers please teach this in your schools when he was so honored for making a film about the most ghastly crimes of the millennium.

I have watched this movie on tape, stopping it to examine it in detail at each outrage  the awful dialogue, the wooden acting, the unbelievable props ... everything about this movie is awful, so bad that it has to be seen and examined to be believed.One or two people who have commented on this movie on the Internet Movie Database have defended it on the grounds that 1 at least Mr. Wood was attempting to do something and so deserves your respect and that 2 this is an example of subversive art film-making and so deserves your respect.I wish to take a little of the time of anyone who is reading this to argue that you cannot have art without craft. A monkey may throw dung at people, but that does not make him a cogent speaker. All he communicates is anger.  Mr. Wood may have had excellent intentions when he wrote, produced and directed this film.  He may have intended to make some serious statements. All that comes across is an ineptness so profound that people watch this as a prime example of bad movie making.Others have argued that there are worse movies, movies that are made for a quick buck, which pander endlessly and add nothing.  I agree with that assessment.  If lack of talent is sad,  actual ability  that is used for the lowest purposes is worse. However, that does not dignify this work with any value, nor does the cloak of art.  I feel sorry for Mr. Wood, but he had no talent, no ability and no resources. This is an awful film.  Without ability, you cannot have art, despite the insistence of so many modern artists.  In another bad film of the era, BUCKET OF BLOOD, the protagonist wishes to be a sculptor.  He takes home clay and attempts to model a bust.  His technique of sculpting a nose is to smash on the clay and command it Be a nose!Roger Corman, who directed that movie, made cheap movies intended for the drive-in circuit and knew he was making cheap movies.  He knew you cannot make art with just good intentions, only a mess.  It is a pity that some of the learned commentators on cinema cannot seem to understand this.So, if your intention is to see a movie that is so bad it is hilarious, by all means, take a look at this movie, and my own personal favorite bad movie, TERROR OF TINY TOWN.  But don't mistake it for anything other than what it is.  And if you think you're an artist simply because you're so brilliant, all I can say is don't give up your day job.

I have watched this movie on tape, stopping it to examine it in detail at each outrage  the awful dialogue, the wooden acting, the unbelievable props ... everything about this movie is awful, so bad that it has to be seen and examined to be believed.One or two people who have commented on this movie on the Internet Movie Database have defended it on the grounds that 1 at least Mr. Wood was attempting to do something and so deserves your respect and that 2 this is an example of subversive art film-making and so deserves your respect.I wish to take a little of the time of anyone who is reading this to argue that you cannot have art without craft. A monkey may throw dung at people, but that does not make him a cogent speaker. All he communicates is anger.  Mr. Wood may have had excellent intentions when he wrote, produced and directed this film.  He may have intended to make some serious statements. All that comes across is an ineptness so profound that people watch this as a prime example of bad movie making.Others have argued that there are worse movies, movies that are made for a quick buck, which pander endlessly and add nothing.  I agree with that assessment.  If lack of talent is sad,  actual ability  that is used for the lowest purposes is worse. However, that does not dignify this work with any value, nor does the cloak of art.  I feel sorry for Mr. Wood, but he had no talent, no ability and no resources. This is an awful film.  Without ability, you cannot have art, despite the insistence of so many modern artists.  In another bad film of the era, BUCKET OF BLOOD, the protagonist wishes to be a sculptor.  He takes home clay and attempts to model a bust.  His technique of sculpting a nose is to smash on the clay and command it Be a nose!Roger Corman, who directed that movie, made cheap movies intended for the drive-in circuit and knew he was making cheap movies.  He knew you cannot make art with just good intentions, only a mess.  It is a pity that some of the learned commentators on cinema cannot seem to understand this.So, if your intention is to see a movie that is so bad it is hilarious, by all means, take a look at this movie, and my own personal favorite bad movie, TERROR OF TINY TOWN.  But don't mistake it for anything other than what it is.  And if you think you're an artist simply because you're so brilliant, all I can say is don't give up your day job.

But it was a theatrical release, seeing as it it's headlined by a first-rate cast, a somewhat respected director (De Palma's been getting scorched by the critics recently, more or less deservedly), and a fairly acclaimed screenwriter in David Koepp (who would follow this up with the far superior chiller Stir of Echoes).Nicolas Cage stars as Rick Santoro, a cop at a boxing match who, along with thousands of spectators, witnesses the shooting of the secretary of defense.  Santoro has everyone rounded up and kept in the vicinity of the stadium, not a problem since there's a hurricane brewing outside.  Meanwhile, Major Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise) has plans of his own, and Santoro's belief that there's a major conspiracy going on might just be for real.For about an hour, maybe a bit less, Snake Eyes is moderately enjoyable (worthy of ** to ** 1\/2) fluff, moving at a fairly quick pace with a set-up that isn't half-bad.  Then De Palma struts his stuff in Rashomon-style, giving us first-person POVs during flashbacks and stories being told from different perspectives.  It's all for naught, since it's easily predictable who's lying and who isn't (for crying out loud, the villain is revealed less than halfway through).  De Palma's camerawork (split screens, aerial shots) is visually dazzling, but it can't hide the lack of plot that's at work.The last half-hour is the worst, climaxing to a resolution that's so inane, it has to be seen to be believed.  This isn't even to mention the horrible editing.  (Spoilers begin) You can clearly see a huge wave tipping over a police van, then the camera cuts to said van crashing through the building, just conveniently in time and place to stop the villian from executing witnesses.  Arrghh!  The original ending featured a tidal wave, which might explain the later dialogue where Santoro talks about he remembers almost drowning, which of course, makes no sense given that such a tidal wave never occurred.  This is one of the more blatant bits of filmmaking incompetence I've seen, De Palma should seriously be ashamed.I used to be fan of his and I actually did enjoy the much maligned Mission to Mars, but while his movies might still be visual stunners, they're coming up as losers when it comes to plot and characters (a la this film and the recent Femme Fatale).  Snake Eyes isn't his worst (that's either Fatale or Bonfire of the Vanities), but it signals De Palma's fading career.

With the former all you have to do is put an ordinary joe in a prison , surround him with a bunch of black men and have a guard say Time for a shower you scum  and you'll have the audience biting their finger nails.***** SPOILERS ***** Tom Selleck plays the everyman character of Jimmie Rainwood fairly well in this film and you really can empathise with him as he gets mugged by the home boys on his way back from the canteen , and the following scene made me aware of something I hadn't known at the time - American prisons are factionalised along ethnic lines . I know this now after reading up on it and watching documentaries on the American penal system which did slightly spoil the credibility of THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for me .In no way should THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and AN INNOCENT MAN be compared of course , but this film is very entertaining and sometimes chilling as the prison clichés come one after the other . The white prisoners despise Jimmie for supposedly showing the white race to be weak while the black prisoners show what's in store for him by letting Jimmie witness a gang rape in the gym , and if you look like Tom Selleck you've got to worry about being popular in prison for all the wrong reasons . My main criticism about AN INNOCENT MAN is the rather weak ending where it's revealed that the cops who fitted up Jimmie are corrupt which lets the screen writers - just like Jimmie - get out of jail .All in all a good prison drama . If you like the HBO prison drama OZ you'll certainly enjoy this .

Why? For several reasons1.) The science and technical aspects covered are really way out there. Although some leeway must be given since the movie came out before actual rockets and space travel were possible.  Thus, most of the science and tech talk was conjecture.2.) The U.S. was the only country working on a rocket to put people in another planet?  No international community, I guess.  Asia, Europe, and the Soviet Union just didn't seem to exist.  Unlike the current climate of space travel and science.3.) The racial undertones of the movie.  Anyone notice that the 64 chosen people (along with a bunch of animals to breed for food and such) to embark on the journey to another planet were all WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) ?  No African, Arab\/Muslim, Asian, Hispanic, Catholic or Jewish people.  Plus, most of them were blond haired and\/or blue-eyed.  Not very culturally diverse. Hitler would have loved this movie if he had lived.4.) The purpose of the journey and rocket was to continue the human race on another planet.  If so, several important considerations were avoideda.) Why 32 men and 32 women?  If the goal was to populate another planet as quickly as possible, why not just 6 men and 60 women?  That would allow 60+ new humans per year for like 20 years.  And then it grows exponentially. Plus, you would have to make sure that the men and women chosen weren't sterile.b.) If you are going to redo humankind another planet, why not give consideration to not have those with genetic flaws go?  That way, many genetic diseases or conditions could be avoided.  Although, that would smack again of the Nazi flair and movies like 1984 and Gattaca.5.) The stupid painting\/mural used at the end to represent the landscape of the alien planet.  Not really logical if you study it.  What happened? Someone run a tad over budget and couldn't afford to use real scenery?Once again, a decent movie, but not a sci-fi classic.  There are much better.5 stars out of 10.
