Ethan (John Wayne's character) is an ex-Confederate Civil War fighter who returns to his home, only to have his brother's family killed with the two daughters taken by Comanches. Ethan swears to single-purpose vengeance against the Comanches, which includes going as far as killing the surviving daughter because of her apparent racial uncleanness via contact with the Comanches, and the eponymous search begins.It's hard, seeing John Wayne, token hero of the American Western movie landscape, held up as the man who rights all wrongs in a dangerous company, being so racist and vehemently hate-filled, and to look past that and see that Ethan is an anti-hero and the point is the nature in which this close-minded determination causes damage. Whereas it's a little awkward to state, as the back of one DVD edition of this movie states, that Ethan eventually finds his humanity when such scene occurs literally five shots away from him scalping a Comanche himself, there is a huge role of racial politics in this film which the movie explores to many subtle ways.For one thing, the idea of a man killing his own niece because he considers her racially unclean because of contact (sexual, hegemonic, both mean the same thing in his mind) speaks volumes to the kind of tension frontier life contained, a theme often underplayed in Western films for a much weaker hero-vs-villain two-dimensionality. It also speaks to the patriarchal nature of the society Ford is here-in representing, thus making the sub-plot involving Laurie and Martin strike a meaningful contrast that lends even more weight to its sense of comedic relief.Also, a lot of the plot in this one is understated. Ethan's tension is there before the Comanches, in the hint that he may have had feelings for his brother's wife. The Comanche raid allows that tension to come out with a much more solid and material focus, an aspect that isn't fully resolved, but is compellingly placed. This is one of the many subtle asides Ford puts into the film that detail a character more compelling and three-dimensional than his dialog, one that affords this movie a reason to re-watch if you missed it the first time.Of course, all of this is set against the grand vistas of the Monument Valley. The setting practically overshadows the plot, which is one reason why a movie made of about 70% horse-back scenes and stretching over 5 years of plot time can maintain interest for two hours. Many critics speak of the visual use of the Monument Valley as making the characters seem that much more vulnerable, but there's also the thematic epic-ness of the process, putting these settlers into the lands of the Gods. To be perfectly honest, it's Monument Valley that stays with me much better than the rest of the movie.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2007","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" You know, many times Westerns get an ill-rap for being racist in their treatment of the frontier conflicts between the Cowboys and Indians, but this movie gets it pretty historically right.

On the contrary, there are stretches in the film where you wonder where it will be going (early in the film more-so than other parts, though this is part of Roeg's design as it unfolds). As their other child, a son away at boarding school, gets sick and Julee Christie's character- who has been given a chilling premonition by a blind Italian lady while the two of them, the other played by Donald Sutherland, are in Venice- goes to see to him, the results start to affect Sutherland's character. He sees someone in a red coat, in quick glimpses, and even thinks he sees Christie again. But is there a plot growing in the works? Is he seeing what he thinks he is, or does he lose his rationality? Like Roeg's previous film, Walkabout, there are times when the story is taking such a leisurely pace that it has to be on part of the audience to stay with it. But Roeg twists the screws just slightly, making little things and the attention to details via quick edits, super-impositions, that darn abstraction of the red-mark (which, by the way, shows up later in a church Sutherland is remodeling), that one doesn't want to look away. It is, on the one hand, sort of cheating for what its core audience might want- it doesn't get very much suspenseful until the last ten minutes or so, when finally the stakes are raised just enough through circumstance, and Sutherland succumbing to what he early on had warned Christie off of (believing the blind lady out of some idea that the daughter was still alive).On the other hand, it's not exactly about the suspense anyway it's taken from a short story by the same author who provided stories for some of Hitchcock's films (Rebecca and The Birds), and while it could be said that the filmmaker doesn't shy away from a twist at the end or with some direct musical choices throughout (albeit Roeg doesn't quite get a Herrmann here), it's less about that than about the mind losing a stake in what may or may not really be happening. Is it paranoid if it's really happening to you? Roeg seems to suggest paranoia following the character (is there a plot surrounding Sutherland and Christie, the blind lady, the detective, the strange murders occurring), but his style isn't that of a Hitchcock. He'll linger on some scenes, make some flashes to others, and it sort of put me in a strange mood watching it, almost like watching Antonioni (and even then a comparison is hard to do as the style of both with the camera is separate).What Don't Look Back does is surprise the viewer, if not completely successfully in terms of genre than as something reaching outside the bounds of it, and that's what makes it work as well as it does (if at all) so many years later. The editing is especially good, as was with Walkabout (watch the cross-cutting between the steamy, real husband-wife kind of sex scene and the two of them getting dressed the next day), the mood has a eerie effect without over-stepping itself, and there's also one of the most disturbing killers from a 1970s film. And it goes without saying that Sutherland and Christie both turn in fantastic work here (the former probably more than the latter, if only because of his amount of screen time outranking the other).

Probably Lynch's most famous work, along with the Twin Peaks saga, Blue Velvet is a highly original film about the loss of innocence and the sexual awakening of a young man who discovers a sinister, sadistic society living in his humble, All-American hometown.The movie's storyline is quite simple, and as a result of the films success, has spawned countless imitators in both literature and cinema. A dangerously inquisitive young man, Jeffrey Beaumont (Lynch's muse Kyle MacLachlen, remember him from Twin Peaks?) comes across a human ear buried in a field of overgrown grass. Thanks to advice of his girlfriend Sandy, who obtained her information on the ear from her policeman father, suspects a local lounge singer of association in a crime and hides in her apartment in an amateurish plot to spy on her. She discovers him, procures a large knife, and forces him to strip. She proceeds to fondle him, insisting that she not be looked at. A knock on the door interrupts them, and Jeffery is sent back to the closet. Enter Frank Booth. He inhales a gas (helium?, many fans continue to debate on what the drug actually was) from a portable tank on his belt and then brutally rapes and abuses her, to a certain degree mirroring the very act of violence she performed on Jeffery. Frank exits, and moments later Jeffery consoles her, and she whispers to him hit me In this brief twenty minutes, sexual roles are deliberately confused, reinvented, and ultimately reversed.Even some fifteen years after the release of Blue Velvet its vision remains wildly adamant relative to the stride of other works of contemporary noir. There have been many films about suburban crime, but none as memorable, or as well-known, as this. What makes Blue Velvet increasingly disturbing and such a memorable piece of cinema is how it builds on and subsequently deconstructs audience expectations and assumptions. The film's Americana setting and mood are introduced in an exposition lifted directly from older classic films (there are numerous references to It's A Wonderful Life). In result, the film is initially expected to follow a particular path. It slowly plunges into crime and our expectations are violated by images of disquieting violence and explicit sex, and suburban archetypes are paired with primal curiosity and perversion.The film is set in Lumberton, a very American town. This does not represent a quaint, small town by similarity; it IS one. Lumberton is filled with characters that are completely typical. Presumably the cops eat doughnuts, and drink coffee and the quarterback dates the head cheerleader not out of coincidence but of intention. These characters function to punctuate the story, not to distinguish it. The famous individuality of Lynch's disturbing, highly original vision is established in the darker side of Lumberton, one that is made known through the eyes of Jeffery, our detached observer and questionable hero. Important plot points are not figuratively underlined by clear dialogue and dim-witted, loudmouthed crooks. The film's crime occurs incidentally, and the main characters discover it by second-hand.In the center of the slowly fashioned web of crime is Frank. Dennis Hopper's mesmerizing performance as drug-fulled Frank Booth has been cited numerously as one of the most vile characters in cinema. His dialogue appropriately echoes his nature; he speaks, and acts, in brief, concentrated violent outbursts, whether he is driving or demanding one of his thugs to get him a Pabst Blue Ribbon &#151; his beer of choice, especially of Jeffrey's Hieniken.Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated by audiences. Likewise, it is not a film that is easily forgotten. Thus, the film is a timeless controversy, something that will evoke discussion throughout the ages, and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise.

His dialogue appropriately echoes his nature; he speaks, and acts, in brief, concentrated violent outbursts, whether he is driving or demanding one of his thugs to get him a Pabst Blue Ribbon &#151; his beer of choice, especially of Jeffrey's Hieniken.Blue Velvet is not a film that is easily appreciated by audiences. Likewise, it is not a film that is easily forgotten. Thus, the film is a timeless controversy, something that will evoke discussion throughout the ages, and it is a vision demanding attention if not praise.

But objectivity is one thing, and Oliver Stone is its polar opposite. Instead of Stone's powerhouse film-making style and fierce political convictions adding substance and energy to JFK, his take on the infamous assassination and its aftermath, it is Stone's self-righteous and self-indulgent hammering of the material that inhibit the film from being the intelligent and compelling political investigation piece it could have been. As it is, while JFK could be considered a solid thesis on Stone's perspective on the events, as a film it struggles to hold up amidst the torrent of its own flaws. Stone may never have had the pretense of disguising his perception of the events of the JFK assassination and the alleged ensuing conspiracy as cold hard fact, but he certainly seems determined to beat his audience over the head with his side of the story to the point of bewildered acceptance. Stone's incredibly forceful portrayal of his own perspective, pitching his film directly to heartfelt American sentiment (even going so far as to have Costner directly address the camera when speaking of American liberty) has the final outcome emerge as just a shade away from propaganda. Stone's work tends to attract a love it or hate it reaction, but with a film this shamelessly self-congratulating and painfully biased, it is distinctly hard to love it, plaudits or not. Apart from Stone's own stance on the material, speaking strictly in film-making terms, JFK also finds itself lacking. Excruciatingly long and unreasonably talky (especially near the film's climax, where Kevin Costner talks for literally half an hour straight... no joke) and making use of an abundance of unreasonably clichéd patriotic sequences enough to make one's stomach queasy, Stone's film is far too self-indulgent to make its proper effect. Seldom arises the complaint that a director needs to simplify their work, but given the relatively simple plot ensuing, Stone sure manages to complicate the hell out of it, clarified with a series of incredibly contrived play-by-plays by Garrison and his team. While it is abundantly clear that Stone has done his research on the case, and it is easy to get swept up in the story to a degree, one can't help but wish that he had not found it necessary to include every last scrap of information regarding it - as such, the film feels like it is overflowing at the seams with factual information, often thrust so rapid fire into the audience's face that they have no time to process or internalize it. It is a shame indeed that the content of the film is so disappointingly brought to life, as JFK's technical work is laudable indeed, making use of terrific cinematography and editing (although the initially effective montage sequences, complimented with real historical footage do grow tiresome after being steadily overused as the film progresses) even if the normally reliable John Williams' score overloads on patriotic musical clichés to a nauseating extent. The astonishing array of talented actors substantially raise the quality of the film as a whole. While Kevin Costner as patriotic American everyman DA Jim Garrison is bland at best, painfully trite at worst and unquestionably given far too much screen time, the wonderful supporting cast are more than enough to carry the dead weight of the film's lead. Tommy Lee Jones, in a distinctly different role from his usual casting is electrifying as ominous influential businessman Clay Shaw, with a cold menace simmering beneath his character's flamboyant exterior. Gary Oldman of course effortlessly steals the show as alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald - seen mostly in flashbacks, Oldman's meticulous dedication in fully inhabiting his characters is used to chilling and compelling effect. Backed by dynamic performances from Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, John Candy and Walter Matthau, all superb when given their moment to shine, the film's supporting cast raises the bar in terms of quality considerably. Unfortunately, Sissy Spacek is wasted in a banal subplot as Garrison's wife, adding a nauseatingly by the numbers obsession endangers family life theme to an already overlong film. As Stone dollops on the sap and Spacek overacts to her heart's content, backed up by absurdly untalented child actors as their children, the family sequences are among the film's most painful and unnecessary. Keeping in mind that appreciation of Oliver Stone's films does tend to be just as subjective as his own cinematic stance, it becomes difficult to dispute JFK being far too overlong, overstuffed with dialogue and bombarded by offensively clichéd sequences to be anywhere near as effective as it ought to have been.

I rented a copy in a local video store. Everyone was talking about it at the time especially about Jean-Claude Van Damme, who only did some small roles in movies like No retreat, No surrender. This time he was the main character. Bloodsport tells the story of martial arts expert, Frank Dux (played by Jean Claude Van Damme), who travels to Hong Kong to participate in a dangerous underground competition known as the Kumite. Frank Dux was trained by Tanaka whose son recently died and was going to participate in the Kumite tournament. Frank decides to compete and represents the family name of his master, Tanaka. But Frank has a little problem, he is a special force for the US Army and getting hurt in the competition is not a luxury for the army. The army decides to send agents Helmet (played by Norman Burton) and Rawling (played by Oscar winner Forest Whitaker) and follow Frank all the way to Hong Kong.On his journey Frank meets a big roughneck American call Ray Jackson (played by Donald Gibb) who becomes his friend and is also participating in the tournament. Frank also meets an attractive young reporter Janice Kent (played by Leah Ayres) who wants to write an article of the underground competition. The competition is fearless with fighters from around the world and introduced different styles and disciplines of fighting. Frank toughest challenge is Chong Li (played by the legendary Bolo Yeung) a menacing and ruthless fighter who will stop at nothing. The movie has its cheesy part and the music, well it's the 80s, but our IMDb need to understand that BloodSport is a low budget movie and it launched the career of Van Damme as a mayor action star. It even inspired other movies like Kickboxer, Shootfighter, American Samurai, and more, it also inspired video games like Street Fighter Mortal Kombat and Fatal Fury. Years later the Ultimate Fighting Championship introduced us with real live fighters from around the world with the same format as the movie. These are some of the reasons Bloodsport should be consider as a classic. So, if you seen this movie, I invite you to rent it or buy it and travel the time machine of memories.

The movie has its cheesy part and the music, well it's the 80s, but our IMDb need to understand that BloodSport is a low budget movie and it launched the career of Van Damme as a mayor action star. It even inspired other movies like Kickboxer, Shootfighter, American Samurai, and more, it also inspired video games like Street Fighter Mortal Kombat and Fatal Fury. Years later the Ultimate Fighting Championship introduced us with real live fighters from around the world with the same format as the movie. These are some of the reasons Bloodsport should be consider as a classic. So, if you seen this movie, I invite you to rent it or buy it and travel the time machine of memories. Those who haven't seen it, I make the same invitation and see the movie that started it all.

However, why does Poitier leave the night before the dedication? This is not some slight oversight by the director. A perfect ending is deliberately avoided.I'm convinced this is because the writer wanted to emphasize that Poitier's character, just like him as a person, was as an individualist, and he'd already gotten past being subservient to a religion or any group. He built the chapel for his own reasons, as he stated many times. He specifically says at the table some things never change before he tricks Skana into thanking him, after which she points to the sky and says HE (god) built the chapel He also denies her the chance to put him in the front row on opening day, which she offers to him.I'd love to hear other interpretations, but I'm convinced the message is about modernity and pride in living beyond religion, and its constraints. He wasn't going to be her puppet, no matter what. Maybe he knew he would react poorly to her treatment the next day.Anyway, I cant imagine a movie in Hollywood being this masterful with subtlety anymore, nor could I imagine Hollywood making a movie with this complex a message on religion (in which religion comes up short to the individual) since 1980. Poitier's talent is incredible, and it reminds me, though I was born in 1964, of a bright hope for the future of individual rights and modernity that existed in the early sixties, and was promptly squashed by the machine.A generation that looks to mindless rappers could do well to reset their sights on Mr Poitier's cool strength, class, and intelligence. He has all these qualities and still retains his integrity. Of course, his get-along attitude is interpreted by some as collusion, but ignorant confrontation hasn't produced better results.

It is a political and social satire about nuclear war. When a United States general orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, the President scrambles to cancel the attack and mutually work things out with the Soviet Union. Negotiations seem to work, until it is realized that there is a Doomsday Device implemented to automatically counter-attack any nuclear hits. Needless to say, things become complicated.The cast is one of the greatest strengths of the film; all the characters are finely crafted and acted flawlessly. Peter Sellers does his legendary performance in three roles (Dr. Strangelove, the President, and Group Captain Mandrake). I do wish that Dr. Strangelove had more screen time; seeing that he was the title character, I expected a bigger influence from him onto the plot. Mandrake was a solid comedy character and the President had a believable, political image. Performances from other actors were also great. George C. Scott as General Turgidson was commendable; his paranoia and fights with the ambassador were classic. Slim Pickens was simply fantastic as the bomber pilot Major Kong, seething with a heavily pro-American mindset.The technical aspects of Dr. Strangelove are also a strong point. The camera angles and cinematography are excellent. The scenes all have the same dark comedy mood in them. Although there was extensive dialog, it never felt overwhelming. The decision to use When Johnny Comes Marching Home as music for the bomber scenes (with no music used elsewhere) was a good choice. There are many nuances that fill even the smallest holes in the movie, and each character is meticulously detailed.The message is perhaps the most important part of the film, especially when focusing in the context of its release date (during the height of the Cold War). It is basically a satire of mutual destruction, but carries other intriguing implications. There is a lot of sexual imagery, although it is hidden as a second layer to the main plot (although it is mentioned in Dr. Strangelove's ending speech). The whole conclusion was epic and hilarious, and wraps things up just like it should.Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece that is rightly praised.

The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed, guitar playing Reggie.

The first sequel of 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and highly entertaining. After the first sequel however, Phantasm creator Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it even is quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new, are at times tiresome, which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors. - SPOILERS - Quite in the beginning, we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres (the brain-sucking flying silver balls) is unraveled. Thenceforward, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as Tim, a Home Alone-style little kid who happens to be great at shooting, an Rocky, a tough and super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a crew cut) are introduced. The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed, guitar playing Reggie.

Phantasm has so far been followed by 3 sequels, a fourth sequel is announced for 2008. The sequels differ in quality (Phantasm II is immensely entertaining while the others are quite poor) but none of them comes near the original in atmosphere, suspense and greatness.I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I assure that those who haven't seen Phantasm yet can prepare for one of the creepiest villains ever, the 'Tall Man', brilliantly played by Angus Scrimm. This extremely scary Tall Man, a mysterious supernatural corpse snatcher, alone would be reason enough to see this movie, but Phantasm has so much more to offer. The film is full of highly bizarre creatures, constantly suspenseful and often delivers a downright nightmarish atmosphere. Apart from Angus Scrimm, who, as I mentioned above, delivers a brilliant performance in the role of the Tall Man, Reggie Bannister is also great as the pony-tailed Reggie. A. Michael Baldwin is also good in the lead, the other performances aren't bad, but not particularly worth mentioning either. The film is also quite violent and gory, the main theme is a highly memorable and great piece of Horror movie score and the suspense is constant. The film also has a few minor flaws, but these are by far overwhelmed by the film's qualities. All said, Phantasm is a creepy and bizarre film that deserves its cult-status, and a must-see for any lover of Horror. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2007","score":"","review":" Don Coscarelli's Phantasm of 1979 is a creepy, bizarre and very original cult flick, that no lover of the Horror genre can afford to miss.
