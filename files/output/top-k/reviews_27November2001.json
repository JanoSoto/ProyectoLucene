The first film (episode IV, NEW BEGINNING, or whatever) was undoubtedly the best, with a great story and simple, uncomplicated (but still very interesting) characters.  The original stands on its own, complete in and of itself.     With EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, they began to go off track.  Lucas made a huge mistake with his plot development of having Luke be the son of Darth Vader, and also the brother of Leia.  This was ill-conceived, and just as stupid as it would be if James Bond found out that Goldfinger was his long-lost father (not to mention Miss Galore being his sister!).  We were thus robbed of the Vader we loved to hate, a classic villain of all time, and they ruined a good story line with this soap opera contrivance.     That being said, the other entries can be acknowledged as various imperfect parts of the unadulterated original, and have at least offered the opportunity to view their progressive special effects.  In that sense, I wasn't disappointed with the technology which brought about the entertaining RETURN OF THE JEDI, and neither am I really disappointed with that aspect of the otherwise weak PHANTOM MENACE.     As for the story which plays out in PHANTOM, I never was able to follow it closely due to a lack of compelling plot.  The characters played by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor (as young Obi-Wan Kenobi) uncover some kind of conspiracy hatched by the shadowy Darth Sidious.  They spend the rest of the film running around trying to thwart whatever's supposed to be going on, and even that sounds more interesting than it actually is.  Along the way, they meet the little boy who will one day grow up to become Darth Vader, and I can't think of anything more ridiculous than seeing Vader as a child.     The several action scenes were effective enough, and Natalie Portman's character shows some promise, as does McGregor's take on Obi-Wan.  Those criticizing Jake Lloyd, in his role as little Anakin Vader (I know, his name's Skywalker), should give the kid a break.  He did about as good as anybody could with this.  But the irritating Jar Jar was indeed unnecessary, and the two robots from the earlier films were totally out of place.     However, Darth Maul (Ray Park) proves to be an intriguing and enigmatic presence as one of the evil foes, giving the impression of being an indomitable force of nature.  He's almost, but not quite, a worthy stand-in villain for Darth Vader, at least as the latter character was originally perceived, and Maul's duel with the two heroes is one of the few high points.  By the way, shouldn't there be some kind of Jedi knight's code prohibiting two against one in a fight.     Finally, here's how the STAR WARS saga could have been saved.  I would have kept Vader as an unredeemable villain, and never as the father of Luke and Leia.  PHANTOM MENACE should have been about two young Jedi knights (not children), Anakin and Vader, who join with Obi-Wan in combatting the so-called menace.  The next film would end with Vader turning against his fellow knights, and joining the dark side of the Empire.  And the third installment would end with evil triumphing, and Vader killing Anakin, who leaves behind an infant son (the future Luke Skywalker).     There's the bare bones of a plot which Lucas could have fleshed out with a far better story than the convoluted soap into which he let the saga decline.  He had a chance to create a series that would live up to some very high standards, and PHANTOM MENACE could have deserved to take its place as part of the truly great and original STAR WARS film.

Convinced Marxists will hate its all too truthful criticism of communism. The 2  sex scenes break up the movie´s otherwise family friendly tone. However, in spite of these details, which can be both pluses and minuses depending on one´s point of view, Moscow on the Hudson is a great movie - possibly even the best movie ever made about the immigrant experience. ( I should know because I was an immigrant to the U.S. myself.) It is perhaps even mislabled as a comedy since its dramatic aspects outweigh its comedic ones. Its essential point seems to be that if you have a positive attitude, you can actually connect with the strange people in a strange land. However, its other major point is that no matter how well you adapt, the home where your roots are is still your home and you will miss it no matter how awful life there was. And if you are like Vladimir, you will also have to deal with an unstable mix of odd jobs, friends who never stay in one place too long, your new country´s street scum, arrogant morons from your motherland, and a significant other who will not fully commit to you. However, Vladimir realizes that this is not too high a price to pay for freedom to speak your mind, travel, and really shop around at Bloomingdale´s. He also winds up appreciating America´s wealth of many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, although the makers of this film were good enough to not bang the viewer over the head with this point. Rather, they present it as irreverently and matter of factly as Jim Jarmusch does in his best work. This all amounts to a movie that is very human (or humane) in a gentle way and rather realistic in its depiction of the less extreme varieties of human nature. Its low key approach is much better for expressing its points than the loads of melodrama which these kinds of movies usually have. The jazz music soundtrack is great too.

This is a very grown up movie. Kubrick takes his characters, his actors and his adult audience places they all know about but don't want to go, at least not in decent company.I never did understand 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968), but I guessed it was about life, the universe and everything. I wish I couldn't understand Eyes Wide Shut because it's about everyman (generic!), with Kubrick playing psychotherapist. Under our clothes we are all naked, and even the Queen starts the day on the throne, toilet paper in hand. We put on our uniforms to pretend we are different, and so we don't have to confront the reality underneath. Kubrick's titles sequence uses these facts and tells us we're in for a rough ride.Is the plot thin? Does the plot matter? Like Bogart and Bacall's The Big Sleep (1946), it's not the plot that matters here, but rather what is really going on in individual scenes as snapshots of different angles of everyman's psyche. If you want a more substantial plot, add what has gone before for yourself .... if you know. (Alice's last words may be a clue). In any event, Kubrick's view was that a film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.As a mirror held up to our dark side, Eyes Wide Shut did not disturb me as profoundly as did Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) - but it came close.

I cried every time he appeared on the screen.Thora Birch was also far, far below her level in 'American Beauty', obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character, and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.If at all, the thief Snails (Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie) had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes, the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however.The performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me, and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special', but far more for 'being untalented'.The effects where better than the story, but really not that exciting either.Some people say fantasy is about stereotypes, but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story !

This story was nothing but crap !And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors, they have proven they can do far, far better !

This shows in the poor character development, the abundance of meaningless shots, and lastly, and most importantly in my mind, the meaninglessness of the dialogue. -All of the integrity of the characters from the first two Godfathers is completely done away with in the first sequence. -Michael, a taciturn, introverted, calculating megalomaniac in the first two films is lavish, loose-lipped, pathetic in his control over his family, and careless as he never was and never would have been by the first two movies. -Constanza is all of a sudden involved in the family affairs. Joe Mantegna plays a terribly thin enemy of the family, Joey Zasa, but can't be blamed as an actor with such a flimsy script. Andy Garcia overacts every one of Vincent Corleone's lines and every step--he practically goosesteps. Tom Hagan is missing and leaves a giant hole. It doesn't matter that Sofia Coppola can't act, because she had nothing to work with anyway--she plays a whinging, incestuous brat poorly, but convincingly (!). -The first dramatic sequence involves a conflict between Joey Zasa and Vincent mediated by Michael, who is trying to go legit, but can't seem to do it. Vincent tries to convince Michael that Zasa is an enemy in a very un-Godfatherly manner a) he does it right in front of Zasa, b) he does so simply because Zasa supposedly says, F*ck Michael Corleone, behind his back, and c) he disobeys Michael right in the room by biting Zasa's ear off. -This is juvenile drama. There is no tension that lasts longer than a sequence. There is no reason motivating the characters. There is no real respect for anything--all the subtleties of the family traditions are stomped on, which makes the highly visual sequences, loaded with symbols, cheap because the symbols mean nothing to the characters. -The haughty diction is only pretension void of any understanding of respect and the values that drive the family and Michael in particular. Michael, a very chiseled character in the first two movies, becomes paper thin, with no real idea that is central to his action. All his actions in the first movie and the facades he puts on as Don in the second movie show an aspiration to an ideal or, at least, an aspiration to appear as this ideal. He has none of this in the third film and this change of character doesn't happen on screen, nor is it explained. We're left only to believe that Coppola and Puzo tore this one off in a frenzied weekend when the purse got light. -The story lacks direction, focus, has nothing in particular to say, but that's not condemnable unto itself. The dialogue, however, is worthy of a pair of misguided high school kids who watched the first two movies and figured they knew what respect was because they saw one guy shoot another and a bunch of people get scared. None of the dialogue is loaded with the layers of meaning and subtlety that exist in the first two. All the characters are brash and stereotypical, or, in the case of a few, like Enzo the Baker and Bridget Fonda's character, tokens and a waste of celluloid. -Though Godfather III isn't worth its score in Scrabble, it is, however, a testament to Pacino as an actor, that with such flimsy stuff he still manages to act compellingly.

It's one of my favourite movies.  So when I heard about the sequel I couldn't wait for the DVD.  I shoulda waited even longer. There is so many things wrong with this movie that I'm amazed anyone would say this is better than the first.  Only one thing saved this movie from total destruction.  And that's the character of Charisse.  Who we learn is beginning to have this thing called Dr. Dolittle's talent. It saved it from being a total waste of time.  I'll probably go buy it now. (Thank God for online rentals!!)  Some of the humor I liked of course, but.....The bad is really bad.  First..continuity.  Okay.. Dr. Dolittle has ended and number 2 starts.  Did I miss something here?  They don't explain what happened to Rodney (the Guinea Pig) or how bout the baby Gator.  Hmmm perhaps the Gator ate Rodney and they deemed it not to the liking of family entertainment.  Two... they shift the focus off the fact that Dolittle is a doctor.  There's a time for an environmental movie and there's not a time for it.  This wasn't the time.  Imagine ER suddenly became a tv show about what George Clooney does in his spare time.  Eddie shoulda been doing what he does best.  Doctoring.  At least have it so the bear needed physical help, instead of the instructional video on bear mating.Finally.. at the end of the first movie we are left knowing that it doesn't take riches to get places in one's life.  Great moral feeling here.  The bad guys were rich.  So guess what... The second movie  Dr. Dolittle is now a rather rich doctor.  Lives in a mansion with a push button gate.This movie doesn't even try to be a family movie.  It's doesn't try anything.
