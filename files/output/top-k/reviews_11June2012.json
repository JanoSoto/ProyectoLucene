[{"date":"11 June 2012","score":"","review":" Showing the same stretch of time in a movie several times over isn't new. And it's not just about Kieslowski -- I also need to think of Jim Jarmusch's masterpiece _Mystery Train_. Tom Tykwer shows 3 alternative ways of developing a story, and behind the seeming vacuousness of it all even manages to be positive and celebrate religious faith. The movie has a happy ending -- if you disregard the two foregoing endings; in juxtaposing the three, Tykwer ensures that the final happy ending isn't corny and conventional, but ironic. Probably the best decision on the part of the director was to make the movie sweet & short; the result is that the 80 minutes are so action-packed you hardly have room to breathe. Lots more nuances could be added to each of the 3 story lines -- but Tykwer wisely eschewed all of that. The action remains suspenseful literally to the last few seconds -- you can never be sure if a car doesn't come racing round a corner suddenly, mowing down the two heroes just before the final credits roll. One of Tykwer's messages seems to be that human destinies are entirely haphazard; this can particularly be felt in the photographic flash-forwards of destinies of some of the passers-by of Lola's desperate run. It's an astonishing feat that Tykwer manages to be moralistic -- unobtrusively -- in a hectic movie like this; his main message to the viewer seems to be, Play it nice. Once Lola basically decides (likely in her subconscious) to play it nice, she finally gets it right. _Lola rennt_ affirms the director's belief in the super-natural; Lola's wins at the casino are no gimmick; neither is her healing power in the speeding ambulance car; or the hint received by Manni from the blind woman -- all of these are Tykwer's assertions that those things are, in fact, possible; that spirit can overcome matter. The overarching message, Play it nice, seems so powerful that the movie's other, starker message, retreats into the background; namely, _Lola rennt_ seems to suggest that whatever events happen in our lives, do not really matter; the only thing that matters is, Play it nice; and *whatever* (literally) happens to you whenever you play it nice, must be accepted as your destiny; therefore, it's not really preferable to live or to die at any particular moment; to find the money (or whatever, since this is just Hitchcock's famed MacGuffin) or lose it -- as long as you play it nice, or at least try to. (Such as in Lola's first two runs in which she *doesn't* play it nice, but at least is sincerely trying to help out a friend, a fellow human being in need.) And so, it's not *events* (or non-events, or any possible type of developments or non-developments) in our lives that are in any way important -- rather it's our *attitude* in life, and in every moment of our lives; we should be as focused on living our life the right way in each and every moment, as Lola is focused on her run and getting to the desired spot before 12 noon (her resolve being best seen in the moments just before she almost gets run over by a truck, and before she notices the casino building). _Lola rennt_ moves at an incredibly brisk pace -- as fast as Lola herself can be seen running through a myriad of Berlin's streets. The cinematography, very varied and dynamic in the style of MTV videoclips, is enriched by animation, even; the musical score is inventive, modern, with techno-beats, but non-obtrusive -- I fail to see how anyone could possibly fall asleep while watching a movie proceeding at such a furious pace. The allusions to Hitchcock's _Vertigo_ are much appreciated. While it would probably be too much to call _Lola rennt_ a crown jewel in terms of art of film-making, it's definitely a precious little glittering diamond.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"11 June 2012","score":"","review":" Police Story meets Lethal Weapon in Brett Ratner's directorial emergence to the big time. A fairly odd couple join forces to solve a kidnapping and what a ride of endless comedy, superior action and crazy entertainment it turns into. We've seen Black movies, Chinese films, but who would have envisaged, as Chris Tucker coins it, something 'Blackinese'? It's so poles apart from convention, but that's the essence of Buddy Cop Comedy and the reason why 'Rush Hour' is a definitive chapter in this sub-genre's history. This pairing really worked because of the expectation that it was never destined to. Truth is though, this unconventionally bizarre couple sizzled. They fed off each other, giving one another motivation and inspiration for their respective characters and showing each other the ropes as they individually know it. The fun they had was so evident and that feeling came through the screen to the audience. In general, this was a really well constructed action film script. It had all the ingredients for a solid Hong Kong style action driven movie including a villain which is not just an everyday gangster, 'good guys' who aren't hapless yet are not overly capable either as well as, most importantly, a screenplay with effectively choreographed action sequences but interwoven with bouts of fitting light-hearted humour. Tucker excels tremendously as the brash and cocky Detective Carter, it was as if the role was made for him. He is gut-bustingly hilarious in his fast talking performance which will no doubt go down as legendary in the field of African - American comedy, a worthy follow up to his famous 'Smokey' in a style extremely reminiscent of one of his idols, Eddie Murphy. He in fact improvises much of his dialogue and it comes across as brilliantly spontaneous, particularly in Carter's interactions with (or otherwise known as his patronising of) Jackie Chan's Lee. He just flummoxes people with an ability to talk utter garbage (similar to the infamous Axel Foley) again and again. He talks and swaggers as if he owns this movie, and that attitude made if feel like he did. And just how great was his chemistry with Carter's self determined non existent trophy in Elizabeth Pena? They both nailed that, and it begs the query, why do you always need a stereotypical love interest? Pena's character worked wonders in conjunction with Carter the way a regular love interest never would. Jackie Chan finally brings his fantastic stunt work to the mass Hollywood audience and really forges a future in action comedy. You could really call him the more able sidekick. Much has been made of Chan's relatively shaky English but it is admirable to see a role which required that sort of casting. In other words, they needed the shaky English for the contrast in partners to work. And Jackie Chan makes it a point to let his words flow naturally and not try overly hard to make himself 'too Chinese'. He doesn't hesitate to give some of his own to Chris Tucker, even if he is outspoken most of the time. Hilarious but not treated foolishly, action filled but not action dictated, if you like African - American comedy, Hong Kong cinema and a bit of prejudice, you'll lap this up. And do hang on for the in credit bloopers. There were always bound to be many stuff ups with this formula, who doesn't find those funny?
