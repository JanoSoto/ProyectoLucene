But I enjoyed this movie a lot when I first watched it back in the 1980s and a recent reviewing on DVD proved it to be just as fascinating and interesting as ever. Personally I was never all that impressed by Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter in the hugely overrated 'The Silence Of The Lambs' in the first place, and 'Hannibal' was one of the worst major releases in the last few years, so the less said about that the better. Brian Cox ('Rushmore') plays a much more low key Dr. Lecter in this movie, but to me is very effective in the few scenes he is in. And that I suppose is the most important thing to emphasise about 'Manhunter' - Lector is only one very small part of this movie, which is, as the title implies, focuses on FBI Agent Graham, played by the underrated William Petersen ('To Live And Die In L.A.', 'Gunshy'). Petersen is the star of this show, end of story. The strong supporting cast includes the ultra-creepy Tom Noonan (some may remember him from 'Robocop 2'), Dennis Farina ('Get Shorty'), Joan Allen ('Pleasantville'), Stephen Lang ('Last Exit To Brooklyn') and Kim Greist ('Brazil'). 'Manhunter' may not be Michael Mann's best work (that for me is a tie between 'Thief' and 'Heat'), but it is first rate thriller that values intelligence over sensationalism, quite a rare thing in the often tired serial killer genre. Forget about Hannibal Lecter, watch this movie because it is excellent in its own right. An extremely underrated movie.

However, don't expect a slasher movie.But at the center of it all is Christan Bale as Patrick Bateman. Shallow, self-aware, greedy, narcissistic and completely nuts! As a portrait of a man who has no soul and only exists when he can experience the `high' of murder or have the most stylish business card in his firm, his performance is truly chilling. He is machine, not human, who delights in others pain and degradation, except for one scene in his apartment with his sweet secretary. When he realizes that a murderous rage may be imminent he tells her to get home because `he might hurt her'. Hmmm, in what sense one may wonder? Just kidding. Anyway, at that point, there is a subtle sense that he MIGHT be salvaged by this girl and that he longs for a life that is real.Christian Bale was apparently not a first choice for the part but seeing him here I doubt that anyone could be a better choice (certainly not Leonardo DiCaprio).

I was already too old, and I was rather annoyed at most of it. Particularly annoying was the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. It had the longest line and, when I finally got on the ride, it was utterly boring. It also takes longer than all of the other rides, as well. Well, the movie on which the ride is based is fortunately much more fun (and you could probably watch it thrice in a row from the time you step into the ride's line up to the moment you get back off the thing!). It's actually one of the best films Disney ever put its name on, counting both live action and animation. In fact, the only one I can think of off hand that I definitely prefer is Mary Poppins. A good deal of 20,000's success can probably be found in Jules Verne's novel. I have a feeling that a lot of the dialogue and plot were left intact (I know some of it was changed). The script and dialogue are enormously literate. Disney films rarely (if ever) express this much intelligence and depth. It would only equal half the movie, though, if the lead actors weren't aboard. Kirk Douglas, Paul Lukas, Peter Lorre, and James Mason are at their bests here. Douglas and Mason in particular give stellar performances (Lukas' character is more of an observer and Lorre is, well, Lorre, but both have great scenes). Douglas plays Ned Land, a harpooner and the sole survivor of a ship's crew which was attacked by the Nautilaus. He's energetic and funny, and he also effectively communicates his dilemma as someone who has no real purpose on the ship, and is thus disposable. Heck, Kirk even sings a great song, believe it or not! Mason plays Captain Nemo, a character that became so archetypical afterwards that he might seem somewhat cliche to some. But Mason has some of the most amazing line readings. Richard Fleischer's direction is quite good. The film also benefits from an obviously enormous budget, as the production values are awe-inspiring. Take for example a scene in which the Nautilaus begins to sink. We see various bolts burst and pipes bend. We see the details when they repair the ship. And the giant squid attack is actually quite well done. The special effect technology is a bit crude at the time (a goofy rubber shark thankfully only appears in one shot), but the squid's enormous tentacles look and move realistically, or at least as realistically as one can demand for a film from this period.

This should not be misconstrued as a criticism of the series in general but more of a 'don't flog a dead horse' warning to Mr Myers.  There is only so far one can take a comedy series before it starts to grate and if we never see those horrible teeth on screen ever again then the series will have survived, reputation untarnished.  The point is, this is a fantastic movie.As with all spoof movies the comedy is distinctly hit and miss (think Scary Movie, Hot Shots, Naked Gun and yes, even Airplane!).  Thankfully AP3 has a far greater percentage of hits than misses.  Some of the set pieces worked into this movie were absolute, unquestionable genius.  The scene with the fountain statue and the Japanese guard had me almost crying with laughter. Another fine & inventive set piece was the scene with the Japanese subtitiles.  Other fine examples were the Mole, Fat Bastards wire driven combat scene and another brilliant shadow scene, this time with Mini-Me instead of Felicity Shagwell.Acting wise, very impressive. Aside from the comic genius that is Mike Myers,this time adding a forth, politically incorrect villain in the form of the hilarious Goldmember (Hi guysh!  I'm from Holland!  Isn't zat vierd?), Michael Caine is perfectly cast as Mr Powers Snr, in a kind of lighter hearted 'Get Carter' sort of way.Credit must go, however, to young Beyonce Knowles.  Popstars who act are a mixed breed.  You have the good (David Bowie, Jennifer Lopez, Bjork), the average (Britney Spears, Ice Cube) and the bloody awful (Mariah Carey, Jon Bon Jovi, Mick Jagger).  Fortunately for her, the 21 year old is comendably realistic as the big-haired blacksploitation secret agent.  Surrounded as she is by a top-notch cast she can hardly fail to look good, but instead of riding the talent of her cast-mates as you might expect from a relative newcomer, Beyonce carries herself extremley well and doesn't look at all like she's reading off a piece of card (I'm looking at you Mariah!).Now we get to the part of AP3 that forced me to give it a lower rating than it might otherwise have got.  Scott Evil.  Now you may remember that in the first two movies, young Scott was one of the principle sources of entertainment with his frequent set pieces with Dr Evil.  Now call me cynical if you like, but turning Scott Evil...er...evil was about the worst thing they could have done to the character.  The whole reason he was so great was that he was a voice of reason within a organisation of evil geniuses.  You can also tell  that actor Seth Green, is uncomfortable in a role he used to relish, especially at the very end of the movie.Aside from this one gripe though, Austin Powers in Goldmember is a thoroughly entertaining spoof comedy, easily the best in the series and highly recomended to anyone who wants to be in stiches for an hour and a half.

You might find yourself constantly, and torturously, waiting at the end of the various scenes for the movie to catch up as the characters drone on about how lame and hopeless they are.  In that sense, this is probably theee most non-NY NY movie I have ever seen.  I guess that was the point.  Maybe if you like silent movies, you can just turn the repetitious dialogue down and get some enjoyment out of 50s NY.  Yes Ernest Borgnine's character is believable (painfully so) but my sympathy for him was over after about 15 min. and then I just wanted to strangle him and\/or the writer.  For me the high point of the movie was in the first scene where a lady customer comes up to the main character (Marty) and says `Whats'a matter with you?  My boy Frank was 19 years old when he got married.  Whats'a matter with you?'  It was the only funny line in the movie.  Marty just smiled and took it, which is what you might have to do to finish this movie.  I totally missed the point of this movie.  Good luck.The characters are like poor little birds with broken wings  Poor little birds.

The film concerns an alien life force that has taken possession of a fossilized man-ape, and then thaws out while en route to Moscow on the Trans-Siberian Express. Hammer superstars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are on board for the wild ride, and theirs are always a welcome presence. This movie really is pretty well done, with an interesting story, good acting, decent production values, some so-so special effects, and some good shocks and surprises. I was a little disappointed at first when HERE COME THE SPOILERS the fossilized man-ape critter got killed so early on, but then the alien life force started to jump around, from the man-ape to the Russian police inspector to the mad monk, and that kept things interesting. (I'm still a little unclear as to just WHY the monk, who was so direly warning of the danger of the beast in the film's beginning, decided to go over to the dark side so suddenly, after watching one of its murders. Perhaps someone can explain that part to me...) Telly Savalas is just a weeee bit over the top as the Cossack inspector, but it's all in good fun. The scene in which Peter Cushing trepans the baggageman's skull to examine his smoothed-out brain (did I mention that the alien life force can suck the thoughts and memories out of its victims' eyeballs, leaving those orbs whitened and bloodied?) was a nice touch. Just the right amount of grisly fun, without being too much of a grossout. Besides the cool trepanning, we are also treated to multiple murders, two (2!) hot-looking redheads, and--shades of Night of the Living Dead--reanimated, bloody-eyed zombies running amok at the end. All topped off by a nice train crash and multiple explosions! Lee and Cushing are their usual suave selves. The movie is an excellent minor affair that makes one wonder why filmmakers can't carry off such feats today with all the tools at their disposal. The film has atmosphere and creepy charm, and that's something that I suppose all the $$$ can't buy. Horror talents such as Cushing and Lee only come along rarely; who do we have today to take their place? No one. It occurs to me that there are NO great horror actors today to speak of, for the first time, practically, since moving pictures began! Am I right? Who can you think of that is on a par today with Lon Chaney, Lionel Atwill, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Evelyn Ankers, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Hazel Court, Vincent Price, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Steele and so on? We've got NOTHING to compare! Perhaps that's one of the reasons why even a relatively minor entry such as Horror Express seems so good. The two leads are as charismatic as can be, and carry their horror history into whatever picture they decide to grace. Can you imagine this picture being made today with Brad Pitt and Mark Damon?

In the process of flying stealthily below radar, the copilot\/thief (Meredith) strikes an oil drilling platform and loses control of the airplane.  After a brief struggle to stay aloft, the jetliner settles onto the surface of the water, but not before a massive storage container tears loose and punches a fatal hole in the forward cargo compartment.And therein lies the solution to the first problem.  Like the customization of a conversion van from the same era, this private jet has been modified to contain a series of individually pressurized cargo holds.  When the forward cargo compartment floods, the rest of the plane is left dry.  Within minutes, however, the weight of the water pulls the plane to the floor of the ocean, with most of the passengers still alive and plenty of doors and windows leaking ominously.Airport '77 starts with heavy-handed drama and never lets up.  There's not much room for humor in a 747 several hundred feet under the water, but Airport '77 doesn't even attempt to lighten the mood occasionally. Better disaster movies pull the audience from one emotional extreme to another, but on this plane, the dialogue is suffocating even before the oxygen starts to run low.  There isn't anyone in charge of bringing hope to the survivors (and the audience).And despite their occasional humanitarian efforts, this group of super-rich, mostly white passengers does little to elicit sympathy from the audience. Only the head flight attendant (Vaccaro) invites compassion.  Her romance with the pilot (a mustache-laden Lemmon) isn't adequately explored, particularly when he volunteers to leave the plane in a risky maneuver that might easily kill him.  Meanwhile, virtually the entire support staff of the plane magically disappears so that the drama can focus on the wealthiest and presumably most interesting group aboard.The tone of this film is gloomy right from the start, and bad cinematography doesn't help.

All of the external effects are clear, and the flooding inside the plane is done as well as can be expected.  Aside from the abundance of dark brown furniture (and carpet, and paint, and wallpaper) it's the relentlessly dim lighting that clinches the claustrophobia. Though possibly necessitated by the depth of the plane underwater, the resultant sense of suffocation only disengages the viewer further.  The cheap special effects of The Concorde Airport '79 indicate that the lesson was learned that good effects won't save a mediocre film.In short, Airport '77 just isn't fun enough.
