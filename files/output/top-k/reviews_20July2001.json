New dino each movie (all new the first, stegos & pachys the second, Spinosaurus & ankylos the third) 4.

Funny moments - the stuffed dinos, the godzilla theme, the satellite phone 7.  Exploiters vs. Preservers (although in the third movie the debate is toned down to touching vs. watching)Needless to say, there are more.The dinos are great, although the hyped fight of Spinosaur vs. T-Rex was too short.  But there are problems.1.  When the plane falls to the ground, it looks like it's a lot further than 16 feet (the height of the spinosaur)2.  In the water, the spino is standing up with what appears to be only its feet in the water (at the crane), but the dino was just seen swimming toward the boat, which can't be in water much deeper than the crane!  While the homage to Jaws is nice, could it be a little more realistic?  The difference in water depth is too exaggerated in too small a distance, to my understanding.3.  If the raptors are so intelligent in this movie (talking to each other, communicating, etc., basically acting like primitive humans) then why did the female in the first kill all but two of the others?  Bad PMS day? Cowing others into submission would be a better way than killing them, doncha think?4.  How did Kirby know Billy's name?  I was expecting a well, I met this guy earlier scene (probably on the cutting floor) where Billy explained to Grant who Kirby was.  Nope.5.  The T-Rex didn't have to chase the humans too far to run into the Spino's territory (unless the Spino just looks to kill T-Rexs (hinted at here, but that DOES NOT fit the Spino's characteristics as understood today)) so any notion of territoriality of predators is kinda quashed.Three were good points though.1.  The raptors. 2.  The ankylos (one of my fave dinos). 3.  The sat phone. 4.  The aerie (from the original story, good use of a lost piece). 5.

No John Hammond (also should've died in the first movie, again thank Spielberg). 8.

I'm not a big fan of hers in the first place, except for her cute role in Fly Away Home, but I didn't see any magic onscreen while I was watching this movie. I really don't tap into the chemistry between Logan and Marie. All I see is a brother\/sister type relationship- nothing more. While she is a very human, very sweet girl, I don't think we deserved to see that much of her in the movie.Famke Janssen- WOW. Loved her. She's such a controlled actress, it's scary. You don't see much of her in the movie (to which I'm very mad about), but the scenes you do see emit such a poised, passionate, heroic, yet restrained woman who has a lot of back history I hope we explore in the sequel. Famke is a gorgeous actress, and is very direct and very honest. I wish they gave her more screentime.

This is one of the most interesting storylines in the movie, and I'm eager to see how Rogue gets thrown into the mix, if she does at all (I'm thinking she might). Personally, I love the Logan\/Jean Grey pair. I know that the storyline will probably turn out to be Scott\/Jean, but I'm very content and proud of my couple shipper fetish.

I don't like him much as Scott (look to the love triangle diatribe), but he did play a good part as Cyclops. I loved the throw of words he shared with Logan (Stay away from my girl). He's a great actor, and very handsome too. But I do have a slight hostility toward his character (getting in the way of my Logan\/Jean, lol).Patrick Stewart, exceptional!

Sequels are usually attempts at making more money and satisfying the publics craving for more carnage, wile some films like Aliens escaped such fates, Jurassic Park III will die a worse death then most sequels. The characters are a hopeless crew of stereotypes and hallow personalities that are doomed to die or barley survive. I was eager when i heard Jurassic Park II was going to be better then The Lost World and that the character of Dr. Alann Grant would be revived (some missed Malcolm to some extent, I agree - Malcolm would have given the movie a slim chance). What appalled me more then the series of questionable discrepancies was that Dr Alan Grant's character degraded form a brilliant scientist to a lost soul whose bested by a pree-teen multiple times. I was amazed at the life-like Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) displayed in the first and second movies. I was stunned when the spinasaurus acted more like a stiff robot at points, as well as the T-rex, I then saw the poor CGI quality in all but the raptors (who were the only redeemer of the movie). For only the misely 90 minutes length, the satellite phone stunt,Spinasaurus skat incident, the baby Petrandon attack, the seeming understanding between the survivors and the raptors, combined with the insulting marine arrival at the end, coupled with the Pteranadon escape led to a cataclysmic disappointment.

It was definitely a worthy effort, but it came up short in many areas. The first is suspense. SPOILERS TO COME....... The audience has little time to build a fear of the unknown on the island. The spinosaurus was quick to attack. Definitely too soon. It seemed like one attack came right after another by each of the species. C'mon.....!! I didn't find myself gripping the seat, fearful for the characters. Right after the spinosaurus chase, 20 seconds later, they're face to face with the T-REX(his only cameo) The fight between the two was decent. The first movie had more build-up to the action. My biggest complaint for JP3 is no climactic ending. No final showdown. The raptors circle them, exchange glances (and eggs), but that's it. Then the characters are saved. Where's the suspense? The acting could have been better. One thing about these movies....yes the people scream, but they just don't act like a regular human would confronted with a dino that was about to take their life. A little too casual. I wouldn't dare walk through the jungle not knowing what was watching me. But then you wouldn't have a movie....but they should still act more terrified. Dr. Grant's reaction to the Kirbys' deceit was not very convincing. He was hardly ticked for more than a minute. Think about it....he's faced these creatures before...one would think he would be scared as hell considering what he went through last time. I thought he was going to hit Macy (I didn't care for William H. Macy or Tea Leoni in this movie.....these roles should belong to more unknown actors.) The plot seemed to resemble the second.....a rescue. Nothing more. Lost World and JP3 both had stranded people venturing through the jungle to safety. The first movie had a great plot. Lots of substance. The second two movies use a little plot just to get the characters out to island for a game of cat & mouse. The special effects were excellent. I don't know how they do it so well with computers and real footage, but it all looks real. The pteranadon sequence was a fresh look for JP, something new beyond the raptors and T-REX (but they are still great). I enjoyed the new situations the characters encountered, like the boat river attack and the pteranadons. Lots of action, but sometimes a little too much. I think the first movie was the best, because it was the first. My theory on sequels is that when we first see a new idea onscreen( in this case,realistic dinos in a park) movie goers love it. The second time, when the sequel is viewed, we think Been there, done that We want the same substance in a new idea, but not too far-fetched (Like T-REX in San Diego) It takes a supergenius to make a sequel better. I believe if JP3 had been the first of the series, we wouldn't like Jurassic Park so well cause we would find it boring. Another example.... Everyone loves Star Wars and always will. I think of all movies in the trilogy, it is the worst. Cause it's not the one I saw first ( I can't decide if I like Empire or Return better). Even though it has good characters and story, I believe if Phantom Menace was the first movie ever released with the star wars subject and theme and with its awesome special effects and action, and then Star Wars came out after it, people would say Whoa..who made this awful thing. Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon and Obi Wan saber scene was a LOT more entertaining than Alec Guiness standing there poking a stick at Vader. I'm not saying I like Phantom Menace better, I'm saying that's the way it is for sequels.  One of my regrets about Phantom was its lack of Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, etc.....but that's obviously because its set in the past......and for a star wars movie to be star warsy, it has to have those characters, because that's who we grew on. It just wasn't the same without those characters, but what can you do? That's why I hope Episode 3 has Darth Vader, TIE Fighters, stormtroopers, X-Wings...some of the old star wars stuff. Anyway Back to JP3. I have a few minor flaws that I can't get over. First, if the air space over the island is restricted, how on earth did they get a boat out there in the beginning for parasailing? Hard to believe they didn't get caught after leaving Costa Rica or wherever. I doubt they had permission. Second gripe, how did the kid survive for 8 weeks on the island.......very unbelieveable. A KID!!!! I don't see it happening, with the dinos and all. Even though he had the truck and the compound as refuge, those two places weren't dino proof. He would have been dead in two days. Third complaint, the island looked large, and their chances of finding the kid in that amount of time were skeptical. Grant wasn't even thrilled to have found him. Finally, the cell phone in the spinosaurus? They wouldn't hear it, especially from that far away. No way. All in all, the movie was well shot, exciting (not suspenseful) at times, great special effects, and some humor. My only regret about the series is that in the story, the rest of the world knows about the dinosaurs' existence.

The first film could still work at 2 hours because it was a concept few of the audience would be familiar with, so it needed to establish itself.  2. Where the hell was Sam Neill?  3. Isn't this just King Kong? It seemed to try too hard to be original, and somehow ended up being completely UNoriginal.  4. It went WAY overboard at the end, as Spielberg has a strange tendancy to do.  Luckily this habit was not used in the first film.I was worried that JP3 would have the same problems.  I am glad to say that it does not.  It cuts it down to 92 minutes, Sam Niell IS in it and it doesn't TRY to be original, it knows it cannot put forward any good, new ideas.In a way, I am glad Spielberg did not direct, as he may have done what he did with JP2.

It reminded me that sometimes with films, you just have to sit back, stop analysing it and enjoy what you see (something the young kids in front of me were obviously doing, as they walked out the cinema declaring it was probably the best film they had ever seen).  Sam Niell is still great, and William H Macy is in fine form, as per usual.  And the bit with the pterodactyl.  That hadn't been done before, so it was nice to see something original.  The way it emerges from the mist was actually quite SCARY.Plus, the effects are great.  The dinosaurs actually ARE real.  I think. And they roar.  Very loudly.  See this film with no high expectations, and enjoy it.  And stop analysing it, for god sake.3 stars (out of 5).PS.

A lot. It was one of Spielberg's worst movies, and here's why 1. It was stretched it out to 2 hours.  The first film could still work at 2 hours because it was a concept few of the audience would be familiar with, so it needed to establish itself.  2. Where the hell was Sam Neill?  3. Isn't this just King Kong? It seemed to try too hard to be original, and somehow ended up being completely UNoriginal.  4. It went WAY overboard at the end, as Spielberg has a strange tendancy to do.  Luckily this habit was not used in the first film.I was worried that JP3 would have the same problems.  I am glad to say that it does not.  It cuts it down to 92 minutes, Sam Niell IS in it and it doesn't TRY to be original, it knows it cannot put forward any good, new ideas.In a way, I am glad Spielberg did not direct, as he may have done what he did with JP2.  So the addition of Joe Johnston was a welcome change.The story People on island.  Dinosaurs on island.  Dinosaurs chase people and roar.  Very loudly.  Hey haven't we heard this before?

Had they been FAKE quotation marks, had Jake been quoting some non-existent movie, all might have been well.  Had there been NO quotation marks, all might have been well.  (It's not Scorsese's fault if the most fitting words Jake could possibly utter turn out to have already been used back in 1954; if the words fit seamlessly into his movie just as well as into the earlier one, he should simply steal them, and leave the attribution of credit for the fine print at the end.)  The trouble is that when it comes time for a moment of truth Raging Bull is unable to speak for itself.  Its reach exceeds its grasp - it's as simple as that.There are things IMPRESSIVE about the film, like the brilliantly edited fight sequences, and De Niro's performance.  The extended scene in which Jake suspects his wife of having sex with his brother is electrifying.  But in context these aren't enough to sustain us.

It's not plagiarism Jake is quoting, and we know he's meant to be quoting, from a movie he's seen, but that's the problem - those quotation marks.  Had they been FAKE quotation marks, had Jake been quoting some non-existent movie, all might have been well.  Had there been NO quotation marks, all might have been well.  (It's not Scorsese's fault if the most fitting words Jake could possibly utter turn out to have already been used back in 1954; if the words fit seamlessly into his movie just as well as into the earlier one, he should simply steal them, and leave the attribution of credit for the fine print at the end.)  The trouble is that when it comes time for a moment of truth Raging Bull is unable to speak for itself.  Its reach exceeds its grasp - it's as simple as that.There are things IMPRESSIVE about the film, like the brilliantly edited fight sequences, and De Niro's performance.  The extended scene in which Jake suspects his wife of having sex with his brother is electrifying.  But in context these aren't enough to sustain us.  The fight sequences are interludes over quickly, the outcome obvious from the first second, they're one-sentence summaries of the true dramatic action, which take place outside the ring.  As they should be; but this means that they can't carry the film on their own however brilliant they may be (and they ARE brilliant).  And DeNiro's performance needs something solid to spark off, which neither the story nor the other characters provides.Another problem it isn't really a black and white film.  It's TINTED monochrome.  (I can think of only one instance of Technicolor monochrome actually working the afterlife sequences in A Matter of Life and Death.  There was no tinting.  I think there's a good reason why tinted monochrome vanished off the face of the Earth in the late 1920s, while films were still being ROUTINELY made in black and white in the 1960s.)  The title was in red, and some home movie sequences were in faded colour.  This half-hearted use of colour just looked weak.  Make up your mind colour, black and white, or (if you're certain you know what you're doing) a combination of both.  Not, for God's sake, a BLEND.I was let down when Raging Bull turned out to be no more than an above average Scorsese potboiler, with some outstanding elements.  I really wanted it to be the great film so many people say it is.  A cinematic hero of mine, Michael Powell, greatly admired it, and to some degree inspired it.  I wish it were worthy of him.

To many, it is simply a film about four friends trying to get laid before they graduate high school and go on to bigger and better things (well, maybe, let's see the sequel).  But I believe that the writers and the concievers had something else in mind.  If they wanted to do another sex comedy, they could have done a remake of Losin' It or Porky's or something else from the '80s.  Instead, they found a way to incorporate those entertaining tactics into a film with a finely developed coming-of-age message.  The sex part is really just to keep the viewer watching. I'm pretty sure that I'm right because 90% of the people I have talked to that are part of a face-value generation have said that there's something there and that it has a message.  American Pie could be called an organized sex comedy.  But I think it's an organized drama.  The ending was a fine one--something that I could relate to as I am saying goodbye to my friends in High School and heading onto bigger and better things.  Yep, I guess I'm starting the second film of my life, and maybe we all will understand the message of American Pie when we finish it.  Anyway, highly recommended.

I wasn't too keen on the second one though. It was really good, just not as good as the first one. Anyway, the third installment of Jurassic Park is great. You have all your usual excitement and of course the great special effects. If you enjoyed the first two, or even if you didn't, I'm sure you will enjoy this one. Let's hope they'll make a fourth one soon. I give this film an 8\/10.
