[{"date":"17 July 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Under the direction of Joel Schumacher this is a powerful insight into the extreme actions sometimes used in the porn industry and the illegal snuff movie legends.  Nicholas Cage plays the private detective and family man who gets caught up in trying to find out the source of an 8mm film found by an old woman after her husband's death.   After feeling the effects of the horror that has just faced him whilst watching it, he takes on the quest to find out the awful truth.  His journey through Cleveland and New York to undercover the awful truth brings him face to face with the mother of the victim played powerfully and emotionally by Jenny Powell and he struggles to confront the pain and the anguish involved.      He hooks up with a sleazy musician who works in a sex shop  (Joaquin Phoenix) and relies on his inside knowledge to guide him to the people involved in the industry.  His naivete on these issues is apparent but he is very rapidly educated as he moves through the scenes going deeper and deeper into the mire.  There are several Phoenix quotes that are powerful in their exchanges but the one that remains is `There's things that you see but you cannot see, and they get in your head and they stay there.' and that is such a fact of life.    James Gandolfini is the scumbag who exploits girls who want to be in movies and abuses them for his own financial and sick gain.  He's teamed up with `Double Velvet' and together they are the lowest of the low, neither showing any conscience or remorse about their actions.  Their association  with a masked abuser who appears in the films is something they are proud of, to the disgust of those who come into contact with them. I found the performances very powerful in a film that doesn't revolve so much around the seediness of what goes on in this scene, but more the depraved personalities of the people involved.  The dark and sinister atmosphere coupled with a very intriguing Indian musical score adds much to the tension..   The film is essentially a crime drama\/thriller and I think the way that it has been depicted was an effort to give the story an original slant and one that would be talked about.  Yes it could be said that it is a way to expose what is deemed by many to be totally unacceptable, ie S&M, but in the end there is a far more simple moral to the tale and that is a crime is there to be paid for one way or another.

Once you accept that the main idea is stupid, you can appreciate that each individual scene is well-written in terms of character development. Everyone is slightly more ambiguous than their stock character usually would be. The mad doctor is sincerely concerned with the insipid heroine who reminds him of his daughter, and his madness is a kind of beautiful tragedy. The good boyfriend says he doesn't want her hurt, but he also seems jealous of the doctor and resentful that the heroine won't be so dependent on him. There's real tension in their triangle. The hick sheriff is almost sharp enough to figure things out. The town blowhard gets several scenes showing what a well-chiseled wretch he is, especially the scene with his pathetic wife. The small-towners are all various little unflattering types--lazy, suspicious, gossipy, narrow-minded--not exactly an ad for rural life. Karloff's maid seems mute except when she suddenly whispers one word. There's a city doctor who comes on as an antagonist, then gets converted into an ally by Karloff's evidence, and disappears from the movie! There's the wise caretaker, introduced in a surprising pan shot that begins with a black circus worker playing a trumpet for a dancing elephant and ending with the ape being provoked by the rotten trainer. The very ending, too, has a certain power if you meet the movie halfway. The trouble is, just as you're pulled into the simplicity and effectiveness of all these human scenes, along comes another scene with that apesuit to pull the rug out from under the movie's credibility. The ape is the worst thing about THE APE!

Namely, i'll be pointing out the errors made with the bats (mind you i've been watching now and then as this movie plays, it's not worth my attention). First off, since when can a single bat overpower a full grown man? One bat flings himself at one nonetheless, and instead of grabbing the bat and crushing it under his boot, he decides to bounce around the cafe knocking over everything that's loose. Second, bats are blind any way you look at it, yet these critters seem to have some red vision - and woe the man who views it, for this is not all. The third point is the fact that when shot at, lots of sparks shoot off the bat, power rangers style, apparently these mutated bats are made of flintstone. The fourth point (and i'm sure there are more, but in total i've watched this movie for six minutes) is that apparently, bat crap gives off toxic levels of ammonia gas, so naturally the people who enter the lair wear space suits with added padded armor.I'd say this sums up some of the ludicrous material in this movie, and you get the point - bad, bad, bad movie.
