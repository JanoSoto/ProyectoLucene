EAST OF EDEN is the only one I hadn't seen and the second of the three to be shown on Reel 13. I was particularly curious about EAST OF EDEN because it paired Dean with one of his Actors' Studio mentors &#150; director Elia Kazan. Kazan introduced the more naturalistic method acting style to Hollywood with films like A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and ON THE WATERFRONT. The impact of the collaboration is most apparent in that Dean, for the only time in his brief career, seems to be surrounded by actors with a similar background and training. In the review of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, I noted how it often seemed that Dean was acting in his own movie, but here, he is amongst peers in Julie Harris, Burl Ives, Lois Smith and Jo Van Fleet, who won an Oscar for her supporting performance (I am usually against giving Oscars to people for less than ten minutes of screen time, but I might have to make an exception here &#150; she was brilliant).Oddly enough, with all the familiar and talented thespians around him, Dean's presence is less effective than it was in his other work. Don't get me wrong &#150; he displays several moments of greatness (great body language throughout, outstanding choices in the Ferris wheel scene), but as blasphemous as it might be to say, there were a few moments where I felt he went too far. He is constantly whining to such an extreme degree, that it diffuses the moments that really call for it. Now, this isn't overacting in the traditional sense. As a matter of fact, I feel similarly about this performance as I did about the recent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis in THERE WILL BE BLOOD. It's more scenery chewing than overacting. Both actors are believable when they hit those extreme emotions, but I wonder if the choice to go that far is always appropriate. While it's impressive that they can get there, they might be actually be harming the overall narrative. The more often they cry or scream, the less impact it will have as the film goes on. This is problematic because, more often than not, the end of a film requires the broader emotions more than the beginning. For example, there is a scene toward the end of EAST OF EDEN where Dean's character presents his father with a gift that he worked his ass off for, but the righteous father manages to find the negativity in it. Dean cries and convulses in full breakdown mode, almost as if he didn't have control of his motor skills. This had the potential to be very powerful &#150; if we hadn't seen it four times earlier. To be fair, this was Dean's first film and he clearly went on to refine his craft in his next efforts.Elia Kazan also seemed a little off his game. This film, which was possibly his most ambitious in terms of scope and budget seems more like an experiment to him than anything else. I got the sense that he was almost playing with ideas and concepts. He employs these very interesting Dutch angles throughout, but very often, they don't seem to be motivated. There is an early Q&A scene between Dean and Raymond Massey. As the scene goes on, the angle becomes more off-axis, but the scene occurs too early to utilize a technique that extreme. (There is a scene later on the film when Dean is on a swing where Kazan justifies the awkward angle by using the forward movement of the swing to essentially push the camera off-axis. This works much better). Other experiments were more successful. First, this might have been the first time he shot in color and the results are astounding. The cinematography is beautiful and the colors are extraordinarily rich. Second, he is a master of staging and not in the theatrical sense. This is very much blocking for the camera frame. The best example is the scene that takes place immediately after the scene where Dean presents the gift. Dean pouts in the backyard under a huge tree. Its leaves hang so low that they obscure the entire top half of Dean. Julie Harris runs under the tree to console him so she is also hidden. (This idea of obscuring characters\/moments from the camera occurs often in the Kazan oeuvre). From their legs and torso, you can tell they stand close, but is he crying on her shoulder? Are they making out? Then, Dean's brother comes out and orders Harris (his girlfriend) out from the tree. She runs out and into the foreground. The brother is in the middleground with his back to the camera and Dean is in the background, still obscured by the tree. The brother then begins to admonish Dean's character, but it's Harris' face we see &#150; as if the brother could be referring to either one of them. It's a beautiful, simple and truly cinematic framing idea that manages to convey a multitude of ideas with one swift stroke.As you may have interpreted, I have mixed feelings about EAST OF EDEN. While the artistic achievements of the film are exciting, the film ultimately fails to pack an emotional punch, possibly because the narrative is mired in the complexities and the allegories of the Steinbeck novel it's based on. Familial relations, foreign politics, xenophobia, profiteering, infidelity, class distinctions, the nature of evil and of course, the albatross hanging over the whole thing &#150; Biblical allegory &#150; are all covered within the 110 minutes of EAST OF EDEN. While I think it's great that Kazan tried to layer the film with all that meaning, I wonder if he didn't push it too far. With all those deep issues crammed into one package, it's hard to care about any of them.

The story also provides him a sort-of-girlfriend (Mary Kate Schellhardt) with a deep concern for the environment (Couldn't this movie ever be more nature-friendly?) and even a little brother named Elvis (Francis Capra), who is just so... annoying.

The photography is adequate, capturing on film a lively shot of its environments and, of course the whales.

A group of travellers, mostly English, have gathered in a hotel in the fictional European state of Bandrika (for which read Germany). A young heiress, Iris Henderson, is preparing (not very enthusiastically) to return to England for her marriage to an aristocrat. A young Cambridge musicologist, Gilbert, who is making a study of Bandrikan folk-music, antagonises his fellow-guests by persuading a group of local peasants to perform a folk-dance, very noisily, in his hotel room. Eric, a barrister, has gone on holiday with his mistress in order to further their adulterous liaison. Two cricket-mad English gentlemen are anxious to get back to Manchester for the test match.Some of Hitchcock's other films have a comic opening, such as Rebecca in which Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier try to outwit her overbearing, bullying employer. The mood of that film, however, quickly becomes darker and more serious. In The Lady Vanishes, however, the mood remains relatively light even when Hitchcock introduces the suspense elements. On the train journey back to England, Iris makes the acquaintance of an elderly governess named Miss Froy. (May Witty was 73 at the time the film was made, but I suspect that Miss Froy is supposed to be rather younger- she mentions that both her parents are both alive, something that would be remarkable in the case of a 73-year-old). Iris falls asleep and when she wakes she finds that Miss Froy has disappeared. Stranger still, none of the other passengers can remember ever having seen her. To make things worse, an eminent doctor suggests that Miss Froy never actually existed and that Iris is suffering from delusions. Iris realises that something suspicious is going on, and joins forces with Gilbert to investigate. They discover that Miss Froy is actually a spy working for the British government and that she is in possession of secret information, information which the Bandrikan authorities are determined to prevent her from getting back to Britain.For much of its length the film remains a comedy-thriller. Like most romantic comedy couples, Iris and Gilbert fall in love after an initial period of mutual dislike. Charters and Caldicott continue their discussions about cricket, oblivious to the drama unfolding around them. Only at one point does the tone darken. Towards the end there is a confrontation between the Bandrikan police and some of the passengers. Eric, the adulterous barrister, takes the seemingly sensible position that to engage in a shootout with the police would be suicidal and prefers the path of compromise. He steps outside the train to negotiate- and is promptly shot dead for his pains. This may have been Hitchcock's comment on Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. (The film opened a few weeks after the Munich conference).The film has some similarities with Hitchcock's earlier espionage thriller, The 39 Steps, which also blended comedy with suspense and romance. (The closest equivalent in Hitchcock's later work would be North by Northwest). One difference between the two films, however, would be their setting. The 39 Steps has an open, outdoor feel; much of the action takes place on the wide-open Scottish moorlands. The Lady Vanishes, apart from the hotel scenes, is set in the enclosed, claustrophobic setting of the train.

Here, however, it is Iris who is the main character and Gilbert her companion. Both Lockwood and Michael Redgrave, in his first major screen role, are excellent.Hitchcock was often hampered by financial constraints during his British period, and The Lady Vanishes does not contain any of the great directorial set-pieces that would later become his hallmark.

A group of travellers, mostly English, have gathered in a hotel in the fictional European state of Bandrika (for which read Germany). A young heiress, Iris Henderson, is preparing (not very enthusiastically) to return to England for her marriage to an aristocrat. A young Cambridge musicologist, Gilbert, who is making a study of Bandrikan folk-music, antagonises his fellow-guests by persuading a group of local peasants to perform a folk-dance, very noisily, in his hotel room. Eric, a barrister, has gone on holiday with his mistress in order to further their adulterous liaison. Two cricket-mad English gentlemen are anxious to get back to Manchester for the test match.Some of Hitchcock's other films have a comic opening, such as Rebecca in which Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier try to outwit her overbearing, bullying employer. The mood of that film, however, quickly becomes darker and more serious. In The Lady Vanishes, however, the mood remains relatively light even when Hitchcock introduces the suspense elements. On the train journey back to England, Iris makes the acquaintance of an elderly governess named Miss Froy. (May Witty was 73 at the time the film was made, but I suspect that Miss Froy is supposed to be rather younger- she mentions that both her parents are both alive, something that would be remarkable in the case of a 73-year-old). Iris falls asleep and when she wakes she finds that Miss Froy has disappeared. Stranger still, none of the other passengers can remember ever having seen her. To make things worse, an eminent doctor suggests that Miss Froy never actually existed and that Iris is suffering from delusions. Iris realises that something suspicious is going on, and joins forces with Gilbert to investigate. They discover that Miss Froy is actually a spy working for the British government and that she is in possession of secret information, information which the Bandrikan authorities are determined to prevent her from getting back to Britain.For much of its length the film remains a comedy-thriller. Like most romantic comedy couples, Iris and Gilbert fall in love after an initial period of mutual dislike. Charters and Caldicott continue their discussions about cricket, oblivious to the drama unfolding around them. Only at one point does the tone darken. Towards the end there is a confrontation between the Bandrikan police and some of the passengers. Eric, the adulterous barrister, takes the seemingly sensible position that to engage in a shootout with the police would be suicidal and prefers the path of compromise. He steps outside the train to negotiate- and is promptly shot dead for his pains. This may have been Hitchcock's comment on Chamberlain's policy of appeasement. (The film opened a few weeks after the Munich conference).The film has some similarities with Hitchcock's earlier espionage thriller, The 39 Steps, which also blended comedy with suspense and romance. (The closest equivalent in Hitchcock's later work would be North by Northwest). One difference between the two films, however, would be their setting.

Let me explain.First off, this film gives an amazing amount of statistics, whether they be true or false, that support racism as a system, especially when regarding the black community. This would be acceptable if there was something to in fact balance this racism out. However, there is not. All the viewer is given is a bowl 5h!t story of how Derik is saved by a black man in jail. This is completely circumstantial, and leaves nothing but an unlikely story for the viewer, in addition to cold hard facts that support bigotry. I find this extremely offensive, in that there are dozens of reasons why racism is wrong, but how many reasons (facts) are given in the movie? None. Every slight attempt to oppose racism through debate is shot down, aside from Sweeny's questioning which is again circumstantial (has being a skinhead helped Derrrikk). Finally, the ending of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of being rewarded for change, Norton is given a deceased brother. Are we to believe that this does not rekindle racist thought for Derik? It takes years to erase bigotry, but only one incident to rekindle it. Though some may doubt this assumption, I have hard evidence to prove my point. One of the proposed endings of the film was supposed to replace Danny's conclusion speech, with further plot. The final scene takes place back at the Vinyard's. In this shot, Derik is pictured with a towel over his head, starring at his swastika in the mirror. After cutting to a shot of hair inside of his sink, the camera returns to Derik, where he removes the towel and reveals the unthinkable. He is now a skinhead again. And why shouldn't he be? Death of a family member is what sparked up this train of thought, and why should this fail to continue. After all, violence is portrayed as a vicious circle in this film anyways. One final thing that may sway your opinion as to how American History X is in fact racist, not Liberating, is the quarrel behind the scenes; between Kaye and Norton. You can look this up yourself, but just keep in mind, i did not come to this conclusion out of nowhere. AHX is fricking racist, despite the intentions of many involved with it. Norton's charisma, coupled with the plot itself exploit this, and I hope some of you can get your head out of your azzes and try to think past the surface.

When I read about it in Down and Dirty Pictures I expected it to be a tasteless assault upon the Christian religion, but to my surprise it wasn't, and not only was it not tasteless it turned out to be a pretty good film. I felt like it treated its subject matter fairly delicately given that it was an independent film and it was a Miramax production. I thought that this was an excellent movie about a priest who is doubting his own profession and the fact that God was even real. Honestly I thought that his relationship with the girl who was being molested by her father was more interesting than the fact that he was gay. At first I even thought that him being gay was overkill and the movie would have been better if it were just about his relationship to the girl, but by the time the ending rolled around I realized that it was necessary for him to be gay for this movie to work. If it were not for that touching scene in which she is the only person to receive the sacraments from him I would say that his being gay was totally inconsequential to the movie. But those very few moments absolutely make this movie. But now that I have discussed the gay factor I would like to concentrate on some of the movie's other strong points. This film was truly hilarious. The gay priest's relationship with his fellow straight priest was another high point in the film. Their conversations about, What does God care about what a man does with his dick? Were particularly funny and the scene in which the older man they are staying with chaperones them is just hysterical. There are two other scenes that stick out in my mind about this movie. The first being when the molesting father is in the confessional and you only get to see his face, that man was simply terrifying. He seemed to be so evil in that one scene, he really nailed the part. The second scene that I thought was particularly powerful was when the gay priest was praying and telling Jesus that he had it so easy because He knew everything and basically yelling at God for being God&#151;if that makes any sense&#151;God was answering his prayer by exposing the girl's father as a molester. Overall Priest is a superb movie and it is rather unfortunate that some people will avoid this film simply because of its premise.

There simply would be no movie without him, or, well, it might, but it would've been boring as hell.

In fact, it has always been my absolute favorite horror movie, though recently several other films have vied for that top position in my mind. It is, for me, the archetype of the slasher film and one of a few archetypes for general horror. (And yes, I know that Black Christmas (1974, Bob Clark) came out before and has a lot of similarities to Halloween-enough, that many would claim Carpenter plagiarized Black Christmas. I don't want to get into that argument here, but to me it really doesn't matter. Both are great films). Like some other classics, I have a certain nostalgia for Halloween-it is the first horror film that I remember seeing, so I am sure that impacts on my impression and thoughts of it. But it is a movie that spawned the resurgence of horror and the development of the slasher sub-genre in the 1980's and produced the iconic Michael Myers that even every child knows without having watched the movie.Halloween tells the stories of two main characters on Halloween night. Michael Myers, recently escaped from a mental institution after spending 15 years in it for the killing of his sister, has returned home to the town of Haddonfield, Illinois. And Laurie Strode is a babysitter, who happens to attract his attention to become his next victim (this first movie doesn't give clues as to why, though the story line develops later on). But in this simple plot, Carpenter succeeds in creating a masterpiece of progressively increasing suspense and dread.Carpenter shows The Shape in a subtly but steadily more menacing manner as the film progresses from a child to a man able to smash a car window with his hand to killing a dog bare-handed to taking physical punishment that should kill a person. The lack of any real motivation for his killing-he's just a middle class kid gone bad for no apparent reason-makes it more frightening for me. But Halloween doesn't just have a scary killer. There is a consistent mood and atmosphere of dread that builds through the use of lighting, a haunting musical score, jump scares (but not occurring exactly when you expect them to, making their appearance unexpected), and subtle appearances of The Shape.Performances by all the principal and secondary actors and actresses work for me. I have this haunting image of Annie's (Nancy Loomis) death scene and her facial expression as she falls against the car window. The detail and set up to create the perfect horrifying death scene at this point in the movie is incredible.And I really enjoy the script. With the exception of QUint's monologue in Jaws (1975, Steven Spielberg) about the USS Indianapolis, I don't think there is any other monologue that I enjoy more than Dr. Loomis' (played by an incredible Donald Pleasance) regarding the Devil's eyes in Halloween.An annual tradition in my home, Halloween never fails to please.

The great Vincent Price is back in his role of Francois Delambre, whose brother Andre Delambre (played by David Hedison) was turned into a Human Fly in the original film. Fifteen years are supposed to have passed since the events in the first film, and Andre Delambre's son Philippe (Brad Halsey) has become a dedicated scientist himself. In spite of his worried uncle's warnings, Philippe is determined to carry on his father's experiments. With objectionable results, of course... Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and even though the role of the reasonable, worried uncle may not be typical for the master of sinister and macabre characters, he is once again excellent in his role. Besides Price, none of the other actors from the original appears. The new actors also deliver good performances, however, especially David Frankham is good as an English gangster (as its predecessor, the film is set in Canada). Visually, Return Of The Fly is something rare, namely a black and white sequel to a film that was actually in color. It is not clear what reason they had to make the sequel in black and white, but it is save to assume that the budget was lower. The Film has a great plot, however, including a number of sub-plots. The settings from the first film were used again for this, which is a good thing, as far as I am considered. Overall, Return Of The Fly may not be quite as essential a film as its predecessor, but it is definitely more than worth a look for any lover of Sci-Fi and Horror in general, and for my fellow Vincent Price fans in particular. Highly recommended!

Think LASSIE as a harmless 3-ton marine mammal, specifically a 3-ton Killer Whale, and you got the concept of FREE WILLY. But don't let the predictable fluffy areas fool you! This is a surprisingly charming and oftentimes wonderful twist on the boy-and-his-dog plot line. It's sweet, a little predictable to be sure, but a noble and quite impressive movie of its kind. If your looking for a harmless, but entertaining, family diversion, I suggest to take a shot on FREE WILLY. If you don't find yourself assured, a rental might be fine.Perhaps one of the startling affair about FREE WILLY is that it doesn't solely concern the dog (the animal), but finds its time to for the boy as well. Instead of a movie heavily devoted on the save-the-animals aspect of the fable, FREE WILLY finds time to make the human dimension interesting and relevant. The boy of the story is Jessie (Jason James Richter), an orphaned boy forced to run amok the streets hang out with a bunch of trouble-makers. He picked the wrong place to mess with when he stumbles upon a too-small tank of a 3-ton Orca in captivity. Since he sprayed graffiti all over the walls, Jessie is sanctioned to clean the place up. He's also going to be assigned to his new adoptive parents (played by Michael Madsen and Jayne Atkinson). The moments where Jessie tries to adapt to his life under foster-parenthood isn't one of the film's best scenes, but granted, they're welcome addition to an otherwise predictable fare.Still, the moments between Jessie and the gigantic cetacean, as played by Sea World attraction Keiko as well as a believable animatronic double, is what basically FREE WILLY is all about. The moments between the boy and his whale are sweet and often tear-jerking on some occasions. Sure this thing has more Save the Whales slogan than any other film I've ever seen dealing with the same subject, but FREE WILLY does so with shamelessly but not dully. The movie doesn't make us go Yeah sure! Save the whales already!. It does its predictable and preachy elements with relevance. We care about these characters, and to what might happen to them.The movie isn't flawless of course. With slightly glacial-paced midsection and a number of schmaltzy substance, FREE WILLY isn't free from its faults. But for sweet, feather-weight family entertainment, FREE WILLY still holds water. Your kids might love it. You might love it too. Consider that the surprise bonus in this cheerful little tale.Rating **** out of 5.

Judy Davis puts in an entertaining performance as the eccentric and lovelorn George Sand, Emma Thompson amuses herself, and us, as the slightly mad Duchess D'Antan along with Anton Rodgers as her lovably gruff and occasionally outraged husband. Mandy Patinkin, Julian Sands and Anna Massey all turn up for work with a zesty delight, hamming it up like nobody's business.So far so very good. Everything rattles along charmingly, all and sundry delivering the amusingly droll script with great gusto and professionalism.And then just as we settle down for 90 minutes of above average entertainment, Hugh Grant turns up and sinks the entire ship with all hands.If I say that Hugh struggles manfully with an abysmal script, I would be lying. If I say that he presents us with a thoughtful portrayal of the tortured and sickly composer, rising to the challenge like the great actor he is (in some people's estimation), I would be guilty of gross misrepresentation. If I said that our highly regarded (at least by some people I know)and under talented leading man spends the entire movie looking like a terrified rabbit caught in the headlights of a speeding juggernaut, cowering with fear every time someone speaks to him and almost expiring with blind panic whenever George Sand is in the same room, my integrity and reputation as an honest man would be beyond doubt.I don't know who Hugh Grant based his performance on, or if he even took the trouble to research his character, but what he ends up showing us is a kind of consumptive, cowering, idiot who could no more compose, or indeed play, some of the most exquisitely ethereal and beautiful music known to man than I could eat the Eiffel Tower. I doubt whether this preposterous character could play a triangle without quivering in fear, let alone a piano.But never mind.The movie is actually an entertaining take on the famous love story, presented by a who's who of (mostly) British actors in a beautifully designed and photographed period piece to a soundtrack of heavenly music. And an unintentionally laughable piano player.Anyway, it's nice to see Hugh Grant in yet another comedy role.Any other actor would have portrayed Chopin as a sensitive, soulful and talented composer.
