But the most disturbing change is the personality of the hero as conceived by actor, director and writers. (Mann and Crowe credit the writers of the 1936 movie.) Cooper's Hawkeye is never arrogant. He is never condescending to frontier tenderfoots. He knows when he's right, and he's supremely confident; but he never needs to prove himself right; and he is never supercilious. In fact, he is scrupulously courteous. But even his name is altered for this movie. Is Daniel Day-Lewis too exalted for the homespun name of America's first superman, Natty Bumppo?

The point of these changes to Cooper's characters and plot escape me, and what this movie is about eludes me as well, unless it's about sex-ahead-of-its-time.

Taxi Driver is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance. This probably stands as De Niro's second best work to Raging Bull, and among the finest acting performances of all time. Travis Bickle is the self proclaimed, God's lonely man. Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war, and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, So long. As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war.

Bickle walks amongst the people on the filthy, crowded streets of New York City. Wherever he goes, he goes unnoticed; like a ghost meandering through life's morbid boredom of repetitiveness as each day endlessly runs into the next. Bickle suffers from an inability to sleep so he goes to the porno theaters after 12 hour shifts. His mind is constantly racing as he takes various forms of pills and abuses alcohol. The former Vietnam Veteran has a damaged psyche that continues to get worse and worse as the disgust for the lowlifes of New York eat away at his consciences. The first act of the films starts with a normal looking man, with a regular hair cut and regular job in an irregular city. We watch Bickle go through everyday routines and his work habit is the main focus to derive attention away from his bloodlust. We don't see much wrong with him other than some signs of frustration and restlessness. He decides that his body needs some fine tuning as he reverts back to his days as a Marine. He meets up with a gun dealer and buys three pistols and a .44 magnum. He's ready for war, and the table is set. The ending of the film is controversial for its vagueness and its inability to state a clear purpose of reality or fantasy. The film strongly suggests a dream-like state as we watch with a long running overhead shot (possibly signifying Bickle's departure from the world?) of the carnage left in Bickle's wake. Then there's the music of a dream inducing state at the end of the scene, which is the strongest hint towards a dream like state. What we do know is that Travis Bickle takes the lives of lowlifes, degenerates, and the scum of the earth. He's treated as the hero and glorified by the media for his actions. This is a slap in the face to the media for finding that a vigilante did the right thing because it was for a good cause Kill 5 scumbags, save 1. The final scene of the film is also controversial. We see Betsy for the first time since their big fight and she's no longer disgusted with Travis. Now the media has changed her opinion of him too. Travis has reverted back to the same look he spouted in the first act of the film. He's quiet, reserved and humble. He looks harmless. As the ride home goes along we find out that Palantine has won the nomination. After, Travis drops Betsy off, he leaves without taking her money and with a smile on his face he gives her a simple, So long. As Travis drives off, he menacingly looks back into the mirror, representing a problem still exists, then we fade back to the start of the film. With the symbolic scenes throughout the film depicting Bickle's brooding, boiling, rage within; symbolizing the fact that nothing has changed. The near death experience doesn't cure him. The accolades from the media and the recognition from everyday people doesn't make it any better. He's still ready for war.

Taxi Driver is one of Martin Scorsese' finest achievements as he teams up with Robert De Niro. Travis Bickle (De Niro) is the title character. The acting as a whole is exceptional. Harvey Keitel has an extremely small part as a pimp named Sport, and he brings a forgettable character to center stage. Keitel is so good in this you wish you would get to see more from his character. Jodie Foster plays the prostitute under Sports rule. Iris, is 12 years old, and for a 14 year old actress (at the time), Foster deals with some heavy and extremely adult material, and she handles it incredibly well. Keitel and Foster have a scene together where Sport holds her and slowly dances with her as he whispers into her ear about how lucky he is to have a woman like her. It's an utterly repulsive scene. The look on his face mixed with the calm and safe look on the face of Iris, is pretty disgusting. It's extremely well acted even though it's a pretty quick and minor scene. In this one scene we see the type of control Sport has over the young, impressionable child that he abuses and takes advantage of. These are the kinds of things that set Travis Bickle off. The film is a classic that dissects the fallout of one mans loneliness and his thirst for acceptance, recognition and notice. The editing is very good, the direction is great, but it's carried by a magnificent script from Paul Schrader and a great lead performance.

Wood, Jr.'s plea for tolerance against men who like to dress in women's clothing reminds us countless times that they aren't homosexuals but just transvestites. This is an extremely cooky little film that often times gets called one of the worst ever made but that's so far from the truth because movies that are among the worst ever made and never this entertaining. What makes this film so surreal is the fact that it comes off campy yet every single scene in the movie is trying to be so heartfelt and serious that the viewer just has to sit there and not believe what's going on in front of his eyes. You can tell that Wood was so serious in trying to get people to understand him and this is made even clearer by the director playing the role and Glen and Glenda. Wood's screenplay contains his usual off the wall dialogue, which while silly, is certainly entertaining. Wood always tries to be poetic with his dialogue and he manages to do so but at the same time this stuff is so out there that you can never take it too serious. Then, of course, you have Bela Lugosi playing some sort of scientist yet it's pretty clear he's suppose to be a God-like being. What can you really say about Lugosi? Sure, it's rather sad in a funny way to see someone like him in a movie like this but that just adds to the film's surreal charm. I must say that even though his dialogue is downright silly, Lugosi, always the professional, does a good job in his role. I'm not sure if Lugosi actually knew what the film was going to be about but that fire and passion is still there for us to watch. Wood, the actor, isn't the best thing around but he's certainly no worse than what we usually see in a movie like this. Dolores Fuller, future songwriter for Elvis, plays Glen's girlfriend and does a pretty bad job but she does give us plenty of laughs. Lyle Talbot and Timothy Farrell are also on hand so more laughs here. When it's all said and done, there's no doubt this is a bad movie yet it's very original and I'd even go a step further and say that it has a surreal nature about it that makes it strangely entertaining throughout.

From the opening title sequence to the end where DeNiro quotes scenes from On the Waterfront, this is a rather remarkable, if dark and depressing, look at a self destructing maniac and it's one of the best character studies of all time. This certainly isn't a film that you'll want to watch often considering how depressing it is but it will always be a strong entertainment when viewed. On a technical side this film is flawless from start to finish. The sound effects really stand out as their use here is unforgettable and they still rank among the best for any film I've seen. The use of Italian composer Pietro Mascagni music also hits the right mood as it contains a certain sadness, which fits the film perfectly. The boxing scenes are among the most brutal that I've ever seen in a movie. The final fight with Robinson is so brutal, violent and perfectly edited that you cant' help but feel the actor is really being beaten down in the film. Cathy Moriarty plays DeNiro's wife who he meets when she is fifteen years old and the actress must play her in different aspects of her life. Moriarty is just another example of Scorsese taking someone no one has really heard of and getting them to deliver a strong performance. The highlight for Moriarty is a scene where she's getting slapped around in a bathroom and she finally breaks in anger to try and put Jake in his place. Joe Pesci plays the younger La Motta and also shines very brightly. The rage he has to show, to a smaller level than La Motta, is great to watch and he really works well with DeNiro. As far as DeNiro goes, I'd say his performance here is the second greatest I've ever seen after Marlon Brando in Last Tango in Paris. Everyone knows about the weight gain, which is in itself very impressive but the true genius here is the prison scene where La Motta finally cracks and breaks down. The emotions that DeNiro show in this scene and the rage are something hard to watch but it's so fitting for the character and the film. The movie isn't easy to watch and there aren't any soft punches thrown but if you like in your face dramas then this here is certainly one of the greatest ever made.

In WWII Greece, Peck plays a soldier recruited by Quayle to take part in a daring, nearly suicidal, mission to destroy a pair of massive guns that are cutting off rescue efforts of some 2000 men being cornered on a nearby island. Filling out the team are demolitions expert Niven, Greek resistance fighter Quinn, proved killer Baker and hotheaded Darren. They are later joined by two female, Greek, underground agents, Scala and Papas. Just getting to the area from which to mount the plan proves treacherous in itself, especially when Quayle is severely injured and has to be carried the rest of the way. There's a daunting mountain climb, a severe thunderstorm and shipwreck and a dangerous jaunt across a rocky valley as planes drop mortar from overhead. When the team is finally in place to begin the demolition, it seems that the problems they've encountered (including an arrest by the Nazis) have turned out to be more than just a coincidence. With the odds now even more extreme, they press on to destroy the title guns and allow the retrieval of the stranded men. Peck is stalwart and resourceful in his role, though there are occasions during which he is permitted to act far too over-emphatically, even coming off as foolish, such as when he tears into Niven during one of their respites. Niven is handed some of the rare pithy lines and manages to develop a rather three-dimensional character out of the situation. Quinn does a fine job, though he, too, hams it up every once in a while, though at least his turn seems intentional (as part of a scheme to fool the S.S.) Quayle is typically strong, adding texture and authenticity to his role. Baker and Darren play rather stock characters, each getting a moment or two to shine, with Baker probably getting the best of the deal. Notable actors Justice and Harris turn up briefly at the beginning to set the stage for the events to follow. If one were to insist on inserting two females into the story, as was done here, he could do much worse than Scala and Papas. Scala is a bit too made up for her part, but does an admirable job and Papas is extremely earthy and believable in her role. The ladies have one very memorable moment together about ¾'s of the way through. Named by many as their favorite adventure or war film, it was never really intended to be the serious piece of cinema that it seems to have become in retrospect. The stars were merely out to make an impressive action flick. However, in light of how bubble-gum (and bubble-headed) and slap-dash subsequent adventure movies have become, it can't help but be thought of in a different light now. Still, even director Thompson wished, in retrospect, that he'd trimmed up a few of the longish scenes. The film comes close, at times, to wearing out its welcome as it clocks in at over 2-1\/2 hours. Several sequences stand out as memorable including the shipwreck (in which the actors were tormented with thousands of gallons of water), the revelation of the hidden enemy and the demolition of the guns. A sequel (generally considered inferior) came out seventeen years later called Force 10 From Navarone.

Quinn does a fine job, though he, too, hams it up every once in a while, though at least his turn seems intentional (as part of a scheme to fool the S.S.)

In WWII Greece, Peck plays a soldier recruited by Quayle to take part in a daring, nearly suicidal, mission to destroy a pair of massive guns that are cutting off rescue efforts of some 2000 men being cornered on a nearby island. Filling out the team are demolitions expert Niven, Greek resistance fighter Quinn, proved killer Baker and hotheaded Darren. They are later joined by two female, Greek, underground agents, Scala and Papas. Just getting to the area from which to mount the plan proves treacherous in itself, especially when Quayle is severely injured and has to be carried the rest of the way. There's a daunting mountain climb, a severe thunderstorm and shipwreck and a dangerous jaunt across a rocky valley as planes drop mortar from overhead. When the team is finally in place to begin the demolition, it seems that the problems they've encountered (including an arrest by the Nazis) have turned out to be more than just a coincidence. With the odds now even more extreme, they press on to destroy the title guns and allow the retrieval of the stranded men.

He's got no friends, no girl, no job, yet he's one of the more fascinating creations in the noir pantheon. Just when you think he's out of tricks, he pulls out a shotgun as the cops close in. He's hidden one deep inside a storm drain for an emergency like this. Now we know what he does with his time-- he's a one-man army against the machinery of modern society.But wait, he's not against the plug-in kind of machinery. Martin's a closet genius at modifying the most sophisticated electronics, an untrained innovator with just that kind of intelligence. Does he do it for money-- it's hard to tell. We do know he's not above presenting someone else's work as his own. However, that demeaning aspect may simply be the script complying with Production Code requirements. Businessman Whit Bissell would like to partner up with the mystery man's skills, offering a research laboratory in return. But when Martin refuses with a knowing smile, we know he's got his own drummer. And, we also know that anyone who gets in the way of that drummer turns the science whiz into a cold-blooded killer.At first I thought it a mistake that the screenplay didn't fill in more of Martin's personal story, something that might get a handle on his extreme behavior. But on second thought, better to leave him a mystery man of rare and unfeeling talents. That way, we're free to speculate on a background instead of having to settle for some half-baked Freudianism circa 1948. The character strikes me as someone who has chosen to live outside normal bounds as a challenge to his ingenuity and resourcefulness, both of which he possesses in spades.And it's that, I think, which makes him an unusual crime figure. Time and again, he uses those qualities to defeat the relentless machinery of law enforcement, shown in its many scientific and professional phases. Basehart the actor manages a number of subtle shadings conveying a depth of character not shown by the impersonal forces of law and order. Not that the screenplay doesn't try to humanize the cops-- that's the point of the convalescent hospital scene and the crime lab joshing. Rather, for the professionals, it's a job. For Martin, however, it's something deeper, more interesting, but not necessarily admirable.The movie itself has an uncredited Anthony Mann written all over it, especially the scenes with Basehart. Director Mann, cameraman John Alton, and scripters Higgins and Essex are responsible, I expect, for pointing away from the rather dull procedures onto the noirish atmosphere of outlaw alienation. Of course, bit player Jack Webb saw how popular such procedures could be for a TV audience and spun them off into one of the 1950's most successful series. But it's the underground man Roy Martin, alone with his mutt dog and inner demons that makes up one of noir's most fascinating crime figures.

This time out Charles Grodin plays a man who travels to a mysterious island trying to locate oil for his company. Jeff Bridges plays a scientist and Jessica Lange is on board as a woman saves after her boat went down in a storm. All three are impressive by the island until the giant ape shows up and becomes fixated on the blonde. This film seems to take a lot of heat, which is somewhat understandable but I'd have to give the film an A for effort even though the final movie doesn't turn out as well as one would have hoped. What does work best here are the special effects of Kong, which are truly outstanding. There isn't a single frame in the film where Kong appears to be a fake and this adds a lot of truth to his character, which they actually do try to develop here. Whether he's breaking down trees in the jungle or climbing to the top of the World Trade Center, all these effects come off looking terrific and they certainly hold up well today. Another added bonus is Jessica Lange who turns in a good performance even though her character is horribly written. She's mainly on display here for us to look at her body but I'm not going to complain about this. Both the Grodin and Bridges' characters are also poorly written but both actors manage to do good work, although they both go over the top at times. The screenplay is the film's biggest problem due to how long things get carried out. I think cutting ten or fifteen minutes would have really helped the film because several scenes get carried out too long. The search for Kong goes on forever as does the final escape. I do respect the fact that the filmmakers tried to do a different take on the story instead of simply remaking the original movie.

But although I do not think there is too much substance to this first Mad Max film, it combines and updates so many typical conventions; realises its doing so and delivers it all in one satisfactory package that suffices in a department of a series of genres that it doesn't really matter.The film feels like a western with its large, barren desert location and its masked riders resembling a posse as they cover this barren wasteland spreading fear and destruction. Mad Max represents the ultimate updating into a modern age, in terms of convention and genre. These masked riders do not ride horses but ride motorbikes; the film is somewhat needlessly set a few years into the future but adds to that science-fiction, 'updating' sort of atmosphere and the general feel you get during scenes is that you're watching something of a very post-modern type. At its heart, Mad Max is a revenge film but to say it is a revenge film spoils some of the films best scenes and reasons for character motivation. Mad Max, apart from being a western and a Cagney revenge film is a romance; a rural melodrama and an action film complete with shootouts and car chases.Despite being set in the future, Max Rockatansky (Gibson) is a police ranger part of the law enforcement that deploy its officers with squad cars straight out of the 1970s. Max is given this hard-bodied and somewhat psychotic build up shot in close up format as he waits, like an animal further down the road, for his prey. His prey is The Nightrider but rather than targeting David Hasselhoff and his talking black car, he is after what we first presume to be a joy rider and his female partner who avoids and defeats the other police officers with ease. But after this introduction consisting of close ups of shades; the body; his car's revving exhaust and such, it is revealed Max is a more softer character &#150; a family man who just wants to earn a living. So already Mad Max announces itself as a film that toys with what we think we identify as convention or formula and doesn't really let up from here.The film develops from this opening scene more resembling the opening stunt to a James Bond flick than anything else into a menacing and eerie series of scenes revolving the biker gang's want for revenge. It appears this Nightrider was connected to this posse and now Max is in trouble. But this is where Mad Max focuses on atmosphere more than it does narrative or developing the characters, something that with hindsight we can all say Hollywood do nowadays predominantly with all their summer releases and sequels. With all this emphasis on the family man that is Max, the threat that the biker gang carries is rather menacing on more than one occasion and the director does do well in getting across the correct feelings we as an audience are supposed to experience.Then there are the things that you don't expect to see in the film but are included anyway. There is a scene in which the biker gang hang out on a beach. It's been established they resemble a gang of outlaws in a typical classical Hollywood western but their transport are not horses, they're motorbikes; their choice of weapon are not Colt pistols but German Mauser pistols and pump-action shotguns and to add a further post-modern touch, they take pop-shots at a mannequin dummy for entertainment. But Max's time spent with wife Jesse (Samuel) on a farm owes more to rural melodramas of old and Max's cause and effect revenge sequence much later on in the film is played out with brutal pacing in a barrage of scenes in which some parts inside of you will want to cheer during. This sequence is the part of the film in which you feel the most is achieved, the most in which is accomplished. Away from the romance; the slow burning of the evil biker gang creating a threatening presence and the gradual destruction of Max's life involving friends and family, Mad Max's final third of revenge sees caution thrown to the wind in an entertaining and worthwhile sequence of events, culminating in a memorable scene in which an enemy character is given a choice of life or death.Although the film looks patchy in its editing and the low budget does show, I don't think it detracts from the overall delivery of the film.

Coppola did a fantastic job capturing the whole physiological dimension of the Vietnam War, in particular, and all wars in general. The psychological and physical journey down the river, highlighting many of the aspects of the Vietnam War, including the distance of the generals from the war, commanders like Kilgore who enjoyed the war, the eccentricities and very different personalities of those involved, young inexperienced and confused soldiers, drugs, technology, the air war, the pointlessness defending of strategically unimportant places, the idea of no front lines, primitive and modern ways of fighting a war, the indigenous people of Vietnam, the politics of the war and arguments over how the war should be best fought, the conflict of ethics and civilisation, the humanitarian aspects of the war and the brutal measures adopted by both sides and a philosophical understanding of what possessed those to do what they did. The film also covers atrocities carried out by both sides, suffering of the civilians caught up in the middle of it all, and how powerless they were to avoid an acute involvement in the war. The movie also explores the idea of conditioning a soldier to go out and win battles but the difficulty of then asking him to only fight the war in a particular manner. The concept of the problem the army had with Green Berets, independent, intelligent and educated soldiers, allowed to operate on their own is also assessed. There is some disjoint in the Redux scenes, especially regarding the extra scenes involving the playboy bunnies as pointed out by some other submitters to this website. However, the French plantation scene provides a deeper insight into the war, comparing U.S. involvement with the French colonial war 1945-54, and showing the ghost like world in which the French settlers now live, neither belonging to France or Vietnam and is interesting from a post-colonial perspective. The French plantation scene also provides some continuity in the journey up the river and back in time, as Coppola wanted. There were also a couple of scenes from the 'Apocalypse Now &#150; The Complete Dossier' which could have been including and may have cast more light on the characters in the film &#150; 'the tiger cages' scene with Kurtz and Willard and the 'Special forces knife' scene with Colby and Willard. The scene with Willard in the tiger cage while Kurtz discusses how he is prosecuting the war in a much more primitive and brutal manner in order to win at practically any cost, and Willard disagreeing gives a more in-depth insight into Kurtz and shows that Willard is not going to take the same path as Colby and join Kurtz. The scene with Colby and Willard gives a greater understanding of Colby's state of mind after he had refused to carry out his original mission and had joined Kurtz. However, he has not been completely taken over by the darker nature, and detached himself from his emotions, and he urges Willard to kill Kurtz and explain things to his wife and kids but unlike Kurtz's later request to Willard regarding his son, Colby asks Willard not to tell them everything. Although Milius sought a different ending, the ending Coppola decided on, the idea of the primal myth of death and rebirth, suggested by Denis Jakob, a friend of Coppola's was probably far more suited to the atmosphere and mood of the film.

For my money this is the best coming of age film ever made because of how real it comes off. Perhaps I see myself and my friends in the role of these characters when we were their age but the movie has always struck me as being as true to teenage years as a film can possibly get. The bad language, the stuff the boys talk about and their looking for adventure is something any guy can connect with and I think this film delivers all the laughs, tears and drama of growing up. Each of the four boys are given great character development over the course of the 88-minute running time, which is pretty remarkable since the film doesn't run too long. We get to know each of the characters from their fears to their hopes for the future even though it's obvious that some won't ever reach their goals, which again, just falls back on how real the movie comes off. This is certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and director Reiner handles all of it with great care and his visual style and song selections all hit the right mark. Another thing that keeps the film great are the performances by the four leads. Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell all have some very tough scenes for such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble. The film belongs to Phoenix however as he clearly sticks out from the rest of the cast, which is saying a whole lot. The maturity he shows here is rather amazing to watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldn't be able to pull off the material here. The way the four boys work together makes their characters very memorable. The supporting players include future stars Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack who also turn in great performances. Richard Dreyfuss appears in a few scenes and narrates the film and he does a great job. I think narration quite often ruins films but that's not the case here because Dreyfuss really puts his heart and soul into the narration and it really comes off as he's telling a story from his own childhood.

We get to know each of the characters from their fears to their hopes for the future even though it's obvious that some won't ever reach their goals, which again, just falls back on how real the movie comes off. This is certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story and director Reiner handles all of it with great care and his visual style and song selections all hit the right mark. Another thing that keeps the film great are the performances by the four leads. Wheaton, Feldman and O'Connell all have some very tough scenes for such young actors but all pull them off without any trouble. The film belongs to Phoenix however as he clearly sticks out from the rest of the cast, which is saying a whole lot. The maturity he shows here is rather amazing to watch because there are actors twice his age that wouldn't be able to pull off the material here. The way the four boys work together makes their characters very memorable. The supporting players include future stars Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack who also turn in great performances. Richard Dreyfuss appears in a few scenes and narrates the film and he does a great job. I think narration quite often ruins films but that's not the case here because Dreyfuss really puts his heart and soul into the narration and it really comes off as he's telling a story from his own childhood.

Not perfect, but very, very good, a film that captures the zeitgeist of the 1970s like a butterfly on a pin. Harry is a professional eavesdropper, yes, the best bugger on the West Coast, but try as he might, he's not immune from the human mystery of his work.You know you are watching a terrific film when you see Hackman sharing a scene with Robert Duvall and Harrison Ford, the latter in an early role as a weaselly majordomo. You know you are watching a subversive one when the three great actors are being upstaged by a Doberman. There's not a laugh in the whole movie, Harry is told at one point, perhaps a wink from Francis regarding the heavy subject matter. But it is relevant, what with Watergate exploding at the time of the film's release and the question of surveillance a constant one.I could have done without Allen Garfield's too-heavy turn as a rival of Harry's, or a detour between Harry and his girlfriend (a badly shot Teri Garr) that takes us nowhere. Yes, as many point out here, the main riddle of the film, having to do with the mystery couple and a stray line of conversation Harry picks up, doesn't exactly match up on later reflection. But it doesn't have to, because Coppola establishes early on, by focusing so much on Harry, that what we are dealing with here is subjective, not objective, reality. It's Rashomon wired for sound, and a perfect companion piece where reality itself was a twistable thing.Great central work by Hackman, who according to Coppola's commentary track felt miserable in the role of Harry and looks it. Other superlative work includes David Shire's creepy and sad score for solo piano, Walter Murch's editing and sound design that captures the title conversation in all its odd, devolving permutations. It's amazing to me how anyone who lived through the 1970s can still totally buy into the enveloping mystery of the story, even if it does feature Han Solo and Shirley Feeney. (Cindy Williams, perhaps a bigger star later that decade than Ford or even Hackman as one-half of TV's Laverne & Shirley, makes for a great object of Harry's bugging and, eventually, his tragic passion.)In the end, The Conversation isn't really about the politics of surveillance, or the individual versus society. It's about a guy who realizes the world he watches has teeth, and that the sad derelict he overhears someone talking about may well be himself. No man is an island, even if some are better off that way.I have nothing personal, nothing of value, Harry tells us. The bitter brilliance of The Conversation is Coppola's way of showing us how much better off he would have been had he been right.
