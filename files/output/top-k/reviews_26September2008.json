His most recent film is definitely one of my favourites of this decade and the previous one to that is almost as great as Sideways with a terrific performance of Jack Nicholson. I just watched recently and finally Election. Simply another gem of Payne, for sure I had big expectations and I'm not disappointed at all. I watched it without knowing a single thing about it, only that Payne directed it of course, and I think that was absolutely great.Anyway, it takes a subject that is simple and that should have been simple for the persons involved, a simple school election, so simple that there was only one candidate, the only student who felt a real interest for that election, something that was even an obsession for her. To begin we know two characters that somehow found in that election nothing but a messy situation that they still remember. These two characters are teacher and student, they are Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) and Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick). She is that mentioned unique candidate for the school election and he is a dedicate teacher who seems to be where he always wanted. A chapter in the past will be relevant in these present days, a chapter that is a secret for most of the people but that is not important when that chapter is in the mind of Jim and Tracy. In the end of the film we see that Jim has found a total new life in New York, new job and a new lady after the extremely messy school election. He sees Tracy, he is intrigue, it seems that Tracy has found the success and the power. For sure Jim will not forget Tracy for a long time but not just due to that moment that happened during his visit to Washington, D.C. but because as soon as Jim sees someone with initiative, someone who seems to know it all he will see Tracy, no doubt about it. The case of his best friend marked him, is that mentioned chapter, he was even paranoid, he knew that as soon as he spend more time with Tracy he was closer to the place of his best friend. Upon that we have in Jim a man who will end with any of his problems just to open a bigger one. Is great, I loved the moments of happiness, there were moments when Jim felt that everything was just fine, that he could even start a new chapter in his life and for a reason he ended living in New York City. There are some interesting things; we always have a narrator that will expand our vision. We can trust in all the narrators and even that we feel that, as soon as they start talking, we can know many characters we will only know more about four characters the mentioned two, Paul and Tammy Metzler (Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell). With the candidates for the school election we can see three classic types of students and that is resume in the speech. Definitely one of my favourites scenes of the film, we see the student who is just an expert so the majority will find useless to debate with her. Other is the popular and likable character, he is funny so is not very important if his speech is just not good. And the other is the one who will connect with the majority because she is saying what a lot wanted to say. She is my favourite and she is part of another interesting take on a subject the family. She is sister of Paul and we have in both two narrators. We see with both how they see the other and how they don't know a lot of the other. But I was a nice ending for them and for Tracy but for Jim? Again is interesting since in the beginning he says to us that working as a teacher is the thing that he likes to do. What happens to a man when he loses everything? Everything he's worked for... everything he believes in? Driven from his home... cast out of society... how can he survive? Where can he go? New York City! For centuries people have come to New York seeking refuge from their troubled lives. Now I am one of them.So I really liked this film, it is funny and extremely entertaining. Most of the actors and actresses are unknown to me, I found some terrific acting. Finally, Payne is still great for me.

With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.The simple tale of how three gunslingers form an unlikely alliance of hate, in order to find $200,000 (that's $6 million by today's standards) worth of stolen gold, in a country that is ravaged by war, is elegantly told by the maestro of westerns, Sergio Leone. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end. Leone should probably be awarded a Nobel Prize for that scene alone. Leone is probably why westerns are popular among the youth of the '60s, hell, he probably influenced would be filmmakers at the time. I know of one who was particularly influenced by Leone's direction - Quentin Tarantino himself said that this film is the best-directed film of all time. And yes, although the film may be long, there's not a scene that goes by that you'll say boring.Clint Eastwood - The Good. The legendary Man With No Name. His character perfectly embodies with the true meaning of masculinity. As per in his previous films, he plays a mysterious gunslinger, one with a deadly aim and a strong sense of honor and pride. He is the perfect hero, and this film stands out as one of Clint's, if not his, best film ever.Lee Van Cleef - The Bad. Here, instead of the fatherly Doug Mortimer in the previous For A Few Dollars More, we get the stone-cold assassin Angel Eyes. Van Cleef plays him chillingly to the bone. He is wicked, he is ruthless, he is cruel. He would kill anyone, be it his targets or even his own client.Eli Wallach - The Ugly. He is Tuco, a criminal on the loose. He is the most interesting character in the film, as we see the ugly side of man through him. He is two-faced, slimy, arrogant, and hate-able. But that what makes his character great. There is no substitution for Wallach, he will always be Tuco no matter what.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music - that's another thing. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.So, yes, this is truly cinematic brilliance. If you want to see the film in all it's glory, I reckon you readers get the extended cut DVD of the film. It's Leone's true version of this film, and it would do you some good to see his true film, not to mention the remastered picture and 5.1 sound so that you can hear the gunshots and explosions in all its fury.

Then I went to another store about a month later and I found Talk Radio on DVD for only $5.00. So I see it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So after the film was over I was speechless. I have never seen such a film like this. Here's the main plot, then i'll tell ya what I thought of it.It is about a Dallas talk radio host Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about whatever other people bring up and he interupts, and is taking everything seriously. Now, a network wants to put his show live everywhere in the U.S. So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone callers like Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a rock n roll drugged kid), John (rapist), and others. Now some of the callers sound like the same actor\/actresses. But still I think it fits okay.Now what I love a lot about this film is the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. The dark music in the background fits very nicely too. It has a flashback scene in the film also how he started with radio, which I think they did good on. But the great thing about the film is ending. I was surprised by it, and it kind of makes you feel paranoid a little about the phone callers off the air and everything about it is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things to people over a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's underrated\/weakest films mentioned, but I think it's his best in my opinion.But definitely get this film if you like films with paranoia-feel like films with a dark atmosphere with sinister music in the background. I still watch this film a lot of the times now when i'm bored, as matter fact I watched it tonight. Yeah, if ya wanna really get the sinister feel to the film, watch it at nightime with the lights off. I may sound crazy, but it makes the film better!Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the film did so well was maybe in my point of view because of the title. 'Talk Radio.' It doesn't sound very tricky or anything, it's kind of plain. A better title like the book Talked To Death or maybe The Abusive Radio Host or something catchy and not plain Talk Radio. Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone usually didn't do Universal I don't think. Paramount might have been a good company. I don't know, something about this film didn't do so well, but I love it.Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage.

One of these is tracked, her loves disappointments and death. Indeed, the nuclear complex at the center of this story (closed) is now the world's largest Superfund site, costing over two billion dollars a year just to monitor. The problems there were related to what you see here on screen.Somehow the steam has gone out of this story, as in the modern era the trespasses of government and big business even make this seem small comparing consequences. But there are some interesting elements of this film that make it a joy to watch.The unseen villain here is radiation. You cannot see it. After the fact, you can track it using the same methods (in movie terms) as a regular detective. But its pervasive and final. Its a reflection of noir that there is an unseen force, controlled subconsciously by the audience that changes the ordinary lives we randomly choose. Has to be ordinary people. Mike Nichols understands this. Its why, I think, he chose this project.You see, Mike's talent is in filling all the space. He fills the frame. He fills the lives, the dialog. There's depth there. Its not depth in the emotional sense &#151; he is careful to keep the arc clean and easy to read. No, its just that he leaves no space empty. Even the framing of a shot has the sort of clutter you find in real life. There's no stage cleanliness where if you see something you know it will factor in the story.He does this editing-wise as well.

He's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles, but I guess I always put his success down to his characters' grumpiness and ruthlessness, a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co-star Jack Lemmon, and, I suppose, a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures. Watching Gene Saks' 'The Odd Couple (1968),' adapted from a popular Neil Simon play, the realisation suddenly clicked Matthau is, in his own right, absolutely hilarious! Initially striking the audience as filthy, crude and generally unappealing, his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts, culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own. At the same time, while holding his own as a comedian, his interplay with Lemmon is, of course, pitch-perfect; indeed, the film rightly belongs to both actors, who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves, let alone together.Calling to mind Billy Wilder's screenplay for 'The Apartment (1960),' this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise. Compulsive house-cleaner Felix Unger (Lemmon), having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years, attempts to commit suicide, but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window. Dejected, he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar (Matthau), a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches (that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat!). Oscar kindly offers Felix a place to stay, but is soon overwhelmed by his friend's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness. The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement, with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly-nagging wife, and Oscar as the sloppy, unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he's supposed to. This is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks, and, by the end of it, we can completely sympathise with Felix's ex-wife, who remains unseen.'The Odd Couple' is a terrific comedy, most of all because it has a lot of heart. For all their arguing, it's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other, most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade, instead &#150; perhaps inadvertently &#150; ending up informing Oscar how tops he his. The pair's four poker buddies (John Fiedler, Herb Edelman, David Sheiner and Larry Haines) are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance, but you can't deny that they've got the best of intentions. Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory, but maybe being ignored wasn't quite the correct solution to Felix's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality. Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays I was recently disappointed by Wilder's 'The Seven Year Itch (1955), this film doesn't simply strike at the same chord throughout, and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed, through tears, laughter and much disagreement.

A brakeman is a train board rail transport worker in the U.S. Historically, the brakeman was the person who would walk the length of a train atop the cars while the train is in motion and turn the brake wheel on each car to apply the train's brakes from Wicipeda. A movie like this conjors up several different thoughts of wonder. What was it like to despise your fellow countrymen? What was it like to live in a country where you had no instant means of communication and travel? The movie paints an interesting historical picture that highlights the animosity between the North and the South during the civil war. It also presents us with the first recipients of the Congressianl Medal of Honor. Did I get that right? TGLC does have some impressive chase sequences that ended rather disappointedly for the Northerns. I guess I really thought they were going to get away with stealing a train. They would have gotten away with it too, if it hadn't been for that rotten train conductor William Campbell (Jeffrey Hunter) and his mangy dog. It's also fun to see Jeff York (Mike Fink) and Fess Parker (Davy Crockett) on hand to lend personality to this Civil War light family drama.My mother enjoyed it more than I did. This is one of those movies I can appreciate but don't necessarily like. It just didn't draw me in to the train ride. It didn't roll me down the tracks. I was busy writing another movie review at the time, so maybe the distraction derailed me a tad bit. I would perhaps watch it again sometime and give it more of a fair chance.

Because of that, his appeal to mainstream audiences was as wide as deep his reverence among aficionados. His films are among the favorites of many great directors, from Scorsese to Kurosawa.Ford made great films throughout his long and illustrious career. One of those was The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. That film, like many of his others, is skewered with problems and elements of period melodrama acted sometimes by not so great actors. But nevertheless, those films, and this one, survive and thrive in spite of them.James Stewart plays Rance Stoddard, a big wig senator, once a small time lawyer. His fame came as a result of his killing of a notorious outlaw, Liberty Valance. Rance tells his story to a group of reporters when he returns with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to the small town where he found fame for the funeral of a man - Tom Doniphon. Lee Marvin plays Valance, who's gang holds up Rance's coach, then mercilessly beats him. He's found by Tom, a rugged wild man played with ferocity by John Wayne. He has a side kick, Pompey, a towering African American. The two men get along, but there is conflict under the surface. At this stage in the game, Hallie appears to be in line for Tom, not Rance. Rance preaches the word of the law, while Tom insists the only way to survive in this essentially lawless land is through the word of the gun. He frequently stands up for Rance when Liberty rides into town, and though never outwardly stated, seems to emasculate Rance with his protection of him. In the mean time, Rance is persuaded to start teaching the townsfolk to read and write, and starts working for the local paper. He is a jack of all trades but the gun.When the town decides to elect two delegates to head to the territorial capital city to press for statehood, Liberty tries to bully the people into elected him. Embarrassingly, they elect Rance and the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, as their representatives. Soon after, Liberty orders Rance to meet him in the streets, guns drawn, or leave town. They meet, Liberty toys with Rance, then on the final draw is inexplicably shot dead. Rance is celebrated for killing the outlaw, but all is not as it seems in the end.The first two thirds of Liberty Valance play fairly standard. What keeps it really going is Stewart's fearless wimpishness, Wayne's commanding and quite enthralling screen presence, and Lee Marvin's eccentric and dandyish portrayal of Liberty Valance. His performance, I think, is one of the big highlights of the film. He has such a wildness about him that when he's intimidated by Tom, the scene jumps off the screen.Ford's direction is characteristically meticulous and understated. The film's best scene comes after Valance has been shot, with Rance and the other townsfolk at the territorial meeting. It's one of the best examples of the 19th century political meeting and their elaborate goings on. Horses ride in as signs are raised and slogans shouted. Wayne makes his reappearance here, after a curious absence during the street gunfight. It's the scene that i remember most vividly from the film, and its crude elegance is enthralling to watch.As noted, Ford's film's tend to suffer with age due to some period hamminess. His shifting of genre's sometimes can confuse modern audiences, and the melodrama is occasionally thick enough to choke a bull. John Qualen is there again doing his almost insultingly embarrassing Nordic impressions. His foolishness is often charming though. Some have also pointed out that both Stewart and Wayne were far too old to play their characters, but to their credit, they succeed anyway in their portrayals.Nevertheless, The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, because of what it is, is a great film, in spite of what it is. It is a classic example of the Hollywood Golden Era, coming in its dying days. The final revelations of the film and the understated feeling of resentment Hallie seems to have for Rance in the present tense heighten the film. When asked who placed the cactus rose for Tom, Hallie responds, almost defiantly, I did. He was his friend, almost her lover. Their relationship exists only because Tom saved Rance - more than anyone else really ever knows. As the man says, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.

He is a jack of all trades but the gun.When the town decides to elect two delegates to head to the territorial capital city to press for statehood, Liberty tries to bully the people into elected him. Embarrassingly, they elect Rance and the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, as their representatives. Soon after, Liberty orders Rance to meet him in the streets, guns drawn, or leave town. They meet, Liberty toys with Rance, then on the final draw is inexplicably shot dead. Rance is celebrated for killing the outlaw, but all is not as it seems in the end.The first two thirds of Liberty Valance play fairly standard. What keeps it really going is Stewart's fearless wimpishness, Wayne's commanding and quite enthralling screen presence, and Lee Marvin's eccentric and dandyish portrayal of Liberty Valance. His performance, I think, is one of the big highlights of the film. He has such a wildness about him that when he's intimidated by Tom, the scene jumps off the screen.Ford's direction is characteristically meticulous and understated. The film's best scene comes after Valance has been shot, with Rance and the other townsfolk at the territorial meeting. It's one of the best examples of the 19th century political meeting and their elaborate goings on. Horses ride in as signs are raised and slogans shouted. Wayne makes his reappearance here, after a curious absence during the street gunfight. It's the scene that i remember most vividly from the film, and its crude elegance is enthralling to watch.As noted, Ford's film's tend to suffer with age due to some period hamminess. His shifting of genre's sometimes can confuse modern audiences, and the melodrama is occasionally thick enough to choke a bull. John Qualen is there again doing his almost insultingly embarrassing Nordic impressions. His foolishness is often charming though. Some have also pointed out that both Stewart and Wayne were far too old to play their characters, but to their credit, they succeed anyway in their portrayals.Nevertheless, The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, because of what it is, is a great film, in spite of what it is. It is a classic example of the Hollywood Golden Era, coming in its dying days. The final revelations of the film and the understated feeling of resentment Hallie seems to have for Rance in the present tense heighten the film. When asked who placed the cactus rose for Tom, Hallie responds, almost defiantly, I did. He was his friend, almost her lover. Their relationship exists only because Tom saved Rance - more than anyone else really ever knows. As the man says, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.

Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film auteur. Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic\/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and legitimate society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding favor, whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, I believe in America. America has made my fortune, and then turns to disillusioned contradiction for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now. It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business. And most famously of all I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael! A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head, he relates, and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me. Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as Senator Corleone or Governor Corleone not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (prince of darkness) Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes &#150; especially in the Don's home office &#150; with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas) and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1\/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that crime did not pay.

Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film auteur. Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic\/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and legitimate society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding favor, whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, I believe in America. America has made my fortune, and then turns to disillusioned contradiction for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have.

It's strictly business. And most famously of all I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael! A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head, he relates, and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me. Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as Senator Corleone or Governor Corleone not as his successor.

I like the way the fast-talking football radio commentator acts as glue and ferment between the scenes, and in the opening shot. And the infamous scene where the nameless bad lieutenant sexually badgers two Jersey girls is a brilliant exercise in cinematic story telling, and proof yet again that what you don't show in a movie can be much worse than what you do show.***SPOILERS ON*** (If you haven't seen the movie, the nameless bad lieutenant stops a car with a busted tail-light. As it turns out, the passengers are two out-of-town girls who have snaffled the family car to go to a downtown club, and they obviously don't want their parents to hear about it. The lieutenant then orders the passenger girl to turn around while he masturbates to the girl in the driver's seat simulating fellatio.Visually, the scene is not explicit -- you see no skin or privates. Mentally the scene makes great impact. The scene is much creepier than if they had visually shown the lieutenant raping the two girls.) ***SPOILERS OFF***But in many other aspects the movie is direly lacking. It uses a stream-of-consciousness-style of film-making where the scenes are shot in a documentary style, and you have to pick out the story from the scenes. Well, I was picking and picking and still looking for the story when suddenly the titles rolled. What I got at the end is this a super-sexy nun has been raped, but refuses to identify the rapists because she's a Catholic who forgives those who rape her (and the fact that identifying the rapists might prevent them from raping others somehow never enters the picture). The Bad Lieutenant, being a Catholic himself, struggles with this, but he eventually captures the perps and for some reason puts them on a bus. Roll end titles. The crooked copper has ameliorated himself by setting free two nun rapists.There is no protagonist, no antagonist, no suspense, no plot, no development. The movie is visually very stylish, but I never for one second believed that a real cop could carry on his excesses the way the bad lieutenant did. There are endless dream sequences where he injects freebase cocaine into his eyeballs in the company of a bevy of Nebraskan hookers whilst betting the life of his dead grandmother with the Albanian mafia on the Yankees' winning the world series, which unfortunately in itself is totally boring and unshocking to watch. There is never any moral conflict -- the lieutenant is too far gone for that. And if he's able to carry on all these excesses and STILL hold down a job as a police investigator, take care of his family AND maintain the physique of a competition body builder, then he must be doing something right. I abide by the law and eat muesli, and still look like a dead newt.Overall, despite its reputation, a bad movie with only a few good scenes. It just tries too hard to be shocking and metaphorical.

Wouldn't it be better to take a bad movie of theirs and remake it into a good movie? Why mess with perfection? Despite having said all that, I enjoyed the remake. Les Miserables is the only Broadway musical I ever saw and I saw it in Boston. If I went to London and saw the same show, it would more or less be the same show, but with the personal touch that each cast brings to the performance. That is how it was with the remake of the Parent Trap.The original is not better because it is the first version I saw, but because it has more charm overall because of the delightful Hayley Milles. It also has Hayley Milles beating up herself. The remake has Linsey Lohan having a sword fight with herself which she pulls off nicely and little Linsey is so cute and adorable. The first movie had a nicely flowing story pace while the remake had a more logically revealing storyline. You learn a little bit more about what caused the Parent's breakup in the first place. The people's reactions in the first film are more realistic and natural then in the remake, except for that of the nurse maid on the Father's side. She cries up a storm when she finds out the true identity of the girl she hasn't seen since she was one years old. The new version also has Dennis Quaid which is usually a good idea for any casting director. What worked to make the story a success the first time around, they included this time around. They structure the story differently but just as effectively. The ending of the first one worked really well and the ending of this Parent Trap ends equally well but in a different way. They could not have fit the new ending in the older version for technological reasons. But the new ending makes more sense story wise then the former all the former is quite good as well. The Remake of the Parent Trap deserves a place next to the Original Parent Trap in your family library. It might even be fun to watch the two and then compare them. The movies together and by themselves make for an evening of in-depth discussion and entertainment. If your brave you can then watch Parent Trap 2 and then realize how much better the other two films really are. If they remake Parent Trap 2, lets hope it's better then the original.

As the pendant has the sentence 'together in Paris' on it, Anya concludes that her family must reside in France, and so hooks up with two con men, Dimitri (John Cusack) and Vladimir (Kelsey Grammar), who decide to pass her off as the lost Romanov princess Anastasia to swindle the Dowager Empress (Angela Lansbury) out of the reward she has offered for her granddaughter's safe return. What the conniving pair and orphaned urchin don't realize is that Anya *is* Anastasia, and her family's undead confidant Rasputin (Christopher Lloyd) is bent on destroying her, and so eradicating the Romanov line forever.What a brilliant tale this is! Who cares if it isn't historically accurate? It's not meant to be, and there are quite a few little historical details anyways, like the paintings, and physical similarities between the cartoon characters and the real people (like the ghost of Anastasia's little brother Alexi walks with a limp, etc). It's meant to be a fantasy, a bit of wishful thinking. And there have been other takes on this story, so why bash this one?As well as this, the songs are extraordinary. 'Once Upon a December' still sends shivers down my spine even after all these years of being a steadfast fan of the film--even as a teenager I catch myself humming the tunes of 'Journey to the Past', 'In the Dark of the Night', 'Rumour in St Petersburg', and especially the uber-catchy 'Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)'. The humour and romance walk hand in hand with this one--though a lot of the laughs come out of the wicked Rasputin (only amusing because he's falling apart) and his bat side-kick Bartok (voiced by The Simpsons' Hank Azaria, so he's automatically hilarious), the funniest parts of the movie (I think) are generated by the bantering relationship between Dimitri the con-man and Anya\/Anastasia. They are constantly arguing and insulting each other, even when faced with mortal peril, which makes their 'unspoken attraction' (as Dimitri's partner Vladimir calls it) even more adorable and real-seeming. All in all, 'Anastasia' may not be the perfect film, and sure it isn't historically accurate, but it is superb all the same!

I've got to say that I'm going to have to side with those who call it a classic this time around. More specifically, I've never before seen a neorealist film I would ever have called gripping and I've not seen any neorealist film as good since Roma, citta apperta.Let me quickly go through some of the myths and the more popular interpretations it is true that the movie completely revolves around a man and his son searching for the man's stolen bicycle, but it is not true at all that there's nothing else to it. More specifically, it's about the man's relationship with his son as a main theme and an exploration of post-war Rome as subtext. It is true that it has quite a lot of communist themes placed through-out, but honestly those themes are entirely engulfed in the much more personal, tragic aspects of the movie. The more poignant political commentary is in the way the plot works, where people are forced to own property--a certain type of property--in order to get a job and thus get more property. Truly you can't blame the movie for that, because it has a point.What this movie is really good at is shifting the emotions of the viewers to match those felt by the protagonist Antonio Vicci. The movie quickly establishes the importance of the bicycle and its emotional value to Vicci. The search itself is desperate, but it is given depth by the relationship of Antonio to Bruno, his son. As the two of them share a love for the bike and a need to retrieve it, they also share a shifting and dynamic relationship to each other that runs from full support to quiet alienation and everything in between. The strongest moments in the film are the ones in which their relationship seem the most damaged. The father eventually must depend on the son to share his pain.In terms of the concept of neorealism itself, it's debatable where this movie fits. The most clear features of it are its focus on class struggle, a taste of the melodrama, and a plot lead on by a simple, singular desire. However, the production values are much higher than the famed Roma, citta apperta, and at this point de Sica is well established as an auteur working under the awareness of a more popular and mainstream international audience. Genre debates aside, it's a strong film that well deserves its lasting appreciation, no matter how many people find it boring or disagree with its politics.--PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"26 September 2008","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Despite this movie's strong placement in the annals of those deemed classics, I was a bit hesitant to check it out because I'm not the biggest fan of neorealism, and, strangely enough, a lot of my friends with opinions I respect really didn't like it.
