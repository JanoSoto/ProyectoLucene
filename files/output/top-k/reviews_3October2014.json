This is the kind of film you just don't ever want to end. Nunnally Johnson does an incredible job making John Steinbeck's words ready for the screen and John Ford never fails to do justice to the narrative. When a character performs a longer dialog, you can tell you're seeing it with the same impact readers felt reading it. When Tom Joad walks across a lonesome road under the dim blue sky of an early morning you just have to imagine Steinbeck was proud of the people who worked so hard to bring his work to a new medium.The story of the Joad family is a rough one. It begins with Tom fresh out of prison for what is described as self defense. It seems hopeful, but this is the last good fortune he'll see for a long while. Upon finding his family displaced and staying with an uncle, he learns that they've been removed from the farm where the Joad family had been sharecropping for decades. Their seemly only hope is a sizable journey towards California, so they load up a 'jalopy' far past its breaking point to set out on a trail ripe with misery in hopes of rebuilding. You start out rooting for the Joads, how could you not? But the film subjects them to a myriad of misfortunes along the way. Your hope turns to pity quickly, but you can't help but appreciate how much you admire their courage. It's remarkable how much I came to feel for the Joads. Tom is an outstanding protagonist, and you're with him till the very end.A film with a story this great would do fine without being technically impressive and pleasant to look at, but those aspects are wonderfully done too. The film looks incredibly crisp. I didn't manage to forget it was black and white, but I couldn't take my mind off how great it looked. You can see every mark on a person's face, every detail in Tom's scar, and California's ugly brown hills and beautiful green pastures are both presented just as they are to this day.I genuinely loved this movie. It had such an emotional impact. It was hard seeing the Joad family suffer, and it was such a relief to see them finally catch a break. Tom Joad was such a great character that by the end of the film he actually felt like a brother. The film really makes you feel like a Joad yourself, looking back at the family's history. I've been lucky enough to see Cannery Row on a few occasions, and I've seen with my own eyes the fields that the migrant workers of the time would have gone to in search of work. It gave the film a great impact. I'm glad I took the time to watch something so well done that I enjoyed so much.

The great depression, the deadbeat husband, naive dreamy wife, were all well played and written. So, because of that you really can enter that fantasy world with Cecilia, knowing that she does not have nothing worth for coming back home after a movie night.I get the sad ending in the artistic way, and is pretty real and touching, but made my heart chilled after smiling so much through the same story minutes before the ending. But in the other hand, I wish so bad she went inside the screen with Tom. I wish I could have told her - HEY, this is what you always wanted, do not be afraid if it seems  too perfect, just embrace it!I know that, but the way they explained, once they turn off the movie projector, they disappear. It is kind of sad, but why not jump to be happy for while (I believe most of us while reading or watching, wish we could choose magic over reality), instead of just being miserable forever. In the 30's getting a divorce was not like these days, and that scene at the brothel, showed me how she could ended up like those women.Unfortunately, she chose what it seemed to be touchable, reality. And I understand where she came from, though. I have seen it, in real life people scared of something that seems so good to be true, it must be troubled. There's even a saying about it,and that gets in people's way for the true happiness. If you like to watch movies for all the possible senses, even reading that has a potential sad ending to you, I recommend it.I did not spoil myself in any shape of form before watching it, so my heart is a little bit frozen still.

To be read after watching the film.Se7en is the second time David Fincher has insisted on a weirdo number title that doesn't make much sense other than to look cool, but fortunately it is the last. The story goes New Line had refused Andrew Kevin Walker's script because of the now (in)famous head in a box ending, preferring it rewritten as a detective noir, but when they sent the script to Fincher offering him the project, they accidentally sent the original script and Fincher took the project based on the original end, and strangely, because he saw the film about a meditation on the evil within us all, rather than a police detective thriller. If Se7en is a meditation on the evil within, then god help us, because as Mills (Brad Pitt) says to Somerset (Morgan Freeman) several times through the story, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) is mad, and no matter how much you want to dress him up in the admiration we all have for a passionate dedication to our individual projects, what gets us in with Se7en is the graphic imagery, not the important statement on psychological depth. Se7en never once turns the camera on the fascinated viewer, it merely tells a story very well, and its subject choice reveals a talent Fincher has for tapping into a cultural zeitgeist that can sell a product or a story, but leaves the creative thinker at the margins of the goings on, and never the subject of it. Fincher never once makes us ask ourselves why we want to see images of a man who has eaten himself to death, he just gives them to us, standing by our side, pointing outward at the evil we get and chose not to be. It's a horrible waste, because the film screams for the point to be made, through Somerset's self-reflection and Tracy Mills' (Gwyneth Paltro) external observations (as the film stands she is barely more than a head in a box) and painted precisely as it is with just slight variances to both those characters lines, the film could have been a masterpiece of societal observation instead of a glamorous cop flick that becomes all about its gruesomeness. As we will see, Fincher is completely capable of this level of observation, because he goes there in his best film Zodiac, but he pulls away from it in Se7en, speaking to his overall problem of subject versus object - holding a mirror up to the people (art) or giving them what they want (advertising).If there is a running theme of intellectual constraint in Fincher's films, there is a compensatory splendor in his equal parts subtle and intensified aesthetic pallet, that sees much of the impact of atmosphere he tried to evoke in Alien³ fully realized. The world of Se7en is made unrelentingly bleak, all the unlit rooms and preoccupation with torch-light notwithstanding. It almost always rains in this unnamed burg where no one switches a light on, nothing really works and people inspecting apartments never think to stay in them to look around for longer than five minutes. Fincher used bleach bypass to retain the silver in the film stock, washing everything in a tinted gray that gives flesh both living and dead a pasty quality. Nothing, even Paltrow's face and hair, is luminous. Blood is always a dark, liquid earth brown.Those who fought for the ending, Fincher and Pitt specifically, knew to do so because it is the punchline that gives Se7ven its heart, the rest of the script being too clichéd (the retiring cop and the rookie newbie, the last-minute superior serial killer, the visits to the library to sink into his mind, the black cop white cop Lethal Weapon thing) to amount to much, particularly when stripped of the only punch that would have given it teeth that I articulated in the first paragraph.Yet Fincher could see a script that lent itself to potent mise-en- scene and in many ways, this will define him as a director from this film forward, which is partially why Se7en is usually thought of as his first film. Fincher the adman knew to sell John Doe as a concept right from the beginning. The opening credits (something Fincher will become more and more famous for) are devoted to the serial killer, the part of us Fincher falsely imagines Se7en is highlighting. Actually, Fincher plays it safe offering John Doe to us packaged (Brown box delivered if you like) in sleazy funk, indulging us ah-la-music video. The opening title becomes it's own narrative concept and it's not till later in the film we realize we were watching John Doe, as Fincher would say, working on some really evil s$%^. The choice of (another) bad script and the focus on the serial killer is where Fincher creatively sells out, because it's not until Zodiac that he realizes just knowing what we want and giving it to us doesn't make him deep or even clever. He needs to focus on us rather than feed us, instead adopting the central conceit of advertising that assumes because it knows what will motivate us, that it is smarter than us. Se7en is a beautifully crafted film, and Fincher draws solid performances from his talented cast, but his own timidity prevents it from being a truly great film.

The story goes New Line had refused Andrew Kevin Walker's script because of the now (in)famous head in a box ending, preferring it rewritten as a detective noir, but when they sent the script to Fincher offering him the project, they accidentally sent the original script and Fincher took the project based on the original end, and strangely, because he saw the film about a meditation on the evil within us all, rather than a police detective thriller. If Se7en is a meditation on the evil within, then god help us, because as Mills (Brad Pitt) says to Somerset (Morgan Freeman) several times through the story, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) is mad, and no matter how much you want to dress him up in the admiration we all have for a passionate dedication to our individual projects, what gets us in with Se7en is the graphic imagery, not the important statement on psychological depth. Se7en never once turns the camera on the fascinated viewer, it merely tells a story very well, and its subject choice reveals a talent Fincher has for tapping into a cultural zeitgeist that can sell a product or a story, but leaves the creative thinker at the margins of the goings on, and never the subject of it. Fincher never once makes us ask ourselves why we want to see images of a man who has eaten himself to death, he just gives them to us, standing by our side, pointing outward at the evil we get and chose not to be. It's a horrible waste, because the film screams for the point to be made, through Somerset's self-reflection and Tracy Mills' (Gwyneth Paltro) external observations (as the film stands she is barely more than a head in a box) and painted precisely as it is with just slight variances to both those characters lines, the film could have been a masterpiece of societal observation instead of a glamorous cop flick that becomes all about its gruesomeness. As we will see, Fincher is completely capable of this level of observation, because he goes there in his best film Zodiac, but he pulls away from it in Se7en, speaking to his overall problem of subject versus object - holding a mirror up to the people (art) or giving them what they want (advertising).If there is a running theme of intellectual constraint in Fincher's films, there is a compensatory splendor in his equal parts subtle and intensified aesthetic pallet, that sees much of the impact of atmosphere he tried to evoke in Alien³ fully realized. The world of Se7en is made unrelentingly bleak, all the unlit rooms and preoccupation with torch-light notwithstanding. It almost always rains in this unnamed burg where no one switches a light on, nothing really works and people inspecting apartments never think to stay in them to look around for longer than five minutes. Fincher used bleach bypass to retain the silver in the film stock, washing everything in a tinted gray that gives flesh both living and dead a pasty quality. Nothing, even Paltrow's face and hair, is luminous. Blood is always a dark, liquid earth brown.Those who fought for the ending, Fincher and Pitt specifically, knew to do so because it is the punchline that gives Se7ven its heart, the rest of the script being too clichéd (the retiring cop and the rookie newbie, the last-minute superior serial killer, the visits to the library to sink into his mind, the black cop white cop Lethal Weapon thing) to amount to much, particularly when stripped of the only punch that would have given it teeth that I articulated in the first paragraph.Yet Fincher could see a script that lent itself to potent mise-en- scene and in many ways, this will define him as a director from this film forward, which is partially why Se7en is usually thought of as his first film. Fincher the adman knew to sell John Doe as a concept right from the beginning. The opening credits (something Fincher will become more and more famous for) are devoted to the serial killer, the part of us Fincher falsely imagines Se7en is highlighting. Actually, Fincher plays it safe offering John Doe to us packaged (Brown box delivered if you like) in sleazy funk, indulging us ah-la-music video. The opening title becomes it's own narrative concept and it's not till later in the film we realize we were watching John Doe, as Fincher would say, working on some really evil s$%^. The choice of (another) bad script and the focus on the serial killer is where Fincher creatively sells out, because it's not until Zodiac that he realizes just knowing what we want and giving it to us doesn't make him deep or even clever. He needs to focus on us rather than feed us, instead adopting the central conceit of advertising that assumes because it knows what will motivate us, that it is smarter than us. Se7en is a beautifully crafted film, and Fincher draws solid performances from his talented cast, but his own timidity prevents it from being a truly great film.

I don't know what it is about Harris &#x85; but he grows on you. He's a great actor, even in a somewhat one-note role like the one he has here. He can be forceful and intimidating, and even genuinely frightening, but also sympathetic at the same time.

Pulp Fiction was nothing short of a typical movie in the crime drama thriller genre. The way the film was set up was not in typical chronological order. The movie is set up in what I would call a chapter format, and it covers stories of individuals and through those stories you learn how they are all connected. Although I feel this is a good way to format a movie, it was a little confusing at time and made me go huh?. I think the editing in this film fit what Tarantino was trying to convey to the audience. The only part like I said before that was not conducive for a movie goer is how it can be confusing at times. For example there is a moment in the movie where Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was killed by Butch Coolidge played by Bruce Willis and immediately following that chapter Vincent Vega was alive and well, it was not until later in the movie it was understood that this movie was done in the chapter format. The editing throughout this movie was spot on. The sound through the movie was the done impeccably. The music fit every scene perfectly. For example when Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman went to dinner at a dinner that replicated famous era's in the past and had servers that were look alike to past famous people the music was from the 50's era. During the twist competition the music was the music they played back when the twist was in style. During the fast paced scenes it was a fast paced sound that made your heart pump a little faster and helped with the anticipation the audience would be feeling. Overall the sound was very effective. The crime aspect of this film was very apparent. I think it had more crime than drama and thriller. There were a lot of crude remarks made.

If I am solely looking at the editing, sound, cinematography, and other aspects of film making it was an excellently crafted film, however the content left a little to be desired. I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 18 however I would recommend this to adults that like the genre of crime and thriller because it contains everything I would expect of that genre and will not leave them unhappy.

This time however the threat does not come from outer space but in a neat twist from inner space, a prehistoric creature that feeds on radioactive energy and has now emerged as the development of nuclear power\/weaponry has finally provided it with enough food source to return to the surface. A great concept which unfortunately the special effects can never live up to, I envisioned something more akin to Morbius' creature of the 'Id' from The Forbidden Planet. Speaking of which this must have been quite shocking in its' day, the sight of the creature's victims melting away must have been truly disturbing to a 50s audience. They also kill the kid which must have been taboo at the time. One thing that stuck in my craw a little was the nurse who was rendered mute after witnessing her lover's death, I half expected someone to exclaim 'Well of course she's hysterical, she's only a woman'. Underpinning this all is an early form of environmentalism, atomic energy had been sold to the masses as the great white hope but now people were beginning to have second thoughts as the grieving father's rant against the scientist illustrates. That the creature resembles an oil slick may also be a metaphor of sorts. The ending is somewhat underwhelming, the creatures defeat depending on a tyre getting out of a rut and you wonder if there wasn't supposed to be another scene before the titles run but all the same it's an interesting and entertaining film.

Obviously this film is not quite as successful as the original film, but its still nevertheless a pretty decent and interesting thriller, that has lots of twists and turns. The story is basically about a husband and wife named Steven (Michael Douglas) and Emily Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) where despite being married and have high prolific careers, are having a troublesome relationship and various other issues in their lives. Emily (Gwyneth) is having an affair with someone, Steven (Michael) is having serious financial implications. Neither of them are mentally stable, yet have various 'targets' to achieve. The film is pretty good for what it was. Michael Douglas was the outstanding performer of this film and if not for his performance, then I just feel the film would've dropped way down to mediocrity. I'm surprised just how beautiful Gwyneth looked back then, she was a very good choice playing the character Emily. The cast choice was good and the film is a decent thriller worth watching for 1 night or something at least. The conclusion according to me was a let down otherwise it could've got a higher rating.Personally, I found this film pretty enjoyable and gave it a 6 rating and it is certainly worth watching. What makes the film different compared to Dial M for Murder, is that it is much much darker.

Oh, and Donald Sutherland plays Ronald. He's like a fire version of Hannibal Lecter, who makes Brian crack by asking him if he wanted to be like his father (dies at the start of the film).I'm really not sure what this film wanted to be. It starts out as a kind of drama about the camaraderie and conflict between a group of fire fighters, turns into a thriller about an arsonist and a conspiracy, then turns into a kind of horror film in which fire is made out to be a living thing with a mind of it's own and Brian's nemesis or something. There's even a scene of him using the hose against a blaze like Ripley uses the rifle against the aliens. And a scene of the fire communicating with him as he faces it. Then all these elements come together for an overblown action climax.The film is ridiculous, overblown, silly, sentimental, and I love it.

The Rainmaker is an underrated film and in my opinion this film is what every aspiring Law Student should see at least once. This movie deals with a lot of different aspects such as injustice, corruption, discrimination, social issues, and human rights. This legal movie will set out to aspire and motivate any aspiring Law Student and really open your eyes to the legal world. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"}]
