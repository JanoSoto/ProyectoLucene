[{"date":"10 April 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the best films in the exciting category of future technology and radical ideas run amok, Director Steven Spielberg's (Saving Private Ryan) Minority Report dazzles through its high-octane action and visuals that are both gritty and fantastically futuristic, while at the same time the film thematically explores the dangerous world of pre-judgment and the quandary of pitting personal liberties and freedom of choice -- not to mention the moral, ethical, and judicial nightmare that is the notion that one may be found guilty of a crime that has yet to be committed -- against the guise of making the world a safer place. While other films similarly explore the dangers and downsides of the role of advanced technologies in futuristic settings, Minority Report proves the best of the bunch for its ability to counter the wonderfully-realized visuals of a bright and glossy utopian future world with an examination of the dark and disquieting elements that under the surface make it so, with superb special effects and exceptional actions scenes in tow to make it a complete Science Fiction picture.In the year 2054, Washington, D.C. has become one of the safest cities in the world. Premeditated murder has virtually disappeared, and crimes of passion are at an all-time low thanks to the Department of Precrime and the work of the Precogs, a trio of individuals with the capability to see future murders unfold and allow the would-be assailants to be arrested before they've had the opportunity to commit their heinous acts. The Department is headed by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a divorced man who years earlier lost his son before the arrival of the Precogs. The program having proved a rousing success in the nation's capital, it's on the verge of going national, and Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), a representative from the Attorney General's office, has arrived for one final inspection of the process. When Anderton finds himself identified by the Precogs as a would-be assailant in a future murder, he must go on the run in an effort to clear his name of a crime he has yet to commit. In the process, he becomes privy to information that could jeopardize the future of the Precrime division while unearthing further disturbing information surrounding the project's origins.Though perhaps most readily identifiable by its stunning action scenes and nearly impeccable and highly-advanced special effects, Minority Report is, at its core, a cautionary tale that, like the best of Science Fiction, incorporates ideas that may be seen as relevant today but framed within the worlds of tomorrow. Based on a story by the famed Science Fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, Minority Report tackles some hard-hitting questions about not only one possible future of the American justice system, but also the impact of highly-advanced technologies on personal liberties. Is the future set? Is there no personal choice? Is one possible outcome of an as- of-yet physically unrealized future event enough to accuse, convict, and punish a man for a crime that ultimately went uncommitted? Spielberg, through the prism of Dick's story, manages to mesh a brilliant philosophical undertone with a big-budget special effects extravaganza, the film is a rare movie going experience that manages to be both very smart and a lot of fun at the same time.Indeed, Minority Report's invigoratingly deep and incredibly well-integrated thematic structure only helps in making the picture a complete experience that delivers everything the modern movie going audience could hope for in a film such as this. The tale of the hunter becoming the hunted and suddenly forced to more personally understand what it is he's done to others and experience firsthand how the system he heretofore so enthusiastically embraced can fail when forced to look at it while on the other side of the law lends yet another added layer of tension and purpose to the film, further accentuating the questions raised throughout the story. Featuring a quality cast, Minority Report still isn't a movie that's sold by its stars. Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow don't disappear into their roles, but they do embrace them wholeheartedly and all deliver convincing performances that, again, only accentuate both the heavier themes and exciting action pieces that define the movie. Cruise is Cruise, his character not all that different than other roles he's played (his John Anderton seems at least partially reminiscent of Ethan Hunt), but the actor manages to capture the feel of the movie superbly and convey enough raw emotion in conjunction with his abilities as an Action star to play the part very well in each of its several layers of complexity. Just as importantly, the picture's special effects are not only seamless, they're cool; and in conjunction with the wonderfully-choreographed action pieces and Composer John Williams' (Star Wars) heart-racing score, Minority Report proves a wonderful movie when examined from every angle.

You give Scorsese credit here for using the young actor in a role that matches his natural persona, in contrast to others, including Spielberg, who seem to make more of the actor than there is, and a certain falseness gets in the way. But this film uses the awkwardness and naive, boyish qualities of Cruise as a sudden pool shark really well. What holds it all back? I think basically plot. I mean, it's fun to see the big hustle at play, and to get stung once or twice when things aren't what they seem. But we sort of know going in that that's the general plan, and then it happens.

It was the right genre, the perfect character, and the quintessential story for one of the American cinema's idols to finish off a succession of pictures that have since gone on to become some of the most memorable and influential works of art in history. It also featured the ideal supporting cast (many of them aging stars like Wayne himself) for the Duke to act with. Note the word 'act' in my sentences. Those who have thought of John Wayne's acting ability as hammy or over-the-top, then you best see The Shootist and ponder over your own words before you go pass judgment on one of the most talented individuals who ever worked in Hollywood. Because if Wayne's final performance is not a first-class case of acting, then neither was Vivien Leigh's portrait of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind, or Meryl Streep's gut-wrenching expressions in Sophie's Choice or Gregory Peck lecturing his children in To Kill a Mockingbird. John Wayne was no longer the tough-as-nails, brawny fighter he was in his youth and neither was his character. By contrast, he plays a famous world-weary gunfighter who upon visiting a doctor who once saved his life after a shootout (James Stewart) discovers he will die in less than two months not from a bullet, but from cancer. The dying gunfighter decides that he is going to die peacefully in a boardinghouse run by a widow (Lauren Bacall) and her rambunctious son (Ron Howard). However, some of the town's people are not so willing to let Wayne go in peace.Perhaps next to Akira Kurosawa's marvelous film Ikiru, The Shootist may be the most powerful film to tackle the subjects of cancer and, more importantly, life and death. John Wayne, as many know, had been diagnosed with cancer before making The Shootist. Although he recovered from it, he would be stricken by it again, this time fatally, after his last film and personally, I believe that Wayne knew deep down in himself while making this movie that his time was running short and you can see him pour out his heart into his performance. The result is a deeply moving portrait of a lonely, dying man whom the world never gave a chance to truly understand. Wayne does not speak (often) in his usual brass, fear-inducing tone but with a rather soft, woozy voice and his eyes constantly reflect the pain and misery that is going through his mind. Since he had first-hand experience with cancer, Wayne knew exactly how to carve this character into a three-dimensional human being.The supporting performances are absolutely fabulous. Lauren Bacall, whose husband Humphrey Bogart had also died of cancer, is compelling as the landlady who discovers she's really, in a way, tougher than the gunfighter she's reluctantly housing. Ron Howard is very good as the young kid who, not unlike Brandon DeWilde did to Alan Ladd in Shane, looks up to the gunfighter without knowing the true consequences of making your name with a weapon. There's also a terrific cameo supporting role by John Wayne's close friend James Stewart as the doctor who diagnoses him with cancer. Supporting roles also go to great names such as Hugh O'Brian, Harry Morgan, Richard Boone, and Bill McKinney as the townsmen and troublemakers who just don't want to let the poor man die in peace.The Shootist was directed by Don Siegel, and therefore the audience knows right off that they are not to be disappointed by the action scenes. But Siegel's directing is at its best in the more tender moments such as the truly tear-jerking scene where James Stewart breaks the bad news to Wayne about his health. The Shootist is not simply another rowdy Western with lots of gunfights, men swigging whiskey, and fists flying through the air. It has all of this and much more; it has a human story that touches our hearts. And most of the credit is due to the star, John Wayne, whose performance is so marvelous and three-dimensional that we instantly see him as more of a human being than we ever have before. Let's face it some of Wayne's previous roles were a little repetitive. They were, after all, written for him in the John Wayne image.

But is it all that great? Of course, that is very subjective, but for me the answer is no. Considering all the hype around this movie, I expected something far better. That said, the movie isn't bad and it's an important film.

The roots of legendary comic mastermind Charlie Chaplin's decision to lampoon looming Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler allegedly stemmed from his outraged discovery that Hitler had imitated Chaplin's own 'Little Tramp' moustache for the sake of acquiring an iconic image, provoking Chaplin to ridicule Hitler's own image in the same way he felt his own had been defiled - a fascinating case of art imitating life imitating art. And one cannot overstate the role of Chaplin's The Great Dictator, raising awareness of the atrocities of Nazi Germany to largely unaware overseas audiences as courageously as it sends up the man figure-heading the conflict. Nonetheless, there remains an interesting process of collective cultural memory in which the quality of the actual piece is considered synonymous with its historical impact or relevance, and Chaplin's wartime satire is no exception. As such, while unquestionably still a very strong film in its own right, on contemporary examination, while The Great Dictator is unquestionably one of the most important films of all time, sadly it cannot also claim the title as one of the best.While Chaplin is notorious for obsessive perfectionism, one gets the sense that with The Great Dictator his mind was more occupied with its socio-political relevance than its construction as a film. Predicated on parallelling the lives of fanatical Hitler surrogate Adenoid Hynkel and the stand-in Tramp figure, a shell-shocked Jewish barber (both played by Chaplin), the intercutting between narrative strands feels awkward and uncomfortable, both requiring too much exposition to blend seamlessly together. Equally, the film on the whole feels unnecessarily drawn out, its two hour running time consistently lagging through overextended gags (as unforgettable as the two main comedic set pieces - Hynkel impishly playing with an inflated globe and the farcical battles for dominance between Hykel and Mussolini surrogate Nappolini - are, both run past the point of remaining truly funny) and frequent patches of 'dead time' which are neither comedic nor serve to further the plot (the extended WW1 opening sequence feels largely unnecessary). Similarly, banking the narrative on a highly contrived climax (the barber being mistaken for Hynkel) makes the entire film feel somewhat forced, also detracting from the enjoyment. However, the main concern is that the film, for lack of a better term, simply isn't that funny, with the general tone pitched uncertainly between pantomime silliness and sympathetic reverence and thus functioning as neither as enjoyable or proactively poignant as it could have been.Despite the film's essential function of raising audience awareness of the devastating cruelty inflicted by the Nazis, there remains the feel of Chaplin soft-pedalling the inhumanities depicted, whether for the sake of not overly upsetting audiences or due to legal concerns, but either way lessening the film's potential impact. Equally, Chaplin's infamous ending monologue remains a source of eternal contention, yet no matter how ham-handed a disruption of the narrative or excessively saccharine, there remains a tremendous power and resonance in his earnest words, serving as a fitting message for hope in the midst of a time sorely lacking in it. Finally, the film's hefty production values (despite the discordant presence of some obviously fake sets) ably elucidates the absurd opulence of the Nazi propaganda displays in a more tastefully subtle (and thereby more effective) fashion.As with the majority of Chaplin's films, the true joy is to be found in the performance(s) of the man himself. In fact, the real shame is that Chaplin resisted the temptation to drink in his own antics more, as his Hitler impersonation is a comedic triumph, each bout of mangled German profanities, enraged flared nostrils and over-important strutting a wonder to behold, and his Jewish barber nostalgically recalls the best of the Tramp (though both characters sharing Chaplin's never before heard reedy voice feels another piece of poor planning). It comes as somewhat of a shame that Chaplin generally pitches for the obvious humour, rather than allowing for more unorthodox moments to breathe life into the picture one of the most hilarious points in the film is a throwaway moment when Hynkel, hurrying between appointments, stumbles and staggers across a sumptuously decorated hallway - an exquisite moment of slapstick belying the humanity beneath, and ultimately a more effective method of undermining Hitler's steely persona. Apart from the star's dual roles, the majority of the cast feel too sombre and straight faced to infuse much of interest into the film, though Paulette Goddard rekindles the feisty warmth and spunkiness she displayed in Modern Times and Jack Oakie appealingly tramples the scenery with a deliciously campy Mussolini impression.While more problematic as a film than its reputation suggests, Chaplin's The Great Dictator remains a timeless testament to the power and importance of satire and film's potential to function as a vehicle for urgent social commentary and information. Despite being one of the lesser Chaplin efforts as a film, its vibrant daring is one of a variety simply not attempted by contemporary cinema, making the film worth experiencing by itself.-8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Desperate times calls for desperate measures goes the saying, so it is fitting that the second world war and its concentration of some of the most inhumane atrocities in human history yielded one of cinema's most overt and audacious political satires as response.

It is refreshing to see a film where military uniforms and badges of rank are, it seems, are intended to be worn properly. In many films it seems the dresser places a Brigadier General's stars out on the sewed-down portion of the epaulet as is done with lower officer ranks. This is always incorrect. Todays Class A uniforms still offer this choice but for many services, they now have a slip-over sleeve with the rank on it that goes over the epaulet as seen on a shirt worn when the jacket is not worn, so with these, an error is not possible. In later views about twenty minutes into the film the stars were put out on the sewed-down portion of the epaulet. The dark brown dress jacket first seen at a later time also had wrong placement of the distinctive single star. It seems without constant supervision of shooting or writing out instructions, this error occurs on a General's star(s) more often than not. At about thirty-five minutes they are back, centered on the Class A dark brown top. Apparently the one who had been instructed in proper display was not always the one in charge of the uniforms. This was a sad note to see introduced into such a fine film.I am always surprised to see this because almost any military man knows this. The General's star placement is done differently for a number of reasons, one likely being that his rank, above all others, is instantly discernible even with a greater distance.Many good reviews are written about this film, I just thought the military accuracy due our serving men and women should be given the correctness the uniform deserves.It was very refreshing too, seeing Dr. Oppenheimer's driving to a location he loved and was instrumental in choosing, in that fine, perfectly restored, beautiful vintage yellow Packard convertible.I thought another comment was appropriate by this observer. Though there may not have been any physicists or other highly placed scientists of color, if one looks very carefully as I did, you will see an American of African Heritage as an attendant in an ambulance and helping load a box diagonally stenciled OAK RIDGE.Similarly, close observation shows a person of Latin heritage and a person of native American heritage. A comment and dismissal to Michael Merriman of no romantic interest with Nurse Kathleen Robinson and Dr. Schoenfield's attention directed seemingly unexplained elsewhere which may simply be to maintain professional distinction but he is never seen in the film with a woman so it might be meant to give a hint of his lack of interest in the opposite sex.I found the incorporation of these attentiveness issues to be quite appropriate given the many considerations in this film, religion notwithstanding. I also noticed a derogatory term applying to the Japanese was noticeably nearly missing and was heard used only twice, and in the Pentagon. I applaud those connected with the film for this sensitivity. It is a very commendable and often overlooked. This is a very good film with much of the physics shown accurately depicted; heard and seen in discussions. Very minimally touched upon was the major contribution made on the plutonium bomb with shaped charges designed for armor-penetrating ordinance. This and other accomplishments were much a part of the many earlier trial and error work of our British and Canadian allies though their program code named Tube Alloys. It had been going on for a much longer time actually beginning in 1939 with the French seeing the need for a moderator of the reaction, then done with heavy water. Knowledge of this by even the Germans was one of the reasons they had occupied Norway with Europe's only heavy water plant in Norsk, Norway. But the British and Canadians began with exiled German scientists in 1940, with their knowledge of many specifics. It seems our own Manhattan Project's beginning was among the last since it was known in these other countries where here it only began after it languished with a few thousand dollars funding and almost no research since Professors Szilárd and Einstein's letter to President Roosevelt in August, 1939. Even the Japanese had theorized the possibility of making an atomic bomb many years previously in 1934. Historically interesting was Einstein's unspoken thought that the process leading to making a destructive device such as a bomb, never even occurred to him. Thankfully, German scientist's religion had effectively doomed Germany's progress toward making a bomb.I was very impressed with John Cusak's willingness to see accuracy shown; submitting to the loss of much of his hair for reality in the film. Though as a physician I was quite upset showing his intense suffering though this may have been done to make a point. I would hope that one so massively destroyed with radiation would have had most of the extreme suffering removed with the adequate use of morphine. These scenes do have a basis in reality with unnamed hero, Armenian-heritage Harry K. Daghlian, Jr. during necessary testing, accidentally causing what is called a nuclear excursion when he dropped near critical-mass pieces together which required him to use and expose his ungloved hands to separate the then critical mass nuclear components and expose his whole body to the massively fatal radiation source. In 1946 Louis Slotin also died of a similar accident and these are mentioned in this review principally to show the testing in uncharted territory and done with the crudest of methods as shown very accurately in the film, using just a screwdriver.Many perspectives and the fantastic development of its story and its telling are of the highest order not often seen in a film.

It had been going on for a much longer time actually beginning in 1939 with the French seeing the need for a moderator of the reaction, then done with heavy water. Knowledge of this by even the Germans was one of the reasons they had occupied Norway with Europe's only heavy water plant in Norsk, Norway. But the British and Canadians began with exiled German scientists in 1940, with their knowledge of many specifics. It seems our own Manhattan Project's beginning was among the last since it was known in these other countries where here it only began after it languished with a few thousand dollars funding and almost no research since Professors Szilárd and Einstein's letter to President Roosevelt in August, 1939. Even the Japanese had theorized the possibility of making an atomic bomb many years previously in 1934. Historically interesting was Einstein's unspoken thought that the process leading to making a destructive device such as a bomb, never even occurred to him. Thankfully, German scientist's religion had effectively doomed Germany's progress toward making a bomb.I was very impressed with John Cusak's willingness to see accuracy shown; submitting to the loss of much of his hair for reality in the film. Though as a physician I was quite upset showing his intense suffering though this may have been done to make a point. I would hope that one so massively destroyed with radiation would have had most of the extreme suffering removed with the adequate use of morphine. These scenes do have a basis in reality with unnamed hero, Armenian-heritage Harry K. Daghlian, Jr. during necessary testing, accidentally causing what is called a nuclear excursion when he dropped near critical-mass pieces together which required him to use and expose his ungloved hands to separate the then critical mass nuclear components and expose his whole body to the massively fatal radiation source. In 1946 Louis Slotin also died of a similar accident and these are mentioned in this review principally to show the testing in uncharted territory and done with the crudest of methods as shown very accurately in the film, using just a screwdriver.Many perspectives and the fantastic development of its story and its telling are of the highest order not often seen in a film. It gets high marks from me.

Once again we have Toshiro Mifune playing that anonymous, sword-wielding ronin without a name (the inspiration for Clint Eastwood's iconic character The Man with No Name) caught up in a struggle between two sides. However, this time he is jumping sides not between greedy town bosses, but a corrupt superintendent and a group of brave but reckless clansmen trying to rescue hostages from the enemy. And just like before, we have ecstatic excitement, lots of action scenes with surprisingly commendable saber duels, fantastic performances, witty dialogue, and a truly thunderous climax at the end.Sanjuro is just one step below Yojimbo perhaps because Kurosawa did not originally intend to make a sequel to the said film and it is a very difficult challenge to build the second piece of the saga puzzle and make it equal to the first, let alone better. But just because it is not on the level of a masterpiece like Yojimbo does not mean it's not a heck of a lot of fun, because it is.There is not one moment in Sanjuro that I did not enjoy. Toshiro Mifune's flawless acting coupled with Akira Kurosawa's one-of-a-kind direction takes a story that might otherwise seem kind of silly and makes it into an entirely plausible period piece as far as the human mind is concerned. And what's truly enjoyable is the fact that Kurosawa does not simply have one action scene after another. Again, he builds a solid narrative in which surprises and ideas are introduced for the audience. We like the ronin, but we identify most with the petrified, confused clansmen who aren't really sure which side Mifune is on. So when he pulls a tactic, we wonder with obfuscation along with them.In short, Sanjuro is yet another tremendous entertaining opus from the master Akira Kurosawa. While it's not standing on the same tier as Yojimbo or some of Kurosawa's other films, it is a really enjoyable thrill ride. And the final climax, where Toshiro Mifune once again goes eye to eye with Tatsuya Nakadai is really, well, explosive.

The church-burnings and lynchings had been going on since the early 20th century and climaxed under Eisenhauer, Kennedy and Johnson. The happy ending was the signing of civil rights legislation by President Johnson, although many people paid a high price for this goal, some with their lives.Mississippi Burning is loosely based on the investigation of three civil rights workers who disappeared while attempting to cross the Nebraska-Mississippi border in June of 1964. (Their bodies were eventually found in a hay stack, and their car was retrieved from a swamp.) Their crime attempting to register Black and ethnic voters in the state of Mississippi. Most of the events, save for aspects of the investigation, have been largely fictionalized. However, the events as portrayed do well to paint a landscape of distrust and violence stemming from racial hatred and intolerance that was still prevalent in the deep south at that time. Federal agents, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman in tour-de-four Oscar-caliber performances, enter into what appears to be a mini-civil war. Members of the KKK and other supremacist groups run the town and surrounding area like a demilitarized zone in which white males hold all political power and keep blacks in living conditions that would give Auschwitz a run for its money.

(Of course the arsonists also regarded themselves as Christians, but that's a whole other subject.) Law enforcement turns a blind eye to these heinous acts since they are in cahoots with the segregationists.Much of the film chronicles the federal investigation which reveals that the disappearance of the young men is just a tip-of-the-iceberg of racially-motivated brutality and violence maintained by a complex infrastructure designed to keep blacks and other ethnic minorities in their place. Happiness as defined by the quote at the beginning of this review basically means living in squalor and fear with no hope of improvement.

The African-Americans are in a no-win situation. Swift violence is inflicted upon them if they protest, but it also occurs without provocation. The racists literally get away with murder largely because they can. The film implies that these white supremacists burned several churches and homes during the course of about 2 weeks in the rural town of Meridian, Mississippi, probably excessive even by KKK standards.

That was seven years ago, and three years after this Erin Brockovich film was released, so it has been out for ten years in total and I finally sat down to watch it from start to finish this month. Even though it took years for this to happen, and I don't think I was expecting to be able to give it a rating higher than 7\/10, this 2000 drama certainly didn't fail to grab me. I guess my expectations were slightly surpassed, since I'm giving it an 8.Erin Brockovich is a single mother who has been married and divorced twice and is now desperately searching for employment, but is having no luck, lacking the experience required for the jobs she applies for. After a failed lawsuit against a doctor who crashed into her car on the road and left her injured, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry, to give her a job at his law firm to make up for the loss of the case. She gets to work for Masry as a clerk in his office, but her revealing attire and aggressive demeanor lead to conflict in the workplace. After getting this job, it isn't long before she begins to investigate a real estate case involving the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in Hinkley, California. She soon discovers that the company is responsible for the contamination of the water in this town! The hexavalent chromium that they dump is going into the town's water system, leading to serious health problems for the townspeople, and PG&E has been lying about it! This leads Brockovich and her law firm into a challenging fight against a multi-billion dollar corporation to try and bring them to justice!I'm can't remember exactly what my thoughts were as I watched this film seven years ago, but when I started watching it this month, it didn't look so great at the beginning with the job interview, but it quickly improves, perhaps starting with the part where the lawsuit fails. For the rest of the film, it's very intriguing for the most part as we watch the protagonist attempting to put an end to PG&E's crime against the people of Hinkley, and the problems she faces with her kids, her boyfriend George, her boss, and others. The film can be somewhat moving at times with scenes involving seriously ill Hinkley residents. Julia Roberts does a decent job playing the protagonist, even if her performance is not amazing, and I don't know exactly what the real Erin Brockovich is like, but the movie version of her is a short-tempered and often rude individual who also proves that she is caring and clever. Albert Finney also stands out as Ed Masry. He's an English actor and does a great American accent here. Not everything about this film is perfect, there is some fairly weak dialogue and maybe some unconvincing parts, but apart from that, I can't complain much when it comes to the film's quality.Since this is a movie based on a true story (there's even a cameo appearance from the real Erin Brockovich-Ellis as a waitress named Julia), it doesn't surprise me that there has been controversy over how accurate it is, and some people have trashed the film for its inaccuracies, some of which I have read about. I really don't have much to say about this, but at the beginning, it does say it's BASED ON a true story, it doesn't say it IS a true story. Even if this biopic is very inaccurate, it's still a very effective and memorable film. With all the language, it's not family-friendly, and all the swearing, a lot of it coming from Julia Roberts in the lead role, is apparently the reason for the film's R rating. There are also adults who can't stand constant profanity in movies, and if you're one of them, Erin Brockovich is not for you, either.

The picture's numerous flashback scenes work well to establish the beginnings of Don Corleone's rise to power, and Robert de Niro's portrayal of the young Vito effectively allow us to forget about asking why Marlon Brando didn't show up even once. Pacino is no longer the fresh faced kid home from the military who takes up the family business, but the brooding, brutal leader of a crime syndicate with a chessboard strategy of staying two and three steps ahead of his enemies at all times.If you haven't seen the movie in a long time, you might be surprised like I was while watching today. It's easy to recall the highlights like Frank Pentangeli's courtroom scene and subsequent suicide, and the way Fredo met his timely demise. What I had long forgotten was the way the picture opens with the Sicilian back story, and the way the New York neighborhood flashback thread literally runs throughout the entire picture. It's funny how I recall those scenes as a single sequence leading up to the murder of Don Fanucci, but it just goes to show you how faulty memory can be.You know, it's hard to believe that the first two Godfather movies are nearing the forty year mark since their original release.

O'Hara comes into a room and says to Bogart, playing a disaffected American, Why do you always make jokes about my name, huh? In Chile the name of O'Hara is, is a tip top name. Many Germans in Chile have become to be called O'Hara.And so there is a dig at a lot of stereotypes, most of them with shades of truth. The style of the film is not film noir, as many people say, but more just an intrigue or war time spy film. The most direct connection seems to be Huston's own Maltese Falcon, but even this is based on Bogart and Lorre appearing in both films (as well as a fun appearance in Beat the Devil by Robert Morely doing a kind of less pleasant Sidney Greenstreet). I sensed a lot of direct influence from Lady from Shanghai, an overlooked and frankly brilliant and daring Orson Welles film from a few years earlier. Check out the slightly surreal plot, the strange sequences of locations (land, boat, land, with an exotic overture in the middle), and the characters themselves, including Jennifer Jones as a kind of decorative female not unlike Rita Hayworth in Shanghai. There is even a man-to-man discussion of Heyworth in Beat the Devil between Bogart and a unlikely Muslim captor in a generally hilarious scene.The film is flawed by its own excesses at times, and by a kind of frivolousness that Welles, for one, avoided by making his film's excesses more formal and less literary. Huston, like Bogart, was literate by nature, as a lot of heavy drinking men were in those days, and the dialog, as brilliant as it is (and shepherded along by Huston and Truman Capote in tandem), isn't always in synch with the acting, and with the flow of events. So if we don't really expect anything from the plot, per se, knowing it's all just in fun, we come to expect more from the series of remarks, the twists of fate, and the yawning expectations of an audience used to very high quality writing and acting by 1953.I know some people who just can't finish watching this because it strikes them as phony and childish. Bogart might agree--he lost money on the production. But there are some great moments, and an ongoing repartee that works well, or works superbly, at different moments. I'd cash out a couple of actors for others more idiosyncratic, I think. But no one asked me, I know. Watch it for what it is. And check out Lady from Shanghai and see if you see what I mean.

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? Imitation of Life? Superfly? Now, name ONE film ever made with even ONE white character, that wasn't also exploitive. Psycho? Denigrates matricidal caucasian closet queens. Ben-Hur? Stereotypes Jews and Christians. Tyler Perry's 'Madea' ? Don't ask.The notion that Disney's Song of the South fosters negative black stereotypes fails at first glance. Does it reflect stereotypes? Of course. Foster? No. It's popular entertainment of its day.It was made 65 years ago. 81 years after the Civil War. Or, from our present, nearly a century and a half after the film's period.The truth of this film? It was SUBVERSIVE, for its day, in its casual depiction of warm friendships and loves between a young white boy and blacks. Particularly an old black story-telling man. The only sympathetic white character (besides child-stars Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patton) is Lucile Watson as Granny -- the identical exploitive stereotypical role she played in The Women.ALL the blacks in Song of the South are wonderful and wise and ever-ready to shuck and jive for the grownups, but so what? They're STILL wonderful-er and wiser than 98% of the white cast. And the two white-kid leads (and we) know it.So enough of the criticism of Song of the South on historically myopic racist grounds.You tell me Who's the worst stereotype? Uncle Remus or Blacula?Disney's 1946 Song of the South broke new technical ground for cinema as the first full-length combination of live action and animation.It broke FAR more important (and subversive) ground as the first mainstream (and color film, ironically) with a black lead. SO subversive was building a major motion picture around a black lead that nobody ever mentioned it at the time. Or much since.But there it is. James Baskett delivering Uncle Remus (AND additional character voices) -- and some of the most clichéd and simplistic dialogue ever written -- with all the natural ease and compelling nuance of an Olivier. Without Uncle Remus -- without the lead -- there's no picture.Without James Baskett this collective historic artistic achievement wouldn't exist.Walt Disney knew exactly what he was doing here, in shaping and casting this film. Giving Hattie McDaniel something extra to do to showcase her talents (the Sooner or Later ditty). Hiring the wondrous Bobby Driscoll to register deeper and truer emotions than any child actor of his era.In the end?

The Crying Game starts off as a tragic IRA story, but then evolves into something else and, before the 112 minutes are over, the plot changes again. Unlike the typical Hollywood film where you can predict how a story line will develop, it is impossible to figure out what is going to happen next in The Crying Game - and that is one of the great things about this movie. The other brilliant thing about this film are the characters, especially Fergus (Stephen Rea) and Dil (Jaye Davidson), who evolve and develop over the course of this film. Neil Jordan could have made a film with static characters like James Cameron did with True Lies or Stephen Spielberg did with The Indiana Jones series. But Jordan chose not do that. Instead he wanted to make a movie about people faced with difficult and quite unexpected personal crises and show how they evolve, or fail to evolve, to cope with these challenges. I have not ventured too deeply into the plot, because The Crying Game is not the kind of film that can be properly explained in a review. The Crying Game has to be seen more than once for it to be properly understood and the understanding of this film cannot be conveyed in a review, but rather can only result from a person experiencing it for himself or herself. Rather than me telling you (the readers) what to think about The Crying Game, the best thing is to see the movie and decide for yourselves what this film is all about and how you feel about it.

I didn't just spend time watching this movie from beginning to end, did I?

It's a common cliché to say if I could give less than one star I would but I look at my one star and I can't see what it's doing there. This would-be comedy of a guy who inexplicably gets together with a woman who inexplicably has an obsession to get married is an utter waste of time for any citizen of the world. Played by French Stewart and Bridgitte Wilson - neither of whom can act, I quickly discovered (and then they're still too good for this screenplay) - this couple is the kind of characters only invented as an excuse to, for some reason, tell a story that amounts to nothing. Rarely have I seen such unoriginal dead jokes and unfunny, miscalculated attempts at comedy. I guess I was baffled by the movie's complete nothingness.

Silent film or not, Nosferatu will bring chills up and down your spine. The performance of Max Schreck reveals his attention to detail as one of the original method actors.The movie opens on a town bathed in sepia tones coupled with flute-like sounds wrapped in semi-upbeat music. This is Ellen and Hutter's hopeful theme. Hutter presents his beautiful wife with freshly picked flowers upon her asking why did he kill them? We are faced almost immediately with foreshadowing of what's to come. Sepia tones continue with Knock proposing to Hutter the idea of making a pretty penny with selling the house across the street.As Hutter gets ready to travel to meet Count Orlock, Ellen's face at the doorway is filled with concern, and then they embrace with a kiss. The film then alternates between blue and sepia hues upon his journey, with a showing of dogs on the path. The joy and innocence exuding from Butter's face reminds me of Begnini's spirit throughout the 1997 movie Life is Beautiful. The ending share similar qualities, too.The music changes to deeply ominous, foreboding tones of the didgeridoo, coupled with intermittent dissonant long tones. Then the original melody is sped up to signify the impending nighttime when unnatural deeds occur. After Butter crosses the bridge into the pass, he is met by a carriage driven by a character emulating Count Orlock. The horses are even shrouded to cover their hideous sights. Then Butter meets up with Count Orlock who tells him that it is late and his servants are asleep. There is even a reddish scene. .....wonder what this means for later.End of Act 1.So much about this movie screams MASTERPIECE! Sound, lighting, color, makeup, thematic melodies, graininess of the film, and acting. I haven't seen enough silent films to compare, but for me Nosferatu hit all the right chords, figuratively and literally. The only complaint, and it's very superficial, is that the music had similar qualities of the synthesized tones from the early computer video game King's Quest, oddly enough.
