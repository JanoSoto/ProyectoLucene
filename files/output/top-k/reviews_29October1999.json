","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"29 October 1999","score":"","review":"  The main characters Mark and Robert are pop culture trivia nuts, science fiction fans, and in particular Star Trek fans. They're almost thirty, and spend much of their time watching old movies, collecting action figures and comic books, and (in a refreshing contrast to most movie geeks) attractive and bouncing between relationships with women. Mark's part of the story is a coming-of-age story, even though he's such a geek that his coming-of-age doesn't happen until he's about 30. Robert's part of the story is a romantic comedy that starts when he finds his ideal match.Mark is hard-working, financially well-off, but is afraid of commitment with women. His relationships are mostly with women he finds annoying, so he doesn't have to worry about falling hard enough to worry about commitment.Robert is a financial mess, putting his collecting ahead of basics like utilities and rent. Although he's more grown up in his relationships with women than Mark, he falls in love with women almost too quickly. They find him likeable, but are quickly driven off by his trivia obsession and financial irresponsibility. But finally he meets Claire, in a comic book store. She's just as beautiful as the other women Robert had been involved with, but she shares his pop culture interests. She's his perfect match, but still troubled by his money problems. In addition, his friends become jealous of the time he spends with her.The movie is loaded with pop culture references, which are amusing whether you get them or not. When I knew what they were talking about, I thought, what a geek I am to remember that stuff. When I didn't know what they were talking about, I could feel sympathy for the women characters who were baffled by their trivia-spouting.The title isn't a reference to business, but rather the Star Trek starship Enterprise. The main characters' hero is Star Trek captain Kirk, who always prevailed and always got the women. When presented with a dilemma, they often deal with it by asking themselves, What would captain Kirk do?William Shatner appears in the movie, mainly as himself. But in an introductory scene, Shatner appears as Kirk, when one of the main characters (as a boy, 19 years earlier) is being beaten up by a bully for going to school in a Star Trek uniform. Captain Kirk is the boy's imaginary friend, and inspires him (with words more in character with the Shatner caricature) to beat up the bully who had just beaten him nearly senseless.As himself, Shatner plays a caricature of his public image, somewhat self-absorbed, both annoyed and amused by those who confuse him with his characters, but also troubled by self-doubt. He wants to make a musical Julius Caesar where he plays all the characters except Calpurnia. His performance is excellent throughout. If he really was as egotistical as the movie caricature, he would never have agreed to the part.Mark is the first one of the main characters to turn thirty, and he's deeply troubled by that fact. Possible mild spoiler He has a nightmare inspired by the unintentionally corny 1976 movie Logan's Run, where people live in a utopia until they're euthanized at age 30. Even his nightmares are somewhat geeky. Near the end, the gang takes Mark to a screening of a Star Trek movie for his dreaded thirtieth birthday.How the movie arrives at its conclusion, which includes Shatner's advertised musical Julius Caesar performance, is too much a spoiler to include, even with a warning.I want to see this movie again. But not so many times that I can recite all the lines.
