The animation in those films is infinitely better. Heck, even Small Soldiers surpassed this one by thousands of miles. I would rather watch Toy Story 2 a hundred times than watch five minutes of Shrek's dreck one more time. Also, if you have even seen the briefest clip of Final Fantasy The Spirits Within, the so-called realistic animation of Shrek looks as much like a cartoon as the human characters from Pokemon. Heck, even the characters from Toy Story look more like human beings than the characters of Shrek, AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOYS!Shrek is obviously going to have one of the highest grosses of the year, if not the highest.

The film is stunning visually, and the humor is like that of the Warner Brothers or Jay Ward - delightful spoofs.Now, don't take me wrong. I love certain Disney productions, most of which were made in the 40s (Pinocchio, Bambi, Dumbo, Fantasia). But the studio's talent for storytelling has faded and is encroached on more and more every year by the demand to provide stunning visuals over the true essence of good cinema stories. Shrek, as unlikely a candidate as it struck me as before seeing it, has these things. The animation, although entirely computer generated (anyone else intimidated by the fact that the most enjoyable American animated films of the past few years have all been CGI?) is realistic and believable, but what really knocked my socks off was the appeal Shrek has that can be channeled both to adults and children, and yes, adolescents like myself. Some of the gags are more fun than others, such as the sharp wit of the dialogue being more enjoyable to me than the title character wiping his posterior with a page from a book, but this only demonstrates the film's ability to articulate its audience's interests.Our characters are rather simple, really A pessimistic, lonesome (but in denial) ogre voiced by Mike Myers who lives out in a swamp, an obscenely talkative donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy, a diminutive, egotistical, one-dimensional lord of the kingdom of Duloc named Farquaad and an isolated-until-freed-by-Shrek-princess named Fiona with an overly melodramatic way of handling things, a minor attitude problem, and the ability to kill birds with her terribly high singing ala Snow White but simply not so.Farquaad's rounding up fairy-tale critters to make room and they subsequently run for haven in Shrek's swamp. We meet, along the way, the three bears, the three blind mice, the three pigs, the wolf in grandmother's clothes, the fairy Godmother, Peter Pan, Pinocchio, the Magic Mirror (who provides Farquaad with his choices for a future wife ala the Dating Game), the Gingerbread Man, The seven dwarves and countless others (look out for a hilarious musical number by someone named Monsieur Hood as he tries to woo Fiona with his merry men). The film's production unit obviously spent more time on the main four characters than others - some of the lesser characters and background people look without much in the line of experession or detail, but this is a forgivable sin in the animation industry given how much crap is released annually with character designs devoid of any style whatsover.The choice of music, mainly Smashmouth and the Monkees, in some way or another, isn't too fitting, but it's also forgivable. Abandoning such superficialities as character designs, choice of music and detail in animation, I repeat, we have a good story with good dialogue and uproarious humor here. One of the best films of the year unquestionably.Now, why can't we figure out how to make traditionally animated films that are as much fun as SHREK or the TOY STORY films on a regular basis?

That is much lower than I would have expected, and I may be being generous. You know how I am. I wasn't even hugely excited, and I was still disappointed.I'm going to have a hard time discussing the movie without going through the whole plot. Once you see it, I'll be glad to talk with you about it. Basically, the problem with this movie is it never figures out what its point is. It jumps from conflict to conflict, yet never seems to link them thematically coherently. I also had a very nagging problem about Henry Swinton's sudden, unexplained character change (in my eyes, he does an about-face on an issue incredibly drastically). Also, it has a Kubrick ending. The last half hour of any Kubrick ending breaks away from the rest of the movie and makes no sense.Let me regroup.Ostensibly, the movie is nothing more than a futuristic look at Pinocchio. It owes a huge debt to it, and the movie features the story prominently. David obviously wants to become a real boy. He is the first artificially intelligent robot programmed to love. This concept presents many conflicts. What is love? What does it mean to program love into a robot? If a robot can love a human, can a human love a robot? Is an artificially intelligent being considered real? Do they have rights? Are they citizens? What does it mean to be human? What is the meaning of life? Will artificial intelligence ultimately destroy us? The problem with the movie is it can't figure out what to focus on, and therefore tries to focus on everything, thereby creating a disjointed storyline where characters disappear, plotlines don't resolve, and themes bounce around but don't cohere, lessening the overall effect. Everything feels like a plot device. And the ending, as I said, comes out of *nowhere*. I was prepared for the movie to end; I was even preparing my mental evaluation of the ending, because it satisfied me to some extent. Then an extra half hour of Kubrick materializes.What is good about this film? As you would expect, Haley Joel Osment is excellent. His excessive makeup gives him a look not quite human and his robotic voice is incredibly convincing. He has not blinking down to an art. Jude Law is very good as well. I liked John Williams' score, especially because he worked with some techno in a couple scenes, which was interesting. The special effects are amazing. All the robots are very, very realistic. Kudos to whoever worked on them, animatronics and effects. Also, just like the disappointing *Shrek* had its Gingerbread Man, who I felt should get his own movie, *A.I.* has Teddy. Every single scene with Teddy is a scene worth watching. Teddy plain rocks. I want Teddy.All in all, the movie is still worth watching as a whole to at least see the concepts presented, even if they're not handled very well. It's not terrible, though extremists would call it that. Most of the critical reviews have been mixed, and as my score indicates, such opinions are valid. It is a very problematic movie. Much of the time I was thinking, the game is so much better. Much more complex and interesting. But the game is not only completely immersive, but also spanning months and a whole different type of media. It would be very hard to make a movie of the game and do it justice, although, God, I would see it if someone did.Final judgment 6.1 and a half. Worth watching, but don't expect too much.
