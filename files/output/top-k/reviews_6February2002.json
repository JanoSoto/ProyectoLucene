My opinion is that the studio should have shelved this movie and it will suffer from comparison with what we have been through.It was truly painful to watch this film.  Arnold Schwartzenegger and the other actors do a good job, but the subject material -- a fireman who loses his wife and child to a terrorist bombing -- is just too difficult for this time in our history. It's difficult to imagine that the studio thought this film would EVER be acceptable. Even hardened critics in the audience winced at the similarities to what we have endured -- the bad guys, although supposedly of Colombian extraction -- look a lot like the Middle Eastern men whose pictures we have seen over and over again -- sans the turbans. Honestly, I don't know how good the box office for this movie will be. Maybe die-hard action movie buffs will go to it, but I cannot recommend this movie to my audience -- not because it is terrible, but because it is not entertainment in my mind.

A lot of you will think that a '10' is a too high of a rating.  I know it's not a landmark movie about computers, the Internet, technology, etc. and it does have some plot holes.  The reason I gave it a 10 is for entertainment and for Sandra Bullock.  I'm a huge fan of Sandra.  Some of the plot elements are far fetched.  But, the main idea of people using technology to control things is not a bad idea.  I don't think that idea is that far out there. A good number of people have given this movie a hard time about its representation of some technology.  This is not a documentary on technology or a learning program.  The reason things seemed to happen unnaturally fast (especially for 1995) is that the movie makers have to fit everything within a couple of hours.

This is an event that no one cared about when it happened.  Vietnam was an event that the majority of Americans didn't care about and it took the U.S. years to commit themselves to WWII.  But now when you watch films made by Americans all you get to see is events that surround these times that are told through their eyes.  And I guess that only makes sense when you are spending millions of dollars making the film and more millions marketing it.  I mean, who would want to see a film where another country either does more than the U.S. does or at least helps them out?  You can look at one of the great AMERICAN War films like Saving Private Ryan for example and poke holes in the entire beginning of the film ( were the Americans really the only ones on the beaches of Normandy?)  But Hollywood can make jingoism like this and sell it to their patriots because this is what everyone wants to see.  Rocky Balboa is not only spoke of with reverence as a character, he symbolizes the great American struggle, the good guy vs. the bad guy, the underdog vs. the favourite, David vs. Goliath.  Black Hawk Down is a film that I'm sure has many accuracies to them, but you can't tell me that this is the whole story.  We only get to hear things from an American point of view.  That is always how it is.  And that is fine, again, is any true patriotic, flag waving American going to want to see a film where the Americans aren't the heroes?  Even though they are the big bad Americans, for some reason it is prudent for film makers to present them as the underdogs, the Davids, the Rockys.  Now think about it, how funny is that?I mention this in utter futility because I am Canadian and I realize I will never understand the true spirit of what it is like to be American so this film perhaps is not really made for me.  But when people comment that a film like this is unflinching in it's realism because it shows us how the government betrayed it's soldiers and this is why so many died that day.  Well here's a news flash for all of you.  That theory has been going around for years and this is the not the first film to suggest that.  But when it is mentioned in popcorn movies like Rambo, people just brush it off like it is just good entertainment.  But mention it in Black Hawk Down and it all of a  sudden becomes some hidden dogmatic like piece of information that we have never heard before ( let the soldiers do what they do best and all is right with the world, but once the politicians get involved, it is FUBAR).  Does this sound familiar?  I think Chuck Norris even had that theory in Missing In Action. I do not really want to say to much more about this film.  It served it's purpose, especially in the wake of 911.  But it is films like this that upset the rest of the world at times because although this is an accurate depiction of what happened on the streets of Somalia, it is not a true depiction of why the U.S. was there and this is a microcosm of how sometimes the U.S. sticks it's nose into everyone elses business and how sometimes it can go wrong.  But as one of the characters in Mississppi Burning said Your in Mississippi now, the rest of the world don't mean s**t.  I'm sure that is how most Americans feel about the rest of the world.

I admit that the early sound version, ie. the first English dub, was pretty poor, but the new 2001 version is excellent.As far as technical aspects the animation is flawless (2 years of frame by frame animation cells), the colors are vivid and life-like, and, even though it was made in 1988, it still has an aura of the present inherent within it. The musical score is probably one of the best I've ever heard.  It is the kind of music that you can listen to without the necessity of context (that is you can appreciate the music without ever seeing the movie).This is just one of those movies you can watch, say Wow, and then watch again.

Spoilers are in the summaries.HIGHLANDER  Great original story with a beginning and an ending.  Immortals appear to originate from mystical or religious beginning.  It is never fully explained which is nice.  Each viewer can use their belief system to fill in the gaps.  The Kurgon was an original over the top villain.  Excellent and beautiful filming of Scotland.  This film never felt as though it were shot on a stage.  Awesome sound track by Queen.  Once Connor won the Prize the viewer was left to draw his\/her own conclusions as to how he would use the Prize to better the world.  All in all this film was about as close to perfect as one is likely to get in the SciFi\/Fantasy world.HIGHLANDER 2  This film sucks on almost every level.  Gone is the mystical religious origin of immortals.  Now they are either aliens from another planet or immortals that can use science to travel through time, depending on which version of this film you watch.  Gone is the beautiful scenery and in comes the BATMAN THE MOVIE type sets.  General  Katana is an unoriginal rip off of Kurgon.  The  wife Connor married at the end of the first movie dies of a plague.  For the second time Connor wins the Prize and in doing so changes the premise of the story from there can be only one to there will always be at least one more.  This film reused the first movies sound track and it didn't fit the film.  Basically, this movie was as bad as the first one was good.HIGHLANDER-The Series  I only caught the show occasionally.  It further destroys the the concept of the original movie.  However if you can somehow not compare it to the first movie it it was a good tv show.  The series premier had another Kurgon rip off villain, Quince, but the following episodes had more original and diverse villains.  In my opinion Duncan MacLeod was a pale rip off of Conor MacLeod.  I follow the movies more than the series but as I understand it if you follow the series H-4 will make more sense.HIGHLANDER 3  An obvious attempt to eradicate the damage done by H-2 to the highlander story line.  However, once again there is a Kurgon rip off for a villain.  Kane is an over the top evil immortal that offers nothing new.  This film tries to bring back the mystical and religious feel to the film and somewhat succeeds.  Connor's wife from the end of the first film now dies in a car accident.  It is never explained how she returned from the dead to die from the plague in H-2.  Connor has an adopted son that is never mentioned in H-4.  Connor goes through another love interest.  For someone who in the original movie did not like getting into relationships with mortals, Connor gets more women than James West or Captain Kirk.  On the plus side Loreena Mckennitt's song BONNY PORTMORE is put to good use in this film.  All in all a good attempt at restoring the story line but it fails.HIGHLANDER 4  The final nail in the coffin.  A lame villain who is less menacing than any of the other film villains leaves Connor no choice other than to have Duncan kill him and then Duncan with Connor's spirit can beat this villain.  Hogwash!!  In H-3 Connor acquired the ability to cast illusions.  In H-4 he evidently decides not to use this ability.  Duncan now takes over as the only Highlander left to carry the franchise.  This may have been a good call.  Lambert, although only 2 years older than Paul looks 10 years older.  I don't think he could keep portraying an immortal.  Anyway, this film is all over the place.  It brings back people and places from other movies and the tv shows and ultimately ends up one big contrived mess.  Do these writers have a clue as to what made the original movie work?  I think not!Lastly, I love the first film and because of that I wast time and money viewing it's sequels.  This franchise is beginning to look like the Star Trek franchise.  What's next, HIGHLANDER-THE NEXT GENERATION?
