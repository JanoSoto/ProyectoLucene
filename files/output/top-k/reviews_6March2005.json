[{"date":"6 March 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" PECKER Aspect ratio 1.851Sound format Dolby DigitalThe life of an aspiring Baltimore photographer (Edward Furlong) is turned upside down when his neighborhood snap-shots are embraced by the New York Art-set.John Waters takes a satirical swipe at the bubble-headed Art world in this low-profile entry, which adheres closely to the template established in his earlier 'mainstream' works (HAIRSPRAY, CRY-BABY, etc.). Waters' own screenplay includes a wide assortment of eccentric characters, engaged in an uneasy truce with conservative doomsayers who cluck loudly from the sidelines, and he paints the mix in vivid colors, providing a unique visual backdrop for cartoon-like performances which teeter precariously on the brink of caricature. Furlong and co-star Christina Ricci are blank but charming, an 'ordinary' couple who retreat into anonymity as their lives are consumed by the demands of those around them Furlong's naive parents (Mary Kay Place and Mark Joy), fag-hag sister (Martha Plimpton), sugar-addicted brat sibling (Lauren Hulsey), and the Art crowd who live in their own little world, far removed from everyday reality (their reaction when forced to travel from New York to Baltimore is priceless!). Amusing rather than laugh out loud funny, the movie will divide viewers from the outset; die-hard fans of this director's worldview, however, will be bowled over by his daring.
