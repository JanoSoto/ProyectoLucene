However, at least I must like it... whatever it is.It's a story which doesn't really fit easily into any particular genre. It's not really thrilling enough to be a thriller. It doesn't have any element of a 'who-dun-it' as every death is pretty much self explanatory and there's certainly no action in it. Perhaps the best category &#x96; if this IS even a category &#x96; is 'serial killer' film... as there are plenty of bodies piling up here and there.It's about a man &#x96; Clay, played by Joaquin Phoenix &#x96; who just seems to attract death and destruction all around him. He can't seem to go a day in his small American town without someone he knows getting killed &#x96; normally horribly. And this trend is set to get worse when he meets Lester, played by (a slim) Vince Vaughn, who also seems to just want to kill pretty much everyone in his way.What follows isn't your average story. There are no 'damsels in distress' who conveniently need to be rescued in the final act. And, talking of final acts, there isn't the traditional stand-off between hero and villain in some dramatic place, like the top of a high-rise building. Perhaps that's why the film has such an odd feel to it. It doesn't really conform to any sort of blueprint. You just follow the lives of these &#x96; murderous &#x96; characters and see where it takes you.If you like the sound of that, you should get something out of this film. It has the feel of a film-maker's early work where he's still allowed enough freedom not to conform to every Hollywood convention. However, a word of caution, if you're looking for 'relatable' characters then you probably won't find any here. All of them, even Clay, are hardly the sort of people you'd want to hang around with.

It's definitely one of the more adult animes I've ever seen, and I'm a huge fan of those. I love animes with dark and gritty themes that explore the realms of fantasy, which this film has covered.When a prince from a village is infected with a curse by a demon, he must travel to the West to find a cure, only to find a war being waged between the Gods of the forest\/San, the wolf woman of the forest, and the mining town of Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi.Although the themes are centered around the environment, it doesn't include the typical man is evil message from every other Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas film. Lady Eboshi is likable and reasonable. San is strong willed and protective of the forest, but she has her own faults as well. It's simply about getting over differences when both sides are at fault. It's more about controlling hate and willing to compromise to keep the peace. Even though some of the dialogue kind of forces it in your face, it's still a natural feeling in the end.The animation is fantastic. The lighting and colors are elegant, and the camera angles on certain scenes is stunning. The animation in Miyazaki's films have stylistically evolved over the course of his career, and it shows.The film has a strong emphasis on fantasy. Although it takes itself very realistically and adult, the forest elements involving spirits are not only beautiful, but very powerfully introduced and used. With that said, the fighting scenes are incredibly realistic and entertaining to no end, mostly because of the amazing animation that goes with it.The story is told very quickly, sidestepping when necessary and getting right down to things, which is what I love about it. It doesn't drag, it's long, but very entertaining. There's no bs in this film whatsoever.It's a must see, there's nothing else to say.

The music is some of the most incredible I have heard for a film. I read so many people asking the stupidest questions why did the lady parole doctor not turn her in? If you were not able to read between the lines, I'll help you out. As Joanna is not able to really have a regular, trusting relationship with a man, it makes perfect sense that she and this woman were lovers. Not to mention all the Sapphic hints that were thrown about when the doc was in the film. Genevieve Bujold was BREATHTAKING in her scenes. A powerhouse, that lady. So, when she and Joanna spot each other in the diner, that is why the tears and rush of emotion that they had to keep in check came from. Joanna kills because it sustains her. Robbing wealthy men allows her to maintain a lifestyle that also helps her stay ahead of the law. She is also able to act out her anger and frustrations toward the father that abandoned her on them. The Eye is just pathetic. Emotionally wounded, weak, mousy man too unsure of himself to just step up and do anything definitive. He feels both love and fatherly feelings towards Joanna and I believe they probably confuse him as to how to actually approach her or reach out to her, were he ever ballsy enough to actually do so. This film haunted me the very first time I saw it, and I could not get it out of my head for days. I have bought it on DVD a few times, and it is one of my go-to's. I LOVE THIS FILM. When you watch a film, listen to a song, read a book, anything having to do with the arts, there is a very important thing that you have to have the ability to use and to bring to the table suspension of disbelief.

If you ask questions like this, or notice things like this, you should probably watch the Kardashians and nothing but reality garbage because I think anything with any real artistic merit is going to be beyond your level of comprehension. If you can not just allow these things to pass by (ever thought maybe he threw out the cig? Maybe he smoked it quickly?) then you are really not getting the whole point anyway. So, your watching films and things like this is probably a waste of your time as well as an insult to those who worked very hard to bring it to you. Also, not everyone likes vanilla ice cream. I am not going to force you to eat a bowl of it if you want strawberry. Same with films. Just because something was above your understanding does not mean that it did not make sense.

In the first one, new recruits arrive to Parris Island for a basic training. The first scene set the atmosphere of the film; young men's head are shaved, their eyes seem totally empty and one of them even looks retarded. The narrator is one of the recruits, the whole film is set especially around his war experience. The recruits are trained to become war machines. The simplistic one is bullied by the instructor and even if he is helped by the narrator he becomes totally crazy at the end of the first part. From this first step of the movie, we can see that's it's an anti- war movie, the recruits seem to have been brainwashed in order to be programmed to kill. The send part of the film is set in Vietnam. The narrator is now a reporter at the Star & Stripes journal and because he is one of the less exposed soldiers he asks to be send to Phu Bai, where most of the combats takes place. During this experience, he discovers the different types of soldiers, the ones who shoot on everything and the others, including the narrator, who seem to be self-minded.Yet, at the end everyone ends to kill someone.

Seriously, it's emotional. I was expecting it to be a realistic drama about a nice guy being condemned to death. But then the fantasy part comes in and it's quite surprising.But this film really is just pure art. It's original. It's touching. It's an extraordinary tale. And the actors are brilliant. Each actor plays their part brilliantly. From Tom Hanks playing the nice and kind prison guard with the bladder problem to Percy, who's um... not a very nice guy apparently.The film is three hours long but those three hours are worth it. Unlike the tedious Titanic film, each minute of this film is interesting and keeps you gripped throughout the entire thing. It gives you a mixture of emotions Joy, laughter and also grief. And of course, hate for Percy. Michael Clarke Duncan is usually seen playing big brutal thugs because of his huge height and muscle, actually he's surprisingly great at playing the soft John Coffey.The plot is actually very simple. I'm not going to give away too much but you definitely know that this movie is not what it seems. But it's really the acting that brings out the film. The acting really is impressive, mainly drives the film to be honest. It didn't even need a plot, shove these guys into one room and tell them to act out a few lines and BOOM, it would still be a decent film. So when it comes to cast, The Green Mile really does have it good.It's actually quite hard to find any bad points about this film. The length was one thing, maybe it could have been shorter. But other than that it was brilliant. The film is very interesting. You see the point of view of prisoners who are on death row and realize that maybe there is actually a reason why it was banned in some countries. Because you start to feel how they feel when they are left with something like this. Only weeks to live. Some of the prisoners you are glad they are in this state, but the other prisoners you just feel sorry for. The film brings out one vital message Should they really still be punished even if they are truly sorry for what they did wrong? It sounds stupid while you're reading this but watch the film and you will understand what I'm saying. Trust me. This film might just change your view on the death penalty. It really is a great film and it's quite hard to find flaws in any of it. You care for most of the characters, even Mister Jingles the small little mouse who turns out to be a nuisance at first but even for a mouse he's a lovable character... Apart from Percy, no, Percy can go to hell. It is one of the most dramatic films ever and I was nearly crying at the end. A realistic but sad ending. The plot line is simple but unique. Trust me, it sounds boring. It's set in 1930s and is based around death row (yawn), but it's actually really interesting and it gripped me right from the start. The story is more than what it seems and actually turns out to be quite deep.So that's enough said because I really have nothing else to say. It's an amazing movie and really is worth a watch.

I wasn't really sure what to expect when I decided to watch this movie, but I must say, that I did enjoy it. xXx is a fun and exciting action film, which while not one of the greatest movies of all time, is still fun and enjoyable nevertheless. I had heard about the mixed reviews that this movie received upon its original release, and so therefore, I was kind of wondering how it would turn out when I watched it, but when I did watch it, I ended up liking the movie. This movie is a movie that certainly delivers what it promises, it promises us a lot of action and thrills, and boy, it certainly does deliver that. And hey, it's probably better than many of the action films that come out in this decade. Sure, this movie is merciless and mindless in its action, but there's still much to recommend and at least the acting is good, and Rob Cohen's directing is coherent. This movie was basically a hit or miss kind of thing, and it hit in the right places numerous times.Vin Diesel plays the hero of the movie Xander Cage, and like the movie did, Diesel surprised me here. He certainly knew how to bring out the action and the thrills, and the way he does it, you will definitely be rooting for him. Samuel L. Jackson gives in a good performance as Agent Augustus Eugene Gibbons, who acts as Cage's boss. And basically, everyone else seemed to do good in their roles as well. That was surprising as well, that the acting was quite good, because I was expecting it to be mindless or over the top, just like the action is, but no, it was actually good. The action is over the top, but it's entertaining all the same, scenarios in which the good guys take on the bad guys, and everything in between.

Sure, this movie is merciless and mindless in its action, but there's still much to recommend and at least the acting is good, and Rob Cohen's directing is coherent. This movie was basically a hit or miss kind of thing, and it hit in the right places numerous times.Vin Diesel plays the hero of the movie Xander Cage, and like the movie did, Diesel surprised me here. He certainly knew how to bring out the action and the thrills, and the way he does it, you will definitely be rooting for him. Samuel L.

That was surprising as well, that the acting was quite good, because I was expecting it to be mindless or over the top, just like the action is, but no, it was actually good.

Of those four, this is the most faithful to the novel - which, as with Dracula, I have never actually read - as well as the most faithful version ever made. This is an absolutely brilliant take on the material. After the 1957 and 1931 films (both of which are referenced several times), it is my third favourite Frankenstein film. The film was not well received critically or very successful commercially in the US, which led to the joke at the time that Mary Shelley wanted her name taken off of it which, given its aforementioned fidelity to the source material, is more than a little ironic.As with Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing, Kenneth Branagh excels as both an actor and a director and has rapidly become one of my favourites in each category. His Victor Frankenstein, a character who was based on Shelley's brilliant but often unstable and uncaring husband Percy, is a good and decent man who is undone by his own fanaticism. His attempts to resurrect the dead are motivated by the noblest of intentions. He hopes to allow humanity to cheat death so that people never again have to lose loved ones, an obsession which begins after the tragic death of his mother in childbirth, something which nicely plays into Victor's later problems with giving birth himself. Branagh plays the title character brilliantly, creating a tragic figure who elicited my sympathy in spite of his extremely misguided and unwise experiments. On the directing side of things, the film looks beautiful. The sets and the scenery are gorgeous and the more whimsical scenes at the beginning of the film serve as an excellent contrast to the horror elements later on. This is best demonstrated by two scenes which feature dancing one lovely one towards the beginning in which Victor and Elizabeth are seen at a ball and another, macabre one in which they dance around his laboratory after she has been resurrected. The framework scenes involving Captain Walton's Arctic expedition are extremely effective as his fanaticism offers a nice contrast to Victor's. Unlike Victor, however, Walton learned his lesson before it was too late. I don't know whether or not it is true but, according to IMDb, the producer Francis Ford Coppola wanted Branagh to cut the first half an hour of the film but he refused. This was certainly for the best as these scenes are crucial to understanding Victor's character as well as providing very good contrasts as I mentioned before. I'm not very familiar with Coppola's body of work but I find it hard to believe that he could have failed to understand that. There were not many actors or directors, living or dead, whom I would describe as artists but Branagh is certainly one of them.Another thing that I love about Branagh's films is his great eye for casting, notwithstanding Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton in Much Ado About Nothing. Much like his father, the film's take on the Creature is a tragic, misunderstood figure. He starts off as gentle and kind but becomes a killer after he is mistreated and abused. His scene with the blind grandfather, the only person who is kind to him, is one of the best in the film. He vows revenge on Frankenstein for abandoning him to the very cruel world of 1793. In line with the novel, this Creature is far more articulate and intelligent than most versions and Robert De Niro is excellent in the role. However, I have to say that I've always found Victor to be a far more interesting character than his creation and this film is no exception. Helena Bonham Carter is extremely strong as Victor's eventual wife Elizabeth, a very intelligent and kind young woman who is murdered by the vengeful Creature on her wedding night. Her love for Victor survives her resurrection but it is not strong enough to prevent her from committing suicide after she was repulsed by her own appearance and its similarity to the Creature's. She and Branagh, who began a relationship during the film, have great chemistry. The film has a very strong supporting cast overall, including Ian Holm, Branagh's mascot Richard Briers, a surprisingly good John Cleese in one of his only completely serious roles, Tom Hulce (who was cast in preference to Branagh as Mozart in Amadeus, though he clearly didn't hold a grudge!), Cherie Lunghi, Celia Imrie and Aidan Quinn.Overall, this is a sorely underrated film which provides a fascinating and thought-provoking take on one of the most widely adapted novels of the 19th Century.

Gittes Isn't everybody?The story to Chinatown is about a private detective, Jake Gittes, hired to investigate an adultery case, stumbles on the plot of a murder involving incest and the privatization of water through state and municipal corruption, land use and real estate. If he doesn't drop the case at once he faces threats of legal action, but he pursues it anyway, slowly uncovering a vast conspiracy.Some people may not know but I got a lot of things to do and those things are reviewing 8 Movies, three TV shows and two video games so basically that's why I'm a bit behind of the new releases. Then and now I have to take a little break or a day off from doing this because well I can be a bit tried of doing this, but I still have fun reviewing and I'm extremely proud to be talking about the great classics and the new films, TV shows and games that come out. Speaking of cult classics, Chinatown was on top of my list to watch next, because I heard nothing but amazing things about this movie and after watching it I can agree that this movie was outstanding.Jack Nicholson is now known as the single best actor of all time just like Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and in this movie his talent dose shine in this movie. He played his so well that I actually didn't fully hate him because in the movie his character is kind of a A-hole but I didn't hate him, if a different director took the director chair and directed the movie differently then maybe I would have dislike him. Jack Nicholson did probably his 4th best performance that I've seen from him.The movie is filled with lines that I won't lie but the lines have stuck with me after the movie was over and I got to give the writers credit for that. The music in this movie has that smooth jazzy beat to it and that totally fitted the movie so well. The cinematography in this movie was shot beautifully and just perfection with it's open and normal shots.For problems I don't really have any problems to be honest. I didn't find a single thing that I dislike or bothered me, no wonder it's classic.

Gittes Isn't everybody?The story to Chinatown is about a private detective, Jake Gittes, hired to investigate an adultery case, stumbles on the plot of a murder involving incest and the privatization of water through state and municipal corruption, land use and real estate. If he doesn't drop the case at once he faces threats of legal action, but he pursues it anyway, slowly uncovering a vast conspiracy.Some people may not know but I got a lot of things to do and those things are reviewing 8 Movies, three TV shows and two video games so basically that's why I'm a bit behind of the new releases. Then and now I have to take a little break or a day off from doing this because well I can be a bit tried of doing this, but I still have fun reviewing and I'm extremely proud to be talking about the great classics and the new films, TV shows and games that come out. Speaking of cult classics, Chinatown was on top of my list to watch next, because I heard nothing but amazing things about this movie and after watching it I can agree that this movie was outstanding.Jack Nicholson is now known as the single best actor of all time just like Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and in this movie his talent dose shine in this movie.

With little alternatives they decide to kidnap Nathan Arizona Jr. (TJ Kuhn) infant son of local furniture czar Nathan Arizona Sr. (Trey Wilson). But because kidnapping a baby of a local businessman is going to cause a stir HI and Ed get a whole lot more than they wish for. The Coen brothers are great with dark comedy and it really shows in this film. I can't really think of a whole lot of other movies that make kidnapping (let alone baby kidnapping) into a funny subject. With great characters all over the place saying funny lines who couldn't love this movie's humor. It seems very much like an episode of the Simpsons where all the action revolves around grown people doing stupid things. And that is where all the humor lies. I really can't recommend this film enough so I'll just end by saying go see it.
