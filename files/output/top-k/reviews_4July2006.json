The story is very interesting, and the characters aren't people you'll like. All of the characters are believable, because there are really people like this in real world, so I don't considerate them caricatures. The script is very intelligent, and has really good lines that make you laugh uncomfortably. So, to like this, you need to be capable of laugh with the problems of the others and all of the mean, and I mean really really bad, people here.The characters have development; in the beginning, Suzanne doesn't seem that bad, the teens have real personalities and problems, that you get to understand during the film. I had doubts about Kidman's character. I hated her, but at the same time I didn't want her to be discovered. I think that this feeling was what the director wanted to induce in the viewers, so she becomes unpredictable. And it gets to be, somehow, a bit of a thriller. Will Suzanne kill Larry? Will she be discovered? And how will the society react? You keep asking yourself questions, and you really want to know the answers.It's really interesting to see the teenagers' behavior and interaction with Suzanne. It's all a bit ironic, because she's an horrible person but very respected (which happens in real life a lot, too). The bad part of the script is the ending, in which it's a bit hard to understand what happened to her.Now, the directing. I considerate it good. The (quite) fast hand-held camera works well, and gives you the idea of someone (the media), following all the situations and getting in our lives. It has good plans, because it makes very good use of all of the very expressive actors involved.The actors are all extremely well, and I'll speak a bit about each of them. Nicole Kidman gives one of the performances of her career, and should have had at least an Oscar nod. She creates this unpleasant person, extremely ambitious, very sexy (wich she uses to do whatever she wants), and kind of sugar cold. What's magic, is that she gets under your skin and you can't stop thinking about her. In a moment she is sexy, in the next she's just a cold, horrible woman. Her way of talking, walking, looking at people, everything is just perfect. I considerate this one of the best performances I've ever seen.The three teenagers (played by Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Alison Folland) are very well played. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance, as a poor, dumb kid, who falls madly in love whit Suzanne. She uses him, but he always believes her. Casey Affleck hasn't a lot of screen time, but he's believable and very funny as this teen that wants to go to bed with Nicole Kidman. But my favorite of the three is Allison Folland. She gets perfectly is the role of an insecure teenage girl who had been abused and thinks she finds a friend in Suzanne. Three very strong supporting actors.Then, there is Matt Dillon, who could have shined more if he had some more screen time. But even this way, he gets in the character and Larry, this sweet, simple guy, who only wants a calm existence, comes to life. His sister, played by Illeana Douglas, creates this ironic, sarcastic woman who's funny and real.This movie has some sex scenes, that fit and are necessary to the story and allow us to know more about the characters. The murder scene is quite violent, too, but that was useful to show us how Jimmy was feeling in that moment. It's brilliantly shot and that's the time one understands how big was his obsession with Suzanne. It has some pretty bad language, too, and some harsh scenes more to the end that show us how mean Suzanne really was inside, when she was not pretending. I recommend this to Nicole Kidman\/Joaquin Phoenix fans and people that like dark comedies and satires. Overall, it's a well written movie (it as some plot holes, though) with some really intelligent bits, fantastic acting, good direction, really entertaining and thought provoking Watch It!

So, I'll pass. I never watch those Dude, you gotta see this movie movies, because frankly I don't care. If I did I would have sought it out. I have nothing against the franchise, know that others have really enjoyed it & speak highly of the favors it offers, and that's good enough for me.But I have seen PHANTASM II, and now own a DVD release with the infamous 'work print' version containing all of the explicit gore removed from the theatrical release to avoid an X rating. Why anyone would want to rate PHANTASM II an X when there is good old fashioned filth like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, Emanuelle in America, HOUSE BY THE EDGE OF THE PARK and SNUFF slinking around escapes me, but to each his own. I think the MPAA was reacting to the tone of PHANTASM II more than it's actual content. The film has an enjoyably nihilistic yet decidedly juvenile and irreverent air to it where anything is game, nothing is sacred, and the more ironic the death & mutilation scenes the better for it's target demographic of 14 year old potheads who never grew up. Take the scene where one of the evil mortuary attendants has to hack off his own hand to avoid getting one of those flying metal balls in the face. It's almost like a sick homage to MAD MAX Can he hack his hand off in time??I first saw this film, or rather parts of it, on cable at a party in college where everyone was tripping and got bad karma from the film. I can see why. I can also see why they kept saying Let's switch back to that PHANTASM II again and see what's happening the movie is like a train wreck. You can't help but want to take a peek, have it push you over the edge, turn away, then peek back again. The thing I remember being impressed by -- and still am -- is the sheer cinematic nature of the film. It's completely phony or fake, existing only as a screen treatment of some warped, sadistic horror effects aficionado's favorite scenes from the history of horror strung into one cacophonous 100 odd minute comic strip, with no bearing on or relation to our everyday reality. Individual frames may stick out but the cohesive whole of the thing is only known to those who read along, and again as stated, I don't care.Is it fair to judge a franchise film when you come in halfway through the series after missing the setup? Of course not That would be like judging Abbey Road based only on side two. So by refusing to play along with the franchise formula I look at this installment as an outsider, with no precept of what comes before the gimmick ending\/beginning or what happens after the actual ending of the film. I judge it only on what we see here and it's impressive if tasteless stuff, propelled by a sort of kinetic frenzy to want to see whatever could be dreamed up and executed on film, which can often result in pretty interesting movies. I could care less about Mike, Reggie, Liz and their bond of weirdness, though Samantha Phillips' Alchemy can ride herd on me anytime she likes, and yeah, of course the Quad Double Shotgun rulez. But I could care less if James LeGros (who became red-hot the following year with the *STILL* annoyingly trendy DRUGSTORE COWBOY) isn't the real Mike or, for that matter, if this is any good, better or worse than the other installments from the series, which I have no urge to & probably never will see. It is what it is, and what PHANTASM II is can best be termed as gnarly, gory, hyper kinetic fun, and again, that's good enough for me.I've sat through this DVD's theatrical print and the work print now three times each and have no idea what the story is about. It doesn't involve me enough to want to know, though the parade of carnage, explosions and flying limbs is about as impressive as any I have seen. Just what it all means eludes me, and I can live with that PHANTASM II on it's own without the rest of the series to explain it is like a distended nightmare one is walking into after it has started & leaving before it ends -- like a good party -- with a ghoulish sense of humor and an interesting release history to banter on about. It's a great horror movie for people who have limited attention spans or may possibly be drunk (or both), and while I will still agree with my fellow party goers that this is probably a bad trip, I honestly don't know why anyone who is tripping would set out to watch it.

However, cute is exactly the operative word for this one. Julia Roberts, John Cusak, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Billy Crystal star in this romantic comedy.

The film is based on the Broadway musical in which William Daniels and Howard Da Silva had starred.The musical (Broadway show and movie) both concentrated on John Adams, the Massachusetts lawyer and delegate to the Congress (who eventually became an important diplomat, our first Vice President, and our Second President). Adams was a brilliant man, but blunt and insulting to get his points across. Like his cousin Sam (who is not a character in the musical, unfortunately, but was one of the most skillful rebel instigators of all times) John happened to be a realist. He had defended the British soldiers in the Boston Massacre, but he was a patriot who had seen what was going on in Massachusetts since 1765, and he was unimpressed by ideas of the restoration of colonial relations between the 13 colonies and England. Adams worked to get an edge in against the moderates (led by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania) who were mostly large property owners and felt the Empire was too great an institution to be thrown away cavalierly. Dickinson had little use for Adams or Massachusetts (he felt that was the only trouble-making colony and that Adams was impossibly rude - certainly not a gentleman).But Adams found allies - Dickenson's rival in Pennsylvania Ben Franklin, Virginia's Richard Henry Lee and Thomas Jefferson, and Delaware's Caesar Rodney. But even with these allies, could he build the consensus that he needed to get independence? Through the musical numbers the main problems Adams faces are brought to the attention of the audience. He is lonely - he misses Abigail (his wife, Virginia Vestoff) and they have several duets based on their letters (she wants him to come home too). Jefferson can't work without seeing his wife Martha, and Adams sends for her (much to Abigail's annoyance - why not her?). The South does not like any suggestion that slavery has been forced on them by English trade methods, and that the institution is wrong. The final outcome of all the negotiation and compromise (some of which infuriates Adams) comes down to a single man who disappoints Dickinson.Adams is played by William Daniels, who had the best role in his career and was lucky enough to duplicate it on film. A man of dry and slight appearance (perhaps perennially looking unhappy) Daniels fits the role of the dour, pessimistic, but witty Adams. Howard Da Silva is perfect as Franklin - charming and clever, and devilish in the conclusion in explaining why Adams must give in on the slavery question.Ken Howard is appealing as the idealistic, young Jefferson - who shows a sly liking for Adams that will build to a famous friendship (only disrupted by party politics for ten years on the 1790s). He and Blythe Danner are cute as the young couple (they were just married in 1773). Danner has one of the best tunes in the show - He plays the violin - which deals with her affection for Tom (listen to the melody carefully, the last verse has a degree of foreboding about her early death in 1782). Howard, Da Silva, and Daniels have a funny song, The Egg, about the birth of the United States, especially regarding the national bird (Franklin keeps pushing the turkey because it is a feisty bird and delicious). And note the song by the young soldier, Mother, Look Sharp which is ultimately tragic and chilling about death on the battlefield.As Dickinson, Donald Madden is a fine foe to Adams - and ultimately an honorable patriot (despite his desire for keeping the British Empire together, he will join the army to protect his country). And John Cullum has the best song (my opinion) in the show - Molassas to Rum to Slaves where he describes the hypocrisy of the North about slavery by showing the triangle trade that enriched New England.My only problem deals with one character - Judge James Wilson. He is the final key to Adams winning on independence, and is shown as an insecure figure who seeks anonymity. Wilson was no mediocrity, but a skillful legal mind who would play important roles in the creation of the U.S. Constitution and in the formative years of the U.S. Supreme Court (of which he was an Associate Justice). But aside from that the film is wonderful, and good entertainment for Independence Day.Postscript 07\/05\/2008 - Turner Classics showed the film last night as part of the Fourth of July Celebration.

Apparently there is additional dialog that is useful in the film, and a nice additional song, Cool Conservative Men sung by Dickenson and Rutledge. If you want to get this film make sure to get the complete version of it.

Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. Per Qualche Dollaro in più (For a few dollars more), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.For a Few Dollars More, the second in the so-called Dollars trilogy (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after Indio for the same reason? Written by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film's main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the Trilogy and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.Stylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone's previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone's realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre's conventions. For a Few Dollars More is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.Clint Eastwood's super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone's brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volontè as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.Per qualche dollaro in più is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It's only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn't hurt the film. Fans will always argue about which of the three films of the trilogy is the best, and while personally I prefer The Good, the Bad and the Ugly over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 July 2006","score":"78 out of 87 people found the following review useful","review":" Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the Spaghetti Western with the brilliant Per un Pugno di Dollari (A Fistful of Dollars).

It is AMAZING to me that it didn't win the Academy Award. Everyone knows Serpico (a good film), The French Connection (a very good film) and so many other good (and not very good) films, yet for some reason that remains sad and frustrating, this film remains virtually unknown and unappreciated. It's not a good film. It's not a very good film. It's a GREAT film. With all due respect, how Foxion in Houston could call this a passable cop story and not the film other comments would have you believe is not only misleading, it borders on irresponsible.By the time you read this, you're most likely already familiar with the plot. Just in case you're not, here's the synopsis....It's based on the true story of a highly decorated NYC narcotics detective (Danny Ciello) who has a crisis of conscience after years of using effective but illegal (and immoral?) methods to obtain the many major drug busts that he and his partners have accomplished. He decides to help federal anti-corruption prosecutors in an effort to once again become the good cop he started out to be and always wanted to be. By confessing some of his own transgressions, wearing a wire for the feds to get more corrupt cops, and vowing to never give up his partners or the deal is off, he figures his soul will be cleansed and he can contribute toward helping stop at least some police corruption, thus making him a good cop again. However, once the wheels of justice start to turn, a very large and tangled web gets woven and spins out of control as more and more people get implicated and strictly by the book prosecutors who know nothing of how things work on the streets (and simply don't care), begin pressuring Ciello for more and more details (including info on his partners) as events further unfold. Being that Ciello has already confessed to them some of his transgressions, and being that he will have to perjure himself on the stand to protect both himself and his partners (thus jeopardizing his credibility as a witness and thus the entire government's case), Ciello is backed into a nightmarish corner that he never imagined could happen. Thus starts an ongoing series of further moral and legal crises that Ciello has to somehow face under extreme duress while things continue to fall apart in his world, sometimes with tragic consequences.Now...let's break down the common criticisms of this film 1) It's a bit long. Sighhhhhhhh. Lawrence of Arabia was long. Ghandi was long. The Godfather was long. Gone With the Wind was long. I don't hear anybody complaining that THOSE films were a bit long. A great film is a great film no matter the length of it...and let's face it, there's a LOT of material to cover in this film and it does so brilliantly while keeping the viewer engaged. 2) Treat Williams was too emotional and overacted. Sighhhhhhh. Someone who was as successful as Detective Ciello at such a young age HAS to be passionate (emotional) about the things in his corner of the world or they simply would not get accomplished. The unfathomable amount and intensity of emotions this man had to deal with are portrayed impeccably by Williams not only in spoken delivery, but in body language and facial expression as well. It's simply a tour de force. 3) They never tell you WHY Detective Ciello turned state's witness. Sighhhhhhhhhhh. So what??? As it turns out, upon being interviewed, the real-life detective upon which the movie is based (Detective Bob Leuci), states that to this very day, he can't put a handle on exactly why he decided to turn rat (and if you actually THINK about what you watched in this film, you'll realize that it's not simply a matter of becoming a rat as several others have described in their plot assessment.) Besides, if you read between the lines of this film, you'll realize the most likely WHY rather easily.Bottom line...this movie is extraordinary.

The original Carrie, if anything I've read is accurate, wasn't met with instant critical success. But due to DePalma's growing reputation and developing career, it has taken on a cult status for sure. And for good reason.I made sure to watch the original before viewing the sequel. The original has a lot going for it, most notably in the style and thematic department. However, I believe it lacks to some degree in character development, and the sequel actually succeeds at creating more believably motivated characters than the original.For instance, William Katt's character in the original, Tommy Ross, sporting the Sammy Hagar-esquire mop, is a very ambiguous character. The top jock who is also a straight-A student and with a popular girl, he doesn't get to do much for the film except show a nice smile. He gets enlisted by his girlfriend Sue Snell (Amy Irving) to take wallflower Carrie to the prom in order to make up for the vicious hazing in the opening shower scene. Tommy agrees, the administration finds out and thinks it's another joke, but the couple do it anyway. It's never really clear through the script and character development just how much they really care about making it up to Carrie. It's a gaping hole that could have been simply filled with some more dialogue or additional scenes of Snell's character. Then, instead of offering resolution for Katt's character, he gets clonked on the head with a bucket and presumably dies on the prom couple stage. Huh? The Rage, on the other hand, features a heroine who is less a victim than a tough survivor. No wallflower is she, like the pathetic Carrie of the original. No insane religious overtones here, except for the opening. Rachel, played with a very believable control by cutey Emily Bergl, is not beautiful or even stunningly cute like Sissy Spacek was. The key to the original, in my mind, are those amazing eyes of Spacek's filmed in the red lens as she's covered with blood, during those split-screen, slo-mo shots of the revenege and the rampage. That trance-like state during the murder sequence is CREEPY.The Rage features one heck of a revenge ending as well. Don't underestimate. People get it, but good.The effects are better than the original, they're graphic, and they're appropriate. Talk about CD killing--this is better than Hellraiser III's CD slicing. And one of the jocks gets a comeuppance involving a spear gun that's...well, appropriate, especially since he's played by the believably dimwitted Brad from TV's Home Improvement. (Bit disappointed about the head jock's demise...though it was stylistically impressive, I must say.) Which brings me to the acting and the chemistry with these characters. First off, they look more like high school kids than the original film portrayed. They act like it, too. Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, PJ Soles--they looked old in 1976, and the latter looked old in Halloween playing a cheerleader another 2 years later.Another treat--we get a returning cast member. Always a BIG plus in my book when someone agrees to come back. This time it's Sue Snell (Irving), now a guidance counselor at the rebuilt high school. She has her own checkered past, including commitment to an asylum following the events of the original. I was quite surprised by her fate in this film, that's for sure. Gutsy.Perhaps one of the biggest notes on this film is the fact that, being a 90s horror remake, which everyone thinks will just be an excuse for wall-to-wall violence, or in this case, telekinesis non-stop, it's not. Save for the very bloody end (appropriate--this is a revenge film, remember) the telekinetic power portion of the film is handled very well and controlled in terms of Rachel's acceptance. In the original, the wallflower came out so quickly and was suddenly throwing her mother to the bed.I don't know. I think this film got an automatic panning or a lackluster reaction for no good reason. In its own right, it works well. It's more about what's going on in American high schools everywhere today than it is about telekinetic powers, etc. (Though we get more info on it than the original).So let's not be so quick to scoff at a film that's a sequel to a DePalma. Take this for what it is a good modern revenge film about the timeless cruelty of kids and the curveball of telekinetic powers. I think director Katt Shea (who once was retrospected at MOMA) put more into this than most people think.Another point of recommendation--extras. 3 extra scenes are here which are interesting, as well as the original ending, which thank God they didn't use. The more subtle and shocking effect of the last scene is chilling and fits perfectly.

He gets enlisted by his girlfriend Sue Snell (Amy Irving) to take wallflower Carrie to the prom in order to make up for the vicious hazing in the opening shower scene. Tommy agrees, the administration finds out and thinks it's another joke, but the couple do it anyway. It's never really clear through the script and character development just how much they really care about making it up to Carrie. It's a gaping hole that could have been simply filled with some more dialogue or additional scenes of Snell's character. Then, instead of offering resolution for Katt's character, he gets clonked on the head with a bucket and presumably dies on the prom couple stage. Huh? The Rage, on the other hand, features a heroine who is less a victim than a tough survivor. No wallflower is she, like the pathetic Carrie of the original. No insane religious overtones here, except for the opening. Rachel, played with a very believable control by cutey Emily Bergl, is not beautiful or even stunningly cute like Sissy Spacek was. The key to the original, in my mind, are those amazing eyes of Spacek's filmed in the red lens as she's covered with blood, during those split-screen, slo-mo shots of the revenege and the rampage. That trance-like state during the murder sequence is CREEPY.The Rage features one heck of a revenge ending as well. Don't underestimate. People get it, but good.The effects are better than the original, they're graphic, and they're appropriate. Talk about CD killing--this is better than Hellraiser III's CD slicing. And one of the jocks gets a comeuppance involving a spear gun that's...well, appropriate, especially since he's played by the believably dimwitted Brad from TV's Home Improvement. (Bit disappointed about the head jock's demise...though it was stylistically impressive, I must say.) Which brings me to the acting and the chemistry with these characters. First off, they look more like high school kids than the original film portrayed. They act like it, too. Nancy Allen, Amy Irving, PJ Soles--they looked old in 1976, and the latter looked old in Halloween playing a cheerleader another 2 years later.Another treat--we get a returning cast member. Always a BIG plus in my book when someone agrees to come back. This time it's Sue Snell (Irving), now a guidance counselor at the rebuilt high school. She has her own checkered past, including commitment to an asylum following the events of the original. I was quite surprised by her fate in this film, that's for sure. Gutsy.Perhaps one of the biggest notes on this film is the fact that, being a 90s horror remake, which everyone thinks will just be an excuse for wall-to-wall violence, or in this case, telekinesis non-stop, it's not. Save for the very bloody end (appropriate--this is a revenge film, remember) the telekinetic power portion of the film is handled very well and controlled in terms of Rachel's acceptance. In the original, the wallflower came out so quickly and was suddenly throwing her mother to the bed.I don't know. I think this film got an automatic panning or a lackluster reaction for no good reason. In its own right, it works well. It's more about what's going on in American high schools everywhere today than it is about telekinetic powers, etc. (Though we get more info on it than the original).So let's not be so quick to scoff at a film that's a sequel to a DePalma. Take this for what it is a good modern revenge film about the timeless cruelty of kids and the curveball of telekinetic powers. I think director Katt Shea (who once was retrospected at MOMA) put more into this than most people think.Another point of recommendation--extras. 3 extra scenes are here which are interesting, as well as the original ending, which thank God they didn't use. The more subtle and shocking effect of the last scene is chilling and fits perfectly.
