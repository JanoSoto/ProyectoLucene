[{"date":"26 May 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" As director Darren Aronofsky's second feature film, Requiem for a Dream is also his best. Through its graphic and hard-hitting depictions of drug abuse, the film also serves as a lesson on the American Dream and the impossibility of ever truly achieving it.The story of Requiem for a Dream revolves around four addicts living on Coney Island. The first is Sara, an elderly woman who has been selected to appear as a contestant on her favorite game show. Determined to lose her stout figure for the show, Sara becomes addicted to weight loss pills that cause her to slowly lose her grasp on reality. Her son Harry, along with his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone, is a heroin addict who becomes a dealer in order to feed his addiction and to help Marion open a fashion store. The three of them run into innumerable problems, however. Harry's arm becomes horrendously infected due to the repeated use of unclean needles. Sara looses her mind completely. Marion descends into prostitution to continue her worsening addiction and Tyrone is caught in the middle of a gang shooting which he barely escapes. By the end of the film, which I won't go into too much detail, the four have lost everything they hold dear.As I had previously stated, this film acts as a metaphor for the elusive American Dream. Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion all had a dream of their own that they ultimately failed to achieve. Sara wished to be grand prize winning contestant on the game show, but her addiction became so severe that it drove her insane. Harry and Marion wanted to settle down together and open a store together, but their addictions drive them apart and they finally descend into depravity. Tyrone simply wants to make his mother proud, but his actions end up costing him his freedom. The events of this film suggest that, whether ones actions are good or bad, the American Dream is something that can never truly be achieved. Every choice that we make has a consequence. It is not only drug dependency that hinders ones success, but also issues of money, power, violence, and racial, gender, and sexual tolerance that contribute to the death of our dreams. Perhaps this is what the title of the film, Requiem for a Dream, stands for.Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly powerful, moving, and haunting film that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled. The film's performances, particularly Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto as Sara and Harry, are all top-notch and unforgettable. Keep in mind that this film contains some very unsettling and grim situations and imagery, but those who can bear through it will love the film as I do. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time.

Yet SHAMPOO, not unlike its characters' utterly outmoded hairstyle, is a mediocre downer, which makes Grant's Oscar triumph looks like a fishy consolation prize for the sake of her career achievements. It is 1968, in the eve of the President Election, George (Beatty), a Beverly Hill hairstylist (by the way, no one dares to advise him to get his own flurry hairdo a neat trim), an inveterate womanizer and sex-addict, gyrates around his girlfriend Jill (Hawn) and the cougar patron Felicia (Grant), with other casual dalliances not included. Dreaming of open his own salon but rejected for a bank loan, George is introduced by Felicia to her wealthy hubby Lester (Warden), who might be interested in the investment, meanwhile, he encounters Jacky, his old flame, and discovers she is Lester's mistress. Inevitably Jacky and George rekindles their romance, and everyone involved needs an egress out of the sticky situation. Eventually, the obvious loser is George himself, but as we can envision, 30 minutes after the ending, he is back in his habitual mode to seduce another predator in the jungle of voluptuous creatures, it is hard to deny a self-revealing aspect of George's character is based on Beatty himself (oo who is the co-writer here).More like a personal project for Beatty and Christie, they are not at all in their top form, it it their pillow talk which leaves audience in a state of dumbness and aloofness. Goldie Hawn actually pulls off a renascent awareness of her own worth through maturing from a wide-eyed ingénue to a woman knows what she wants and feels pity on George's addiction. Lee Grant is ferociously acrid as the lust-driven middle-aged wife encircled with desperate loneliness, an Oscar-win is too much for the role nevertheless; Jack Warden is the token of a winner in a male-chauvinistic world, which proffers a rare showcase for this perpetually sidelined character thespian, in the end, he even dissipates some of the antipathy, which presumably aims towards Lester's shallowness and the stink of money, with an inherent affinity borders on visceral humility and drool naiveté, his adventure in a hippie party draws the best eye-sensational revelry in the entire film.

At the head of the gang is Stanley (Sylvester Stallone), an intimidating thug with a guarded heart of gold, who's in a dilemma when his rough-talking girl Frannie (Maria Smith) announces she's pregnant. Her best friend Annie (Renee Paris) is dating the handsome Chico (Perry King), but Chico only uses her for sex while really setting his eyes on the new girl in school (Susan Blakely). Butchey (Henry Winkler) is the most bright of the Lords, and could make something better of himself if he wanted. Wimpy (Paul Mace) is a short member of the group who hangs out with his friends for the security it gives him.Most of what occurs on screen has no plot, and consists of vignettes with its cast members. Stallone fares best of all, and some good moments include him bullying a rival gang member in a pool hall, and especially the film's best scene near the end that takes place inside a jewelry store, when Frannie and Annie push Sly into buying a $1600 engagement ring against his will. Henry Winker's promising part was, unfortunately, under-written... but he's got one good scene occurring after hours alone in the local candy store hangout, where the shop owner tries to drill some sense into his head about how much more wisely he could be spending his time. Perry King's Chico is the main character, but he's such a jerk in the movie that he's hard for us to invest in.Ultimately, the movie has a good deal of problems and is only average. At best, this is watchable to me every few years as being one of those nostalgic guilty pleasures that I first saw in the theater when I was around 11 (it even featured the now-defunct Sunrise Drive-In, which was not far from where I lived back then). It's a very cheap film that was shot on 16mm and blown up, which accounts for its rough looking quality, and also for some poor sound issues that make it difficult to discern occasional dialogue. It's got a 1970s rock n roll soundtrack of made up '50s tunes of varying quality, some of which drown out moments of talking at times.

When Chris discovers slugs may have taken over his best friend we truly believe and feel his pain. The over the top smart talking detective played by Tom Atkins is a delightful mix of attitude and humor, and is probably Atkins best genre roll.

The film has a fun campy side that is purely intentional, but boasts some excellent make up effects and delivers some great gore moments.

The slugs quickly multiply on campus as they enter the victim's mouth and incubate in their brains until their hatched. A radical police detective named Cameron (Atkins) who has connections to the case from years ago is called in to get to the bottom of it. It isn't long before students are turned into zombies and our rag tag team must figure out how to stop and kill them. This fun film is a great mix of Sci-Fi and horror done with tongue in cheek from first time Writer\/Director Fred Dekker. Dekker fills this movie with everything a fright film fan can want. He starts by making his characters very real. The friendship between Chris and J.C. is real and believable and credit has to be given to the actors for pulling this off in such a fashion. When Chris discovers slugs may have taken over his best friend we truly believe and feel his pain. The over the top smart talking detective played by Tom Atkins is a delightful mix of attitude and humor, and is probably Atkins best genre roll. Atkins shines in a role he seems born to play as he answers to anyone with the memorable line Thrill me. The film has a fun campy side that is purely intentional, but boasts some excellent make up effects and delivers some great gore moments. Not overly scary, but well made and executed with genre fans in mind, Night of the Creeps will keep a smile on your face throughout and you will have a ton of fun watching it.

The acting was excellent (not going to lie); though the storyline was mediocre. I was bored half to death during the entire course of the movie. To be honest, the only part which creeped me out was the discovery of all the voodoo figures. What made three helpless teens think it would be a dandy idea to venture off into the middle of the woods to search for a supernatural entity which could have been the cause of many disappearances over the past century is well beyond me. Another annoying aspect of the film was Heather's constant babbling and filming of every little nook and cranny of the woods to capture this so called witch instead of fleeing to safety. First, she gets the group lost - twice - with a map (although Mike ends up idiotically discarding the map later on). Second, the day after Josh mysteriously disappeared from camp, Heather wanders off as usual and finds his bloody remains tied up in his plaid shirt, which is then stuffed into a bundle of sticks and keeps the information to herself. Lastly, she is either really out of shape or she is really stupid. I'm going with the latter. The last scene of the films ends with Mike and Heather entering the house searching for Josh. As the two teens pace across the broken floorboards of the creepy house, we can clearly see little bloody hand prints scattered all over the walls. At this point I would figure out that Josh is dead and leave, but this is a movie so we must venture on! Mike suddenly hears screaming from the basement and sprints down the stairs to rescue his not so alive friend. Instead of chasing after him, Heather decided it'd be in her best interest to instead trot behind him at 2mph and continue to shout at the top of her lungs. The last clip the audience views is Mike seen facing the wall followed by Heather dropping her camera - although we don't see her because it cuts straight to the credits. Boom! The end.What? That's it? I honestly don't understand why this particular film was hyped up so much. I was excited to watch this because of all the commotion surrounding the movie, however it did not live up to my expectations.If I rate below a five, it means I personally think the movie\/TV series was dreadful, which is the reason 3 stars out of 10 were chosen.Thank you for reading.

There's about as much finesse and class to a teen comedy as there is romance in a slasher flick. However, there is no denying that they can be incredible successful as American Pie is testament to, cementing its place in movie folklore as my generation's Fast Times At Ridgemont High or Porky's. If you haven't seen it then you know exactly what to expect (certainly I wasn't too surprised) but at least the cast gamely give it their all and there are one or two moments that certainly reminded me of a torturous time in my life.After finding out that popping your cherry isn't as easy as they'd been led to believe, four friends decide to make a pact to lose their virginity before senior prom in a few months time. For lacrosse-playing jock Oz (Chris Klein), it's about getting in touch with your feelings as he pursues choir singer Heather (Mena Suvari). Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) struggles to tell his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) exactly how he feels while Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas) struggles to keep track of all the rumours swirling about high school about his sexual past. As for Jim (Jason Biggs), his toe-curling lack of confidence with girls isn't helped by the constant interruptions from his dad (Eugene Levy) and unwanted attention by band-camp geek Michele (Alyson Hannigan). Will the boys manage to get their end away or will they learn that there are some things more important in life than sex, despite what the goofy Stifler (Seann William Scott) says?American Pie is not big or clever but it does have some things in its favour. You believe that these four guys are genuine friends away from the cameras and there is a real sense of camaraderie on set. It also feels like a genuine school with a vast cast of characters (although no teachers spring to mind) which I must credit the screenwriter for - Adam Herz has a real skill at writing the sort of dialogue you'd hear in any school anywhere and the sort of sweaty nervous that Biggs excels at. In a way, his performance is typical of the cast as a whole who have generally struggled to escape the film ever since. My main issues are that the comedy is just so obvious, it removes any sense of surprise. Whenever you see Levy, you just know that he's either going to do or say something that will embarrass Biggs.

So, the title might sound derogatory but it's not meant that way.Citizen Kane was about a man with guts and vision, who got so alienated by his obsession to be the voice of people that he ultimately lost his touch with people and ended up miserably with no connection whatsoever with his cherished past. He was misunderstood, but he had it coming. All the King's Men is a character study chronicling the same psychological process but rhyming this time with success, it's about a Southern politician named Willie Stark who never forgot where he came from and never lost his touch, which made him even more dangerous.The story is adapted from a Pulitzer-prize winning novel of the same title written by Robert Penn Warren, and based on the rise and fall of the legendary populist politician Huey Long. The ascension of Willie Stark, played by a mesmerizing Broderick Crawford, is a fictionalization of Long's life and one of the most powerful political movies ever made, for the simple reason that it hasn't lost any of its relevance, as long as politics exist, there will be men like Stark. Yesterday, France was shaken by the victory of French Populist Party in the European elections, politicians acted surprised while they could have seen it coming. Basically, the winners spoke the people's language.It's as simple as that, you've got to put yourself in people's shoes and it's not any politician who can accomplish it. Some see their vocations as something that elevated them above the crowd, they're not leaders but prophets allowing people to embrace their own visions, but men like Willie Stark are within the crowd, not above it. The pivotal moment occurs when after failing attempts to seduce people by talking about fiscal measures and other non-inspirational stuff, good old honest Willie Stark, understands he was the puppet of his own detractors, gets drunk, tears up his paper and enraged by his own anger, gives one of these great roaring speeches tailor-made for the big screen.And the film, directed by Robert Rossen, features the kind of editing the genre requires, crowd close-ups, big headlines, and an unforgettable gallery of flawed characters, starting with the protagonist himself, Willie Stark, who starts out as a nice and honest fellow, struggling to raise his voice, a man of the people, and undeniably for the people, a man revered by the journalist played by John Ireland, but whose rise to power's collateral damage will be a decline of honesty. Power would plant the seeds of a cynical mind. All the King's Men starts like a Capra film but ends in a film-noir mood. After World War II, world turned out to be more disillusioned and cynical for Mr Smith figures, and it's only voices like Willie Stark's that can be heard.Indeed, good old Ma Joad said 'we're the people', but in 1949, only Stark could make this statement audible, embodying in his huge body and larger-than-life personal those Grapes of Wrath. And once Stark realized he had a natural charisma and capability to move the crowds, it's like Forrest Gump's braces breaking, the repressed ego finally implodes to the face of the political scene and from respect, the eyes and hearts are fueled with admiration and fear, starring with his titular inner circle, Mercedes McCambridge plays a sort of Jean Hagen-like character, going from antagonist to main counselor, she delivers her first and greatest (rightfully Oscar-winning) performance as a little woman with the toughest heart, venting her lack of seducing appeal in her infatuation with Stark.The rest of the cast includes Joanne Dru as Ireland's girlfriend, she's literally blown away by Stark's appeal and although her performance might be the one aspect of the film I disliked (God, how many times she had to turn her head theatrically!) the twist in her character &#x96;in all the meanings of the words- was quite gutsy and politically incorrect for its time. And there's Broderick Crawford as Stark, in the role of a lifetime, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor. My other favorite performance from him is in Fellini's Il Bidone and it's quite ironic and befitting that he played a swindler in the film, while Rossen would also direct another classic and favorite of mine The Hustler, after all, isn't a politician a kind of hustler with power as the pay-off?But I'm still puzzled with Stark's character (this is how fascinating he is) did he turn into a bad guy or was he prone to corruption from the very beginning, it's hard to tell, but some of his insightful thoughts say a lot about his vision of politics good comes from evil but, who defines evil? retorts one of the film's reasonable minds. Stark doesn't care, as long as he builds roads, schools, hospitals, as long as he puts his state on the maps, and allow people to stop seeing themselves as hicks, he'll believe in anything he says and does. Tyranny? Dictatorship? Well, we live in a Macchiavellian world where ends justify the means, but as the narrative progresses, we're in the eye of the tornado and can't see if power is an end or a mean for Stark.And maybe this is the power of All the King's Men, Best Picture winner in 1950, a powerful film about power &#x85; even more because it has the kind of straight-forward appeal as if it deliberately embraced the simplicity of the very people targeted by Stark... hence my title as the poor man's Citizen Kane.

After World War II, world turned out to be more disillusioned and cynical for Mr Smith figures, and it's only voices like Willie Stark's that can be heard.Indeed, good old Ma Joad said 'we're the people', but in 1949, only Stark could make this statement audible, embodying in his huge body and larger-than-life personal those Grapes of Wrath. And once Stark realized he had a natural charisma and capability to move the crowds, it's like Forrest Gump's braces breaking, the repressed ego finally implodes to the face of the political scene and from respect, the eyes and hearts are fueled with admiration and fear, starring with his titular inner circle, Mercedes McCambridge plays a sort of Jean Hagen-like character, going from antagonist to main counselor, she delivers her first and greatest (rightfully Oscar-winning) performance as a little woman with the toughest heart, venting her lack of seducing appeal in her infatuation with Stark.The rest of the cast includes Joanne Dru as Ireland's girlfriend, she's literally blown away by Stark's appeal and although her performance might be the one aspect of the film I disliked (God, how many times she had to turn her head theatrically!) the twist in her character &#x96;in all the meanings of the words- was quite gutsy and politically incorrect for its time. And there's Broderick Crawford as Stark, in the role of a lifetime, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor. My other favorite performance from him is in Fellini's Il Bidone and it's quite ironic and befitting that he played a swindler in the film, while Rossen would also direct another classic and favorite of mine The Hustler, after all, isn't a politician a kind of hustler with power as the pay-off?But I'm still puzzled with Stark's character (this is how fascinating he is) did he turn into a bad guy or was he prone to corruption from the very beginning, it's hard to tell, but some of his insightful thoughts say a lot about his vision of politics good comes from evil but, who defines evil? retorts one of the film's reasonable minds. Stark doesn't care, as long as he builds roads, schools, hospitals, as long as he puts his state on the maps, and allow people to stop seeing themselves as hicks, he'll believe in anything he says and does. Tyranny? Dictatorship? Well, we live in a Macchiavellian world where ends justify the means, but as the narrative progresses, we're in the eye of the tornado and can't see if power is an end or a mean for Stark.And maybe this is the power of All the King's Men, Best Picture winner in 1950, a powerful film about power &#x85; even more because it has the kind of straight-forward appeal as if it deliberately embraced the simplicity of the very people targeted by Stark... hence my title as the poor man's Citizen Kane.

So... the three of them have to generally have to fight for their lives for the best part of the movie. And, for the record, the 'best parts' are the first and third acts.

There will be plenty of people out there who will only see it as outdated and silly. And it is. But that doesn't mean that it isn't a fun watch at the same time!

If this is the case and the film is not exactly a true story, then after a recent viewing, I started to wonder why and for what reason, it was made. Now granted, Spike Lee always has good intentions. And most of the time he gets energetic performances from his cast. However, in Crooklyn's case, the material he is saddled with (the story and the monotonous, yet accurate script) is entirely lightweight, and it doesn't have the strength to fill a 2 hour-plus exercise. Whatever conflicts that occur between the characters (characters that fade in and out of the proceedings) are never fully realized and resolved, the one event or tragedy that occurs toward the film's conclusion does not fully beef up any dramatic momentum, and most of the scenes involving the main family depicted (the Carmichael family) feel tedious and in serious need of editing. In essence, Crooklyn would have more effective as a side plot of Lee's family childhood included in a T.V. special\/documentary about his life as a director. What came out in 1994 though, is an authentic, yet unnecessary portrayal of a family of 5 kids (four boys, 1 girl) living in Brooklyn, NY in the summer of 1973.Using many unknown child actors and casting himself as a neighborhood glue sniffing junkie, Lee shoots a film that follows the lives of the fictional family, the Carmichaels. They consists of a hard working school teacher (always tough as nails Alfre Woodard), her calming, hard- up musician husband (with this film and Lee's Clockers, Delroy Lindo is now one of my true acting heroes), and their five children (the film slowly begins to put its main focus on the only daughter in group being Troy, played with confidence by Zelda Harris). Although they are the main tenants of the building they are living in, they are struggling to make ends meet (they fail to pay the electric bill for everybody else and the building loses power) and Carolyn Carmichael (Woodard) being the sole provider, puts a strain on the family dynamic. She and Woody Carmichael (Lindo) fight and argue because he is not able to make any money playing his music (he's a piano player and composer). Crooklyn also in the smallest detail takes a look at some of the other people that live on the same block as the Carmichaels. They are side characters that don't get a lot of screen time to establish themselves, let alone add to the workings of the plot (a plot with a very thin skin). As I stated a couple sentences ago, watching this exercise, you begin to realize that the young Troy becomes the focal point of the movie in general. It's not entirely known upfront. But by the last twenty minutes or so, you understand why. By then it's too late because too much running time is passed and not enough has happened. If the whole entire film focused on this little girl, I think it might have worked. I stress the words might have.When it's all said and done, this is a harmless motion picture that seemed close to Lee's heart. I don't think it's a bad film by any means. I just feel that the subject matter wasn't deep enough or potent enough to engage an audience seeking entertainment value or for lack of a better word, excitement. Yes, the period detail is pretty solid with the soundtrack being composed of some 70's classics and a few rap tunes. The opening credit sequence is excellent, depicting a normal routine of childhood antics (double dutch jump rope, tag, street races, etc.) on a hot summer day in NYC. And the closing credits are a delight leading with an intro by Soul Train creator Don Cornelius followed by a dance sequence on said T.V. show. But, in between, the movie glides by without really saying anything or provoking any deep meaning. So my high end analysis is this instead of watching people's lives on screen, the only way to really embrace this film, is by being in that place and time, and actually inhabiting some form of their existence. If you lived in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood back in 1973, this flick might be your cup of tea. If you didn't, decide to take in a viewing, and wanted to immerse yourself in the world of Crooklyn, (you know its characters and its story) by hook or crook, you'll ultimately feel cheated at what you just saw.

Mel Gibson gets quite the build up in this third installment of the Mad Max series. Does he live up to it?It depends on what you expect. If you were a fan of the high-octane Road Warrior, or the even fiercer Mad Max which kicked things off, you may well miss the disturbed loner of the earlier films, and mind the fact he is more settled and less crazed than ever. But if you watch this film divorced of such expectations, well, I think Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is still problematic, if entertaining in fits and starts.We meet Max still alone in the post-Apocalyptic deserts of Australia, his goods and camels stolen. In search of them, he arrives in Bartertown, a pig-poop-powered oasis for cheats and chiselers. Auntie Entity (Tina Turner) takes an interest in Max, enough to offer a proposition Kill a rival in town so she can have full control of Bartertown. Max agrees readily.Who's the bunny? he asks, clearly not caring one way or the other.That's about the only Mad Max moment in Thunderdome, which otherwise deepens the character by adding a layer of sentimentality and, eventually, paternal protection to a group of cute kids who live all alone in the deepest desert and sees Max as the return of their saviour.You can read the responses here and on the comments thread. These kids are too much like the Ewoks in Return Of The Jedi, only worse because the Star Wars movies always had a kid focus and fuzzy alien types. Mad Max was geared more for adults, which makes long close-ups of dewy-eyed babes under a cloying score that much harder to take. This long detour into Joseph Campbell-evoking storytelling sessions takes up a lot of time that Max could be spending lubing his car axles with some mohawked maniac's guts.Actually, Max doesn't do a lot of driving in this one, just a bit at the end. For the most part, he's regulated to the sidelines, listening to the kids or else Auntie, who explains about her den of misery It's civilization. I'll do anything to protect it.As long as Thunderdome focuses on Auntie and Bartertown, it's at least enjoyable if not as focused or as visceral as the prior Max films. You enjoy the pungently nasty characters that people Max's world, the debris of the old world re-purposed to strange ends, and the guy who hawks camels by telling a crowd This is the vehicle that sent Detroit broke! Max is there, too, a man of few words as always, his actions building to a cage death match in Thunderdome that is one of the movie's major reasons for being.After that, though, the film wanders. Beyond Thunderdome, it turns out, is more than a cool name; it's an all-too-accurate descriptor of the proceedings. Beyond Thunderdome, there's little for Max to do than go back into the desert and discover his lost humanity with the help of those impish Lord Of The Flies kids.A new Mad Max film, sans Gibson but bringing back director George Miller, is expected to open in 2015.

Stallone is the cop, frozen in time along with his arch criminal nemesis, Snipes, and both of them defrosted in a (supposedly) utopian future, only to rage havoc once again.There are plenty of jokes to go alongside the action and Sandra Bullock is great as the plucky lead (and you can see why her performance led on to her true breakthrough role in Speed a year later). And Nigel Hawthorne should also get a nod for his 'futuristic version of Sir Humphrey' in San Angeles - great to see such a serious character actor trading insults with Hollywood's hard men! If you like your action movies fun and light-hearted then Demolition Man stands up to the test of time. It may not be Rambo, Rocky or the Terminator franchise, but it deserves its place in nineties-action history (even if just for making the audience ask the question 'Just what exactly was the deal with the 'three seashells'?).http\/\/thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk\/ ","genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"26 May 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" If you can sit through this movie, especially the three and a half version of this film, I am proud of you. Not to say this movie is bad, but it's often tedious since there is really nothing here to move the plot. The film goes at such a slow pace, but however this film can be incredibly fascinating and the film is enriched with detail. As a history buff, I enjoyed this film as it was because of the historical narrative it induced.Bernardo Bertollucci's film is about the last emperor of China before the warlord age and communist age. The film talks about how Puyi became emperor at such an young age, how he abdicated this throne, and how he ended up as a political prisoner.The acting is really good and we needed good acting to get through a film like this. John Lone does an excellent job as the adult Puyi and really conveys his emotions very well. Peter O'Toole, one of the few Western actors here, does an excellent job as always.Overall, The Last Emperor seems like it does not have in mind to entertain, but to teach. It's a good, fascinating film that talks about changing times and how people must adapt. I was intrigued by this film because the dynasties of China has always impressed me. Is this the film that should win Best Picture at the Oscars? Perhaps not, but this is still a good film to see despite it's tepid pacing. I rate this film 8\/10.

Ironically, it's also one of their finest. With Disney's 'nine old men' working on other projects to hopefully re-vamp the studios financial prospects, Dumbo was developed by Dick Huemer and Joe Grant, two of Disney's founding fathers, who took an unconventional approach to adapting the story from Helen Aberson's children's story. Written almost like a book, the film's charm and appeal lies in it's no frills approach.There's no heavy-handed morality message, just a simple tale about a cute elephant with a physical affliction trying to get by in a world that will not accept him. In fact, away from Jumbo Jr., cruelly dubbed 'Dumbo' by some unsavoury elephants, and his only friend in the world Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy), Dumbo's world is full of unkindness. The faceless men who run the travelling circus Dumbo is apart of, do little but hammer and build with a depressing resignation. The other elephants, apart from Mrs. Jumbo (Verna Felton), refuse to accept him due to his comically large ears, and do everything to ridicule and exile him. There's no moment of realisation for these characters, just a satisfying pay-back.It's strange that this is rarely mentioned as one of Disney's finest. Perhaps it's the lack of musical numbers or the use of silent-era slapstick and facial humour as opposed to the usual quipping sidekick. But for me, this enhances the enjoyment, putting more focus on the wonderful animation, and reducing the story down to something we can all relate to. Much has been said about the crows encountered by Dumbo towards the end of the film, and their racial stereotyping. I will not deny that some of Disney's early output do leave a nasty taste in the mouth, but, in fact, the crows are part of a select few who are sympathetic to Dumbo's plight, and Dumbo feels too innocent to be accused of such. And it's in this innocence that lies the magic, something that was lost once Disney came out of it's Golden Era.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"26 May 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Made to recoup on the financial losses caused by the commercially unsuccessful Pinocchio and Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo is one of Disney's shortest and narratively simplistic works to date.

The second movie was watchable. The third movie directed by Stuart Gillard, was just not in the same as the others, and felt out of place. Since, the movie kill Shredder from the last movie, the movie needed a new plot. From all the rich plots and villains, they could had chosen like Krang, Rat King, or Baxter Stockman. The movie choice, none of them and instead create a new concept in which the Turtles travel back into time to 1603 feudal Japan. I have to give them some credit for trying to make something new out of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but couldn't they just wait until they run out of the establish concepts that the comics and television have provided for their viewers. The feudal Japan settling is pretty interesting, since not a lot of Americans movies at the time, provide that, and I'm glad, they got a lot of Japanese actors to play the supporting roles. Still, the way, they marched the two concepts into one, is dumb plot. So in the present day, April O'Neil (Paige Turco) been shopping at a flea market, and just happen to upon an ancient Japanese scepter that cause them to travel back into time! First off, what a weak establishment for how the Turtles came to hold of the ancient Japanese scepter. A flea market? It's never establish, how the ancient Japanese scepter even got to a flea market in America. Really bad storytelling here. You would had some treasure hunting fun adventure scenes with this, with the Turtles discovering it when travelling to Japan for their training, or the screenwriters could had a story where the turtles find a hideout of a criminal who stealing ancient artifacts, but no. Instead, April buy the Japanese scepter at some odd-screen flea market, and we don't see the turtles in action, until they travel back into time to rescue April. The movie really lack action scenes. Plus, none of them were anything new. The violent was toned down to the point to fit in the PG rating. Full of childish fighting styles, slow fight cinematography and bad one liners sayings. I really doubt they ever go back to the extremely good fighting scenes of the first movie. There were different fighting scenes shot for different countries. Such in the case of Great Britain, which had a law at the time against the presentation of martial arts weapons especially the Nunchakus. When watching both the American & US version, I can say, there is only a few differs. Most of them are in the opening scene. The movie opens up with them dancing to ZZ top in a goofy matter than fighting, anyways. I don't see the big deal. The build up to the turtles is so badly done. Unlike the previous films, the Jim Henson's Creature Shop did not provide the advanced animatronics and it shows how badly done it was. They look like giant underdeveloped frogs than the Turtles. You can even see the man's face in the costume through its mouth in some scenes. They really do lack the facial emotions of the previous films. I still love how they have the same or similar voice acting that was given to the turtles throughout the films. Since, the movie is PG, there wasn't that much foul language. So, there will no scenes of the turtles saying damn, here. I have to say, most of the turtles jokes were really unfunny due to it being out of context, or making no sense. I think, the most fun, I had in the film is with the Ancient Honor Guards with Casey Jones (Elias Koteas) in the present day. It was funny, seeing them dancing to Baltimora 'Tarzan Boy' and learning how to play Hockey. There is a lot of filler scenes with other characters, that didn't live up the turtles premise such as the Kenshin (Eidan Hanzei) love sub-plot. His acting was bad. The actor that play Walker (Stuart Wilson), the villain was pretty good. He looks a bit like a mixed with William Shatner & Kevin Costner. While, the acting isn't so great, I have to say the cinematography for this movie is pretty damn good. The opening shots of the horseman riding away from the samurais in the red rising sun background was amazing. Great use of locations. It really felt like they were in medieval Japan. The famous Turtle Rhapsody from the Orchestra on the Half Shell from the first two movies seem to be missing from this. Instead, it's plays unnoticeable Japanese folk music. Overall I wouldn't shell money over to get the movie, but if you're a turtle fan. It's watchable, but just don't come in, hoping it's going to be as good as the cartoon or the previous films because you'll be deeply disappointing. It should tuck its head into its own movie shell in shame. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 May 2014","score":"","review":" The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1990's trilogy had its up & downs.
