I had always assumed that this was just some other sci-fi movie that everyone was crazy about. Of course I knew about the classic scenes like where Neo bends over backwards dodging the bullets...but other than that I wasn't really interested. Then came the night where my friend taped it off the television when it aired on TBS Superstation. I slept over her house and we watched this. I didn't expect to be impressed. On my first time watching it I didn't understand everything about the movie but I understood what the Matrix really was. Here was my first reaction to this movie Wow.This movie is now one of my favorite movies of all time. But it grabs you even before you see it in theaters. If you've seen the trailer for it it doesn't explain what it's talking about when it shows scenes from the Matrix. Of course people go to the theaters because it's an action movie and of course to figure out what the hell this movie is about. Remember the scene in the club where Trinity is talking to Neo? She says, It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here. Not only is she talking to Neo, but she is unconsciously addressing the audience as well. The people were dragged to the theaters to figure out the answer to that question, which Neo says what is obviously the question and what is on everybody's minds at this point What is the Matrix?The movie starts off on a pretty basic plot. Trinity is attempting to get the code for something in an old building. Cops come, she uses a bunch of kung fu moves and fights them off, people say stuff that we have no idea what they're talking about. Of course then the scene shifts to Neo, an average ordinary guy who's computer is searching for articles on a person called, Morpheus. All of a sudden his computer seems to be talking to him, saying Wake up. This is another example of verbal irony. Then the computer says The Matrix has you... Once again the movie is addressing the audience at the same time. Then to prove the point that the person hacking Neo's computer is watching him and means business, it says Knock Knock, Neo, right before we hear the sound of someone at Neo's door.Then of course there's the nightclub scene and then we shift to Neo being late for work. This is a huge foreshadowing situation. Neo's boss says, You think that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. This is a respected software company because every employee understands that they are part of a whole. Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forward, or you choose to find yourself another job. I'll leave it to you to figure where the similarities to this conversation and the plot of the movie lie.Obviously, the dialogue is brilliant. It's almost like everytime someone says something there's a deeper meaning to it. Anyone who says this movie is crap because they don't understand obviously wasn't paying attention. You need to listen closely to the first 45 minutes to really and truly understand exactly what the Matrix is. If you still don't understand, watch it again. And again until you get it. This is one of those movies that you can watch it over and over and understand a little more about it and that makes it all the more interesting.I love the way this movie tries to make it seem like the actual audience is also in the Matrix. This part is made obvious when Morpheus says You believe it is the year 1999. which is the year this movie first came out, of course. There are other ways though, that this movie tries to connect to the audience (As I have explained above). Not only does it answer the question of the Matrix, but brings up another one Can we really trust our senses? How do we really know what is real and what is not? Even in the 3rd movie this continues, where it challenges our own compassion Are you fighting for truth, Mr. Anderson? Perhaps peace, could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose, and all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself.This movie also goes beyond other movies to challenge the growth of technology. We all already know about artificial intelligence. How do we know that machines with an intellect that matched ours could remain under our control? There have been other movies that have the classic Science has gone too far plotline, but this movie takes it to a new level as well as questioning the entire human existence. The thing that really scares people about this movie is the fact that even though we say it's not true, judging by the acceleration in the advance in technology, it could happen.Now to go on with the things other people are saying about this movie fantastic special effects. I have no problem agreeing with them whatsoever. The Kung Fu scenes were also great. I don't want to imagine how long it took to train the actors for those scenes.The only complaints I have about this movie (and in fact the whole trilogy) is that Neo never smiles. If he ever did, it was only once or twice. Another thing is that Neo also says Why? or What do you mean? almost too much to the point where you want to smash something into the TV screen. But please, try to ignore this. Yes, i will be the first to admit it's annoying, but it doesn't totally stink up the movie. Also, the sequels weren't as amazing as the first movie, but these days, what sequel doesn't suck?Like I said before, this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't explain what makes it so interesting, but it's like what Morpheus says No one can really be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.

This film stands as one of the greatest slasher films made.Soavi doesn't use the cheap tricks(except the black cat jump out in the beginning, but I swear that was put in as a joke) to gain scares, he uses atmosphere and a more human killer. The sets used in this film made me giddy when scenes would start. When our heroine awakens at the end and walks out to look upon an entirely black and blue set, knowing the killer is hidden somewhere in the theatre, I just cringed with happiness and fear. Soavi doesn't waste our time in this one either, he doesn't worry about creating a mystery of the killers identity, we learn very early on much like we did in Halloween and then we start the killings. What I find so great about the film, is that he doesn't try the fear involving jump outs, he creates tension. That is the reason I love this film so much, and why Halloween also stands as one of my top slasher flicks. He creates situations that you can imagine yourself being in, and that is where the constant fear comes from. Things like the guy left behind in the freshly pitch black theatre collecting his money as the rest of the group runs off without him. Along with that we have the girl who locks herself in a dressing closet to avoid the killer in the costume room. My favorite scene though would have to be after the heroine wakes up, she finds her way to the back and walks down a black and dimly lit very LONG hallway with doors on either side and the camera pans with her, following each step, this entire scene had my stomach jumping with delight. The killer is also human in this which is a relief. He is not all knowing, with each person he kills it is entirely believable that anyone could have found them there. Whether it be from the noise they made, or the fact that he was watching them all along, you won't see anyone disappear and hide only to have the killer somehow be directly behind them. I am a sucker for atmosphere movies and more realistic situations, if you like either, check this out )But you must give negative credit where it is due also, so here is some of that. It seems as if with each point we reached that needed to tell a plot point in order to advance the story, the plot points just don't make sense. In the beginning when the two girls decide that a minor sprained ankle is worth sneaking out to a mental institute to get it looked at just seemed like a very rushed and a kind of who cares, it works idea. The director telling the girl to hide the keys was also very stupid to me, why didn't he just hide them himself? Is not like he would have been tempted to leave. And the last I can think of right now, when our heroine is knocked out(an important point) it is done so in an exceptionally lame, and in a manner that makes no sense at all. There are a few more scenes that just make you say What? why??, but I guess it does work, because it is minor in comparison to the rest of the film.

It has everything that an MTV generation boy or girl could want, all neatly packaged in this gem of a movie. I must say the book was amazing, I loved it, it really gave some fresh ideas to life, and why we act the way we act. But i feel the movie is a better medium in which to show this to mass audience. First things first, every actor in this film is marvellous, a joy to watch. Edward Norton is God, when it comes to really nailing a character and slipping into a role, he is close to DeNiro. Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto all are a pleasure to watch. But I must say this film is about one man, Tyler Durden... ladies and gentlemen... Brad Pitt rocked in this. I could never possibly imagine anybody else in this role, he magnificently slips into a potentially hypocritical role, looking good and acting the part, my hats off.

I totally disagree.I think this is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest vampire movie and one of the best action movies in the last 10 years. This is high praise indeed, but permit me to explain why...It opens with one of the most original beginnings with the bloodbath club scene. This is fantastic. The use of red against the dark, eerie backdrop of the club is excellent, as is the pumping crescendo of the soundtrack. Then in steps Wesley. This is the part he was born to play. The arrogant smirk, the tough exterior, the 'do not mess with me approach', allows him to relax and enjoy playing this comic book hero to the max.Stephen Dorff as Frost is also excellent. He steals the show in many of his scenes. He is cold, calculated, arrogant and evil. He is also very stylish and wears a cool shirt for most of the movie. Which brings me along to the costumes. Blade's long black leather coat, in fact all of his leather gear, along with the guns and weaponry, is original and cool. In fact, does 'The Matrix' not copy and borrow heavily from 'Blade' - which came out a year before the much acclaimed 'Matrix'? I know this is very controversial, but I really do think that 'The Matrix' owes a great deal to 'Blade'. From the costumes, to the use of wires in the fight scenes, the fighting choreography in general and a lot of the cinematography are all original in Blade, but then copied, and admittedly expanded, in the 'Matrix'. Any responses to that? Because I know that there are many die hard 'Matrix' fans out there who will be p*ssed at that, but before you lambaste me, check out both films again and then respond.Oh and Blades tattoo is the coolest on film (along with George Clooney in 'From Dusk Till Dawn').OK, weaknesses, there are a couple. Firstly that annoying N'Bushe Wright, with her bad acting and her annoying glances and frowns, and secondly some of the red blobby explosive globules are not brilliantly well done, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise superb film.And to finish the film, the final action set piece does not disappoint. Again, Snipes is masterful as the arrogant (and a very adept martial artist) and confident Blade, as he strides around the temple kicking the crap out of everything that gets in his path. Once more, this scene is accompanied with a great tune, adding to the brilliant soundtrack.This truly is a cult classic film, and one that everyone should watch.

Although, since particularly the Wu-Tang clan has established itself in the hiphop scene, the phenomenon of a big black guy, looking like a bad hiphop mammajamma, from whom you might expect nothing but rage, violence and raw toughness being reflected into the world, instead having a mental interior of a calm and wise orientally oriented person, like a buddhist or a certain kind of martial artist would have, is nothing new anymore, this phenomenon itself is pretty original, and Forest Whitaker does a good job representing it. Then there is this thing of the Haitian ice cream venter, who is the closest thing to a friend Ghost Dog has, and who speaks only French, which Ghost Dog cannot understand at all, and who cannot understand himself a word of the English Ghost Dog speaks. Still he and Ghost Dog seem to have a certain kind of understanding, which especially is brought forward by them saying exactly the same things to each other, the one in French and the other in English. Then the ice cream man takes Ghost Dog to see a man working on a boat on a certain rooftop, and on trying to communicate, this boat builder turns out to speak Spanish. Funny, but with a certain mystique and underlying message, that makes it special. Then the conversation of the three gangsters about hiphop people giving themselves special names, and that this is similar to the indians.

And the blue group rapping in the park, thus bringing the latest news to the streets, in this case the recent hit by Ghost Dog. What to say of the heart attack the consiglieri of Mr. Vargo suffers upon seeing Ghost Dog with a gun in his hand. I mean, a high up gangster of that age, supposedly meaning that amount of experience, getting this exited about a man with a gun? Ask yourself. Then the cartoons Mr. Vargo watches. The trading of books going on between Ghost Dog, the little girl Pearline and Mr. Vargo's daughter. The killing of the bear hunters. The total dedication of Ghost Dog to his retainer. Imagine the difference between Better me than you, and Better you than me. Hard to find in a hired killer, I guess. The overall dialogue between all the characters in the movie, that seem to reflect various kinds of wisdom, and the inserted silences in scenes. The dog looking at Ghost Dog at certain points in the movie. And last but not least, the junkie like mugger trying to rob the nerdy looking oriental man, and being scared off by two very quickly and very well placed martial arts kicks.

He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words His judgment cometh and that right soon. The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the sisters, etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the redemption is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

This movie is not based on any of the Gospels, but is a fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict, based on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same title (which I haven't read to compare, but the film stands well on its own).Jesus here is truly human.  By all appearances he's a mentally-ill cross-maker from Nazareth.  For instance, he joins a group of men sitting in a waiting line at the prostitute's house, watching the peep show.  Because this film goes way beyond what the Bible says, and allows us to think in new ways, it's controversial.  What if Mary was a prostitute and Judas was a good guy?  What if Jesus was reluctant, and thought of God's directions as just voices in his head?  What if there was no literal devil at the temptation in the wilderness?  What if Jesus didn't even die on the cross?  Would there still be such a thing as Christianity?  It is through exploring the what ifs that we have enough options to decide for ourselves.  Faith is a personal matter, and our beliefs can not be decided by others.  One should not fear looking at all the possibilities, even if they are outside of the church's traditions.The point where this film diverges from traditional Christian thought is when Jesus is hanging on the cross, and a little girl appears as his guardian angel, to save him from death.  She takes him to his new life he marries Mary and has a family.  One day, he sees Paul preaching that Christ had died and was risen.  When Jesus confronts him and tells that he didn't die, Paul tells Jesus that people need God, and that my Jesus is much more important and much more powerful, because only a resurrected Jesus can give the people hope.  God will give the people what they need, whether or not it happens in the exact way it's told.  Jesus is an old man on his deathbed when the Romans destroy Jerusalem.The music is superb, Peter Gabriel's contribution of traditional rhythms done on traditional instruments.  The casting is good, for the most part, since Willem Defoe makes a good human Jesus and Harvey Keitel is convincing as a likeable strong disciple and unwilling traitor.  I was a little disappointed, being a David Bowie fan, that his role of Pilate was less than four minutes, and when asking if Jesus' miracles are good or bad magic, requesting a trick, I was reminded of his previous acting role in Labyrinth.  And although Paul gives Jesus a good message, his telling the list of sins during public preaching reminded me of a Monty Python monologue.As a whole I liked this film, since hearing opposing views cannot weaken a strong faith.

By all appearances he's a mentally-ill cross-maker from Nazareth.  For instance, he joins a group of men sitting in a waiting line at the prostitute's house, watching the peep show.  Because this film goes way beyond what the Bible says, and allows us to think in new ways, it's controversial.  What if Mary was a prostitute and Judas was a good guy?  What if Jesus was reluctant, and thought of God's directions as just voices in his head?  What if there was no literal devil at the temptation in the wilderness?

She takes him to his new life he marries Mary and has a family.  One day, he sees Paul preaching that Christ had died and was risen.  When Jesus confronts him and tells that he didn't die, Paul tells Jesus that people need God, and that my Jesus is much more important and much more powerful, because only a resurrected Jesus can give the people hope.

Jesus is an old man on his deathbed when the Romans destroy Jerusalem.The music is superb, Peter Gabriel's contribution of traditional rhythms done on traditional instruments.  The casting is good, for the most part, since Willem Defoe makes a good human Jesus and Harvey Keitel is convincing as a likeable strong disciple and unwilling traitor.  I was a little disappointed, being a David Bowie fan, that his role of Pilate was less than four minutes, and when asking if Jesus' miracles are good or bad magic, requesting a trick, I was reminded of his previous acting role in Labyrinth.  And although Paul gives Jesus a good message, his telling the list of sins during public preaching reminded me of a Monty Python monologue.As a whole I liked this film, since hearing opposing views cannot weaken a strong faith.

By the second time you see it, you're better able to fully appreciate the movie without becoming wrapped up in confusing or disturbing plot elements. Citizen Ruth is one of the best examples of this phenomenon I have ever seen. If you've seen it before, give it another chance. If you have not, give yourself some time to reflect after watching it. You will not be disappointed.Citizen Ruth is the story of a woman, Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern could not have been a better choice for this role), who has spent her difficult life making a lot of bad choices. She is a quick-tempered, irresponsible but naive junkie, who you can't help but root for. When she finds herself pregnant yet again, with no intention of giving up the model airplane glue and spray paint she regularly huffs, the judge makes it clear that with all of her previous run-ins with the legal system, Ruth had better take care of the problem or face serious charges.When the local pro-life group, the Babysavers (Kurtwood Smith was another excellent choice to play the leader of this group) catches wind of the judge's comments, they set out to save Ruth and her unborn child. This, of course, turns out in a hilariously disastrous way, when pro-choice gets involved to even up the playing field. Ruth's naivete makes her easy for both sides to manipulate, and neither pro-life nor pro-choice winds up looking very good.The ending to this movie is not, in my opinion, as predictable as it seems, and it really gives you something to think about - what is life and how much (both in material and ethereal terms) is it worth, particularly when it's placed in the hands of somebody who is in such poor control of her or his own?

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"20 May 2004","score":"17 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":"  Occasionally you will see a movie that may take you some time to decide whether you enjoyed it. By the second time you see it, you're better able to fully appreciate the movie without becoming wrapped up in confusing or disturbing plot elements. Citizen Ruth is one of the best examples of this phenomenon I have ever seen. If you've seen it before, give it another chance. If you have not, give yourself some time to reflect after watching it. You will not be disappointed.Citizen Ruth is the story of a woman, Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern could not have been a better choice for this role), who has spent her difficult life making a lot of bad choices. She is a quick-tempered, irresponsible but naive junkie, who you can't help but root for. When she finds herself pregnant yet again, with no intention of giving up the model airplane glue and spray paint she regularly huffs, the judge makes it clear that with all of her previous run-ins with the legal system, Ruth had better take care of the problem or face serious charges.When the local pro-life group, the Babysavers (Kurtwood Smith was another excellent choice to play the leader of this group) catches wind of the judge's comments, they set out to save Ruth and her unborn child. This, of course, turns out in a hilariously disastrous way, when pro-choice gets involved to even up the playing field. Ruth's naivete makes her easy for both sides to manipulate, and neither pro-life nor pro-choice winds up looking very good.The ending to this movie is not, in my opinion, as predictable as it seems, and it really gives you something to think about - what is life and how much (both in material and ethereal terms) is it worth, particularly when it's placed in the hands of somebody who is in such poor control of her or his own? Is it ethical to take advantage of somebody's lack of knowledge for your own gain, or is it even okay to try to change somebody's mind? Is Ruth Stoops a bad person, or just a misunderstood and desperate woman? And what about her final choice?This movie is worth a second look, and at a $3 rental fee, what do you have to lose?

Now granted to experience the movie to the fullest you have to have had seen or at least heard of the movies that it's making fun of. Now I'm an 80's baby so i caught everything down to the smallest reference. I like the way everything gelled together and made sense, where as the original Scary Movie, while very funny just seemed to throw too much into the mix. I personally was waiting for a movie like this for a long time after the barrage of crappy 90's teen movies. I mean these guys seemed to have been in the same meeting with some of these plots. But back to NATM. I can see where some of the so-called gross out jokes may turn a few people off, but you can't deny moments like the Varsity Blues inspired banana split scene, or the Prom Tonight musical number. I don't think any other spoof has hit the nail on the head so perfectly. There are not a lot of films you can just put on and laugh at because they are down right funny like this one. I highly recommend this movie, even if it means going back and watching every teen flick from the 80's just to get the jokes, it will be time well spent  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Not Another Teen Movie is a great example of how to make a great spoof.

There is nothing in this movie that could possibly rate it above a PG, max. I wouldn't even have reservations letting younger children watch House 2. A new house has a 20-something yuppie called Jesse (Arye Gross) move in with his girlfriend Kate (Lar Park-Lincoln). His friend Charlie (Jonathan Stark), a music agent, arrives with his new diva discovery Jana (Amy Yasbeck) to help him thru the unfamiliar first few days. The house is where Jesse's parents were killed when he was just a baby and it full of many curiosities.Crafted in a bizarre Gothic-Aztec style the house itself is a marvellous set and the many rooms and passages are as mysterious to us as they are to Jesse. Sitting on one of his many mantelpieces is a crystal skull that fascinates him for some reason. He even misses his housewarming party while studying the skull's history. His studies lead him to dig up the grave of his great, great grandfather, or Gramps (Royal Dano), where he discovers the old coot isn't dead just in limbo. The person who possesses the skull is granted eternal youth but it also warps the space-time continuum within the House.Gramps comes home with Jesse, is more enthralled by Kleenex boxes and TV than the mysteries around him and ducks for cover whenever someone from another time comes to steal the skull. Just like the first movie different rooms lead into different time zones. Jesse and Charlie have many hilarious adventures battling caveman, dinosaurs, Aztecs an evil cowboy called Slim. The one that killed Jesse's parents and betrayed Gramps over a century ago.House 2 has so much careless abandon and zany plot twists that it is totally impossible not to love this movie. The huge success of the first movie meant that this one was put into production literally and hour later and Ethan Wiley was given the budget and green light to do whatever he wanted. How often does happen today? Usually it would make for a bad movie considering this was the first movie Wiley directed. But it makes for an unusually cute and light-hearted supernatural romp.One of the weaker aspects of this sequel is that it has more SFX and animation by Phil Tippet's stop-motion workshop and less by Dreamquest. The matte paintings are gorgeous but the dated dinosaurs look hokey in a few shots. If you can just squint during these moments you won't notice.Bill Maher from TV's Politically Incorrect even manages to show up as a music producer who is interested in Yasbeck and mighty suspicious of Jesse's antics. John Ratzenberger (this makes both movies star one of the Cheers barflies) appears as a repairman\/adventurer who assists Jesse and Charlie battle some Aztecs. Look out for Kane Hodder (Jason) in an ape costume. Jesse adopts a fluffy, little baby pterodactyl and a strange creature called a Caterpuppy, a cross between...well you know. You need an open mind and a suspension of disbelief to swallow the outrageous goings on in this movie.The commentary is better than the one on the first movie. Ethan Wiley and Cunningham get on well and have no quibbles pointing out how crazy the film is. They discuss the budget, tell tales of the late Royal Dano and explain how many of the effects were pulled off within the constraints of the budget. One of the most interesting things they mention is that even tho the movie was stuck in between The Color Purple and Beverly Hills Cop II the kids still preferred House 2 as their fave movie of the summer. But because the movie didn't have it's own opening weekend, unlike the original, it wasn't as successful. Didn't stop 2 more sequels being made. A theatrical trailer is also included.Much like the first film the picture has been brilliantly transferred onto DVD. The 1.851 anamorphic picture looks super with very few glitches. Colors are rendered with pleasant accuracy and you wouldn't believe the low-budget origins when judging this picture. There is some grain during darker scenes but other than this the movie is looking great.The Mono soundtrack is not terribly engaging and most of the film's sound is centre-channel biased. But there's no hiss or pop to worry about. It may be Mono but it's clean and fresh sounding to me.
