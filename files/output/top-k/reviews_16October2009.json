I guess this role wasn't difficult to Streep in its essence as she played it already with Robert Deniro in Falling in Love but there was a challenge in this role and it is unfair not to be able to see it as a viewer! The challenge was for Meryle who is in her 40s to act as the teenage who fell in love and found the passion that she had never felt before in such an age and still be lovable to the conservative viewer. I, for one, loved her so much and wasn't intimidated by anything in the way she acted. I was totally compassionate with the character and I have to say that many of the comments didn't quite understand the character. It all lies in the scene where she says to Eastwood that she hoped she didn't bore him with her stupid chatting and he replies back that he could never think of her that way and that she was a smart woman. It's at the moment that she falls in love with him because she had lost her wit in the simple life of the simple man she got married. Just amazing! The story talks about the kind of love that you find once in your life with only one person who can get out the real you and make you feel your importance which life tends to bury down with its different loads.The movie had so many deep and beautiful scenes, particularly the scene where Francesca is in the car with her husband and Eastwood is in his right behind them hanging the necklace on the mirror as a sign for her to leave the car and runaway with him just like teenagers in love would do. Waw, this movie never stops to amaze me with all the details in it. Both characters never knew what love is and they found it together but not at the right time.There is also the scene where her husband is dying and he asks her if he ever did her wrong and she smiles knowing that she had taken the right choice by staying with her family. That's when duty calls and love no matter how big it is fails to surpass doing what's right.And believe me there is so much more to the movie and no matter how much has been said in the reviews, there is still more.

Rather bizarrely, the film was produced by Victor Lownes, of Playboy fame, who saw it as the ideal way to introduce Americans to the mysteries of the Python cult.Unlike the other three Python films (Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Monty Python's Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life), this one does not contain any original material. It consists of sketches taken from the first two series of the TV show, linked by some of Terry Gilliam's surreal animation sequences. The sketches were not taken direct from the television version but were specially remade for the film; some of them were slightly rewritten. I remember getting into a heated debate with a school friend, now a distinguished Professor of History at Oxford, about whether the famous Dead Parrot Sketch contains the lines It has rung down the curtain and joined the choir eternal; it turned out that I had seen the film version, which does contains these lines, and he had seen the television one, which doesn't.Although, as the Not the Nine O'clock News team once pointed out, Britain is still ostensibly a Python-worshipping country, Pythonesque humour is an acquired taste, and attempting to explain its appeal to anyone who is not a Python-worshipper is a forlorn hope. (I have tried, and failed miserably, with my wife). This is probably a generational thing; I belong to that generation which came of age in the seventies and which prided itself on its ability to repeat Python sketches verbatim, but even in that period there was a large part of the older generation which reacted to the show in much the same way as Graham Chapman's colonel. This is getting silly. And a bit suspect, I think. As for anyone born since 1980, and many people born since 1970, I suspect that they may regard the show with the same bafflement that my generation reserved for old radio shows like ITMA. (Did people really use to laugh at that?) Even as a practising Pythonist I have to admit that not all the sketches in And Now For Something Completely Different are hilarious; Musical Mice, for example, does not seem nearly so funny today as it probably once did, and some of the animation segments now look a bit dated. There is not much to link the various sketches together, so film does not flow in the same way as The Holy Grail or Life of Brian, both of which consisted of a series of linked sketches which together formed a coherent narrative. Nevertheless, much of the material here is brilliantly funny. My particular favourites include- Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook (In which John Cleese's Hungarian gentlemen is misled by an inaccurate phrasebook into repeating phrases like Please will you fondle my buttocks or My hovercraft is full of eels in the belief that he is asking something innocuous like Where is the railway station?) Hell's Grannies (A takeoff of the rather earnest tone of British television documentaries of the period).The Funniest Joke in the World (Or how our boys won the war by telling lethally funny jokes to the Germans).Dead Parrot (In which Cleese tries to persuade a sceptical Michael Palin that the parrot he has just purchased is dead, is a stiff, is no more, has ceased to be and has shuffled off this mortal coil. Perhaps the Pythons' best-known sketch).Vocational Guidance Counsellor (Or the sketch which did for the accountancy profession what the Black Death did for mediaeval Europe)Blackmail!

When I first saw this, I assumed that the Upper Class Twits were purely fictitious; it was only when I was invited by my then girlfriend to accompany her to a meeting of the Kensington and Chelsea Young Conservatives that I realised that the Pythons' satire was, if anything, rather understated.Like a number of other reviewers, I noticed that some of my favourite sketches (The Spanish Inquisition, The Australian Philosophers, Ministry of Silly Walks, etc.) were omitted from the film, although some of those that other reviewers were hoping to see, such as the exploding penguin, appeared in the third or fourth series of the programme and hence had not been written when this film was made. Nevertheless, I think that the Pythons were right to limit the amount of material and hence the length of the film to 90 minutes. The Monty Python format was originally designed for thirty-minute programmes, and would probably have become tedious if it had been dragged out to two hours or more.

Quaid plays an English professor-novelist who says, at some point, that English professors don't inspire the kind of passion to be victims of premeditated murders, which is I guess the point of D.O.A. not even English professors are completely without risk. But don't let this movie fool you. Being an English professor is sort of like flying, it's one of the safest ways to travel.The rest of the movie is a flashback entirely from Cornell's point of view in which the events leading up to his entry into the police precinct are retraced, which turns out to be two days. The movie shifts back into color, and we are taken back to the morning of two days ago in Cornell's writing class. The first hint of a plot is an unpublished novel written by one of Cornell's students, Nick Lang. Cornell had promised to read the work but delayed. After class, when Cornell is dashing off, presumably to another class or a meeting, Lang runs after him through the halls begging him to read his work. At one point, the student says he will kill himself if the prof dislikes his novel. A couple of scenes later, guess what? Lang is turned into mush, presumably having killed himself by throwing himself from an undergrad dorm window. Cornell's office just happens to be underneath, and the body hits the window before becoming a human pancake. (I have never heard of student dorms being above professor's offices on a college campus, but that is one of the many strange coincidences that permeate this film.) The incident does not stop Cornell and one of his colleagues from celebrating in his office shortly thereafter.But this is just the beginning. A whole back-story about Lang emerges about him having been put through college on the tab of an older wealthy lady who shot a prowler-thief in her house 20 years previous to the events of the movie. As an interesting twist, it turns out Lang is the son of the slain thief. On top of that, Cornell's marriage is ending. He gives his soon-to-be ex-wife a toy Ferris Wheel and she gives him the divorce papers, a rather odd exchange of Christmas presents. They attend a university social function where he makes a drunken fool of himself. But to add to the twists, the event is sponsored by guess who? The lady financing the late student-writer.It is never fully explained exactly what Cornell writes. We gather he had 4 or 5 successful books, probably novels, but has had nothing for the last four years. But what he is good at is the bottle. He goes to a bar and encounters a young woman who turns out to be the daughter of the lady of the student who killed himself. It's starting to sound like the nursery rhyme The Old Woman Who Swallowed a Fly. The girl is dragged out from the bar by one of the lady's henchmen leaving Cornell to his own devices. But he is not alone. He ends up drinking himself into a frenzy with one of his students, played by Meg Ryan.Next morning, he wakes up in Ryan's freshmen women's dorm room. One of thing about this movie Quaid keeps waking up in places after having conked out. Luckily, he did nothing that would be reported in the gossip column of the university newspaper and jeopardize his tenure. But he feels worse than having a hang-over. He drags himself to the university hospital only to find that he has been poisoned. The lethal chemistry has been absorbed by the body enough that he only has 24 to 48 hours to live. And now he has to find out not only the who but the why. Sort of like a Clue game for geniuses, DOA has many pieces of the puzzle, and Cornell has to figure out their arrangement before he falls over for the last time, and not just from the numerous shaken-not-stirred martinis. Martinis and poison go well together to accelerate the demise of the poor victim. When the pieces start falling into place, they are like nothing you would expect.The film moves a mile-a-minute, with people getting knocked over the head with things, people chasing through tar pits, and of course a short episode at the compulsory carnival. Seems like suspense movies from the 1980's until the mid-1990's always have a scene where the protagonist is stumbling through a carnival or bizarre of some sort late in the evening to add to his already dazed-and-confused condition. Some of the action is a bit unbelievable but what saves it are the fine performances of all the leads, particularly Quaid who keeps you wanting to find out with him what is really going on.

It's a deeply disturbing film, so much so that at one film festival, a man viewing it screamed I can't take it anymore, and ran out of the theater, intending to pull the fire alarm. Tim Roth was there, and it took him 20 minutes to calm him down.The film is about a British family who has just moved from London to Devon, England. They seem to be the perfect family the genial Dad (Ray Winstone), the Mum who has just given birth to a child (Tilda Swinton), and the teenage children, Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) and Jessie (Lara Belmont). But beneath the exterior lies an unspeakable secret.Incest is one of the most unspeakable crimes. It is abuse in every sense of the word sexually, physically, emotionally, psychologically. However, most victims stay silent, and the abuse continues. With The War Zone, Tim Roth brings the issue out into the open.The War Zone is a well-made film, but I found it somewhat uninvolving (then again, with a story like this, how involved would I want to be?). Part of the reason is that Roth uses a lot of emphasis on non-verbal communication. We know what the characters are feeling, but it doesn't translate to the audience. This is because our guide in this story, Tom, is not well-acted by Freddie Cunliffe. Tom is a sullen, brooding character, but Cunliffe's portrayal is flat and not very interesting. He is not adept at non-verbal communication, which is why many of the scenes are not as effective as they could be.Fortunately, the same cannot be said about Cunliffe's co-stars. Lara Belmont is stunning as Jessie. She is remarkably good at portraying Jessie's storm of feelings. Guilt, shame, fear are all evident in her performance. Ray Winstone shines as the likable Dad, and it is easy why no one would suspect him of doing something so evil. Tilda Swinton is great as well, although she doesn't have much to do except look after her newborn baby and appear oblivious to the horror going on around her. But that is important; incest is such a secretive crime that most people don't know is happening unless they are told.Tim Roth is one of the best character actors out there. But like Sean Penn, he's also a good director. He takes chances, and wants this story told in the best way possible. However, the film could have used a little more dialogue and a little less subtlety.I've heard people say that this film is not for everyone. While it's true that this film is intense and disturbing, I think that it IS for everyone. If people don't know about these crimes and their affect on the victims, then it won't stop. The DVD has a lot of information about incest, including helplines for victims, which is good. Don't let that fool you into thinking this is a preachy docudrama. This is a film that simply tells the story, and that is what makes it effective.

Tim Roth was there, and it took him 20 minutes to calm him down.The film is about a British family who has just moved from London to Devon, England. They seem to be the perfect family the genial Dad (Ray Winstone), the Mum who has just given birth to a child (Tilda Swinton), and the teenage children, Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) and Jessie (Lara Belmont). But beneath the exterior lies an unspeakable secret.Incest is one of the most unspeakable crimes. It is abuse in every sense of the word sexually, physically, emotionally, psychologically. However, most victims stay silent, and the abuse continues. With The War Zone, Tim Roth brings the issue out into the open.The War Zone is a well-made film, but I found it somewhat uninvolving (then again, with a story like this, how involved would I want to be?). Part of the reason is that Roth uses a lot of emphasis on non-verbal communication. We know what the characters are feeling, but it doesn't translate to the audience. This is because our guide in this story, Tom, is not well-acted by Freddie Cunliffe. Tom is a sullen, brooding character, but Cunliffe's portrayal is flat and not very interesting. He is not adept at non-verbal communication, which is why many of the scenes are not as effective as they could be.Fortunately, the same cannot be said about Cunliffe's co-stars. Lara Belmont is stunning as Jessie. She is remarkably good at portraying Jessie's storm of feelings. Guilt, shame, fear are all evident in her performance. Ray Winstone shines as the likable Dad, and it is easy why no one would suspect him of doing something so evil. Tilda Swinton is great as well, although she doesn't have much to do except look after her newborn baby and appear oblivious to the horror going on around her. But that is important; incest is such a secretive crime that most people don't know is happening unless they are told.Tim Roth is one of the best character actors out there. But like Sean Penn, he's also a good director. He takes chances, and wants this story told in the best way possible. However, the film could have used a little more dialogue and a little less subtlety.I've heard people say that this film is not for everyone. While it's true that this film is intense and disturbing, I think that it IS for everyone. If people don't know about these crimes and their affect on the victims, then it won't stop. The DVD has a lot of information about incest, including helplines for victims, which is good. Don't let that fool you into thinking this is a preachy docudrama. This is a film that simply tells the story, and that is what makes it effective.

Beetlejuice is an exception. It may not be an all-time comedy classic but it has stood the test of time. The film has so many moments which are, if not exactly classic, certainly memorable. The movie is certainly a bit out there but it is that quirkiness which provides so much of the movie's charm. You haven't seen many movies quite like this one.As our story begins we meet young New England couple Adam and Barbara Maitland, played charmingly by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis respectively. Yes, there once was a time when Alec Baldwin was capable of being charming. Anyhow our very charming couple are rather unfortunately about to find themselves quite dead. After a car accident they find themselves back in their home, rather unsure of how they got there. They will soon come to realize that they did not survive the accident. And thus begins their bizarre journey through the afterlife. Turns out they have to remain in their home for 125 years. Which wouldn't seem all that bad...until the Deetzes move in. The Maitlands find the Deetzes, with their big plans for remodeling the house, to be rather obnoxious and our ghosts are determined to scare them away. They will get sympathy from an unlikely source, the Deetzes' goth teen daughter Lydia, played beautifully by Winona Ryder, who can see the ghostly pair and relates to them a heck of a lot better than she does to her parents.Now am I forgetting anything? Oh yes, Beetlejuice himself, the bio-exorcist as played so memorably by Michael Keaton. It's easy to go this far not having mentioned Beetlejuice because in the grand scheme of things the character really isn't on the screen all that much. But when he is he certainly makes an impression. The movie gets an unmistakable jolt of energy every time the ghost with the most shows up. Keaton turns in a crude, bombastic, manic and often hilarious performance. And to be fair Beetlejuice, the movie, is often crying out for the energy Beetlejuice, the character, provides. The movie is a little flat at times but Keaton is there to prop it up when needed. Director Tim Burton created a fascinating world here and inhabited it with some great characters. Not everything in the movie works. Some of the effects look cheap (Burton will tell you intentionally so) and the story definitely has some lulls. But when the movie hits it hits big. There are some scenes here which will always be remembered very fondly. Most notably two scenes which make great use of the music of Harry Belafonte come to mind. All in all it's a movie which should leave you with a smile on your face and sometimes that's all you really need a movie to do.

The basic premise is that there exists a group of wealthy men who, tired of hunting animals, are prepared to pay up to $500,000 for the excitement of hunting and killing human beings. Their targets are selected from among the unemployed, homeless down-and-outs of New Orleans, normally former servicemen as their military training makes them harder targets to kill, thus affording greater sport to those pursuing them. (Hence the title of the film). Perhaps unusually for an action thriller, this one touches upon social issues in its clear concern for the plight of men who have served their country bravely but now find themselves rejected by society.The hero is Chance Boudreaux, an out of work Cajun merchant seaman who becomes involved with a young woman named Natasha Binder. Natasha is searching for her missing father, who it turns out was one of the men killed by the hunters.The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme (aka the Muscles from Brussels), who had followed another European former bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to Hollywood in the eighties. Neither man initially possessed any great acting talent, but by the early nineties Arnie had greatly improved his dramatic skills and he made some decent films, such as True Lies, during this period. Van Damme, however, showed no such improvement, and his performance in Hard Target is a characteristically wooden one. The Louisiana Cajun aspect to the film seems to have been deliberately contrived to allow Van Damme to play a character whose mother tongue is French, while keeping an American setting. (No American audience is going to want an action-adventure movie set in Paris or Brussels). The one thing in his favour is that, apart from Wilford Brimley's cameo as Chance's eccentric elderly uncle, the rest of the cast are no better, including his love interest Yancy Butler (aka the girl whose parents couldn't spell Nancy).The plot will not bear any too close inspection. We are asked to believe that the villains are not only ruthless but also ruthlessly efficient and well organised, able to conduct manhunts though the streets of a major city without anyone noticing. They also appear to have half the city's police and officials on their payroll and to have at their disposal enough firepower to wipe out a regiment. We are then asked to believe that, when confronted with what should be the fairly simple task of killing an unemployed drifter he proves to be more than a match for them and that when confronted by the hero they suddenly and miraculously lose their previously infallible ability to hit a moving target.And yet as an action thriller this is not a bad one. John Woo and other directors of a similar ilk are lucky that the action-adventure genre does not always require Olivier-calibre acting or coherent plots; if it did, most films of this type would be completely unwatchable. Woo gets the important things about this film right; the action sequences are well handled and the film is fast-paced enough for us to overlook its frequent absurdities. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Hard Target was the first American film directed by the Chinese director John Woo.

The film accurately portrays the race tensions of the time, summed up by when Gary's girlfriend won't shake hands with Junius. And when Gary's mother doesn't WANT to get to know Junius.I've seen the movie so many times, but I never tire of it. Truly worth watching.

For the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one, with a small budget, insultingly bad written script and everything that goes with it.It's silly that with all the money going around in the Christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient funds to make a decent movie with. I'm not a religious, so I couldn't care less really but film-making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance. In that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity.The low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy B-movie like feeling.But what's hurting this movie more is its writing. The stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then I'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it's being insulting to its viewers.I also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times. Seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up. I just couldn't cared less really at times.Still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end, when its story gets more focused on its essence. Still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned, there are far worser one to watch out there, though I don't think this movie will win over any new souls.4\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2009","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end.

Karloff is Cabman John Gray who makes money by taking corpses from graves in order to provide subjects for a medical class taught by a Dr. Wolfe Toddy MacFarlane (Henry Daniell). A Donald Fettes (Russell Wade) has been appointed his assistant. It's Fettes who persuades Toddy (as Gray-an old acquaintance-likes to call MacFarlane) to help give surgery to cure a Georgina Marsh (Sharyn Moffett)-a young girl-as a favor to her mother (Rita Corday). Guess who provides another subject?...Directed by Robert Wise who provides Lewton with yet another suitably atmospheric horror film that actually is quite scary in a scream-your-lungs kind of way when we get to the ending. In contrast to his professional role in The Raven, Lugosi is just a servant named Joseph under MacFarlane who is always a bit startled by him. When the two iconic horror men finally share the screen, the tables have been turned in more ways than one compared to their fates in The Raven. After this and one last turn as Dracula in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, Lugosi would suffer a career decline he would never recover from. So this is truly one last iconic moment between Karloff and Lugosi. One more player who deserves mention is singer Donna Lee who warbles beautifully before her fate is revealed. Just about everything is well done here, so on that note, I highly recommend The Body Snatcher. P.S. Ms. Atwater is another performer who I just found out here was a native of my birthtown of Chicago, Ill.
