People in the UK and Australia especially... do you have nothing else to do there but sit around and pan movies in the most insulting way possible? Does it make you feel powerful and purposeful to try and be pithy and witty when you blast the hard work of others? Clearly your attempts at total blasting of this film is a case of those that can, do, and those that can't, review. I am sure you get a kick out of doing this to most films you see, but you miss the mark. GET A LIFE!!! No one is forcing you to watch any film, so if you don't like this film move on. There is a LOT of talent in this film although maybe they did not have much to work with within the scope of the film. This flick's kids for example have all been successful (Mila Kunis of course on That 70's show with Santa co-star Don Stark) Adam Wylie has starred on Broadway in Into The Woods and is guest starring on everything. Aria Curzon was on Without a Trace on Christmas day and I have seen her in a lot of things as well. All talented. Same with adults...all working much of the time, Steve Valentine I see all over for example. Like I said, this film may not be perfect but it is a cute family film with a silly but fun storyline and it is a heartwarming zany comedy that really is ok for kids. No bad language in it and though a tad violent in moments, it is still not gratuitous or graphic, and there are good life messages to take from the film. Cute warm holiday movie. Rent it for your kidlets. If you are a kind hearted person who likes happy endings and a bit of silly humor you will giggle and enjoy this film.

I don't have the patience nor do I believe that by the time it arrives I'll be that eager to watch it. This is not so with the film, Truly, Madly, Deeply.It started off that I wanted to watch this film for Alan Rickman alone, as a dedicated fan I heard that this was one of his best and am inclined to agree. So I watched, and became engrossed in this wondrous little film that unraveled before me and Alan became a plus. Juliet Stephenson is magnificent, never before have I seen a person on film with such raw emotion. Her sobbing I miss him, I miss him, I miss him... is so powerful that I believe her when she states them.The quirky sweet and endearing thing of this film are the fact that the ghosts aren't haunted tortured souls. They're just a bit lonely, cold and like to watch Five easy Pieces and old Charlie Chaplin films. How can't you love them?Alan Rickman playing the dry, witty Jamie is a nice change of pace for a man who so often is 'rubberstamped' as the 'villain', when he obviously has so much range. This is evident in this film, the man doesn't even have to speak and you feel what he means.Juliet Stephenson as the endearing Nina is a real treat. I haven't seen her in as much as I'd like to, but she is one of those rare actresses' that seems to be her character inside and out. She has got a gift, for rarely has an actress ever reduced me to tears.I'm not going to lie, I do cry at this film, time and time again. Not quiet little sniffles into a Kleenex either. These are racking sobs that I try to muffle by holding my hand over my mouth. I save myself from constant humiliation by watching this brilliant film alone. But this isn't a gut-wrenching-why-should-I-go-on-I-want-to-throw-myself-over-a-building sort of movie. It's just moving.And still to this day, I am adamant that one of the most believable scenes in movie history is when Jamie collapses into bed with an overly hot Nina (As he has the heat on full blast) and murmurs something to the equivalent to They're nice guys aren't they? (If you've seen it, perhaps you know.) You see, they're so believable as a couple in this film. You don't see the stiff kisses or fake smiles that you do in such other Blockbusters. There's grumbling and wincing and erupting into sporadic peals of laughter and all that make real couples real and enjoyable.It's one of those films you can watch over and over, because when you do it doesn't matter if you keep crying about it, or that the ghosts aren't see through, only cold... you feel changed somehow...ugh...that sounds impossible lame doesn't it?Alright, enough flowery wording to describe to you how much I loved this film.

I must admit I must have seen it way over a dozen times and I still love it. Truthfully though, without big Al Pacino, it'd be awful.In Scent Of A Woman, Chris O'Donnell's Charlie Simms is placed in an awkward situation at school whilst simultaneously agreeing to spend Thanksgiving with an obnoxious bitter blind ex-soldier. The soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, is played with mouth dropping beauty by Al Pacino. I confess when British TV created their top 100 actors ever and Al Pacino was number one, I felt kinda cheated as for the films they suggested, I didn't feel it was anything special. If you watch the guy in this film though, it must go down as one of the finest performances of all time.

Say what you will about it, but one thing it wasn't was boring. But that very thing is what you can find in abundance in `The Mothman Prophecies' - a movie so fall-asleep dull and lacking a clear vision that I am amazed it is from the same director. `Mothman' falls into a chasm as its finished product tries to meld the horror, monster and thriller genera into one. If it is a monster movie it is without a monster as we never really see the mythical winged Mothman. If it a horror movie, it is not nearly as creepy as it could be. If it is a thriller, it is so caught up in the goofy horror\/monster movie points to be taken seriously.The script from Richard Hatem, supposedly based on a book and true accounts, gives us nearly 2 hours of exposition and doesn't add up to any payoff, explanation or hypothetical internal logic. Talented stars Richard Gere and Laura Linney show their faces here, but are clearly slumming. Much of their conflicts here consist of going from place to place while nobody believes them. `Mothman' wants to pose questions, but doesn't exactly inspire us to ponder answers. It becomes abundantly clear, Hatem just doesn't have the imagination to think up any creative payoff or give the characters any real run for their money. He barely even delves into the legends. In lue of an actual story or plot, he lazily throws out a few mysterious occurrences to give the movie the semblance that something is or might happen. Even if all the dots don't quite connect. Nothing happens here, plain and simple, from beginning to end. Pellington himself has shifted into Neutral for this effort. Heavy on atmosphere, but crawling at a snails pace it lulls the viewer away from the Mothman and towards the Sandman. The one thing that Pellington gets right here is bringing back Tomandandy from his last film for an appropriate score. It's all a real waste on what could have been an interesting basic premise.

The US military tries to usurp the rule of Aideed but, after 6 weeks, he is still in power and the US demands faster action.  When the military are informed of the location of two of Aideed's top men a mission is put together to catch them. However, when one of the Black Hawk helicopters is hit and crashes, several soldiers are left behind enemy lines, starting a battle for survival and rescue against the hordes of armed Somalis.While most reviews seem to be of one extreme or the other, I think it is important to try and look at the film in the two ways that it should have existed and weight it up on that basis.  First of all, as a war movie there is very little wrong with it.  It is realistic and powerful and you do leave with the feeling of having been in a battle.  The lack of characters is not a major problem as all is required that we know is that these are soldiers - not what family they have or what they are like as people.  However this film would have been much better if it had been totally fictional and had existed just as a flag waving tale to American bravery and dedication to the fight.Sadly this is not a fiction al story, it is based on a true story and it is a lesser film because of what it chooses to omit or spin in it's telling. Like I said, this was a very good film if you want a reasonably intense depiction of being in a battle, however it should have been an anti-war film, such were the lessons to be taken from the events of October 1993. However, because an antiwar film will never sell in post-11\/9 America, the film cannot go down that road.  While it is generally regarded that the US attempt to launch an attack in this way was foolish and that the result was a `fiasco' none of that is shown here.  There is no room for comment on the wisdom of the action when there's cheering to be done.  In fact at one point one of the characters even explains the events by just saying `sh*t happens'.This is just one example of how blindly patriotic this film is.  Does this take away from the impact of the film - no. Does it take away from how good a film it is - yes, and it should.  The film never stops shouting about how heroic and upright the US soldiers are and, in fairness, those involved deserve respect.  However the film ignores the fact that a significant number of those involved in the rescue and the fighting were actually Malaysian (who here are limited to serving glasses of water to the returning US soldiers.  Given that the film lacks characters it would have been no problem to replace white US faces with Malaysian ones (they all end up covered in dirt and blood anyway!).  However, to do that would have required the film to suggest that the US needs external help to bail it out - again not an idea that an audience would take.While the film has no characters it is not a major problem, although I would have liked the US soldiers to at least not be all angels!  The cast were mostly good despite not really ever having to act, I was surprised how many well known faces were involved - Bana, Harnett, McGregor, Sizemore, Fincher, Sheppard, Bloom, Piven and Coates to name a few.  However there are no Somali characters to speak of (in fact - no Somalis at all! The extras were from other nations despite not looking anything like the people of that region).  The film early on has Harnett's character express respect and interest in the Somali people, but the film doesn't.  There is no back story about the country and there is nothing to suggest that this country is anything other than armed gangs of angry black people who are killing the good soldiers.  An antiwar film shouldn't really paint one side good and the other bad in a situation like this, and that was the point I understood the film wasn't trying to be antiwar - it was pro-US.It is a shame that the film spares no thought for these people - yes they killed the US soldiers, but the US killed over 1000 of them during the rescue mission.  There's nothing wrong with the film bigging up the US soldiers, but to just totally ignore this fact other than a caption at the end is basic.  The caption may as well have read - `1000 of them died too but they weren't American so f**k them.'  The film's core is the dramatic and violent rescue mission and I can forgive them making it an `all-US' operation given the fact that it is an US film.  However the film made a conscious choice to remove everything about the story that would be critical (which is a lot) of the US, for this reason it suffered a lot - a film that criticises politics and the whole idea of war does not have to do the same for the soldiers.  These men deserve respect no matter how they got there - but the film wrongly carries this respect over to the whole concept and situation. This was a mistake.I have gone on longer about the bad stuff than the good, so let me make it clear this is a very good film if you are looking for a war film that is dramatic and very realistic.  Scott is a good director and he does very well to make the audience feel like they are in the midst of a battle.  I didn't want it to push an antiwar agenda but I didn't expect it to be as flagwavingly naive as this!  Of course it did well - the audience wanted a film that supports the military, it's just a shame that they didn't just make up a story rather than taking a real one and doing it so badly. There are other people in the world and they are still people regardless of race or beliefs - that this film fails to take that into account is a major failing no matter how exciting or realistic it is.

Does this take away from the impact of the film - no. Does it take away from how good a film it is - yes, and it should.  The film never stops shouting about how heroic and upright the US soldiers are and, in fairness, those involved deserve respect.  However the film ignores the fact that a significant number of those involved in the rescue and the fighting were actually Malaysian (who here are limited to serving glasses of water to the returning US soldiers.  Given that the film lacks characters it would have been no problem to replace white US faces with Malaysian ones (they all end up covered in dirt and blood anyway!).  However, to do that would have required the film to suggest that the US needs external help to bail it out - again not an idea that an audience would take.While the film has no characters it is not a major problem, although I would have liked the US soldiers to at least not be all angels!  The cast were mostly good despite not really ever having to act, I was surprised how many well known faces were involved - Bana, Harnett, McGregor, Sizemore, Fincher, Sheppard, Bloom, Piven and Coates to name a few.  However there are no Somali characters to speak of (in fact - no Somalis at all! The extras were from other nations despite not looking anything like the people of that region).  The film early on has Harnett's character express respect and interest in the Somali people, but the film doesn't.  There is no back story about the country and there is nothing to suggest that this country is anything other than armed gangs of angry black people who are killing the good soldiers.  An antiwar film shouldn't really paint one side good and the other bad in a situation like this, and that was the point I understood the film wasn't trying to be antiwar - it was pro-US.It is a shame that the film spares no thought for these people - yes they killed the US soldiers, but the US killed over 1000 of them during the rescue mission.  There's nothing wrong with the film bigging up the US soldiers, but to just totally ignore this fact other than a caption at the end is basic.  The caption may as well have read - `1000 of them died too but they weren't American so f**k them.'  The film's core is the dramatic and violent rescue mission and I can forgive them making it an `all-US' operation given the fact that it is an US film.  However the film made a conscious choice to remove everything about the story that would be critical (which is a lot) of the US, for this reason it suffered a lot - a film that criticises politics and the whole idea of war does not have to do the same for the soldiers.  These men deserve respect no matter how they got there - but the film wrongly carries this respect over to the whole concept and situation. This was a mistake.I have gone on longer about the bad stuff than the good, so let me make it clear this is a very good film if you are looking for a war film that is dramatic and very realistic.  Scott is a good director and he does very well to make the audience feel like they are in the midst of a battle.  I didn't want it to push an antiwar agenda but I didn't expect it to be as flagwavingly naive as this!  Of course it did well - the audience wanted a film that supports the military, it's just a shame that they didn't just make up a story rather than taking a real one and doing it so badly. There are other people in the world and they are still people regardless of race or beliefs - that this film fails to take that into account is a major failing no matter how exciting or realistic it is. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2004","score":"30 out of 49 people found the following review useful","review":"  In Somalia, warlord Farah Aideed controls the people and uses hunger as a weapon by stopping UN food supplies reaching his people.  The US military tries to usurp the rule of Aideed but, after 6 weeks, he is still in power and the US demands faster action.  When the military are informed of the location of two of Aideed's top men a mission is put together to catch them. However, when one of the Black Hawk helicopters is hit and crashes, several soldiers are left behind enemy lines, starting a battle for survival and rescue against the hordes of armed Somalis.While most reviews seem to be of one extreme or the other, I think it is important to try and look at the film in the two ways that it should have existed and weight it up on that basis.  First of all, as a war movie there is very little wrong with it.  It is realistic and powerful and you do leave with the feeling of having been in a battle.  The lack of characters is not a major problem as all is required that we know is that these are soldiers - not what family they have or what they are like as people.  However this film would have been much better if it had been totally fictional and had existed just as a flag waving tale to American bravery and dedication to the fight.Sadly this is not a fiction al story, it is based on a true story and it is a lesser film because of what it chooses to omit or spin in it's telling. Like I said, this was a very good film if you want a reasonably intense depiction of being in a battle, however it should have been an anti-war film, such were the lessons to be taken from the events of October 1993. However, because an antiwar film will never sell in post-11\/9 America, the film cannot go down that road.  While it is generally regarded that the US attempt to launch an attack in this way was foolish and that the result was a `fiasco' none of that is shown here.

I can do neither.Instead of enjoyment, throughout this film I was annoyed. I can imagine how the stereotyped groups in the film would react (the blind, Chinese, French, homosexuals, transvestites) and despite being in none of these groups I thought this was laughing at someone else's expense was unacceptable. They couldn't even get the two apparent German homosexual space characters right; the two of them sounded Welsh! (No disrespect) If the writers wanted to use the spoof kind of humour, why didn't they take notice of Austin Powers, and why mock such groups instead of mocking teenager's lifestyles like in American Pie in an intelligent way. I mean, if these two 'idiots' are supposed to stoners then what indicates to the audience that this is the case, they resemble no stereotype I am aware of of stoners?The jokes in the film are very poor and some last for far too long- such as the Chinese takeaway scene and the tattoo scene, and you begin to get very angry as the joke continues beyond your temperament. The storyline is utterly ridiculous which I suppose is what is it meant to be but it is far too over-exaggerated. Two teens get intoxicated and can't remember what happened the night before, so what? Do you need to get stupidly drunk to be popular? Didn't think so. I did also notice that the director tried hard to avoid continuity errors- he always made sure that when the two main characters either ate or had rubbish bins tipped on their heads they'd bear the scars afterwards. The group of apparent 'stoner bashers' are likely the group off Grease, what's that all about? The film is real cheesy but not in a half-decent, 'scary movie' kind of way. The SFX towards the end are terrible even though the film was made in 2000 and called breasts who-who's is going to far; its not remotely funny (like the entire film then, really)I'm afraid I can't think of anything good to say about this film, apart from it's thankfully less than 2 hours long.

Both Goodman and Stevie are perfectly cast and Johnny T. is just perfect as the Jesus.
