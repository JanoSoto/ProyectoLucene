If you take it seriously as cinema or expect it to scare you, all but the young and inexperienced will be disappointed.

At any rate I highly recommend the DVD version, and in particular the writer\/director\/actor commentary, which despite the youth and inexperience of all three of them (this is the first movie for both writer and director) is by far the most informative I have yet heard as far as the filmmaking art and what kind of events go on behind the scenes that we rarely hear about.  They pack the entire movie with non-stop commentary on everyone and everything in the movie and several things not in the movie, as opposed to the U.S. Marshals DVD for instance, which asked me to skip ahead several chapters more than once because the director simply had nothing to say about the movie through those sections.  And I think accusations of plagerism from Scream are a bit unfair, since this is really just another movie in the same genre, and Scream is such a shining example of the tongue-in-cheek horror movie\/dark comedy that everything else that fits the same genre for a while is going to be accused of copying.  I really don't see that this is a copy or rip-off of Scream any more than I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream2.  That said, the scripting is a little ham-fisted at times, and some of the humor isn't as intelligent (or as funny) as the niche they are aiming for demands.  The guys on the commentary track admit to quite a bit of the ham-fistedness in good humor, and give their own explanation of how it works with the theme of the movie. If you appreciate the visual quality of a movie as much as I do, this one is pretty impressive considering the youth of the crew and the relatively low budget of the film.  Much of the look was ripped-off from other movies (the movie is rife with homages to other movies, particularly in the horror genre, and these go right down to stylistic cues as detailed as camera movement), as other reviewers would say, but I am inclined to give the writer and director the benefit of the doubt and agree that these are appropriate homages to the cheap horror genre.Anyway, if you can't take a joke, or if you can't let go of your intellectual bloodlust enough that you can see the joke behind the camp, then do not see this movie.

This is an animated film made for adults. After watching this film, I have come upon the realization that most children would get bored and stop watching. Yes Fantasia has its dry parts, otherwise it is the best animated film I have seen.The use of music from such masters as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Tonchielli form the basis for the seven animated shorts that make up this film. Other than short breaks in between segments used to describe the next episode and a brief intermission used to explain sound, the film is basically all animation. Walt Disney had the right idea to go for perfection when making this film and the animators he hired sure did a splendid job.My favourite short was the fourth of the film. Called The Right of Spring, it shows the formation of our planet all the way until the end of the dinosaurs. Starting off with a visually enthralling volcano sequence, we eventually see life change from one-celled organisms to crustaceans to fish to reptiles and then to dinosaurs. The whole dinosaur sequence was the best in the film with the close resemblance of the animated type to the real thing. The atmosphere and movements that surrounded the creatures was perfect, all flowing naturally until their death which is quite interestingly explained without words.The short titled The Sorcerer's Apprentice showcased Mickey Mouse and was quite entertaining, although rather short. Beethoven's 6th, The Pastoral was also done extremely well using the symphony piece in a mythological setting complete with centaurs, musical cherubs and half-man, half-horse characters and of course the typically fat leader who is having a jolly good time. Finally the seventh sequence using Moussorgska's Night On Bald Mountain showcased the transformation of all that is evil into Ave Maria and all things that make up heaven. The beast used in this short is rather frightening and would probably give many children nightmares for many nights to come. The short itself plays well to end the film, although could have ended on a greater high.I like the fact that some Disney films do not follow the formula that they use in all of their films today and in the past few decades. Perhaps Disney could try and create another film like Fantasia (I've heard of something called Fantasia 2000 , but have no clue as to what it is all about) although most people would probably stay away from it just like most people stayed away from Fantasia in 1940. I fully recommend this film to any film lover.8\/10 stars.

Starting off with a visually enthralling volcano sequence, we eventually see life change from one-celled organisms to crustaceans to fish to reptiles and then to dinosaurs. The whole dinosaur sequence was the best in the film with the close resemblance of the animated type to the real thing. The atmosphere and movements that surrounded the creatures was perfect, all flowing naturally until their death which is quite interestingly explained without words.The short titled The Sorcerer's Apprentice showcased Mickey Mouse and was quite entertaining, although rather short. Beethoven's 6th, The Pastoral was also done extremely well using the symphony piece in a mythological setting complete with centaurs, musical cherubs and half-man, half-horse characters and of course the typically fat leader who is having a jolly good time. Finally the seventh sequence using Moussorgska's Night On Bald Mountain showcased the transformation of all that is evil into Ave Maria and all things that make up heaven. The beast used in this short is rather frightening and would probably give many children nightmares for many nights to come. The short itself plays well to end the film, although could have ended on a greater high.I like the fact that some Disney films do not follow the formula that they use in all of their films today and in the past few decades. Perhaps Disney could try and create another film like Fantasia (I've heard of something called Fantasia 2000 , but have no clue as to what it is all about) although most people would probably stay away from it just like most people stayed away from Fantasia in 1940.

This is an animated film made for adults. After watching this film, I have come upon the realization that most children would get bored and stop watching. Yes Fantasia has its dry parts, otherwise it is the best animated film I have seen.The use of music from such masters as Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Tonchielli form the basis for the seven animated shorts that make up this film. Other than short breaks in between segments used to describe the next episode and a brief intermission used to explain sound, the film is basically all animation.

I find it tragic that there is a large amount of people that don't, can't or won't see Mamet for what he is. A cultural genius. As one of our time's greatest writers, I find it incredible that there would be so many negative comments regarding this movie and the mechanical, unbelievable dialog that is found only in the great works of David Mamet. I see the quality of his work, the quality that is lacking in many of the major motion pictures today. The quality is this- I can think of no other writer\/director\/producer that can create such a powerful suspense film without killing half the entities in the script and either violently ceasing the operation of the automobiles of the remaining half or unintelligently placing them together for a mindlessly gratuitous sex scene. I find it sad, sad indeed that we've grown to such an apocalypticly cultured society that demands these vital elements in a movie for an inclusion into some type of- some type of what I don't know, but it really is sad that Mamet cannot be appreciated by everyone.

Most movies require a certain `suspension of reality' to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a `Middle Eastern' country. The US government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the Pilot's son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission.The problem I have with the movie is that it depicts the US Air Force as one colossal joke. In the movie you'll find that Doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two F-16's, all the munitions, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this base seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old kid is fully qualified to pilot an F-16!If that wasn't enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things `blow up'. Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires off AIM-9 Missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for `Air Intercept Missile', meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the AIR. He also fires off 15-20 missiles, where the maximum an F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9's.  The movie also lacks continuity. You'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. Also, 20MM doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it's mostly used for self-defense.I could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but I won't bore you. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather slim. Most military movies deal either with the Army, Navy or Marines.

I thought the movie was technically well-made, with a great opening title sequence and moments of true suspense. A pointless, but entertaining sequel, is what Halloween 5 is best described as. But while watching the film, I found it is a worthy and pretty good Halloween installment, marked by good performances especially by Danielle Harris, and as usual Donald Pleasence.The opening sequence is quite clever, with a Michael Myers, slicing and dicing his way through the credits, but slicing a pumpkin. They show the ending of Halloween 4, which shows Mike trying to get in the truck, to which Jamie Lloyd and her stepsister, Rache; are in. They stop, he falls, and stands back up. The police shoot him, and think he is dead. Jamie goes and checks, but Michael grabs Jamie, and the police shoot again, and he falls to his death into a mine shaft. But alas, he's not dead.After the horror and the ending of Halloween 4, young Jamie Lloyd, is in a hospital, and bed-ridden. Still having nightmares about that terrifying night, she still thinks Michael Myers isn't dead, and is coming after her once again to kill her. Dr. Loomis, whose character seems a bit odd in this movie, still is trying to help young Lloyd get away from Mike, and he knows she can sense what he is doing.Michael who is still alive, goes and terrorizes Rachel, and stalks her in her house while she takes a shower. Jamie can sense something is going to happen, and Loomis tries to call her, and she answers, and finds out what Jamie is thinking, she goes and looks, and behold The Shape is there. Well there's Mike's first death.After that, and no one notices that she's dead. Tina, Rachel's best friend, has a costume party to go to and promises Jamie, that Michael will not be there. But of course he is, and he terrorizes and slaughters teens.Tina, and Rachel, along with a boy from the hospital she is in, have to go up against Michael Myers and all his terror, only to find, he's actually a sensitive guy, which you find out, when Jamie begs for her life, and big Mike cries.With Jamie's telekentic persona to her uncle, she, Tina, the boy, and Dr.Loomis, and find out, who and where he is going to kill next. Leading up to a suspenseful finale, and a shocking, but routine ending. And leaves it wide open for Halloween 6.The performances are credible, with the lead by Danielle Harris, like Halloween 4, she does a good job as her tortured by her uncle character. If you haven't seen Halloween 4 here is who she is. Jamie Lloyd is Laurie Strode's daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis from H1 and H2). Laurie Strode died, and Lloyd was adopted, to a family. How they killed or mentions how Laurie Stode died, I don't remember.Donald Pleasence gives a good, but uneven performance as the imfamous Dr. Loomis, who like in the last 3 tracks down Michael Myers, using Jamies pyschic powers. Although he played his character best in the first and second Halloween, in 4 he did a good job, and in this he does too, but he seems weird, or underacting. He sadly only played Dr. Loomis one more time in Halloween 6 before dying.The other supporting performances by Ellie Cornell who plays Rachel, and Wendy Kaplan who plays Tina, they do give some good performances, that are even, and interesting. But I think the stand-out is Danielle Harris, who is probably the most even performance of the movie, and the most realistic.Some of the sequences I liked to, like the opening. The hospital sequence with the laundry shoot, was original, and quite suspenseful. The Barn, and the last car sequences, were also credible and suspenseful. Now the film itself, was well-made, and stylish, it's also a bit far-fetched and overly done, but still it's a good movie, and merits its award of being a worthy Halloween sequel. See it for fun, no more.7 out of 10. Rated R for strong horror violence and gore, and for some sexuality.

I thought the movie was technically well-made, with a great opening title sequence and moments of true suspense. A pointless, but entertaining sequel, is what Halloween 5 is best described as. But while watching the film, I found it is a worthy and pretty good Halloween installment, marked by good performances especially by Danielle Harris, and as usual Donald Pleasence.The opening sequence is quite clever, with a Michael Myers, slicing and dicing his way through the credits, but slicing a pumpkin. They show the ending of Halloween 4, which shows Mike trying to get in the truck, to which Jamie Lloyd and her stepsister, Rache; are in. They stop, he falls, and stands back up. The police shoot him, and think he is dead. Jamie goes and checks, but Michael grabs Jamie, and the police shoot again, and he falls to his death into a mine shaft. But alas, he's not dead.After the horror and the ending of Halloween 4, young Jamie Lloyd, is in a hospital, and bed-ridden. Still having nightmares about that terrifying night, she still thinks Michael Myers isn't dead, and is coming after her once again to kill her.

Jamie can sense something is going to happen, and Loomis tries to call her, and she answers, and finds out what Jamie is thinking, she goes and looks, and behold The Shape is there.

But of course he is, and he terrorizes and slaughters teens.Tina, and Rachel, along with a boy from the hospital she is in, have to go up against Michael Myers and all his terror, only to find, he's actually a sensitive guy, which you find out, when Jamie begs for her life, and big Mike cries.With Jamie's telekentic persona to her uncle, she, Tina, the boy, and Dr.Loomis, and find out, who and where he is going to kill next. Leading up to a suspenseful finale, and a shocking, but routine ending. And leaves it wide open for Halloween 6.The performances are credible, with the lead by Danielle Harris, like Halloween 4, she does a good job as her tortured by her uncle character.
