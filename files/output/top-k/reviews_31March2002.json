Much, much better.  All of them.Kiss of the Dragon is a relatively serious and dramatic Hong Kong-style action film.  It's gritty and depressing by US standards.

It's better than the action in Romeo Must Die, but not nearly up to Jet Li standards.  And the main problem is the way it's filmed and edited. The competent choreography -- done by Corey Yuen Kwai -- winds up looking bad on the screen because it's almost all done in close-ups, shallow field, rapid cuts, blurs and inappropriate slow-motion, and jerky non-transitions.It's often hard to tell exactly what's going on, and a lot of the kung fu winds up looking fake, which is especially annoying because Jet Li doesn't need wires or camera or editing tricks to be amazing.  He just needs the camera to document him being amazing, and that doesn't happen here.Not a bad movie, all in all, but not a great Jet Li movie.

Hey, for the people that like LOTR(and we are lots of people), having the movie three hours long is a good thing; we get more movie for our buck!  Still, I can see that people who don't like anything related with fantasy will find it boring...but what did you expect?But, there are some great action sequences.  All of the action is very well done and none of it is over-the-top violence.  There are five distinct battle scences along with several other thrilling sequences and the long journey in the Caves of Moria.  Some other reviewers have stated that the action\/violence is too much; I would disagree with you.  Without the action sequences, LOTR would be Star Wars(only the original three will do thank you very much Mr. Lucas) without any starship fights or jedi duels...the action is part of the story(without overpowering the story)?The movie is also top quality in acting, sound, and effects.  In my opinion, Boromir was the best character; he had the best internal battle he wanted to take control of the ring to save his people when in fact he knew that it would corrupt him.  Even thought he was a flawed character unlike Aragorn(cool character but not too deep as of yet), Boromir had my sympathy and I could understand his desire to wield the ring to protect his people. Sound was great...a little too much at times.  And, the effects were top notch without being overdone.  Unlike Star Wars The Phanton Menace where the effects MADE the movie(actually Natalie Portman was the best effect but that's another story), the special effects in the LOTR seem to complement the story.My only problem with the story is that it doesn't have a hot blond princess in need of rescue(LOTR is like the Chronicles without Laurana...)SPOILERS BELOWAragorn chopping the head of the bad guy was tres cool!

Even ones like Very Bad Things. And Election is one of my favorite movies. I also really like most of Danny Devito's other movies (Throw Momma From the Train and War of the Roses).That being said, I didn't like Death to Smoochy. The main reason being that I did not think it was that dark of a comedy.Dark comedy is making patte out of a dog then serving it to its owner (War of the Roses (I know it didn't really happen, but still...)). Its a high school teacher thinking of one of his students as he has sex with his wife (Election). Its systematically killing off your classmates and staging them as liberating suicides (Heathers). All these instances go beyond the social limitations of its time, crossing lines of what people can do to achieve their goals. It is *not* penis-shaped cookies being shown to little kids. That is no more than a plain bathroom sight gag. Nor is it singing kids songs in front of a Nazi convention or having sex with a man in Barney suit. These instances only provide slightly humorous situations, but do not break any social conventions. Dark comedy has to hit you with a mac truck when you're looking the other way. Death to Smoochy taps you on the shoulder, then gives you a bad joke.I keep going over other scenes in Death to Smoochy (the Nazi convention, the ice skating, etc.) and I fail to see the dark humor, or any humor for that matter. Is it only funny because they're hosts of kid shows? I find that to be way too small of a reason to make it humorous. And every other aspect of the movie is generic. In the other movies I mentioned, the humor comes from the twisted things the characters do, and its disturbing regardless of who they are. In Death to Smoochy, no character does anything really outrageous. Rainbow seeks revenge on Smoochy, and does some pretty standard things to get that revenge. What, he plants him at a Nazi convention? Whoopdee-frickin-doo, that's hilarious - sarcasm. A very similar thing happens in Rat Race, which is your standard screwball comedy, and it wasn't terribly funny there either. Then theres the former boxer with no rhythm. He gets a few chuckles here and there, but again, just some standard shtick.

But in the end, where's this dark comedy that everyone talks about? What twisted things do these characters do? I sure can't find them. The characters have some pretty normal desires, and go about fulfilling them in some fairly normal ways, whether it was through a hitman, an agent, or an old fashioned gun. That is *not* dark comedy. Dark comedy would have the characters doing demented things to get the job done, like the ones I mentioned before. The characters in Death to Smoochy do nothing we haven't seen many times before in other movies.And since when do dark comedies have happy endings? Doesn't that go against the standards of a dark comedy? And the ending of Death to Smoochy isn't just happy, its serene.

I was in the fifth grade and not allowed to see it because it was about a PROSTITUTE.  So, I don't know, I think about two years ago I saw a copy of it in my parents video cabinet and popped it in to the VCR - and was so disgusted that I turned it off about a third of the way through (and trust me, I wanted to turn it off earlier). It embarrasses me to know that this is what is known as a chick flick... I mean, I like romance when it's not utter tripe and it's not about PROSTITUTES...  I just had a hard time caring for any of these characters.

The trailer sucked big time, I have never played the games, and I think Michelle Rodriguez is one of the worst actresses in the biz.

My god it's 2002, let's worry about 2002, not 2234. And why can't one director have the guts to change the way we see the future. Every one's god damn future is exactly the same! Shinny walls, computers with brains, stupid people, etc. But that's a whole different subject so back to Resident Evil.I sat and watched, not interested in the whole long explanation of what was happening on the earth at this time. I found myself asking questions like I wonder how much Panic Room will make this weekend, and I gotta buy The Book of the Dead DVD fast! Which is strange since the man only talked for about 45 seconds. When he shut the hell up, I cleared my mind, and watched. I thought, Oh my god, a camera with a brain, but I got myself fully focused when the dumb ass in the elevator got crushed. Now that's what I was looking for in this film. After all the action with the releasing of the virus, Milla Jovovich's character is introduced in this long drawn out scene. How the hell long does it take this girl to stand up! So far, so... well... decent.Well I don't want to go on with this play by play commentary so let me get to the goods. My view on Michelle Rodriguez didn't change one bit! Man, what a horrible actress. I also found it strange that this character is not at all like her character from The Fast and the Furious, yet she acts exactly the same in both! Now if that isn't the sign of a versatile actress, I don't know what is! However aside from the horrible dialogue she is given, and her horrible acting I found interest in her character. This fad of ass-kicking, take charge women seems to be continuing, and god damnit I love it!Milla Jovovich still isn't as attractive as she is made out to be (Well at least not in this film), and still not a very enthusiastic actress. Whenever she does a strenuous punch, or kick she gives off a little tennis player grunt (That little annoying uh!), rather than an I'm kicking your ass scream (AHHHH) that I like from the woman who might soon be kicking my ass. But I'm sure she made her brother proud (For those of you who don't know, Milla has said in more than one interview that the main reason she wanted to play this part was to impress her brother.), kicking those zombies asses.I also gotta' ask how stupid can these people be. The guy sees this pale thing, limping along, blood dripping out of it's mouth, obviously not human, and he puts his gun up and says, Stop, I'll shot. And continues saying this and that I mean it! that is said in all these types of movies, when it is obvious the character doesn't actually mean it. This zombie pretty much could have taken a bite out of his arm, and he just would have kept saying Don't move. I'll shot! I mean it! And the amount of time it took these people to realize these things are not human is incredible! Maybe they were supposed to look and act more human, but they went overboard on the makeup and overacted or whatever, but come on Milla, and Michelle! Your shooting at the thing, and he just stumbles. The thing ain't Superman babe, get a clue!Now you are all probably thinking, My god, he hated it! but I didn't! No, I was actually incredibly surprised at the entertainment factor of the film, and did, for the most part, enjoy it from start to finish. The bad dialogue made me laugh, the bad acting made me smile, and the stupidity of the characters made me yell at the screen. And I had a blast doing all of that. What did I particularly enjoy about the flick? Well for one the zombies. Very pretty, nice and bloody, and they didn't get any extras that were too bad (like the nurse zombie in Dawn of the Dead). The violence was also well done, not overdosing on the gore, and making it almost unwatchable, but putting in just enough to put a HUGE smile on my face when the characters I hated got killed.And I gotta talk about The Licker. I loved it! Sure it looked extremely fake, but I thought Anderson did a smart thing by keeping it mostly off camera, and not showcasing his film's bad special effects like many other films do (Brotherhood of the Wolf comes to mind). But I also wish he would have put up a little bit more of a fight. The thing was huge, and he dies pretty quickly, and easily. And how about the highly entertaining death scenes. Woah, those were fun. Like I already mentioned the gore was nice, and that laser sequence was great.Thumbs up to Paul Anderson for his imaginative, and stylish direction. I know it would not have been the same with a different director (It would have been much worse, or much better). Even though I hated that stupid Red Queen, the POV shots were nice (But couldn't they have come up with a better name for that thing? I don't know if it was in the game or not, but Red Queen? It's a computer\/camera for gods sake! How about The Computer. Personally I don't want to live in the future if we name our computers The Red Queen.) The score was also a plus, getting me into the film even more. Very loud, very mean, and very nice. And the ending set up the sequel, and did a damn fine job in the process. I loved it!Overall, Resident Evil was a surprise. I expected it to suck, and although it TECHNICALLY did, there is no denying I loved it.

Also, if Childers absolutely insisted on a lawyer with combat experience, he could have at least found one that was also good at being a lawyer.***SPOILER***** I would say the ending is a surprise to me, because the defense had absolute no strategy.  Their method of casting doubt to the prosecutor's witness seems to be incredible, like making the doctor translate the audiotape or asking the Vietnamese officer, who is a prosecutor's witness, if he would have done the same thing in his case. How would the doctor translating the tape discredit his prior testimony, and why was the prosecutor anxiously waiting for the answer from the vietnamese officer, who was being cross examination instead of objecting?  And why would the Vietnames officer, whose communication officer was executed by Childers right in front of him, be saluting Childers?  Would the US veterans from WWII ever solute to a surviving Japanese or Nazi officer?  And to top it off, the defendant himself proved that he was a hothead that cannot control his rage.   But not to worry, since they have their secret weapon, which was to thrown the missing tape theory into the air as if it was a conspiracy.  There are plenty of cases out there in real life where witness suddenly dies or crucial evidence disappears, but no prosecutor in their right mind would say My witness which would have proved the defendant is guilty has suddenly been killed.  We all know even though the defendant is locked up in jail, his evil cronies on the outside did the dirty work for him, so please convict the defendant because of that.The battle scenes did not make sense either.  Since they've decided to abandon the embassy, why not just withdrawal?  Or maybe take the snipers out, but to wipe out the whole crowd?   I guess it was that a family's life for an eye mentality.  I would have thought that Childers would forward the demonstrator's co-ordinates to the ship so that they could fire a cruise missle at them.Plus this went beyond the one dimensional stereotyping of ethnic groups, along with the blatant attempt at manipulation of our feelings toward them that are usually in those mindless action movies.  As seen in the case of the really little girl whose leg was amputated from the shooting turns out to have been firing a weapon at the marines from the crowd, as were many of the women, children and old folks.   Or the scenes where the women with babies were hanging around with their sniper husbands on rooftops. Somehow the film is trying to convey the message that wiping out everyone, including every elderly, crippled, child and woman is justified.I don't know how Hodge's son, who was so against Childer's action, turn around and hugs his father for his rightous belief and defense of Childers, even though there was no evidence to make anybody feel that this action was justified.What worked was the production of the fight scenes, with the tense feeling it invoked, that's about it.

I like this movie very much, visually and dramatically, but the score is one of the most amateurish and incompetent, not to mention artistically lacking, I have ever heard. This, in itself, is not surprising since it was written by ex-Abba member Benny Andersson, a composer who seems content to stay within the boundaries of his own quasi-folk\/pop\/pseudo-classical style, without any attempt at ambiguity or originality.What is surprising is that a serious and original (at least when it comes to film) director like Roy Andersson would want to use such a score. In fact, on a documentary included on the DVD there is a clue to Roy's view on music. He claims that all music is as good (equating Beethoven with Vaudeville tunes or something similar) except for how it is arranged a baroque suggestion, of course. Since when was music that mundane? What happened to art? It is obviously important in the movies, so why not in music. This is even more interesting since Roy Andersson has written a book (which I haven't read yet) about the lack of seriousness in our time. Why the would he actively contribute to increasing the lack of seriousness in Swedish films by using Benny Andersson's music in his, otherwise, beautiful movie?The only likely explanation I can think of is that Roy Andersson is one of those few people who have absolutely no ear for music, and if that is the case, then maybe he shouldn't blamed, except to say that he might have asked for someone else's opinion before releasing the movie with the present sound track.It is a mystery to me why no one else has commented on this subject, at least in any of the comments I have yet read.

Argh, just recounting these scenes is hurting me.Immediately upon reaching Mars things go from contrived to worse. A gamma-elf-flare whatever totally wrecks the ship, forcing all the men down to the planet and leaving moss to tend the homestead. They boof the landing thanks to hotshot pilot(is there any other kind?)Bratt, and Stamp ruptures his spleen fatally. Now terribly low on oxygen, the survivors try and make it to the pre-established Mars base, only to find it trashed (probably by Martian delinquents). While they're waiting to die of suffocation, Wimpy knocks Bratt off a cliff and...geez...I could go on...but...disaster after disaster, any one of which could be the basis of a movie, carnivorous exploding fireflies, a vicious ice-storm, and IMHO the lamest an ex-military robot that gets set on kill and goes after the astronauts. I mean, why leave the killemall programming on the mars probe robot? Couldn't the space have been used for something better?Maybe the filmmakers thought this convoy of mayhem made for an exciting adrenaline roller coaster of thrills! as Joe Blow of the Houma Examiner might say, but personally, it just was lame and sad. At the end, when Kilmer actually flicks off Mars and goes F**k this planet I am in complete agreement with him. I am Kilmer and he is me. This ain't no Robinson Crusoe on Mars folks, at least that had a monkey and Adam West. Peace. ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"31 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Contrived.  Very, very contrived.  Feels like some kids got together after spending a whole week watching heist movies and made this movie.  Boring.

Obviously, I was wrong.  If, indeed, this movie was not written by a group of high schoolers, then it definitely was written by slightly-more-creative-than-average monkeys with fat fingers.
