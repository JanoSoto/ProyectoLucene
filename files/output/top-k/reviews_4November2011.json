It's what keeps the world going and helps moving it forward, for better or for worse.You shouldn't take this movie very literally.

You get sucked in by the movie its visual style and slow way of storytelling, that sets things up very nicely. It helps to make the characters some really great ones as well, most notably of course the Malcolm McDowell one, who is a true, classic rebel, who's fed up with the current system and decides to stand up against it, on his very own rebellious sort of way.It's actually surprising this movie got directed by a woman.

However silly doesn't simply equal good or fun as well unfortunately.I always thought that Bride of Chucky would be a fun one to watch. And I did had some fun with it but the movie is still being brought down by a bad story and approach to it.So the movie is more a comedy than anything else really this time but did that really had to mean that they needed to get rid of all the horror elements as well? I can't even call this one a slasher this time really, since Chucky really isn't on a killing rampage this time. I don't even know what he was doing in this movie. I mean, what was his motivation this time? It didn't seem like he was very busy trying to get his soul out of the good guy doll and same goes for the Jennifer Tilly character, who also got transfered into a doll and is the 'bride of Chucky' in this one.And then there are the Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile characters as well. Where they really needed for this movie? Couldn't they come up with a better idea or story for them? I seriously can say that I would had probably liked this movie better, hadn't they been in it at all. It would had caused less distraction and perhaps would had allowed Chucky and his new bride do some more evil and gruesome stuff.I'm not really sure what they were thinking. Seems to me they had no idea how to find or create a good balance between comedy and horror elements and therefore went for purely mostly just comedy instead. I still wouldn't had minded this if the movie did actually had a fun and clever story in it but as it turns out, the movie starts to run out of steam pretty fast, after a promising enough first 20 minutes or so. And I also still really liked the last 10 seconds of the movie. I won't spoil it but all I can say is that's the most awesome Child's Play movie ending I have seen, even though it pretty much came out of nowhere.It also remains awesome that Brad Dourif keeps coming back to do the voice of Chucky. You would think that it really doesn't matter much, since he's only just doing his voice but it makes all the difference in the world really. His voice is perfectly evil and insane and I especially also really like his evil laugh.Can't say that the effects have improved really much. Seems like the animatronic effects for the Chucky doll really haven't improved that much, ever since the first 1988 movie.

Here even the minor characters are well developed, enough to catch your eye. And last, it has to show some violence but in moderate quantities. There is some violence here, most notably in the Billy Batts scene, but it never overflows, Casino had far more violent scenes than this film. If there is no violence whatsoever, then the movie can't be an effective gangster\/mafia movie.But what is perhaps most appealing with this film is that, in contrast to movies like The Godfather trilogy, Scarface and Casino, this movie is based 100% on real events and characters. Only a few names are altered, the rest is all authentic.Robert De Niro again delivers, even though I think he has been somewhat miscast as Jimmy (Burke) Conway. Jimmy the Gent was Irish-American and even though DeNiro is part Irish himself, he doesn't look like a typical Irish-American. Burke was also a tall and imposing man, unlike DeNiro and he always chomped on a cigar. Doesn't help that DeNiro also has that unmistakable Italian-American drawl Wats da madda wit u?Pesci is just incredible and a delight to watch, despite playing a very unsympathetic character. Liotta fits his part perfectly as well and what I liked here is that they show his corruption by the mob world that embraced him in the beginning. If he had been shown as just some innocent naive sweet guy, it wouldn't look authentic, would it? Several scenes have since become classics, deservedly so. The Shinebox scene aka Billy Batts scene is perhaps the most unforgettable, but also the Funny Guy scene. Elizabeth Bracco, even though not my favorite actress, offers a strong supporting role as mrs. Henry Hill, the headstrong and hot tempered Karen. Paul Sorvino is also marvelous in his somewhat restricted but pivotal part as Henry's close friend and first mentor Paulie Cicero. Frank Sivero from Godfather II is a welcome sight and his character is like a counterpart to Pesci's, a silent and unintentionally humorous sidekick.Scorsese scored big with this big screen adaptation of one of the most intriguing real-life mafia stories.

All very well, except that he needs to find the antidote that will make him visible again. Until then, he exhibits on the sort of transparency most of us demand of our governments. There's another thing too. He didn't read the article in the obscure German medical journal that proves the drug drives you mad.Wrapped up from head to toe on a wintry night, Raines takes a room in a country inn and demands to be left along while he plies his instruments in search of the antidote. Of course no one is going to leave alone a person who asks to be left alone. The constant intrusions drive Raines round the bend. He goes on a merry rampage until he's finally undone by a smart police inspector, but not before he kills more than a hundred people, including a former friend and colleague.Ordinarily these stories of humans (or part-humans) gone nuts involve an underlying theme of pathos. Let's face facts. I guess no one felt sorry for the giant ants in Them but who among us didn't shed a tear or two when King Kong made a splash on 34th Street? That pathos is largely absent here. Only in two scenes, both brief and in both of which his former girl friend, Flora, appears, is there any real sign of humanity in Raines' character, a willingness to take the role of Other. These few minutes aside, he's an explosive personality.Which brings up the question of exactly what it is that he wants. He carries on about power and fear and the ability to walk into any bank vault, yet he never makes any relevant demands. In one scene he does walk into a bank and skip out with a tray full of money but he throws it away to the crowd. He seems mostly to get a kick out of people being terrified of him. He hops down the road in a pair of stolen trousers, driving off a frightened woman, and sings, Here we go gathering nuts in May.... He clearly enjoys all the rumors of the invisible man creating chaos. The rumors sound silly and the movie makes a little fun of them but we shouldn't feel too superior, since we're given to equally absurd panics. Google phantom gasser Mattoon for a more modern example. And did you know that McDonald's puts worms in its hamburgers? Claude Raines is pretty good, perhaps more effective in his angry rants than in his few tender moments. The other players are very amusing. When the raving Raines first peels off his guise and reveals himself to be invisible, a goggling constable says, Ewww, he's all eaten away. Best performance Una O'Connor as the head of the country inn, a delicate and restrained blend of extreme hysteria and excess horror.You have to admire the thought that went into this fantasy. It reminded me of Nicholson Baker's The Fermata. It's not a tale of whimsy in which anything can happen. Raines describes the flaws in his invisibility. Not just obvious things like fog and snow, in which his form is outlined, but the dirt under his fingernails and the food that takes an hour to be digested and lose its opacity. And he must not step in a sticky substance with his naked feet or he leaves prints. And in industrial settings he must mind the soot that settles on his body. It almost sounds like more trouble than it's worth unless his plans include sneaking into the girls' gym or something.You will not be bored.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 November 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" What a lot of fun. I haven't read H. G. Wells' novel but this movie adaptation is pretty entertaining.Claude Raines is a scientist who discovers a drug that makes him invisible. All very well, except that he needs to find the antidote that will make him visible again. Until then, he exhibits on the sort of transparency most of us demand of our governments. There's another thing too. He didn't read the article in the obscure German medical journal that proves the drug drives you mad.Wrapped up from head to toe on a wintry night, Raines takes a room in a country inn and demands to be left along while he plies his instruments in search of the antidote. Of course no one is going to leave alone a person who asks to be left alone. The constant intrusions drive Raines round the bend. He goes on a merry rampage until he's finally undone by a smart police inspector, but not before he kills more than a hundred people, including a former friend and colleague.Ordinarily these stories of humans (or part-humans) gone nuts involve an underlying theme of pathos. Let's face facts. I guess no one felt sorry for the giant ants in Them but who among us didn't shed a tear or two when King Kong made a splash on 34th Street? That pathos is largely absent here. Only in two scenes, both brief and in both of which his former girl friend, Flora, appears, is there any real sign of humanity in Raines' character, a willingness to take the role of Other. These few minutes aside, he's an explosive personality.Which brings up the question of exactly what it is that he wants. He carries on about power and fear and the ability to walk into any bank vault, yet he never makes any relevant demands. In one scene he does walk into a bank and skip out with a tray full of money but he throws it away to the crowd. He seems mostly to get a kick out of people being terrified of him. He hops down the road in a pair of stolen trousers, driving off a frightened woman, and sings, Here we go gathering nuts in May.... He clearly enjoys all the rumors of the invisible man creating chaos. The rumors sound silly and the movie makes a little fun of them but we shouldn't feel too superior, since we're given to equally absurd panics. Google phantom gasser Mattoon for a more modern example. And did you know that McDonald's puts worms in its hamburgers? Claude Raines is pretty good, perhaps more effective in his angry rants than in his few tender moments. The other players are very amusing. When the raving Raines first peels off his guise and reveals himself to be invisible, a goggling constable says, Ewww, he's all eaten away. Best performance Una O'Connor as the head of the country inn, a delicate and restrained blend of extreme hysteria and excess horror.You have to admire the thought that went into this fantasy. It reminded me of Nicholson Baker's The Fermata. It's not a tale of whimsy in which anything can happen. Raines describes the flaws in his invisibility. Not just obvious things like fog and snow, in which his form is outlined, but the dirt under his fingernails and the food that takes an hour to be digested and lose its opacity. And he must not step in a sticky substance with his naked feet or he leaves prints. And in industrial settings he must mind the soot that settles on his body. It almost sounds like more trouble than it's worth unless his plans include sneaking into the girls' gym or something.You will not be bored.

I'm of the school that believes that never has someone with so little talent gone so far. The one exception I make is watching Niagara just about every time it shows up on TCM. Even as a child, this was a favorite movie of mine, after having seen it (almost certainly) on Saturday Night At The Movies.But I don't watch the melodramatic thriller \/ film noir for Monroe. I watch it for Niagara. As I child I lived a couple of hours drive from Niagara, so every couple of years the family would hop in the car and head for a day or two at the Falls. And, because much of this film was shot on location, it gives you a real sense of what mostly the Canadian side of the Falls was like in the early and mid-1950s. About the only thing inaccurately depicted was how short the lines would be to go into attractions such as Maid Of The Mist or the tunnels behind the Canadian Falls. The color photography is stunning, and is as much an historical record of Niagara Falls at that time as you'll find.Of course, the movie -- directed by Henry Hathaway -- is pretty good, too! -) It stars Marilyn Monroe and Joseph Cotten. The best acting here is done by Cotton (a real actor), but of course, all eyes are on Monroe (and, at this stage of her career, this was her first truly standout role.The film sets up nicely, with a rather innocent couple (Max Showalter and Jean Peters) checking in at some tourist cabins overlooking the falls for their delayed honeymoon. There they meet George and Rose Loomis (Cotten and Monroe), and discover that she's racy and he's a tad off his rocker (evidently due to WWII). Monroe is having an affair, and the plan is for her boyfriend to kill Cotton in the Niagara River, and then run away to Chicago. Only things get reversed, and Cotton goes on a rampage. It's all very nicely plotted out and acted. Cotton ends up strangling Monroe (for whom the audience has no sympathy), and this is one of the most dramatically filmed scenes in the move. Then -- although this part is a little fantastic -- Cotton and Peters end up on a boat on the river above the falls, and are heading toward the brink in an exciting climax. Kudos to Cotten and Peters, as well as to Showalter, who is great as the sorta likable-goofy husband. And an oddball treat is seeing Don Wilson (from Jack Benny's series) as a shredded wheat executive (what a cornball!).This was a pretty racy film for its time, and Monroe plays the tramp brilliantly...some might say it was type-casting. Just watch her in scenes when she is walking away hurriedly...or rather watch her curves. Does anyone really walk like that????? And so, this film has something for everyone. The tremendous scenic beauty of the Falls, probably never photographed this well before or since. Strong acting by Cotton and Peters. The dumb-blonde beauty of Marilyn Monroe, and don't misunderstand me -- in the camera lens she was a real beauty.Well worth the watching, and it may well deserve a spot on your DVD shelf.

But it's nearly always disappointing to go back and revisit childhood favourites and while Clue isn't a disappointing movie by any stretch of the imagination, I didn't enjoy it as much as before. It is a real curiosity, being the only film I can think of based on a board game and also offering three different endings. But some things were exactly as I'd remembered, namely some astoundingly hammy acting and a fairly dodgy script.On a dark and stormy night, six strangers are invited to an isolated manor house for a formal dinner. Being greeted by the butler Wadsworth (Tim Curry) and informed that they must stick to their given aliases, the only thing initially that links Miss Scarlett (Leslie Ann Warren), Colonel Mustard (Martin Mull), Mrs Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Mrs White (Madeline Kahn) and Mr Green (Michael McKean) is that they are being blackmailed by Mr Boddy (Lee Ving). But when Mr Boddy is found dead in the study, it plunges them all into a complex web of lies, secrets and murder.It might not be a long film but Clue is a brave attempt at stringing a concept out as much as possible. But the whole thing feels like a pantomime, packed to the rafters with hammy acting (none more so than Curry, given that hammy is what he does best) and a ridiculous story in a clichéd setting.

It's daft, childish and frankly a little silly but if you can take it with a pinch of salt then you may enjoy this movie. It remains a real oddity and a genuinely cult movie, something a little different from the norm and therefore, something for those of you fed up with endless Columbo cases.

The location is pretty incredible, the only film I can think of that comes close is R-Point in terms of just how much dread a location alone can create, and the photography and direction brings out its full potential, especially given the mostly great music and sound and the films numerous creeping and sudden scares. The acting was great and the characters definitely felt like real people, with no stupid distractions or horribly forced love interests to crap things up. The plot was decent too, if a bit confused at times, and while the ending was a bit anti-climactic in many ways, it *totally* succeeded in leaving me feeling a bit creeped out for the next few days.What's frustrating are the things that really let the film down. The biggest problem for me was 'Simon'; a brilliantly nasty character, but I found his script way too clichéd to take seriously (does he really need to sarcastically say 'doc' all the time? he sounds like a kid's cartoon villain) and the voice they used sounded pretty stupid.

A kindly, aging Irish crime boss who raised Sullivan as his surrogate son, Rooney is affiliated with Al Capone in Chicago. Curious about his father's mysterious profession, Sullivan's son, Michael Jr., stows away in his father's automobile one night and witnesses the execution of a man at the hands of Sullivan and Rooney's biological son, Connor.Although Michael keeps his promise to remain silent about what he's seen, the paranoid and unstable Connor tries to wipe out the entire Sullivan clan anyway, succeeding only in killing Sullivan's wife, Annie, and youngest son, Peter. Enraged at this and another surprise betrayal by the Rooneys, Sullivan embarks on a path of bloody retribution, Michael in tow. Although he intends to leave his boy with relatives in the rural town of Perdition once the coast is clear, he ends up exposing Michael to the goriest aspects of his talents, slaughtering former associates as he dodges contract assassin Maguire and cripples the cash flow of the Rooney and Capone organizations through a series of bank robberies, attempting to force either mob family to offer up the sequestered Connor as a sacrifice.After successfully killing John Rooney and his son Connor,Sullivan decides to drive Michael Jr. to a relative's beach house in Perdition, a town on the shore of Lake Michigan. Here he is ambushed and shot by a disfigured Maguire, who has survived the hotel shootout. Michael Jr. shows up and points a gun at Maguire, but cannot bring himself to fire. The standoff ends when Sullivan draws a hidden gun and kills Maguire before dying in his son's arms. The film ends with Michael Jr. mourning his father's death as finds his way back to the elderly farm couple that looked after them.Road to Perdition works surprisingly well for so simple a story as it involves the viewer in its story and action from beginning to end.Also,it is an enjoyable,well-acted,well-written, and superbly directed masterpiece.It also explores fully well the boding between fathers and sons.The talented cast delivers especially Hanks with his resonant reserve and Newman in conveying Rooney's failed attempt to live up to his self-image as the ultimate just and loving mob patriarch.Finally,it is a a gripping, touching and absorbing work from Sam Mendes.Overall,Road to Perdition is truly a gangster classic piece of cinema.

The characters are not believable at all, they are not just flat, but they do behave in a simply absurd manner. Twists and kills are sudden and hard to follow - you just have no idea why something happened and motivation of characters is totally unclear. The most bizarre is the ten year old hit-man (or whatever he is) who is supposed to work for the Baron but not only ignores his interests but he is basically willing to kill everyone in his way like there is no law applying to him at all. The Baron seems not to have any connection with politics yet he simply builds super weapon and has no problem to test it live on his own without consent of Army or state.

Claude Reins is easy to hate as the political slimeball who thinks of himself more than the good of the people. As said before, the whole cast shines.I'd like to mention the beginning. Many older movies have very slow beginnings. Not this. Instantly we are thrown into the plot, with a series of phone calls and one hilarious NO! From there, the drama mounts, and the tempo stays high. 'Washington' could've been a dreadfully boring film. But Capra knew what he was doing. He has a thing for inspiration, eh? I would've given this film a low nine, if not for its one fault the ending. The ending is so rushed. Right until the end, the film is a masterpiece, but then it just ends. The point is served, and we can draw our own conclusion, but 5 minutes of footage should've been added to settle things down. Capra would learn this several years later with his masterpiece, 'It's A Wonderful Life'.Themes of justice, sticking to your guns, corruption and more hit you like a political activist trying to drum up support. 'Washington' gives you many things to think about. And if not for the too-soon ending, it would be a masterpiece. 8.6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"4 November 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Some films just come at the wrong time and suffer for it. However, many of them eventually found an audience and have been deemed cult classics. The 1990s was full of movies that endured this fate, including such big budget flops as 'Waterworld' and this film.

Excellent production and costume designs. Great quirky tone. Pace just zips right along. Plenty hilarious situations and dialogue. Impressive special effects, especially on The Rippers. Some exciting, well-staged set pieces.Cons Somewhat dated. Not much in the plot department.Final thoughts Whether you were a fan of the comics or not, 'Tank Girl' is a film that can be enjoyed regardless. It may be too out there for some, but if that's what you like then look no further.

For the uninformed the movie\/book loosely follow the story of Beowulf from the eyes of an outsider. Each and every actor fills their role so perfectly for me that I become lost in the story each and every time I re watch it.

I think its so different from the ordinary Disney film...well i heard it's not even Disney so I guess that's a given. But the characters looked different and it has some really nice songs. Especially the first one This is my idea which speeds things up from when they're kids to when they're older...its really cute and the song itself is nice. Also its not the typical old animated films where the guy and girl fall in love straight away since they kinda dislike each other when they were young. But after that they just have this beautiful love which is both happy and sad and perfect!! Other than that, far longer than forever is a great song, along with many others. Tons of funny characters - Cindrella's friends, who are good funny friends are hilarious as well as the shoes's adviser and his friend. Anyway love it!! A must see classic.
