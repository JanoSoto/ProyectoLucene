Not only the extra's and the menu screens, but the film is somewhat of a more 'complete' experience as well. I mean some of the 'new' scenes make a better or just another sense then they did before. I mean I do not want to ruin anything for anybody, but for anybody who wondered how to choose between 2, without hesitating is possible, this film shows it (I hope this was cryptic enough for those who haven't seen this film and specific enough for those who have). This ULTIMATE EDITION is really a great experience. Although it is filled up with about 15 minutes more than the original theatrical version it still is good. I mean there are no things added to this edition that I think should have been edited in the first place. Why the heck did they take these parts out, I wonder.Anyway all the actors in this film are great. Linda Hamilton as the die - hard b..ch from hell. Edward Furlong as the lonesome kid, who hasn't got anybody really and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger. He just ROCKS. Ok say what you want about Schwarzenegger. I know he is no great character actor, but he does his job well and he has a certain kind of humor, which he also shows in this movie (as well as in True Lies). But that is not the fact that he is so great in this. The reason for that is rather the same as in THE TERMINATOR. He is excellently cast, with his muscular body and his grim face, along with the mechanical walk he adapted. He just makes the perfect machine. I miss out on the villain as well though, Robert Patrick, he is very cool too. A ruthless killing machine, without any regrets whatsoever.Another thing that is really great here is the direction. Especially the scenes, that take place in the future and the action scenes. There is some blood squirting around when people go shooting, but despite that, this one is not as violent as the first one. I also think James Cameron did a great job in putting some critique about human behavior in it and also inserting some drama into the story and even the 'emotionless' cyborg. The special effects, once great are still good, although they are getting a bit old, just as the movie. But have no fear, it will not affect your viewing pleasure.Despite the greatness, there is one thing I do not really understand here and that is how James Cameron, the mastermind could have made such a BIG, HUGE, ENORMOUS mistake in his story as I (obviously) witnessed. I mean, there are some minor things in this film that I think are not too good, like the fact that Cameron makes us believe Sarah is 29 in this film and John is 10 (which would have made Linda Hamilton 18 or 19 in the first movie!!!!), but this is really a FAULT and a big one. It is BIG in a sense that it could have been avoided easily, without ever hurting the film at all, whereas overlooking this fault, it kind of hurt the film from my view (if you did not notice THIS mistake, do not worry; I've seen this film about 8 times). Here it comes (BEAR IN MIND, THERE COULD BE SPOILERS HERE)  Remember when driving into the desert somewhere with Sarah (Hamilton) and John (Furlong), the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) tells them all about Skynet and how 3 years from then they will develop something leading to the nuclear blast in August 1997? (If you don't fast forward to that part). This is not possible within the story sketched, because the film takes place in 1995. Therefore something happening three years later (1998) could not have influence on something in August 1997. The big question now is, how the hell do I know this film takes place in 1995? Well, in the beginning when the T 1000 (Patrick) steals the cop car he looks up info about John Connor and when you look closely at the screen it says Age 10 and Date of Birth something, something 1985. Well it hurts me to say this but this is a pretty obvious mistake, that could have simply been avoided by making Arnold say 'In two years.' instead of 'In three years.' (POSSIBLE SPOILER END). Normal people might not spot this and I hope not to have sc..wed up somebody's film experience, but I just have always felt that there was something wrong with this films timeline. But now that I've finally spot it, I can enjoy this film at ease and admit that it is, in no way worse than it's predecessor, rather just not as original anymore, because when you see THE TERMINATOR shortly before this one, you just notice that there are a lot of similar scenes in both movies plus it is not as magic and amazing as it was before (that goes for every monster, machine or dinosaur sequel). Despite all that I can recommend everyone to go see the ULTIMATE EDITION, for it will bring you the MAXimized T2 film experience as it was meant to be.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 October 2001","score":"","review":"  Yesterday I watched Terminator 2 Judgment day THE ULTIMATE EDITION and I must say it is quite the experience.

So I was almost surprised when staring at the 'rate this movie' screen I gave it 7\/10, but let me tell you why (and trust me I thought about it for a few long moments deciding what to give it and why). First the downside the story was predictable in every way, it was almost painful for me to see children so young using such language and being abused in so many ways, but it was realistic. The high rating I gave it was because the young actors were so very talented, and while the story was obvious it still managed to make me care what happened and what was happening. I wasn't engrossed, I didn't sob like a baby, I didn't find it a revelation on life and death. However, it was very much what it purported to be, a story about showing up. And it did have an interesting message about how something, that to one person can be so insignificant, can be so profound and life-changing to others. Keanu Reeves gets a lot of bad press about being a 'bad actor' but I found him very believable and thought he did an extremely good job.

Sure this one has it's advantages over the second one, but it also is a bit worse at times. But those times are not as frequent or as important as the many times it has advantages over the second installment, because everything that is worse in this film, over the second one has to do with special effects. Now listen closely, the effects are not bad, they are as good as they were in 1984, but they just are not as good as the effects in 1991 and that is it. Regarding the rest of the film, it sure as hell is somewhat better than the sequel. First of all, everything in this film is more original and fresh (because it is a first of course), but not only that. One thing I like a bit more in this film, is that it is darker you know, more mechanic and inhuman. You really get a sense here of the fact that you are dealing with an emotionless machine. All this dark sphere that is created must be ascribed mainly to James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger. James Cameron, of course for his vision and execution of the way he felt the music and the sets had to be and Schwarzenegger for his good performance. I know that many people may well argue about my last statement 'Good performance, Schwarzenegger can't play CRAP!' Well in terms of great character roles or dramatic ones this might all be very true, but in this film Schwarzenegger captured everything his character was about perfectly. You might say he didn't have to act at all. But you go ahead, try to pass as a machine in a movie, kill emotionless, walk static, look grim, speak slowly and well 'machinery' (cut off). All of this enables the viewer to totally believe that he is indeed a machine.The other actors here are not to be forgotten either, Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor are also very well characterized by Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton respectively. I mean they very believable and they have a good chemistry in the film. They are also the characters seen in the best parts of the film (not the coolest, that's what Schwarzenegger is for). My favorite scenes in this movie certainly are the 'intimate scene' and the 1st 2029 A.D. scene with the epilogue at the beginning. All in all I must say that this is a masterpiece of cinema and a must see for everyone who love movies.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 October 2001","score":"","review":"  This is truly a great film, which of course is always somehow compared with part two, just as part two is always compared to this one.

Comic scenario or what.  AND ALL A BIT OF FUN. Thank you Trey and Matt, but the hard part is trying to eclipse it in South Park Even Bigger, Even Longer and Still Uncut.  Or at least doing another to make me laugh again and you a few million bucks more, I am looking forward to it.

The Baby-sitters Club is a brilliant fun teen movie, with a some pretty good acting and a great story-line to it. Each character has something cool and different about them, which is nice. The cast here, including Schuyler Fisk, (Sissy Spaceks daughter.) Bre Blair, Larisa Oleynik and Rachael Leigh Cook all fit into there characters well which of course is great. I give The (Brilliant.)

People who thought BLADE RUNNER was mesmerizing will definitely sink their teeth into what this film has to offer visually. Those sleazy future towns, the cars, the tunnel in the shape of an open mouth, Manhattan half-submerged by water... beautiful, memorable stuff indeed. This is perhaps the most convincing and haunting portrayal of the future I've ever seen. But since the film is such an incredible mix of different moods, tones, mentalities, and storytelling styles, it was almost inevitable there wasn't going to be any flaws. It is far from a total mess, but parts of the film obviously don't work well. The narration, much like BLADE RUNNER, was not needed, and I suspect that in the future Spielberg will re-release the film without it. The sequence with dr. Know was technically well done, but it went on way too long. And I didn't really know what to make of the Gigolo Joe character in the film. What purpose does he really serve? It would've been more exciting if David had found the Blue Fairy at the end with the help of a lot of different people. Also the ending itself has been much discussed here. Although I was enchanted by that moment where the story jumps 2000 years into the future, that moment where he reunites with his mom doesn't work well at all. We really don't know if we should care about that character. She hasn't been well developed and didn't come across as a very likable character in the first act. I understand that for the story to make sense David had to meet his mother at the end, but Spielberg should've handled this character much better. The ending didn't, fortunately, ruin the whole film for me, but it was a considerable letdown. And yet there is so much else to admire in the film that I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone and give it a high rating. A lot of scenes in the film work marvelously well and some really aroused a sense of wonderment in me. I loved an early scene where David meets and compares himself to a group of real kids his age. This was very well done, honest and completely believable. A.I., overall, is a very uneven film that doesn't always work, but it always maintains your interest. It has already been called a flawed masterpiece, and I agree. A film with a lot of ideas, a lot of different tones and moods, and, for all its flaws, never less than mesmerizing.
