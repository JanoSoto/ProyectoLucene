As a matter of fact, at first I couldn't understand the several negative reviews on here, as I watched the first 20 or so minutes--which were hilarious!--then had to take a break to do a few things, eat dinner, etc., and then went back to the movie...oh, plus another thing I did in the meantime was get online and check out the reviews, which I couldn't understand what the deal was.Mark Wahlberg, of course, plays Chris, singer of a cover--er, that's right, TRIBUTE--band that performs Steel Dragon tunes, a fictitious heavy metal group back in the 80s.  Even though a lot have dissed Wahlberg due to his acting, I was actually going to sing (pardon the pun) severe praise for him, since he spent a year and a half growing his hair long for the part, which in all actuality, he couldn't stand; he said during an interview once that it was like a bat flying in my face.  He also looked like he was having the time of his life singing and banging his head along in his car and being onstage, which in fact he can't stand heavy metal in real life...now THAT'S acting, if you ask me!!  If you think his acting is poor, do YOU think you could go onstage in a movie and pretend to really get into playing some music you hate, like country or rap (if you don't like them, that is...I like some rap myself), especially with having to do several takes per scene? Right, I thought so.I was also going to commend about how real this movie was, due to the fact that not all of us heavy metal people live in caves, don't get up until noon and stay up until 2 a. m. to play in some god-forsaken little club (after sacrificing a goat, of course)...no, Chris also works in an office too, and even sings in a church choir (probably a nod to Axl Rose of Guns 'n Roses when he sang in a church choir also, although that was when he was a little kid).  About the only gripe I had was that they overdid a few things, like Chris' headbanging parents; possible--after all, they survived the 60s--but a bit silly.But then I settled down and watched the rest of it.  WAY too many songs. As it's been mentioned here repeatedly, another music movie, Almost Famous, is compared to this, which had the right amount of songs, not going on for too long or repeating them to death...and I'm not slamming those tunes since they weren't metal, as I like pretty much all kinds of music, including those, and they only went on for a minute or two before they switched to something else...here they (the filmmakers) obviously couldn't think of much to do with the script, so they just threw in the songs, skipping around the movie and all, just like when, during a break, Chris brings in some demo tapes and drawings he made of what he thought would make it to the next Steel Dragon album, not knowing that one of the guitarist's and manager (I think it was) had already written all of the songs.  Tension is mounting, but they didn't really do anything to make it feel like it was building up over time how long was this break anyway?  We have no idea, so that also tosses aside character development (or not).* MINOR SPOILERS * This also leads to Chris changing musical direction, which wasn't believable, as we had no idea that he liked anything other than metal, so here it's a bit of a cop-out, to suddenly throw that in. However, it IS pretty funny what happens to the original singer of Steel Dragon (ha ha!) and all.  Chris also doesn't do drugs and the former Steel Dragon singer tells him that he doesn't do drugs either and that he's in bed by 1130 every night, yet Chris immediately becomes trashed after his first Steel Dragon gig, and continues with that lifestyle...sorry, if you haven't done drugs after all this time, why would you suddenly just dive right into them?  Also unbelievable is having every tiny thing that happens to Steel Dragon winds up on the news...however, it's not identified what station is running these reports, as it could be MTV, which IS possible, I suppose.Anyway, it was good to see not only Zakk Wilde's name as one of the producers (one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists), but then when I found out other famous metal musicians also played band members in this movie (Jeff Pilson from Dokken, even though I got tired of them a long time ago), that was even better.  It's also nice to go back to your beginnings, as it's been forever since I've listened to anything less heavy than death metal and grindcore, but I forgot how good some of the regular metal is too (i. e. where they have frontmen that actually SING, that is).  Jennifer Anniston is also good, but this didn't do well (well, besides it being so mixed) since it had a limited audience to begin with, since obviously the only people who will see this are those that are into hard rock and heavy metal only, a bit like how people will see Minority Report because it had a huge budget, Tom Cruise, and it was directed by Steven Spielburg, yet those same people aren't suddenly going to decide that sci-fi is cool and will turn around and see all of the Star Trek movies (just like how none of us metal people are going to decide to see pop star Mariah Carey's movie Glitter...barf!).Oh well, it's best to see this in the video format, since if it doesn't work on you, then you can just turn it off and do something else, then get back to it later, rather than being trapped in a movie theatre for two hours and having to see the whole thing then.

What an amazing scenario, to have the criminals overtake an airplane and try to free themselves with Nick Cage (who is in the Italian-American Hall of Fame mind you) stuck in the middle of all of it.  You must watch this movie to see what predicaments the criminals get themselves into, and how Nick Cage, aided by Cusack and Meaney on the ground, tries to thwart their plans.  I feel this movie should have won multiple academy awards for best writing.  The dialogue between characters, especially Malkovich, was nothing short of phenominal.  So while I sit here and write my second comment for this movie, YOU need to go watch it.  I guarantee your life will be complete upon seeing this movie.A Masterpiece.  Belongs in the Walt Disney hall of fame. 45,000 stars out of a possible 10.

After viewing the film I now understand while he has gone on to only direct one other movie, he's not very good.  Even so, The Curse needs a lot of fixing up in both direction and editing just to get to mediocrity.  The biggest problem is the flow of the movie, its feel is very rough as it jumps from scene to scene.  This could be fixed with establishing shots.For example when Wil Wheaton's character views the Orb on the second night.  We have a shot of Wil looking out his window, cut to a shot of the Orb outside, cut to a shot of Wil outside, looking at the Orb.  How did he get there so fast??  A way to fix this is to have Wil looking at the Orb, get up to leave the room (to establish that he's going to go look at the Orb) and then cut to the scene of the orb, then cut to him looking at it.  Doing little things like establishing shots can make a movie look a lot more professional.But as I said even if this was done the film would only be mediocre.  Claude Akins and Wil Wheaton do as much as they can with the script they are giving.

I don't know why, its just that overly-sappy stories with 20-somethings playing teenagers has never been my thing. However, I do make exceptions (I'm a Breakfast Club and She's All That fan).  This film is kind of a departure from teen love\/teen comedy, because it focuses on a more adult topic that's right, it deals with college kids.I only saw a few scenes towards the end first time I saw this, and then the next time it was on TV, I only saw the same scenes.  I knew I needed to see this film, but it became rare on the pay-per-view channels I saw the ending on, so I went out and paid $29.99 for the DVD.  It's ok--it was worth the price.  I was almost single at the time as well (my 1st boyfriend and I were on the outs), and was just turning 18 when I bought this movie.  It actually helped me through the break-up--I knew things could be worse.In this spirited 2000 retelling of Annie Hall, (which I've never seen), a young man and woman find out about love and relationships during their college years.  Sophomore Al Connelly (Freddie Prinze Jr.), is a satisfied college sophomore who is studying liberal arts, but wants to be a chef. Freshman Imogen (Julia Stiles) worships artistry, but according to her mother, art should only be done on the weekends.  The two meet in a bar one night (AL I thought it was a cool place, but that's because they never checked IDs).  Al falls for Imogen immediately, sort of like infatuation. The two begin a whirlwind courtship that includes a conversation over cake, psychoanalysis (I'll explain this one better, because its one of my favorite scenes), sleeping together, and just enjoying each other's company.  But, the two become distant, and suddenly Al is floored when Imogen dumps him. He suddenly realizes that he needs her to live, and will do anything to get over her, even if it means going to extreme measures.While genuinely a sentimental flick, this is light-hearted and smart. The viewer comes away a little more knowledgable about the opposite sex after seeing this flick.  You can see the chemistry between Al and Imogen, and Prinze and Stiles capture the romantic scenes perfectly.  The story is told from both of their points of view, which is good, because the story would not work one-sided.  Every now and then, the movie would flash forward to either Prinze of Stiles in present day talking about each other, giving their take on everything, as well as a great voice-over track from both during the film.  Anyone who has ever experienced love lost could relate to Al, but I don't know (nor have I heard of) anyone who has ever tried to forget their lost love the way Al did (that was an interesting part).  The reason this film works is the chemistry. Although I am completely over the moon for Prinze, he is not the only reason I enjoyed this film.  It's funny but doesn't try to be silly.  It's sentimental, but not too sappy.  It's smart, but doesn't over kill us with too much intelligence.  It's never stupid, and certainly never dull.  This film works, simply put.My favorite scenes in this film are when Al goes to Imogen's dorm room with cake (Something sacred, he says).  The two have a conversation over the cake, which leads to psychoanalysis, (You know, we're prime for psychoanalysis, Imogen comments).  Al lays on her bed and Imogen asks him questions about his vices (sleeping, beer, wine), he asks about hers (smoking, chocolate, a few others), his past relationships (Faith Keenan--Clepto, Megan Brodski--Cheerleader, Haley Heller-- Scientist), her past relationships (Gabe Stiano--New Age, Ted McGurran--Allergic, and Ricky James--hated by the dog), what they love (him--fish), her (art).  They also disclosed their first kisses (shown in humorous flashbacks--his was a woman who dropped a ring when he was 12, hers was her gym partner when she was 11 1\/2, who knocked her down with a baksetball).  In addition, I liked the opening scene in the coffee shop where Al is observing two young lovers while talking to the camera (Reminds me of my relationship, except Imogen never wore that much jewelry, and I wouldn't be caught dead in those shoes.), the flashback scenes, the narration, the scene where Al attempts to get over Imogen by drinking shampoo (this actually was the one scene I heard alot about before seeing this movie), and the concluding scene (which I will not give away--its too good).This movie is a must rent\/buy for anyone who likes romantic comedies, Freddie Prinze Jr., or Julia Stiles.  I'm disappointed that alot of people didn't like this film, nor did it get the box office success it deserved. This film is targeted at teenage and young adults girls, and probably wouldn't interest the general public under the age of 13 or over the age of 25-30.  This was a good-intentions film, and a must see for those who are romantically involved, or for a girl's movie night.  I've actually owned the DVD for 2 years (2 years as of today, I believe--it was sometime in late October), and the film holds up well with time.  Definitely see this film, there's something for everyone!

Freshman Imogen (Julia Stiles) worships artistry, but according to her mother, art should only be done on the weekends.  The two meet in a bar one night (AL I thought it was a cool place, but that's because they never checked IDs).  Al falls for Imogen immediately, sort of like infatuation. The two begin a whirlwind courtship that includes a conversation over cake, psychoanalysis (I'll explain this one better, because its one of my favorite scenes), sleeping together, and just enjoying each other's company.  But, the two become distant, and suddenly Al is floored when Imogen dumps him. He suddenly realizes that he needs her to live, and will do anything to get over her, even if it means going to extreme measures.While genuinely a sentimental flick, this is light-hearted and smart. The viewer comes away a little more knowledgable about the opposite sex after seeing this flick.  You can see the chemistry between Al and Imogen, and Prinze and Stiles capture the romantic scenes perfectly.  The story is told from both of their points of view, which is good, because the story would not work one-sided.  Every now and then, the movie would flash forward to either Prinze of Stiles in present day talking about each other, giving their take on everything, as well as a great voice-over track from both during the film.  Anyone who has ever experienced love lost could relate to Al, but I don't know (nor have I heard of) anyone who has ever tried to forget their lost love the way Al did (that was an interesting part).  The reason this film works is the chemistry. Although I am completely over the moon for Prinze, he is not the only reason I enjoyed this film.  It's funny but doesn't try to be silly.  It's sentimental, but not too sappy.  It's smart, but doesn't over kill us with too much intelligence.  It's never stupid, and certainly never dull.  This film works, simply put.My favorite scenes in this film are when Al goes to Imogen's dorm room with cake (Something sacred, he says).  The two have a conversation over the cake, which leads to psychoanalysis, (You know, we're prime for psychoanalysis, Imogen comments).  Al lays on her bed and Imogen asks him questions about his vices (sleeping, beer, wine), he asks about hers (smoking, chocolate, a few others), his past relationships (Faith Keenan--Clepto, Megan Brodski--Cheerleader, Haley Heller-- Scientist), her past relationships (Gabe Stiano--New Age, Ted McGurran--Allergic, and Ricky James--hated by the dog), what they love (him--fish), her (art).  They also disclosed their first kisses (shown in humorous flashbacks--his was a woman who dropped a ring when he was 12, hers was her gym partner when she was 11 1\/2, who knocked her down with a baksetball).  In addition, I liked the opening scene in the coffee shop where Al is observing two young lovers while talking to the camera (Reminds me of my relationship, except Imogen never wore that much jewelry, and I wouldn't be caught dead in those shoes.), the flashback scenes, the narration, the scene where Al attempts to get over Imogen by drinking shampoo (this actually was the one scene I heard alot about before seeing this movie), and the concluding scene (which I will not give away--its too good).This movie is a must rent\/buy for anyone who likes romantic comedies, Freddie Prinze Jr., or Julia Stiles.  I'm disappointed that alot of people didn't like this film, nor did it get the box office success it deserved. This film is targeted at teenage and young adults girls, and probably wouldn't interest the general public under the age of 13 or over the age of 25-30.  This was a good-intentions film, and a must see for those who are romantically involved, or for a girl's movie night.  I've actually owned the DVD for 2 years (2 years as of today, I believe--it was sometime in late October), and the film holds up well with time.  Definitely see this film, there's something for everyone!

I don't know why, its just that overly-sappy stories with 20-somethings playing teenagers has never been my thing. However, I do make exceptions (I'm a Breakfast Club and She's All That fan).  This film is kind of a departure from teen love\/teen comedy, because it focuses on a more adult topic that's right, it deals with college kids.I only saw a few scenes towards the end first time I saw this, and then the next time it was on TV, I only saw the same scenes.  I knew I needed to see this film, but it became rare on the pay-per-view channels I saw the ending on, so I went out and paid $29.99 for the DVD.  It's ok--it was worth the price.

A film about American mythology, to which end Henry Fonda is central as a sadistic hitman.  This role pretty much undoes his whole career of do-gooding (with the exception of Fort Apache, which, it has been noted before, shows signs of influence on Once Upon a Time...), but more so it also undoes a mythological complex in American film. The film's shallowness is in its inability to produce any artistic or philosophic alternative to the myth.  Its attempt to do this is Claudia Cardinale as earth mother\/water bearer.  Her character, the protagonist, is interesting and there are many parallels to Joan Crawford in Johnny Guitar (redeemed prostitute, the dream of a rail station, etc.). The images are blazing with truth, and the characters are fantastic.  We even get to see Woody Strode and Jack Elam in a memorable opening scene involving a fly (possibly a touch characteristic of contributing author Dario Argento?).  Bronson is very good in the role of the man with no name or man with the harmonica or whatever you want to call him. The music is some of Morricone's best.This is a western film that is about westerns, about the West, about America, about Europe, about art and death.

A film about American mythology, to which end Henry Fonda is central as a sadistic hitman.  This role pretty much undoes his whole career of do-gooding (with the exception of Fort Apache, which, it has been noted before, shows signs of influence on Once Upon a Time...), but more so it also undoes a mythological complex in American film. The film's shallowness is in its inability to produce any artistic or philosophic alternative to the myth.  Its attempt to do this is Claudia Cardinale as earth mother\/water bearer.

Michael Myers is back and this time he's back with a vengeance, and perhaps with some help.

The first half hour of the film is Altman doing what he does best, the camera wanders around a fully-realized world built from the ground up and peopled by Altman.  The overlapping dialogue is great and the casting looks perfect.  I think the film peaks with the scene where Bill and Annie Oakley are target practicing - Altman weaves together firearms, sex, showbusiness and relationships into a pretty funny scene.Then the Indians show up.  Sitting Bull and William Halsey are portrayed as noble, mysterious and aloof.  The movie spirals into a series of events where they confound the smarmy Bill Cody over and over.  The last hour of the movie requires Newman to act more and more flustered by Sitting Bull until he has a really cringeworthy breakdown in front of a ghostly Sitting Bull.  Maybe there was more fresh drama in watching a white profiteer abase himself before noble Injuns in 1976.  It's hard for me believe that anyone but the most hardcore sentimentalist will find the drama between Cody and Bull interesting.Anyway, there's stuff for hardcore Altman fans to watch for.  Newman is initially impressive in his role and then sputters.  The pageants and attention to details that Altman excels at are well done.  Ultimately the themes of showbiz and history wilt before the rambling blah of the noble savage.
