[{"date":"31 December 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Reindeer Games does just about enough to garner a dumb, border-line recommendation; a confused, neo-noir infused heist flick that darts all over the place with so many tricks, turns and rug-pulling up its sleeve; that by the end the entire carpet is up and all that's left is to strip away the tiles from under both the character's and audience's feet. The film's a little messy, a bit patchy, full of somewhat inconsistent characters and a little wavy in overall tone; but there's a sense of adventure about it, a feeling of energy &#x96; a sense that it wants to try and entertain you as it takes you on this rabid ride all across the snowy outback of Michigan, as deceit; terror and characters as cold as the setting it is in which they're based, rule the roost.Reindeer Games is somewhat more of an exercise in second unit direction and punchy, surprise reveals than intricate plotting and precise character progression. There are a number of individual sequences, in which very few is said but rather a lot is done, that keep the film on some kind of straight and narrow. For instance, a passage of the film sees the lead attempt to escape from the grip of those that have him when they leave him alone in a motel room for the night. The attention to the motel and its surrounding area, its car park in particular, as a space while this individual attempts to avoid certain characters and catch up with others is a wonderfully unfolded sequence. Additionally, the premise for the entire passage places its criminal lead, a rather bland Ben Affleck, in an escapist-driven scenario thus complimenting the actor's annoyingly consistent expression of being frightened, as he strains to get away. The film begins, somewhat needlessly, right nearer the end of the piece as an array of dead individuals in Santa Claus outfits lie strewn around a casino building. We're greeted by a certain Rudy Duncan, and it's Affleck's voice. Rudy's been in prison for a number of years and just wants to lay low as his time in jail nears completion, something that looks in jeopardy when a riot breaks out in the cafeteria and mostly everyone gets involved. His cell-mate and good friend Nick (Frain), is stabbed rather mortally, leaving a bitter taste as freedom beckons. Upon our lead leaving prison, we learn that friends and relatives of these hardened criminals just getting out stand patiently outside in the cold so that they may greet these now free head-cases with warm smiles and cuddles as if they were waiting at an airport terminal for them after a long flight. We also learn that, the best thing to do in order to honour his friend, Rudy reckons getting with the girl he's been exchanging letters with whilst behind bars for all this time might be a good idea.And what a girl. We're lead to believe that Charlize Theron's Ashley; being the reasonably pretty twenty-five year old, easy going girl that she is; needs to go so low as to write to prison inmates in order to find that special someone. Rudy's been studying Ashley for longer and in ways she's unaware. Beginning from the bottom of the photograph and working his way up whilst doing exercises, Rudy has gazed at the pictures Nick was sent of her, by her, from over the years. The notion of having to work strenuously, whilst directly under the eye of her in some sort of form, echoes what's to come. Now, with Nick supposedly knifed; dead and out of the picture and with Ashely completely in the dark as to what Nick's supposed to look like, an advantageous scenario beckons. Director John Frankenheimer, making his last film before his death in 2002, pays closer attention to their relationship and the basis of their relationship than he might otherwise have done. Going into the underlying theme of their bond would spoil too much, but suffice to say; it is to do with identity and who it is they say they are at first meeting.Following a montage in which Ashley and Rudy get to know one another, a cringe-worthy passage that looks like it belongs in the latest Christmas time released romantic-comedy than anything else, Gary Sinise and his leather-sporting tough guy baddies turn up, seeing mostly all of Hell breaking loose. Sinise's Gabriel and his cohorts know that Nick used to work at a local casino, thus they presume he knows all the ins and outs of the security and layout which would be perfect for a robbery &#x96; a robbery Gabriel and co. want to perform. The film enjoys exploring the relationships between these characters and the power play that comes with them. In most of the scenes, Rudy has to bluff as Nick so as to avoid being simply killed; with bluffing playing a prominent part in who exactly is aligned with whom. The film is peppered with some daft instances in which the lyrics from popular Christmas musical numbers act as dialogue, while other Christmas songs pop up as part of the soundtrack. Of the film's other raging inconsistencies is a scene in which the enemy must explain the entire plot to the lead as he thinks he's about to eliminate him; and a bloodied, dual Uzi sporting Dennis Farina doing his best to defend himself. Reindeer Games has few admirers, and while it has that ability to have you emit the odd groan, it's the pulpy material and consistently smirking execution of said material which keeps it alive. The film doesn't settle for mindless action, and most of the more intense scenes revolve around the explosions of emotion between characters as revelations and in vein bargaining play out. This isn't the best by most involved, but it suffices for what it takes on.
