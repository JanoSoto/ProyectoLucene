And, with the exception of Six Degrees Of Separation (in which he had a supporting role), this was Will Smith's first serious film...and he comported himself very well. Matt Damon had less to prove here, having been in a number of serious films, but he also does very well here in a role where in various scenes he has to be very up or very down...and he balances it all pretty well.

They should have kept the narration. If nothing else it may have helped the audience understand and care about him a little more. But with such a moody and gloomy picture combined with its snail pace story, I'm really not sure what could have saved this.The story is interesting enough. Its kind of a police thriller but played out in a futuristic version of Los Angeles. Ford plays some kind of a detective who is assigned to locate and exterminate a handful of replicants. These are androids created to do some type of slave labor on other planets. Apparently they have been deemed too dangerous to be allowed back on earth and must be killed if they are found here. A few scenes show us in graphic detail that they can be capable of psychotic mayhem. Too bad the film isn't even half as interesting as this paragraph makes it sound.

When I saw this in the TV schedule, a 1999-made horror which I - a horror enthusiast - had never heard of and starring some big names, I thought it had to be worth a try. I'm all for 'psychological horror' - which is what this smugly claims to be - and atmosphere in lieu of visual horror, but this fails to deliver in every way.The 'tension-devices' are clichéd and hammy, from creaking doors and continual little anti-climaxes such as coming upon people by surprise. The slightly grotesque and creepy gatekeeper, Bruce Dern (his very casting here a cliché, and could barely be called a cameo) is supposedly meant to create menace. Ditto the weird female housekeeper and the little introductory talk she gives to each arriving guest. They do not. By this point, it's plainly obvious the movie is crushingly bland, self-indulgent and uninspired anyway.You can feel this aura right away at the prologue, where Liam Neeson is being debated by his boss on the ethics of his 'sleep\/fear project'. It is presented with no tone of intrigue or drama whatsoever, and just a smattering of cod-intellectualism. Then we are introduced to one very big haunted (we presume) house through the eyes of the first guest arriving. This is where the clichés come thick and fast, as things plod along at the very pace she is walking through the house.The building itself does not convince, an utterly fantastical and fake construct inside and out. Liam Neeson's dour acting style can be great in some roles, but given the wrong script or casting he can be blandness personified - as here. The end result is his persona simply reflects instead of carrying the entire movie (as he manages to do in Taken). By the time all the 'fear' comes, it does not convince. As the plot is gradually revealed, it does not convince. The horror effects, excellent though some of them are, are laid on so thick and fast that - you've guessed it - they do not convince.

I vividly remember going to see it at my local theater. The place was packed; there had been a lot of buzz about the movie, and&#x97;being a preteen dino enthusiast&#x97; I begged my parents to take me one Saturday afternoon so I could see what everyone was talking about. When it was over, something profound had occurred. It was the first time I recall feeling an overwhelming sense of wonder at what I'd witnessed. Sure, Star Wars had blown me away as a child, and I absorbed all things Indiana Jones; but there was something about Jurassic Park that completely enveloped me. Much of this, I think, has to do with seeing it on the big screen. It wasn't only that, though; it was the seamless effects, the just-plausible- enough-to-be-believable story, and the intense action (too intense, perhaps, for some kids my age, but I ate it up with a spoon) that made it absolutely unforgettable. Thus my love of cinema was cemented forevermore.When I learned that the movie was getting the 3D treatment I groaned. The movie wasn't designed for three dimensions, and there was absolutely no way that it would make for a convincing transfer (especially when compared to films like Avatar, which were specifically tailored for the medium). I managed to resist making too much of a snap judgment and ventured out to my local theater to see the thing (with an IMAX treatment, no less) because, hey&#x97;it's Jurassic freakin' Park.Imagine my surprise when that long-lost sense of wonderment was instantly rekindled from the very first frame. When John Williams' thundering score kicked in, the outside world melted away and I was, for all intents and purposes, a kid again. But not only that; the movie lends itself nicely to 3D, with wayward tree limbs and cascading rainstorms feeling as if they were strategically placed knowing that the movie would one day be reborn in an even more tangible manner.If this wasn't confirmation enough that the movie had seen a successful transition, all I had to do was glance at the youngsters sitting a few seats down from me. I'm guessing they'd never seen the film in any iteration, as their reactions&#x97;ooohs and aaahs in equal measure&#x97;were proof positive that this a picture perfect example of the magic of cinema. A side note I could hardly restrain a snicker as they jolted (nearly) out of their seats when the stray velociraptor popped his head out from behind the control panel. I did the same thing when I was their age, and it's a virtual certainty that the experience&#x97;and the aforementioned sense of wonderment&#x97;will stick with them for a long, long time.So, in case I haven't been clear, go see JP 3D. If you've never seen it, then&#x85; well&#x85; what are you waiting for? If you've seen it at least 500 times since its original release (like me), then trust me when I say that this new iteration is well worth the money. My hope is that the move will be re-released in another 20 years so the next generation of moviegoers can see what it's like to be transported to a world where the impossible really does exist.

I vividly remember going to see it at my local theater. The place was packed; there had been a lot of buzz about the movie, and&#x97;being a preteen dino enthusiast&#x97; I begged my parents to take me one Saturday afternoon so I could see what everyone was talking about. When it was over, something profound had occurred. It was the first time I recall feeling an overwhelming sense of wonder at what I'd witnessed. Sure, Star Wars had blown me away as a child, and I absorbed all things Indiana Jones; but there was something about Jurassic Park that completely enveloped me. Much of this, I think, has to do with seeing it on the big screen. It wasn't only that, though; it was the seamless effects, the just-plausible- enough-to-be-believable story, and the intense action (too intense, perhaps, for some kids my age, but I ate it up with a spoon) that made it absolutely unforgettable.

I find it astonishing that it gained so much praise and so many high ratings. I think it should be regarded to a degree as a comedy, because there are so many things in the movie that lack coherence, integrity and, must of all, a plain sense of just about anything.For starters, the story isn't either original nor great. It's a classic love triangle, that could be solidified by a much better script. Because the script is...just lazy - the dialogue between the characters is short, empty and doesn't add anything to any kind of depth. The characters are dull, even the acting is, in my opinion, very forced (I mean, their expressions are always the same throughout the whole film, which is indeed a very comic element), there's no evident reason why anybody should care about them. Hell, most of them don't even have names, which adds to the numbness of their story-arc. Because there is hardly a story arc anywhere - beyond the soapy, almost pathetic role of the protagonists. So yeah, we are left with almost no story at all, because the most of it just flows around the classic love\/hate relationships, but in such a yawny, a-hundred-times-seen manner that you know what's going to happen in the first half of the movie.Then we have the narrator, which is plain horrible. Or maybe the most comic part of the movie. Both actually. It seems like it's (it's a she, the fish - faced girl who portraits the main protagonist Bill's little sister) just rambling about and on and on about that or this nonsense. At moments it seems that she's trying really hard to get some point or other across, but then just returns to her non-coherent babbling about some ghost touching her neck or somethin'. Her vocabulary is really, um, limited, her accent isn't even Chicago oriented, like the movie states it to be (thank you Qatacyo) and her talent to tell is just...not a talent. Really. I don't know what Malick was thinking while choosing her as the narrator, but he really should be forever imbarrased by his choice.As the whole story progresses, we learn nothing new. After Bill gets himself finally killed, it looks like we wasted 3\/4 of the film, because life really just goes on for his lover and his little sister like nothing ever happened. The ending is pure wtf to me. Like the whole film actually.Of course, with Malick you know that there's going to be some really beautiful photography and cinematic awesomeness ahead. About that, I can't complain - the shots of the nature, surroundings, pastoral fields, animals and insects are really stunning. But that's the only thing in the film that is really worth praising for. And I can't rate this movie higher than 3\/10, because everything else pretty much sucks and just shows all the impatience and suffering the director had to go through in the two years of editing after the shoot. It really shows that he pretty much knew that it's going to end up in a mess. We see that in the way the scenes blend together with no elemental feeling of the story - there's a scene, it's short, we get three lines of dialog and then he pushes us in a new scene that just repeats the formula again and again, without even the slightest coherence. It's all so painfully random and shallow, even the scenes that are supposed to be important or somethin'. So even in this aspect we are left with a couple of nice, really beautiful shots that can't really follow the story around, because it's so weak and tells us absolutely nothing of a real value.I enjoyed for example The Thin Red Line greatly - although the story again isn't that much original, it's pieced together in a skillful way. Professional. The same goes for The Tree of Life. And I dig Tarkovski or Kubrick (and many others), who both did manage to blend together average stories with great cinematography with stunning results. So I guess it's not about either the story element vs. the cinematography element, but it's rather a clever and passionate unison of both that make great, exciting and everlasting masterpieces of cinema.

It's always hard to pick the best film of a genre but if one wanted to say HIGH NOON was the greatest Western ever made it would be hard to fight them. This is an incredibly tense little movie that pretty much takes place in real time and it's just amazing to see how much tension director Fred Zinnemann builds over the course of 85-minutes. I think there are so many classic moments in this film and in fact it's hard to think of any weak moment. I think some of the strongest stuff deals with the question on why the Marshal should wait around when he's got the chance to leave. There are all sorts of questions asked throughout the film like whether the Marshal should stay or why the people should help him. There are several scenes where the Marshal tries to get help from people but each one has him being turned down for a variety of reasons. All of these scenes just make you blood boil more and also they make you want to see the man succeed. Director Zinnemann mixes the brilliant score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the cinematography by Floyd Crosby to really make for a claustrophobic feel that just grows more tense as we get closer to noon. I really loved the way the film was shot as the camera is always up close on the characters and this really gives the picture a real feeling of 3D. Another major plus are the terrific cast members with Cooper leading the way. I think this here is one of his greatest performances because it mixes that tough and brave guy that we love to see him play but there are also scenes where he shows a weakness and the actor pulls all of this off without any problem. Kelly is good as the rather naive wife and Lloyd Bridges is especially memorable as the deputy who backs out. Thomas Mitchell, Lon Chaney, Katy Jurado, Otto Kruger, Harry Morgan and Lee Van Cleef are also great in their parts. Jack Elam's one quick scene of comic relief is perfectly executed. Then we've got Tex Ritter's wonderful song that plays throughout the film. Yes, HIGH NOON is about as great as they came and it's a true classic that continues to get better.

The crows are hilarious, and are definitely one of the best aspects of the movie, and the mother elephant is a typical mother who watches out for their kid.The songs are pretty good as well. Baby Mine is a slow, emotional, melodic tune, When I See An Elephant Fly is an upbeat track that makes you want to dance, and the score is very good as well.The animation is not as good as the previous 3 (because of its small budget), but it is still very interesting, and you could tell that they animated it, so it could stand out from the other films. The Pink Elephant scene is so cool. The way that they go about and move is so brilliant and is beyond words. This is ranked lower than the others because although it is a great film, it is a bit too short (a bit over an hour), and the fact that it does not leave much of an impact on you like the others do. I think that if the film was a bit longer, you would get a bit more invested into it.If you want to watch a short, entertaining family movie, Dumbo is the movie to go to.

This film is about a male elephant who was born with huge ears gets constantly made fun of by the other elephants in the circus, and the humans. After a boy goes too far into picking on Dumbo, his mother goes crazy, and gets locked up in a speedster place for crazy animals. Dumbo then gets put into an act where he falls a ridiculously high distance. Will he be able to shine in the circus?

At a time where movie studios pretty much did what they liked with a licence with no regard to the source material and with the subject matter being firmly kid-orientated thanks to the cartoon, this could have been a bungling mess of cheap cuts, tacky lines and 'boing' sound effects......but oh lord it wasn't!All kudos must go to Director Steve Barren. He not only kept the mass fans of the cartoon happy but also was fairly true to the roots of the comics as well. yes the film has it's fun moments but it is certainly a much more grown up version of the Turtles story and this added a whole new dimension. The thing that makes the film is that it took a brave stance on the content. It didn't pander to the very young kids with braindead dialogue and toned down cartoon action. It's a very dark film, with much more mature content than you'd think would be allowed for a major cashing in on a kids cartoon. Proper fights, adult themes and even pushing the language a bit further than would maybe be comfy for parents of very young children but this only served to make one who is just coming into his teenage years feel like he is being treated with respect when watching the movie. The film has a real gruff, grimy look to it. New York city is portrayed with grubby streets full of trash with dark alleyways and lots of shadows (Very strangely reminding me of Level 2 of the game The last Ninja 2 which is set in New York streets) The films look has a very grainy feel to it, whether this was down to low budget or deliberate I don't know but it added a very dark feel to the action.Barren and the actors hit a perfect balance between the jokey wisecracks and the action packed fights (of which there are many) The humour from the cartoon is retained but it IS actually funny as the green ninjas take the utter mick out of the foot clan whilst simultaneously kicking the seven shades out of them and never once does the humour feel forced or insultingly dumbed down.The fights themselves are actually very well co-ordinated and Barren makes sure that not much is held back in terms of how violent it is with good solid punch and kick sound effects although at no point does it ever seem gratuitous. This of course was in a time where Hollywood hadn't really caught up to the quality of Hong Kong fight scenes and although the later Turtles films had much superior choreography (But inferior films in themselves) the fights in this film do just right, no more and no less.Jim Henson's workshop did a fantastic and groundbreaking at the time job. The Turtles look and move great with all the facial expressions truly realised and used to full effect. This is another feather in Barren's cap as he fought to get Jim Henson and his team on board.All the performances are pretty much bang on thanks to a script which point blank refused to be dumbed down and actually dealt with some pretty dark subjects such as gang influence and teenage runaways and criminals.Special Kudos must go to the voice actors, and in particular Kevin Clash's performance as Splinter. The soft, emotional oriental tones of the old ninja master rat truly displays a feeling of wisdom and fatherhood and one could almost be moved to tears with the felling in is voice.

The random, often anti- chronological leaps to and from memories of pre-war, war, and post-war eras made fluent understanding nothing short of impossible.

The intercutting black and white scenes, although not exactly depicting a jump in time, went along well with slow motion, and emphasized dramatic moments, like Masha running away from the criticism of a colleague when she overacted about a misprint in the newspaper. On the flipside, color scenes, although not particularly faster in pace, featured less tense dialogue, and more emphasis on how everything is so hurried, tense, etc. The color scenes, like that of the doctor meeting Masha and talking about the serenity of nature produced this effect of a needing to slow down. The use of doors as portals to different people and different times was also an effective move. The disappearance of a strange woman talking to Ignat made her message (in the form of Pushkin's letter) regarding the history of Russia being uninteresting much more dramatic and believable.

Bambi is the young, naive deer who has to get taught how to survive, and becomes a mature man in the end. His friends (the skunk and rabbit) are cute and supportive friends. His mother is a wise deer.The characters do not burst into song, and I don't believe that there are any songs, just an amazing score.

It's not only one of the best films of the 90s,but of all-time,a classic of Film-Noir and Crime Drama and one of my favorite movies.Based on James Ellroy's novel and set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1950s,L.A Confidential tells the story of three L.A.P.D cops Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey),Wendell Bud White(Russell Crowe)and Edmund J. Exley(Guy Pierce)who are all different kinds of police officers and had nothing in common. Jack does it for the fame,Bud does it for fear and brutality and Edmund does it to rise above the ranks and live up to his legendary Father who was also a cop. But when one of their own is murdered in a coffee shop robbery,the three cops must come together and solve the case that's filled with twists and turns.L.A Confidential is a brilliant,classic film that was kind of overlooked and underrated in 1997. Despite doing well at the box-office,receiving critical acclaim and being nominated for 8 Oscars and winning two L.A Confidential was overshadowed by James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic. But thankfully L.A Confidential's reputation has grown and the film has become a classic and rightfully so because this film is one of those movies is that if you watch it on television or DVD you never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. One of the many reasons L.A Confidential is a great film is because of the way the film shows Los Angeles in the early 1950s,because when people think of L.A in the 50s they think movie stars,palm trees,beaches and sunny skies. But L.A.C gives viewers a dark world filled with intrigue and Mystery where L.A is surrounded by a dark and bleak underbelly of violence,sex,drugs and police corruption,selling a false and fake image of L.A as a beautiful paradise,but the L.A in this film is far from a paradise showing 1950s Los Angeles and how it really was the way people in L.A knew about but people outside of L.A didn't really know of. L.A.C is a Film-Noir in the truest since with the characters actions that are harsh and sometimes brutal where the characters defined by their actions just as much as their words and every character is not black and white but in shades of gray a Film-Noir in where nothing is what it seems and no one is who they say they are and there is plenty of twists and turns on every corner. And while L.A.C is in the great style and genre of Film-Noir it is not film in the classic style of Film-Noirblack and white photography,dark shadows and harsh and surreal lighting,but natural lighting. Dante Spinotti's beautiful photography and lighting is more natural and realistic where the sunlight is shown in the way it is in the real world and not in the movies. While the film is 2 1\/2 hours the movie moves at such fast pace you feel like you the movie is 90 minutes instead of 137 minutes. There are many characters in the film but everyone gets enough screen time and no role,character or dialog is wasted. The screenplay by Curtis Hansen and Brian Helgeland is just excellent and memorable,with Hansen and Helgeland taking James Ellroy's gritty and tough dialog,the characters from the book and makes situations and moments feel real and just come to life. And while the film doesn't necessary follow the storyline exactly like the book,the spirit of Ellroy's style and writing is still felt throughout the film. The movie's three main characters Jack,Bud and Ed are great characters who fit in the style of Film-Noir and are really well-developed because in the beginning of the film you do not always like them or the things that they do but as the film goes along you begin like them and relate to the three characters in different ways and discover their complex personalities and who they are Although L.A.C isn't an Action film there are a few great Action scenes in the film that are filled with great suspense and surprises during the Action scenes. The final 15-20 minutes of the film is Crime Drama and Film-Noir at it's best and will have you glued to the screen with it's Action and great suspense. A great ending.The whole cast is brilliant in their roles. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Sgt. Jack Vincennes,with Spacey bringing a calm and cool feeling to the performance. Russell Crowe is brilliant and at his best as Wendell Bud White,with Russell bringing anger and intensity to the role. Guy Pearce is fantastic as Ed Exley,with Pearce conveying intelligence and cleverness with the performance. Great character actor James Cromwell is terrific and memorable as cop Dudley Smith. Kim Basinger is wonderful and beautiful as Lynn Bracken,a hooker with a heart of gold and Bud's love interest. Danny DeVito is great as slimy tabloid reporter Sid Hudgens. The Underrated David Strathaim is fabulous and smooth as Pierce Moorehouse Patchett,Lynn's pimp. Ron Rifkin(D.A Ellis Loew),Simon Baker(Matt Reynolds),Graham Beckel(Dick Stensland)and Plalo Seganti(Johnny Stompanato)give fine performances as well.The direction by Curtis Hanson is excellent,with Hanson always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace with a great visual style while also doing well with the Action scenes. Great direction by Hanson.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is intense,brooding,excellent and fits in with film's Film-Noir tone. I also loved Goldsmith's homage to his classic score from Chinatown in one of the scenes. Great score from Goldsmith. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack from Dean Martin(The Christmas Blues,Powder Your Face with Sunshine),Kay Starr(Wheel Of Fortune),Jonny Mercer(Hit The Road To Dreamland)and more.In final word,if you love Crime Dramas,Film-Noir,Mystery,James Ellroy or films in general I highly suggest you see L.A Confidential,an absolute classic of cinema that you can watch again and again and never get tired of.
