Still, it is a stirring portrayal of racism from within the justice system and an engrossing crime drama. It perfectly captures the time period of 1960s southern society. The film drips perfectly with the swampy atmosphere of the locale - watching it, you can practically feel the humidity causing sweat to pour down your back. Plus, past the morals dealing with racism, the film can be enjoyed as a compelling mystery and character drama. Both Mr. Tibbs and Chief Gillespie are terrifically drawn characters with a good amount of depth that transcends any normal film dealing with racism (its a much better film than the recent and overrated Crash).On a technical level, the film is terrific. Sidney Poitier shows why he was one of the country's biggest movie stars for a period of time. As the cool and calm Mr. Tibbs, he offers what is possibly his best performance. Rod Steiger is just as great as Police Chief Gillespie, giving a lot of emotional depth to a character who could've been a stock type racist Southern male, not completely demonizing him but showing his inherit flaws. Its also odd seeing Warren Oates playing such a submissive character (I'm used to his tough guy roles in Sam Peckinpah and Monte Hellman's films), but hes great as always. The direction by Norman Jewison is workmanlike and aesthetically dull, but technically perfect and the film moves at a very quick pace.

He perfectly captures the cynicism, intensity, and occasional vulnerability of the classic character. To think he was starring in fluffy romantic comedies prior is unbelievable. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but this is Powell's show all the way.Its not only Powell which makes this production masterful. Edward Dmytryk's direction is atmospheric as all hell, perfectly capturing the quintessential noir feel. You can practically smell the smoke and whiskey coming off the screen. The cinematography and editing find the right balance between the slick and seedy and occasionally the violence is ahead of its time.

Nevertheless, George Sanders gives the finest performance as the smart and sinister Addison DeWitt, an influential critic who has a major role to play in this event.Above all, the script is what makes this a classic film in its own right. Mankiewicz, just like he did in his previous film A Letter to Three Wives, perfectly balances the transitions between all the main characters. There isn't a dull moment here and by the end, it is a surprise as well as a satisfying look at backstabbing and deceit. This is a near-perfect movie that gets better and better with each viewing. Great acting, solid direction and perfect writing make this a true classic of the Golden Age.

Spielberg's stop- motion, ridiculous corny dialogue back when it wasn't yet so corny and wasn't yet quite so riddled with cheap gratuity, and bygone use of a memorable orchestral score are the true welcome escapes.Moreover, the Jurassic Park films, The Lost World being by far the most fulfilling one, demonstrate a significant implication that may hopefully be heeded by the youngsters who routinely go through phases with the giant Hollywood franchises such as this, one of letting nature run its course gracefully, to leave nature be, to recognize the harm, vanity, infection, and especially the danger in exploiting it and forcing it out of its biological process.

Selznick production of A STAR IS BORN (United Artists, 1937), as directed by William A. Wellman, is a Hollywood story, one of many perhaps, with that all too familiar theme of fame and fortune not always bringing happiness, yet regardless of its timely message (tragedy is a test of courage), there's no doubt that this adaptation ranks one the finest in the lot. Janet Gaynor, a star who was born a decade ago during the silent film era, and being the first actress to win an Academy Award (1928-29), is appropriately cast in her best screen role in a sound film in what might have been Gaynor, a star reborn, this time in glorious Technicolor.Opening with the final shooting script with description of Scene One, fade-in to farmhouse in Fillmore, South Dakota, the plot gets immediately underway with Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor), an avid movie fan, returning home from the theater with her little brother Alex (A.W. Sweatt). Because of her love for the movies and wanting to become an actress, she is criticized and ridiculed by her father (J.C. Nugent) and especially Aunt Mattie (Clara Blandick). As for her grandmother (May Robson), she believes in Esther. After being offered her life savings, Esther takes the next train bound for Hollywood where she is to seek fame and fortune, even if it breaks her heart. Esther registers at the boarding house run by Pop Randall (Edgar Kennedy), applies for acting jobs at numerous studios, and while one good natured receptionist tells her she has a thousand to one chance of ever making it, Esther believes she's that one who will. After an introduction with co-director Danny McGuire (Andy Devine), who lands her a job as a waitress at a Hollywood party, Esther meets Norman Maine (Fredric March), her favorite movie idol who becomes attracted to her, so much by her beauty that whenever she exits, he asks, Do you mind if I have just ... one more look?  Norman talks producer Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) into giving Esther a screen test, followed by a motion picture debut under a new professional name of Vicki Lester, cast opposite Norman in The Enchanted Hour. After Vicki and Norman marry, Vicki's career reaches great heights, to a point of being voted best actress at the eighth annual Academy Awards, while Norman's popularity declines to the point of being terminated from his studio and turning to alcoholism that puts a tremendous strain on their marriage.With Janet Gaynor in a well deserved Academy Award nominated performance that might have paved the way for stronger performances, she's retired from the screen by 1938. Co-stars Fredric March also gives a great indication of a has-been actor that, too, earned him a best actor nomination, and May Robson, whose character appears during the opening and closing segments, was good enough to even get nominated in the supporting category. Other performers worth noting include Lionel Stander as Matt Libby, the gravel voice press agent; Elizabeth Jeans as Norman Maine's domineering escort; Jed Prouty as columnist for Cinema Sidelights, Franklin Pangborn and Guinn Williams in smaller roles.Aside from the fact that things happen so fast in A STAR IS BORN, the story gives the impression as being set solely in 1937 rather than a five or ten year span considering that much of the sets, womens fashions and hair styles appear to be the same throughout. The only notable change is Gaynor, whose character changes from young hopeful to a maturing movie star.The popularity of A STAR IS BORN did lead to musical remakes from Warner Brothers 1954, with Judy Garland and James Mason; and in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. Because of the Garland remake, the original version was kept out of circulation until around 1974-75 when it finally began appearing regularly on television, much to the amazement of a new generation of movie watchers unaware that the 1937 original ever existed. While many may argue the Garland version surpasses Gaynor's, which it does in some ways, the earlier screen treatment is more logical as a dramatic story rather than an overblown musical. The Vicki Lester portrayed by Garland is that of a great singer whose talent much better serves Broadway than Hollywood. Gaynor's Vicki belongs in Hollywood because she's strictly an actress. Regardless of several alterations, the first two are classics in their own right.With its availability on video cassette, DVD, and presentations on various cable TV networks, ranging from Nickelodeon's Nik-at-Nite Movie prior to 1988; American Movie Classics (1990s) and Turner Classic Movies, A STAR IS BORN, a soap-opera with some doses of humor, remains a realistic look at Hollywood's Hollywood that's still timely today.

Well, for the most part, yeah, Hitchcock was very good at what he did and he generally made entertaining movies. But even a genius can make mistakes, even the best can screw up, even the greats turn left when they should have turned right, you get the idea. In this case, Topaz is one of those few Hitchcock films that deserves the label of bad film. And no the old 2nd rate Hitchcock is still better than anyone else cannot hide the fact that this is simply a bad film.Based on a novel by Leon Uris which was based on the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the film follows a French agent, played by the late Frederick Stafford, as he is roped into doing some dirty work for Uncle Sam by an American intelligence man played by John Forsythe (who played one of Hitchcock's less endearing leading men in The Trouble With Harry which is still better than this). Politics, espionage and unhappy romances ensue. Unfortunately, there's no glue holding the film together.Clearly Hitchcock's heart was not in this one, just another assignment made by an old school filmmaker trying to keep working in a changing Hollywood industry, and even Hitchcock himself admitted this film was a turkey. A few well executed shots (such as a stylish death scene in Cuba) cannot make up for the over-length and lack of pacing.

Maybe it was too gross, because Carpenter's breakthrough success Halloween is a very restrained film when it comes to on screen violence (its reputation is derived from the sequels). Maybe its because there are no female characters in the cast, who knows. Looking at it today, time has been very kind. Its still one of the most suspenseful films ever made and an absolute masterpiece of not only the horror genre, but film all together. In fact, I'd say this is one of the few remakes to better the original. The original is an entertaining spook show, but Carpenter's version is an absolutely delirious thrill ride.There are many reasons why the film is so fantastic. For one, Carpenter's direction is the finest of his whole career. He can alternate between being over-the-top and subtle seamlessly, and the pacing is pitch perfect. The acting from the whole cast is very good, as these supposedly tough guy characters take on more depth as the film continues. But, the main reason why this film has garnered its reputation over the years are the special effects. To be honest, the quality of the rest of the film's departments deserve just as much credit. But the effects are still fantastic, and seem way more convincing than most recent CGI overdosing blockbusters. The monster is a truly Lovecraftian creation, and is absolutely terrifying to behold.

I'm no stranger to camp cult classics, but Sam Raimi's particular brand of over-the-top pleasure always involves a sort of forcefulness, a kind of shouting, of the dialog and actions so that everything seems so frantic all of the time. Evil Dead still had this type of humor, but relaxed it and let it flow a bit... this movie pretty much shows off the scenes Raimi was interested in and which ones he just put in there for the story to connect. The beginning shoots by without a breath... the ending drags... some scenes or jokes are emphasized beyond their range, and other stuff is just shown and thrown away before the audience has time to really grasp it.However, Evil Dead 2 is much stronger than Army of Darkness, mostly from its physical comedy. Ash's wrestling with his own hand is some pretty genius stuff, and the scene where the entire house becomes animated, starting with a deer's bust, is pretty much one of the most trippy and bizarre scenes I've seen in cinema--the type of thing that would have scared the crap out of me if the silliness of the rest of the movie hadn't bracketed it in.I think the intention behind Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness was good, but I think Raimi could have stood to pace it down a bit and put less emphasis on being frenetic and hyperactive.
