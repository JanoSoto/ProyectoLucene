You know that it's childish to laugh at it, and that it's not really THAT funny. But still you can't help yourself and constantly find your self laughing.. This is that kind of movie.Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) and Doug Remer (Matt Stone) are two friends from school who are heading to a reunion when the movie starts. They are both losers and everyone else at the reunion seems to have made something out of themselves. Then they get dared to play basketball against two other guys. They then proceed to invent their own game where you don't have to run or break a sweat... Soon this game becomes a huge hit under the name Baseketball (mix between Basketball and Baseball).If you've seen a David Zucker-outing before you know roughly what to expect. Like in the Naked Gun the comedy is fast and often below the belt. What really works to this films advantage is Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Their comical timing is excellent and they seem to really enjoy themselves. I'm quite surprised how well they work here!So, this IS really funny if you overlook the fact that it's more than a little childish. I rate it 6\/10.

I got chills. It's a bizarre film, filled with off-kilter touches, but it sure is a Kubrick film--with genuinely haunting images. The melding together of all the various elements--Shelly Duval's unusual acting style, JackNicholson's,...well...Jack Nicholson persona, gorgeous cinematography withthat breathtaking opening and a classic 20th century film score adds up to areally nifty experience. Seen in context of Kubrick's other masterpieces--it is fascinating to see how he weaves his absolutely distinctive style andobsessions into this film. Seeing it in its first run years ago--I remember the audience getting a real jolt, simply by having the word Tuesday appear on the screen. A wonderful moment! And the audience roared with laughter at that.But then there were moments such as the ending that you wished would giveyou one final scare a la Carrie but instead just seems to end. This is not your average horror movie. The way the characters talk, and their sort of insipid dialogue feels sometimes mundane and even kind of ordinary. But then thosemesmerizing images take hold, and the very ordinariness of the dialogue makes the horror that much creepier. We know Kubrick calculated every single instant of his film--and this one is certainly no exception. With this film he remained a master manipulator, and a master artist.

Carlito's Way is the one that's keep crawling back to my DVD-player.Pacino has a really great role as Carlito, a Puerto-Rican convicted mobster that is out of jail after 5 years thanks to his lawyer friend David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). He wants to leave with his old girlfriend and get away from the environment that, so he says, has had much influence on his former actions. He decides he wants to lead a better life, but soon finds himself having to help his friend with some dirty business.If you've seen Dressed to Kill, Carrie or other De Palma films you'll see similarities in the of the camera , which makes excellent suspense. The camera sometimes takes the first-person position of a character often showing just an environment. Shots like this are not seen much in other films these days, but are really compelling to watch. A lot of De Palma-typical stuff is seen in this film, and the way it all works together makes this for me his best work to date.

It centers around the type of musician that the world of musicians can not stand.You see, there are those that get it, and those that don't. The characters in this movie of course are, the ones that don't. The cluelessly untalented, has beens, never will be's and do anythings that don't have a snowballs chance in hell at even making a solid living in local music scenes. These are the crowd that our more obsessed with the dream than they are about simply creating music.We follow a small group of characters and while they are musicians, the story mainly focuses on how foolish and hopeless they are. What's worse is that as untalented as they are, somehow the opportunities are there....much like the real world of musicians.As things escalate, a few of the characters get more and more unlikable. I mean this movie really did suck, but it did a great job of depicting these jackasses as they really are.It's a late night indi film that pops up every few years. Just like there are films created specifically for actors, this one was specifically for musicians.Yeah it sucks, but it will give you a good idea of what and who the bottom of the barrel in the music world is. It will also show why these ppl are disliked and found to be unbearably annoying and useless......yet sometimes producers and even record exec's find a way to give them fame and fortune....BLAH.
