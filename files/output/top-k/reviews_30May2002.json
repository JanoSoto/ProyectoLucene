[{"date":"30 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy, who has worked as a screenwriter on several films, like G.I. Jane and the new Below. He directed this and I must say I'm pleased to see the film is this effective. The story begins weirdly as we don't know what's going on. It is better to know as little as possible about this film before watching it, so I won't tell you too much. The spaceship crashes into a strange planet in which there seems to be sunny all the time and no nights at all. Soon the darkness begins to threaten and the real hellish nature of the planet starts to reveal and the nightmare begins.There are many great scenes in Pitch Black and especially the use of camera is marvelous. The fast edits are stylish and they are not used too much and they don't irritate. The use of light, shadow and darkness is so effective that the viewer will be on the edge of the seat. It is great to see that Hollywood still manages to release something this interesting and marginal. As we learn what the real threat in the planet is, the tension just raises as the enemy is too strong (and hungry) for the crew members..Also, the sound effects are very creepy and sometimes reminded me of the power of Japanese film Ringu by Hideo Nakata. Technically this film should please demanding fans of horror cinema, too, and don't be turned off about the big studio status of the film.The atmosphere in the planet is VERY scary and the feeling of Hell is touchable. There is a real terror and horror present, and in fact, I hadn't seen anything this effective for some time, at least from Hollywood. There are few stupid cliches that should have been left away, but it seems to be always the case with these kind of films. The film is not too clever or intelligent, and it works mainly in the level of cinematic power and pure terror experience. The effects are great and gore is stylish and not too over the top or laughable. At least the head bite scene is inventive and memorable. Couple of scenes are very disturbing and scary and they only add to the power of the whole movie.8\/10 rating is deserved and this should be seen in big screen (or at least in Widescreen) as that way Pitch Black would be even more effective experience. More this kind of films from Hollywood!
