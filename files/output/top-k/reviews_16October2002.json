Miss Witherspoon is prominently featured in the opening few minutes (with some of her features famously quite prominent)but she otherwise does not factor much into the film.  At a crucial moment in these opening scenes she accidentally shoots Paul Newman (a Private Investigator sent to retrieve 17 year-old Reese from a weekend of concupiscence with her slightly older boyfriend at a resort in Mexico).  Her little girl-like panicked and blurtingly apologetic reaction- eyes like saucers, hand against the mouth- to this incident embodies every\/any character Miss Witherspoon has portrayed on screen thus far (including, presumably the girl in Sweet Home Alabama, which I have not yet seen).  It was quite an illuminating moment for those interested in her career.Onward, however, to the subject at hand the movie itself.  When cast in 1998, as I mentioned, Miss Witherspoon was just another young aspiring actress in California.  The rest of the cast is like a Who's Who of established Hollywood stars, which in and of itself makes for an entertaining film, despite a certain severe weakness to the story and direction, which conspire to make the plot really only of incidental interest to the viewer.Paul Newman, looking every bit as aged as he is supposed to be, is cast as a retired Los Angeles police officer, Private Investigator, husband and alcoholic.  Ever since the shooting incident in Mexico, he has been staying as the houseguest of the wealthy actor and actress (Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandan) who had dispatched him on that mission.  Mr. Hackman's character is ill, and Miss Saradan's character is very seductive towards their guest\/companion\/gofer.  When an ostensibly simple task for Mr. Newman's character(an apparent blackmail pay-off on behalf of Gene Hackman)takes the film into a new direction as a mystery, James Garner (old Jim Rockford himself) saunters into the script as well as an old friend of Gene Hackman's, and former police force colleague of Newman's.  Stockard Channing (Rizzo, of Grease) appears as well as an LAPD Lieutenant, and former partner (among other duties) of the Newman character.The plot wanders along about blackmailers, the mysterious disappearance of Susan Sarandon's first husband twenty years before, remote mountain cabins and the efforts of Newman to piece things together.  A former partner is miraculously brought into the action when the plot requires, and dead bodies continue to accumulate while Newman, now in a Rockford-like mode struggles to solve the riddle before the LAPD haul him in. It's more like a TV movie mystery at this point than anything else, but that's not entirely bad.I think some important scenes or pieces of dialogue must have ended up on the cutting room floor, but it's easy enough to follow the trail and guess who really did what back then, and how it will turn out before the closing credits.   Reese's topless scenes were rather gratuitous and not necessary to the story, and now that she's America's newest sweetheart and movie star, (not to mention noted wife and mommy)will probably never be repeated on the silver screen again. The twilight of the careers of the older established actors has been eclipsed by the dawning of Reese's star.  It's interesting to watch, and the movie's not all that bad either.

We kept hoping that there were going to be some redeeming moments that would produce a laugh or two and it was going to get better, but all in vain. I should've turned it off when I felt the first urge to do so... which was 5 minutes into it. How a character like Tom Green remains at large is beyond me. How he became a Hollywood star I am not even going to attempt to explain. All this malarkey said here by people who somehow managed to like this disaster of a film that you need to just be really open minded and have a good sense of humor, not take yourself too seriously and you will like it is just that - malarkey. I am very open minded and have a very good sense of humor (and so does my girlfriend - we're some of the most easy going people you will ever find), but this movie is just plain unfunny, idiotic and disgusting. When one watches is it one gets a distinct feeling of disbelief that someone in Hollywood actually spent a lot of money on making something like this. That is even taking in consideration the fact that more then half the movies that are coming out of Hollywood are total crap. That is inevitable with the amount of films being produced, but this one is so shockingly bad that I just do not understand how anyone would provide funding for it. I guess it was justified because they figured that there would be enough people who would go and watch it. It is at least nice to hear that most left the theater before it was over.

Some here said that this was one of the funniest movies they have ever seen. Perhaps this flick could be useful in weeding out complete wackos. I think it is pretty safe to take whoever laughs until their stomach hurts at this one, load them up on trucks and take them far, far away. We will all thank Tom Green for a service he has provided this way. Someone said that it should be commended for the strong reaction it produced. I love it how people try to reach to justify just about anything sometimes. To you I say this. When you step into a pile of feces while walking on the street it also produces quite a strong reaction, doesn't it? This one is right up there... or should i say right down there with Scary Movie 2.

When Robin Williams is billed next to Al Pacino, it's very difficult to decide if it's going to work out. However, the concept had me intrigued. The film starts off well, and the tension that Pacino creates with his partner is very tangible, this part of the film is where he really gets something to act with. However, I couldn't help but feel, as the film progressed, it was relying on his weary features to produce the look of an insomniac, rather than his true acting abilities. A few brief moments with the rookie Alaskan cop shows there's still something there, but I think it was the story that confined his acting rather than his acting confining the story.Robin Williams, however, puts in a wonderful performance. I couldn't see him in this role and I was convinced I'd be thinking about his comic runs. Not once, well maybe not true, but I only thought of them in retrospect. I was totally absorbed by his performance, and you almost are in a dilemma over his situation. He should get more serious roles out of this.The rest of the cast acts well, but I'm afraid that this may be another case of a Hollywood film ruining a good foreign film, although I have yet to see the original.

However, I couldn't help but feel, as the film progressed, it was relying on his weary features to produce the look of an insomniac, rather than his true acting abilities. A few brief moments with the rookie Alaskan cop shows there's still something there, but I think it was the story that confined his acting rather than his acting confining the story.Robin Williams, however, puts in a wonderful performance. I couldn't see him in this role and I was convinced I'd be thinking about his comic runs. Not once, well maybe not true, but I only thought of them in retrospect. I was totally absorbed by his performance, and you almost are in a dilemma over his situation. He should get more serious roles out of this.The rest of the cast acts well, but I'm afraid that this may be another case of a Hollywood film ruining a good foreign film, although I have yet to see the original. The suspense is dampened throughout the second half, and I can't quite put my finger on why. Perhaps we are told too much and shown too much in the first half, and you know everything that is going on and why at every turn. Although it is billed that you will be torn as to what is wrong and right, this lasted for a mere instant, as the rights are so obviously more right than the wrongs. I think this is mainly due to the fact that the wrongs are all you are shown and what is played on, and too much of the character in the right is explained from a sympathetic point from the beginning.Right, enough of this essay. It's a pretty good film, and I know people who really enjoyed it, but unfortunately I feel it failed to project that blurring of wrong and right, and the suspense you would have expected.

It is a very old-fashioned film which reminded me of the classics of US movies like The Grapes of Wrath and those Cagney films where he goes mad in solitary.

The cast performances are pretty average, J-Lo is easy on the eye, Ice Cube is his normal self & Eric Stoltz lies down for most of the film - easy money! In a film like this the star of the show should be the monster. For the most part it appears to be a giant rubber snake that terrorizes its hapless victims as they travel upriver. This is mixed with some average CGI FX. Initially it seems that the director is going for a more suspenseful Jaws type approach but its not long before he dumps this style for a more in your face series of snake attacks.

Considering it is a summer movie though the story is not so important, but what is important is the humor which does not make it past the word Dude!. The humor is redundant and the story is dull and boring. This is the type of movie that makes me despise Hollywood.

And it's not a pseudo-Oscar pc boredom film either.  It's a mishmash of styles and symbols, but it is entertaining.  What two guys wouldn't fight for Michelle Pfeiffer if given the chance?  That question is the basis of the film. Compound that notion with the fact that the two guys are best friends and you have that Hollywood staple that almost always entertains the love triangle.  The film Against All Odds couldn't pull it off, but Tequila Sunrise does.  Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell are both less over-the-top than they can be and that helps.  Pfeiffer is very winning and the supporting cast, which includes Raul Julia, Arliss Howard, J.T. Walsh, Arye Gross and Ann Magnuson is very good.  Probably a great date movie, since it appeals to women even more so than guys.
