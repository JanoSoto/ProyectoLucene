I think I could perhaps write an entire book on the meanings that I have interpreted from it. For the purposes of this posting I will try and condense it to a few of the main ideas and thems that are evident throughout.Blue Velvet lends itself to many psychoanalytic interpretations. It illustrates quite elegantly that people have a dark side, and beneath our innocence that most other people see, lie our subconscious perversions just waiting to be unleashed. The film assumes to an extent that we are all as human being voyeurs, to a certain degree.The first theme that I draw from Blue Velvet is that people are in constant battle between their 'id' and their 'superego', to speak in Freudian terms. The 'id' is ruled by the pleasure principle and its major purpose is immediate satisfaction of our needs. In theory, the 'id' is only present in infants and animals, but Blue Velvet clearly challenges this notion. Jeffrey Beaumont is a blatant representation of the 'id'. He can't avoid satisfying his curiosity and voyeuristic needs. He wants to know exactly what is going up in the apartment of Dorothy Vallens, and he'll stop at nothing until he knows what the town gossip is all about. The 'id' is challenged by the 'superego', which is in fact our conscience and based on norms, it maintains information about behavior that is considered to be bad. It is supposed to punish us for being bad with feelings of shame or guilt. Jeffrey feels little guilt about sneaking into the apartment. Sandy feels little guilt about assisting him.The second theme that is quite apparent in Blue Velvet is that people tend to have a dark part of the inner self. On the surface, the world looks very innocent. We see happy families together in the back yard, we see a couple walking happily along a path holding hands. We see local neighbours driving by waving at us. The reality is, despite what you see on the surface, you have no idea what these people are saying, thinking, or doing when they are not within your visual field. In the film there is a scene with Jeffrey and Sandy walking together along a sidewalk in the night. To someone passing by, they would likely think that they are just another couple going for a walk, and have no idea of their voyeuristic intentions. Essentially, they plan a scheme to sneak into Dorothy's apartment to watch her under what seem like everyday, normal conditions (walking together, sitting in the local diner).That people have an infantile or child-like view of the world is also another motif present within the film. To a great extent, this theme relates back to the two previous ones which I have mentioned. The curiosity that we constantly see on Jeffrey's face in many situations places him quite often in the concept of the 'id'. On the surface, he looks like a normal college kid, but deep down, he has this voyeuristic perversion that the film seems to suggest that we all have. Some of us just more readily display it than others. Adults are supposed to be able to suppress their desires for moral purposes, while children do not. In Blue Velvet, the adult characters do not suppress their subconscious desires and thus represent a child-like being in the world.I have only touched on a few of the ideas of Blue Velvet very briefly. The evil character of Frank is a whole other story, one that I will not delve into right now. It would take considerable time and space to do an accurate analysis of this man and what he represents.

In theory, the 'id' is only present in infants and animals, but Blue Velvet clearly challenges this notion. Jeffrey Beaumont is a blatant representation of the 'id'. He can't avoid satisfying his curiosity and voyeuristic needs. He wants to know exactly what is going up in the apartment of Dorothy Vallens, and he'll stop at nothing until he knows what the town gossip is all about. The 'id' is challenged by the 'superego', which is in fact our conscience and based on norms, it maintains information about behavior that is considered to be bad. It is supposed to punish us for being bad with feelings of shame or guilt. Jeffrey feels little guilt about sneaking into the apartment. Sandy feels little guilt about assisting him.The second theme that is quite apparent in Blue Velvet is that people tend to have a dark part of the inner self. On the surface, the world looks very innocent. We see happy families together in the back yard, we see a couple walking happily along a path holding hands. We see local neighbours driving by waving at us. The reality is, despite what you see on the surface, you have no idea what these people are saying, thinking, or doing when they are not within your visual field. In the film there is a scene with Jeffrey and Sandy walking together along a sidewalk in the night. To someone passing by, they would likely think that they are just another couple going for a walk, and have no idea of their voyeuristic intentions. Essentially, they plan a scheme to sneak into Dorothy's apartment to watch her under what seem like everyday, normal conditions (walking together, sitting in the local diner).That people have an infantile or child-like view of the world is also another motif present within the film. To a great extent, this theme relates back to the two previous ones which I have mentioned. The curiosity that we constantly see on Jeffrey's face in many situations places him quite often in the concept of the 'id'. On the surface, he looks like a normal college kid, but deep down, he has this voyeuristic perversion that the film seems to suggest that we all have. Some of us just more readily display it than others. Adults are supposed to be able to suppress their desires for moral purposes, while children do not. In Blue Velvet, the adult characters do not suppress their subconscious desires and thus represent a child-like being in the world.I have only touched on a few of the ideas of Blue Velvet very briefly. The evil character of Frank is a whole other story, one that I will not delve into right now. It would take considerable time and space to do an accurate analysis of this man and what he represents.

I think I could perhaps write an entire book on the meanings that I have interpreted from it. For the purposes of this posting I will try and condense it to a few of the main ideas and thems that are evident throughout.Blue Velvet lends itself to many psychoanalytic interpretations. It illustrates quite elegantly that people have a dark side, and beneath our innocence that most other people see, lie our subconscious perversions just waiting to be unleashed.

It's neither genuinely funny nor entertaining, unless babies left unsupervised to run amock with digitally-altered potty-mouths is your kind of entertainment.The story plots good against evil, but even the standard Disney-type formula outclasses this witless flick by light years. This is a bad movie.Baby Geniuses is about 18-month-olds, played actually by three- or fouryear-olds, and voiced-over by six- or eight-year-olds. It might have been a much better movie simply if adult actors had voiced the baby characters, either in adult voices, or adults doing children's voices, ala The Rugrats. The young voice `actors' are a terrible choice, given that the voices-which emerge from bizarre, special-effects mouths- have to deliver the dialogue that awkward toddlers can't possibly otherwise emote.In a real movie, focusing the camera on the reactions of the supporting actors in a scene might propel the story as well as well as the actor who's speaking. Baby Geniuses attempts to pass off this technique, as the majority of the talking-baby scenes show the back of the talking toddlers' heads. But the other children in the scene who are supposed to be listening and reacting are looking around puzzled and distracted, just like real toddlers do.The real reason we see the backs of so many talking heads undoubtedly was to save the effort of having to create the digital mouth movements for those lines. Unfortunately, the shortcut is painfully obvious.Some of the movie sets, especially the indooor theme park created by the villains, (played by Kathleen Turner and Christopher Lloyd) to prove their superior `Kinder' child-rearing method, look high-budget indeed.But despite slick sets, the movie was technically awful too. I noticed the same extra (an easy-to-spot, attractive blonde woman wearing the same outfit with purse on her right shoulder) walk through scenes in the same shopping mall again and again, even though the scenes span two separate days!The acting of the `adults' was just as atrocious, especially the dim but psychic father played by TV's Ally McBeel co-star Peter MacNicol, speaking via mobile phone to a brainwashed employee who had kidnapped the children of their family-owned day care facility, instead of being outraged or even alarmed, he courteously sets the phone down in dumb silence.Unless you or I were drugged up to obliterate the talking baby voices in our heads, we could have ad-libbed something for better effect in that scene, which was just one of many bad ones for MacNicol. This kind of bad acting reminded me of a twenty-some year-old B movie called H.O.T.S., where the lame plot and worse acting at least more honestly served up that movie's real purpose, which was campy T&A. This movie doesn't have as good an excuse.But let's get real this movie wasn't made to please critics, it was made to appeal to the 10 year-old and under movie-going crowd. And to be fair, the eight year-old boy we saw the movie with walked out of the theater saying it was as good as A Bug's Life, and his high bar for kids movies, The Rugrats Movie.But any conscientious parent should be offended by the several scenes of adult humor in Baby Geniuses. In one scene the baby hero needs a new disguise, and he instructs a baby girl in her stroller to take her clothes off. She says something like `Couldn't you at least buy me dinner first,' and the scene plays out to where he's wearing her clothes, she's smoking the cigar from his previous disguise, and she pleads `Please call me. I'm listed.' Is this kids' humor?Bad movie stats start to pile up Christopher Lloyd's character hardly shows up as the mastermind Kinder. More time must have been spent on his unusual hair and makeup than he is on screen. Any washed-up character actor would have been more right for the part of Kinder as played to Turner's empty villainness.And what's going on with Lloyd's carreer when his considerable talent (think Taxi, Back to the Future, even his manic My Favorite Martian) is wasted on those omnipresent 10-10-fillintheblank long distance telephone commercials, and now this movie.Finally, the movie includes an inexplicable salute to country singer Randy Travis, who sticks out like a sore thumb (or perhaps steals the scene, I'm not sure which) in a cameo appearance, and then reappears at the end of an already too-long movie (almost two hours for cripe's sake) to sing a sweet song about kids, over insufferable slow-motion clips of the movie we just saw, which isn't even over yet. You could almost hear the collective gasp of frustration in the theater as this weird music video unmercifullly delayed the ending credits.Save your money, rent an old Star Wars movie, or better yet, stay home and have game night, and wait for Star Wars Episode One to come out this Spring.

But there I was, in the theater in August of 1986, watching what has now become a cult classic.  Sure critics have ripped Transformers the Movie, but it wasn't made for them; it was made for the numerous kids who were saving their allowance money to buy the toys and getting up early Saturday morning to see the most original toy concept ever created.  For those kids, the movie pleases, and even today those grown-up kids enjoy the movie for it's animation and no-holds-barred action.For starters, Transformers die!  To kill major characters was utterly terrible, but inevitable. Those characters had run their course.  The deaths but established a history, a mythos never before mentioned in the cartoon. Transformers were always cool because of their humanity; in the movie it is revealed that they have spirit as well through the Matrix.The movie moves at an incredible pace. The battle scenes were totally awesome, and the score accents the action. Was Devastator ever as destructive, Megatron ever so cunning and ruthless, Optimus Prime ever so valiant?  The (sexual?) tension between Hot Rod and Arcee was interesting, considering there were never any female Transformers, save for one episode of the cartoon, and seeing Spike all grown up and still buddies with Bumblebee was a treat for long-time fans.  The introduction of Galvatron and his forces was great, and he serves as a persistent and powerful antagonist through the film.  The movie did a great job at characterization, and gave life to our favorite robots as never before.The only problem that I have with the movie is the way it lags after what is now know as The Great War.  In the beginning, Ultra Magnus appears to be a force to be reckoned with, a warrior towering over his troops, yet he ends up being a grouch throughout the rest of the film.  Grimlock and the Dinobots were reduced to status of insolent, mindless, robotic oafs, a role unbecoming of them considering how powerful they are.In all it was a pretty darn good piece of animation, and I'm sure that there will be plenty more late nights where my friends and I kick back and reminisce over one of the most exciting phenomenons the toy industry will ever experience.

Dangerous Liaisons is one of my top 3 movies of all time, and so I hoped that a remake would be a refreshing interpretation of the original.  Not so.This movie left such a poor taste in my mouth, then when I got home I re-watched Dangerous Liaisons for the umpteenth time.  And I felt much less dirty afterwards.Cruel Intentions is the next in a string of remakes of classic novels for teens, such as Romeo and Juliet, and Clueless, but it falls short because, while the main characters of the novels they were based are teens, Valmont and Merteuil were not teens in Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and furthermore were not meant to be.  There is just no way to suspend disbelief, and to accept that these high schoolers have the knowledge and experience that they do.  This is the movie's fatal flaw.Moreover the acting is just pathetic.  Phillippe seems to be doing a (poor) Malkovich impression throughout the entire movie, attempting to remain aloof, while Blair performance as the seemingly near-retarded Cecile is something I would expect to see on Saturday Night Live.  Gellar isn't so bad, except that all she seems to do is sneer sadistically at the camera.  I enjoyed Witherspoon's performance until the end, when she does a 180 degree turn for no real reason.The script needed a lot more revision as well. There was no reason for Valmont and Hargrove to fall in love, no real development there, just proof, it happened.  The dialogue seems overly rife with profanity for the sake of using profanity. Another problem is that CI too closely parallels Dangerous Liaisons.  There was nothing new in it, each scene was a parallel of a (much, much better) scene in DL.  That, to me, is unforgivable.  These kids just aren't the artists that Malkovich and Close are.  Period.If you liked this movie and you haven't seen Dangerous Liaisons, please, I beg you, go see it.  See the difference between a film and a movie.  See what real acting is.  Then compare the two.In summary, Cruel Intentions was aptly named.  It intended to imitate Dangerous Liaisons, and was cruel to anyone who was watching it. ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 1999","score":"","review":"  I went into this movie with high hopes.
