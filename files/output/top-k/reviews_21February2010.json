The idea that you need to illegally transport beer across state lines has no relevance today & generally speaking the film is of it's time with old fashioned cars, silly stunts & a certain childishness about it. To my eye not that much really happens, it felt like scene after scene of cars just driving along with the occasional stunt thrown in which are far from spectacular. The character's are simple & the whole thing is rather predictable & plays out trying to appeal to the crows as the likable rogue of a hero the Bandit keeps getting the better of the silly police who always end up looking dumb while there's the expected romantic angle & the whole thing between the Bandit & Justice seems to be down to a personal grudge rather than the bootlegging which the police never find out. At 90 odd minutes it felt quite long too, I just thought not that much happened really & the whole stupid police against flawless hero angle was predictable & tired. The other thing that stands out is just how unfunny it is, there's plenty of supposed comedy here but I found it really dumb & it just missed the mark by a long way, the comedic antics of Sheriff Justice & his son in particular were very tiresome by the time the end credits ran.Apparently Smokey and the Bandit made a star out of the Pontiac Trans-Am & sales of the car almost doubled within a couple of years after it's release. The biggest disappointment with Smokey and the Bandit were the decidedly average action set-pieces, there's the bridge jump, a few crashing police cars & the big truck at the smashes a couple too but not much else apart from scenes of cars screeching down various roads. I just expected a little bit more & something a bit more memorable. Apparently the recent releases with a 5.1 soundtrack replace all the original sound effects which I would imagine will infuriate the purists out there while the TV versions were dubbed to replace the bad language (not so bad these days though) & is apparently pretty funny as the dubbing is very poor.Filmed largely in Georgia the film looks alright, it's bright & well shot I suppose.

But I only had the chance to see this piece of art yesterday, and haven't quite stopped thinking about it yet. It's one of those movies you'll hardly forget.Although it doesn't have a great plot or memorable lines, it caught my attention right from the amazing opening credits' shots. A contrast between quietness and movement. The main theme transmits some kind of anxiety, mixed with the feeling of inevitable fate. And that's the best about this movie - the photography and sound, rather than the plot itself.The story is divided in three parts, metaphorically titled after three of the four Seasons. It picks us up and drops us inside a world of drug abuse and addiction, firstly showing whatever profit it might give (Summer), only to enlarge the fall (Fall, actually) it causes. Finally it ends up in a Winter, which is, itself, the requiem for a Spring dream that never comes. But as I said before, the plot wasn't the greatest thing about this movie, to me. The way they transport you inside the characters' feelings is almost surreal. Every time a character consumes drugs, it's shown in a figurative, somewhat disturbing, way, with a great image\/sound conjunction. It's almost like a preparation for what's to come, as they were testing your capacity to perceive it. It reaches it's peak quite close to the end, in the most intense scenes I've ever experienced. The way they represented a bad trip after severe pill abuse, almost made me feel like I was the one having the bad trip (although I never had such an experience, I can't compare it to anything else). It actually made me want to make it stop and shut my eyes and ears, with the perception that it wouldn't ever stop. The final unfolding, which lasts for about 4 (very long) minutes, is a never-ending stream of sensations, feelings, disturbing images and pitch sounds and music. When this stream finally ends, it's like a breath of fresh air that only lasts for a minute, until we're brought back into the cruel reality in which the plot culminated. The final requiem for each character's dream.Overall, I cannot say it's a beautiful or even entertaining movie, in its common meaning. It's more like an incredible sensorial experience through the meanders of drug abuse and it's consequences. Does it have a message? Definitely, although not an optimistic one. Does it really matter, in this context? I don't think so. Though, I'm sure I won't forget it soon.

Therefore it hovers down at a kid's level. Good family movies go above a kid's level so that the younger viewer may actually learn something, and the older viewer might possibly say Hmmm, this is an intelligent kid's movie. Watching this kids learn how to cheat, show off, scream like an escaped retard, and be poor sports. Yeah it's a comedy, so the rules may be broken, but that doesn't account for the terrible acting and asinine writing. I have enjoyed several kid's movies, so the excuse that you didn't like it because you're an adult and this movie is made for kids doesn't hold any water and therefore is eliminated as a legitimate reason. This movie is insulting to viewers with a functioning brain and an IQ over 50.There are a lot of cameo appearances by some good actors in this in a failed attempt to legitimize the film. Even John Candy can't save it, and he hams it up as the home announcer with incredible mediocrity.The worst performance in this mess is Daniel Stern's character, who overacts with such a vengeance (even worse than in Home Alone) that he makes Will Ferrell seem like a shy introvert. Screaming out some of the most unfunny lines in cinematic history, Stern brings the film down several notches. For those of you who actually liked Stern's character in this - you are a supreme bunch of ignorant idiots. Small wonder that he hasn't been called on to direct anything else after this garbage.If you want to see a good baseball movie then try Major League, Bad News Bears (the original - NOT the stupid remake), Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own, or Bull Durham if you haven't already seen them. Rookie of the Year gets a 1 out of 10 from me. Without Stern I'd probably have given it a 4.

Therefore it hovers down at a kid's level. Good family movies go above a kid's level so that the younger viewer may actually learn something, and the older viewer might possibly say Hmmm, this is an intelligent kid's movie. Watching this kids learn how to cheat, show off, scream like an escaped retard, and be poor sports. Yeah it's a comedy, so the rules may be broken, but that doesn't account for the terrible acting and asinine writing. I have enjoyed several kid's movies, so the excuse that you didn't like it because you're an adult and this movie is made for kids doesn't hold any water and therefore is eliminated as a legitimate reason. This movie is insulting to viewers with a functioning brain and an IQ over 50.There are a lot of cameo appearances by some good actors in this in a failed attempt to legitimize the film. Even John Candy can't save it, and he hams it up as the home announcer with incredible mediocrity.The worst performance in this mess is Daniel Stern's character, who overacts with such a vengeance (even worse than in Home Alone) that he makes Will Ferrell seem like a shy introvert. Screaming out some of the most unfunny lines in cinematic history, Stern brings the film down several notches. For those of you who actually liked Stern's character in this - you are a supreme bunch of ignorant idiots.

I loved that he brought back Michael Keaton and Michael Gough, and the casting for the film's new villains were well-thought, but the film had a couple flaws that weakened the overall experience in my opinion. In the second adventure, it's Christmas-time in Gotham and the city has been plagued with sightings of a mysterious Pengiun-man from the sewers. The Penguin soon reveals himself to the citizens and, with support from local corrupt businessman Max Shreck, begins a bid for mayor of the city. Meanwhile, Shreck's meek secretary Selina Kyle adopts the persona of Catwoman when a near-death experience spurs her into action to change her life and bring down those who've made her miserable.Just as in the first film, the casting and production design are the greatest parts of the movie. Michael Keaton continues to prove he was a great choice for Bruce Wayne\/Batman, though it seems we don't get nearly as much of him in the film this time around. With two villains to explore (three, if you include Shreck), Bruce loses a good deal of screen time to developing the new characters. This is my primary complaint with all comic-based films that attempt to include multiple villains you spend so much time building up and introducing these new characters that it bogs down the story and it feels uneven. The primary focus of the film is the Penguin and his plot to become mayor (and an additional evil plan involving Gotham's children that he prepares for throughout the movie and watches it fall apart in less than a minute of screen time). Danny DeVito was absolutely perfect as the Penguin and he is what really makes this film enjoyable for me. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a hot Catwoman, but she ends up playing second fiddle to Penguin; still, she's given enough development in her scenes to make a tragic character who's torn between her two lifestyles. Corrupt CEO Max Shreck is played by Christopher Walken, and we all know that man can do no wrong.The film's weaknesses come in the form of the the execution of the story. While BATMAN managed to avoid it for the most part, BATMAN RETURNS jumps right in with a bit of camp I'd hoped we'd left in the past themed henchmen. Right from the start, we're exposed to Penguin's thugs...the Red Triangle Circus gang. So, to match Penguin's circus sideshow vibe, we have henchmen ranging from the organ grinder with the monkey to the ringmaster. It reeked of the corniness of the 1960's series and put a damper on the noir feeling evoked by the first film. There are also plot holes that I can't help but nitpick each time I watch the movie, such as how Penguin and his crew got ahold of such detailed plans for the Batmobile for their plan to blackmail the hero. And, since I'm on the topic of camp, I found it hard to suspend my belief for the Penguin's final plan (his army). Seriously...did the franchise need to resort to something so corny so soon?Despite it's descent into the camp of the 60s that paved the way for the Schumacher sequels to take it too far, I don't hate this film. I love the characters enough to forgive some plot issues and, while it isn't as strong as the first, it's still a great Batman film. I would've been interested to see where Burton would've wanted to take the series from here but I'm glad he got out before the series too a turn for the worse (BATMAN AND ROBIN, anyone?).

This is true, more or less, depending on when looking at either man's life (right now, for example, Coppola is fine just making wine with the occasional 'student' film like Tetro). But I would like to take the comparison a step further in the Tucker company and Coppola's film company, American Zoetrope.Looking at what happened to the two companies, at least in the scope of the story told in the movie (I can't say how true it is to real events, just how it's depicted here), there's glaring similarities, and things I am sure Coppola connected with. Both men had passion to take a dream of something- for Tucker it was a car line, for Coppola it was independent cinema and a means to break out of studio controls- and they went forward to achieve it, like outsiders but with skills and a drive to succeed. And, ultimately, both men didn't quite live up to the dream. It's somewhat ironic then that the only other guy to really get something out of American Zoetrope in its early years (not counting its peaks and valleys in the 80s), was George Lucas, who turns the tables on the usual dynamic of Coppola producing Lucas' early films to producing Coppola's own film this time around. It's a glossy and nostalgic look at dreams how they can go. At the least, Tucker and Coppola tried.And in the film on Tucker, Coppola and his crew, primarily in credit due to DP Vittorio Storaro, make what could be said like a filmic version of a Tucker Car. It's bright and fast and a little off-kilter and unusual. But we like riding in it, and it has an appeal that gives something just a little different, and it's also pretty to look at, too. This may be outside of Dick Tracy Storaro's most colorful color film, so to speak, with the bright primary colors and advertisement of 1940's Americana springing out in the screen. Now, this said, this is not exactly a 'rebel' picture like Coppola's early work. Instead it's in debt to the period in film as well, and the primary influence would probably be Capra. This I mean as a compliment - Tucker as a film is entertaining because of how endearing Tucker is, how Jeff Bridges plays him in this context (a guy with a pioneer-spirit, with a smile even when things look bleakest), and how the villains, corporate board members, a Senator, the Big Three come off.Coppola even has time to give us two really great scenes.

It's a strange scene, as Hughes is in the dark aircraft carrier at night with his Spruce Goose and, as played by a withdrawn Dean Stockwell, is a bit frightening as an innovator who, perhaps, got too much of what he wanted.

This is true, more or less, depending on when looking at either man's life (right now, for example, Coppola is fine just making wine with the occasional 'student' film like Tetro). But I would like to take the comparison a step further in the Tucker company and Coppola's film company, American Zoetrope.Looking at what happened to the two companies, at least in the scope of the story told in the movie (I can't say how true it is to real events, just how it's depicted here), there's glaring similarities, and things I am sure Coppola connected with. Both men had passion to take a dream of something- for Tucker it was a car line, for Coppola it was independent cinema and a means to break out of studio controls- and they went forward to achieve it, like outsiders but with skills and a drive to succeed. And, ultimately, both men didn't quite live up to the dream. It's somewhat ironic then that the only other guy to really get something out of American Zoetrope in its early years (not counting its peaks and valleys in the 80s), was George Lucas, who turns the tables on the usual dynamic of Coppola producing Lucas' early films to producing Coppola's own film this time around. It's a glossy and nostalgic look at dreams how they can go. At the least, Tucker and Coppola tried.And in the film on Tucker, Coppola and his crew, primarily in credit due to DP Vittorio Storaro, make what could be said like a filmic version of a Tucker Car. It's bright and fast and a little off-kilter and unusual. But we like riding in it, and it has an appeal that gives something just a little different, and it's also pretty to look at, too. This may be outside of Dick Tracy Storaro's most colorful color film, so to speak, with the bright primary colors and advertisement of 1940's Americana springing out in the screen. Now, this said, this is not exactly a 'rebel' picture like Coppola's early work. Instead it's in debt to the period in film as well, and the primary influence would probably be Capra.

The main one being that Gerry, the wife is unsatisfied with the money her husband, Tom, is brining home and feels that she is holding him back from reaching his full potential as a man. As Gerry goes to sneak out of the marriage her plan is to leave a note saying goodbye. She decides to pin it to the blanket and in the process pokes Tom in the rear. Gerry is a woman who knows that shes beautiful and plays off of that to get what she needs or wants from rich men along her journey. When she meets up with Mr.Hackensack this way of living increases to the extreme. You see, Mr.Hackensack is one of the richest men in the world. He makes a comment that Chivalry is dead when the who time she is using him for his money and he is seeking out a wife who knows who to knit and is good with children.This film is very well written with even better acting to help pronounce the romantic intensities that a married couple have.

This was a low budget film but went on to become the highest grossing non-English language film for a long time. shot on location on the Italian islands of Salina and Procida and wonderfully photographed by Franco Di Gialomo this is the story of an unemployed and unmarried man Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi) reaching middle age years and is offered a small job as a postman with only one customer, the exiled Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda (Phillipe Noiret) who is staying on the island. Mario and Pablo develop a warm friendship which leads a new confident Mario into writing poetry himself to woo local beauty, the barmaid Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta). Basically a two actor film with a great cast in Troisi, Noiret and Cucinotta with great support in small roles from Linda Moretti as Neruda's mistress Donna Rosa and Renato Scarpa as Mario's boss. Nice costume design by Gianna Giss and production design by Lorenzo Baraldi. A fictionalized account of a brief 1952 stay on the island of Capri by Neruda written by Radford, Troisi, Furio and Giacomo Scarpelli and Anna Pavigano from a story by Antonio Skármeta set in Argentina during Neruda's exile there. This is a touching story and very well rendered. It is visually artistic and dramatically poetic with touches of smart, light comedy. It is painful to watch knowing that it's star, Troisi, filmed this against doctor's orders and ultimately ended up dying of a heart attack immediately after the principal filming. You can see him sweating in almost every scene even when he is not riding his bicycle and none of the other actors are sweating. For his health the director should have shut down or slowed production or recast him. A lot of work went into this for a small film and it paid off on the screen and at the box office.

But the majority of the movie is just tedious set-up and scenes of Katie acting like an idiot as she uncovers what her hosts are really up to.Is she so desperate for a job that she'd go to a remote house out in the country with a complete stranger, just to shoot an audition tape? If you see your drivers license burning in a fireplace, would you not automatically question your hosts? The movie is filled with situations where Katie is forced to do something stupid in order to move the story along. I've seen this so many times in so many of these kinds of movies, but at least sometimes it's exciting. Not here.Like I said, things pick up in the last act.

This film features James LeGros as Mike and thank God that it does. I have nothing against A. Michael Baldwin and really loved him in the original. Still, LeGros brings a professional approach to the production that serves this film well. His strong A-list talent compensates for Reggie Bannister's hammy amateurism. Bannister is fine in small doses. He was fine in the original. But each Phantasm seems to give him yet more screen time. This is dangerous because Bannister is not really an actor he is simply a type. Fortunately, LeGros uses his considerable talent to keep Bannister in the moment and to prevent him from delivering every one of his lines as if it were a punch line. Too bad nobody could do this in Phantasm III, which through its undisciplined focus on Bannister's character becomes just one, long, awful, unfunny joke about unrequited horniness. Phantasm II, however, is still pretty good. -) ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a very solid sequel.

I'm sure that if I had seen it back in the 80's, I would even have rated it a bit higher. Like many fellow viewers on here already stated, the story indeed shows a lot of similarities to A Nightmare on Elmstreet, part 3. Jennifer Rubin looked beautiful as ever and gave a decent performance. Richard Lynch was perfectly creepy as the leader of the hippie-cult who comes back to haunt Jennifer's dreams. The killings among the mental patients were pretty gory and bloody. And the hippie-rock song over the opening-credits struck the right chord too (that rarely happens when you watch 80's movies these days). Even though the twist near the end was something I didn't see coming, I didn't like it that much. Still, this is a rather enjoyable and competently made late 80's horror movie.And here's a bit of trivia Cult actor Richard Lynch is known for his slightly disfigured facial features. These were the result of a horrible accident in the late 70's (I believe). Because of an LSD-trip gone bad, Mr. Lynch set himself on fire. Ironically, in Bad Dreams he plays a hippie-cult leader who sets himself, and his members... on fire. In the movie, however, he looks a little bit more 'burned up & crispy' then he does in real life. Great flamey effects, by the way ","genre":null},{"date":"21 February 2010","score":"","review":" As far as 80's horror movies go, this one is very decent.

On the one hand, we have Carrie, Misery and The Shining; all great horror films that have become classics of the genre. Even recent adaptations of the Mist and 1408 have gained positive responses from critics and fans alike by obtaining the right mood and feel that the author intended.On the other end of the spectrum, there is the terrible film that is The Lawnmower Man. In King's defense, the story bears pretty much no recognition to the original tale and is essentially an adaptation in name only. Nonetheless, when watching a movie with King's name on it, one should expect it to be better then that garbage.Somewhere in the middle we have films that have gained mixed responses. Pet Sematary, for example, has a 50% fresh rate on Rottentomatoes.com from 18 reviews, with reviews ranging from Fred Topel calling it a Great Stephen King movie, to Gerry Shamray calling it Another awful Stephen King adaptation.Children of the Corn is another film that could fit into this middle ground, as it has even less critical acceptance at 36% on Rottentomatoes from 22 reviews. Despite this, it was a financial success, earning $14 million off a $300,000 budget and spawning 6 sequels and a telemovie remake. Granted, the majority of these sequels were direct to DVD, but it still shows that there is a loyal audience that existed for this series and enjoyed the films, regardless of the overall critical opinion. And let's face it, the critic's consensus never meant that much to most horror fans anyway.The story concerns a village that has been overtaken by children. The leader of these kids is a young boy named Isaac who acts as a religious leader towards the other children in the town. The boy claims to be able to communicate with an unknown force referred to as He Who Walks Behind The Rows. When a young married couple enters into the town (played by Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) Isaac begins to dictate to the others how The Man Behind The Rows wants the couple to be dealt with.The acting isn't too bad, Linda Hamilton, being the most famous person here does her job relatively well, but Peter Horn I thought could do with being a bit less of a doofus. Then again, maybe that was how the character was written. John Franklin as Isaac does a pretty good job, with a creepy way of delivering his lines. Courtney Gains as Malachai, his second in command, was a bit more annoying. The way he spoke reminded me of Al Gore in South Park through his irritating whining.But acting isn't what this movie is about. The movie is meant to be creepy mindless entertainment, and it does a pretty good job. Then again, perhaps I'm just a man of simple pleasures. Dressing children up in adults clothing and getting them to speak all spooky-like is already going to do a somewhat decent job of entertaining me. Getting them to act violently towards each other and I'm totally there. The Children of the Corn is not the greatest Stephen King adaptation, but it doesn't need to be. It's a movie that you can put on late at night and just enjoy it for what it is.
