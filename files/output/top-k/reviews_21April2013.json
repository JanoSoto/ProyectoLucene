First, it ended the existence of United Artists as a legitimate studio (it survived only as an arm of Metro Goldwyn Mayer). Secondly, its failure also all but ended the existence of a once-proud film genre, the Western. And thirdly, the litany and avalanche of criticism, gossip, and talk of directorial excess on it virtually closed the shop down on tyro directors who could have their way with the studios and go to town on both budgets and schedules, at least for a good long time.It was Michael Cimino's HEAVEN'S GATE. It was his attempt to make a Western of the scope of past screen epics like GONE WITH THE WIND, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and BEN HUR. And it crashed badly, returning a miserable $1.3 million on a budget of close to $45 million when it opened (for one single weekend) in November 1980 (and re-released in April 1981 in a vastly shortened version, where it didn't do any better).But just how bad of a film is it, in actuality? Compared to other films of more recent times that have either cost much more and failed much worse at the box office, or films that have been hyped up beyond reason and in the end never really delivered, is this really the cataclysm a lot of people make it out to be? In my humble opinion, having seen this film on five different occasions just to convince myself, the answer is No.It has to be conceded that this film, a very loose recreation of the Johnson County range war that raged in the 1890s in Wyoming between European immigrants and ruthless cattle barons, is excessive even for a Western epic the sets are wildly over-sized; the Western towns look dangerously like big cities; numerous individual sequences seem to go on forever, well past reason. All of that I think any reasonable view of the film will reveal to be true. If Steven Spielberg's biggest sin in having made the equally maligned World War II comedy 1941 around the same time as this film was in not realizing until it was too late that slapstick comedy wasn't his forte, then Cimino's sin in making HEAVEN'S GATE the way he did was in not realizing that the Western wasn't really his thing. His visions of making a David Lean\/Cecil B. DeMille-type epic right out of the chute obscured the fact that such grandeur wasn't really what the Western genre was about, either historically or cinematically. He didn't have the experience of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway in this arena. He also unfortunately seemed to lack the ability to see the things that worked in more recent Western epics like director Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH, both towering masterpieces from 1969, and both of which had stories that developed into epics, rather than having been full-born as such from the start. In short, it's likely that Cimino couldn't see the forest for the trees&#x85;at least not through all the smoke and the dust that gets spread around in the film.And yet, somehow, there's a lot to like for any viewer with the patience to sit through the more than three and a half hours of film. The cast, which includes Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif, Joseph Cotten, and Isabelle Hupert, does very solid work, even if they were exposed to doing dozens and dozens of takes under Cimino's uber-perfectionistic direction. The cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, who had won an Oscar for his work on Spielberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND in 1977, is impressive enough, even if sometimes obscured by the aforementioned smoke and dust, especially in the final (and rather violent) battle sequence. The period score by David Mansfield (who has a cameo role) is also fairly impressive, sometimes echoing the score that Ennio Morricone composed for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; and in utilizing Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube, both in Mansfield's solo guitar version (near the end) and Leonard Bernstein's 1965 New York Philharmonic recording (in the Harvard prologue of the film), Cimino may be tipping his cap to Stanley Kubrick's cagey use of the Strauss waltz in 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. The end result may be extravagant to an obvious fault, but one can't fault Cimino for not trying hard enough; his problem, ironically, may have been in trying too much.The film's recent re-release in Cimino's first version (lasting just over three and a half hours) in New York theaters, and on DVD, has led its most ardent defenders to claim HEAVEN'S GATE as the masterpiece that nobody recognized back in 1980-81. I don't know that I'd quite call it a masterpiece, for the reasons I've stated. But even with its numerous attendant flaws, HEAVEN'S GATE is also nowhere near the catastrophe its detractors have made it out to be for decades, not by a long shot. It is a film that needs to be seen with an open mind and a patient one too, which a lot of people still seem exceptionally reluctant to do in this age of TITANIC, AVATAR, and other mega-budget opuses that make even the $45 million spent by Cimino on this one film seem exceptionally paltry now.

So a huge parade, waiting to be addressed by Hynkel, gets the barber's speech instead, and they all cheer the message of peace.This was only Chaplin's first talkie, and some of its best scenes owe much to silent technique, such as his dance with an inflatable globe, and other sequences that are almost mime with music.Work had started on this film in 1937, and Britain and America were both planning to boycott it, for the sake of their neutrality.

Now back to his native country believe this incredible film, which contains all the keys of his work taken to the limit. A perfect script that does not need and do not spare any sequence, magnificent staging, hiding and giving information when needed and a great accomplishment. Anyone who has seen the film can not forget two sequences, when the secretary finds the corpse of the former wife of Blaney to Off (the camera remains in the street) and the murder of the bride, the camera accompanies them to the door and then gradually decreases until the bustle of the street, making the audience think about the crime and giving naturalness and realism rarely achieved before.Hitchcock repeats the theme of false guilt. His usual neuroses (sex, madness and death) articulated in a narrative like never (bitterness, irony and disappointment). Best of Frenzy is the cruelty that draws the characters and their relationships selfish. And the scenes of the murderer in action, that freeze the blood, not in vain, Hitchcock teaches us that death is a frozen picture.It was unjustly despised at the time we certainly before the last great work of the master of suspense. After having declined in his last films before this, Hitchcock created his last great film, a film that is clearly the focus of his films, the story of the false guilt.In Frenzy we have a great film, and though soon know the identity of the murderer, the film does not suffer and got to identify with the poor protagonist, certainly a guy with a disastrous fate. The character of the choke is dazzling and imposing, and his chivalry contrasts perfectly with her dark side. The researcher is also a very well established, and it is in him and his wife in which the director gives the film its comic side.With all, that cocktail out an excellent film that deserves to be seen by every movie lover and surprise many by some nudity, so clearly unpublished so far in the films of Hitchcock.

Fast-forward to 1981 and an attractive woman named Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl) has just inherited the hotel and has come from New York to try to refurbish it. However, once she gets started a strange series of accidents begin to happen. One of the first to die is a man who is painting the outside of the hotel while working on a scaffold. Another supposed accident claims the life of a plumber who is working in the basement. Immediately afterward a mysterious blind woman named Emily (Cinzia Monreale) appears to Liza and things begin to get even more bizarre. At any rate, rather than spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film has to be watched from start to finish in order to understand it. I would also like to mention that this film has more than its share of gore which one would expect from something directed by Lucio Fulci. It also presents lots of zombies. However, while they certainly kill people they aren't the infectious, flesh-eating kind one might expect. In addition to that there are a couple of criticisms I would like to make. First, this film didn't flow smoothly from one scene to the next and had a fragmented feel to it. Likewise, the acting didn't seem to fit the scenarios sometimes and the dialogue seemed flat and almost robotic. But being a Euro-Horror film I suppose that might be expected to an extent. In any case, like I said before this film gets better the further it goes. Definitely worth a watch for those who enjoy a movie of this type.
