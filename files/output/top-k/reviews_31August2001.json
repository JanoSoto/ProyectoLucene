Inexplicably, though, it suddenly embraces that same sweet Disney formula as it draws to a close . . . becoming, in many ways, exactly like the films it professes to mock.  Shrek tries to straddle the line between savvy adult-based humor and sweet family-friendly humor, usually succeeding, but failing miserably in certain spots.  Apparently, the strategy of aiming the film towards both kids and adults worked -- if judging from box-office revenue is any indication, `Shrek' was wildly successful -- but the quality of the film is dropped a notch or two by the occasionally awkward blending of adult satire and child sensibilities.  Shrek is still a very, very good -- and very, very funny -- film, but it could've either been a classic adult satire or a classic kid's movie, if only the producers of Shrek had fully committed to pushing the film in one direction or the other, instead of just compromising to appeal to the masses.Shrek is the story of a lone ogre (aptly named, well, Shrek -- and voiced by Mike Myers) whose major goal in life is to live in solitude in his beloved swamp.  This goal is somewhat thwarted by the ruler of the kingdom, Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), a diminutive, evil tyrant who is forcing all the fairy tale characters in his kingdom to relocate to Shrek's swamp.  Shrek, unhappy with this relocation program, makes an offer to Farquaad -- he'll find Lord Farquaad a princess, which will allow Farquaad to get married and become a King.  All that Shrek wants in return is his swamp to be made like it was before --empty. Lord Farquaad accepts Shrek's offer -- so, along with his loquacious sidekick Donkey (voice by Eddie Murphy), Shrek begins a quest to find a true damsel in distress -- the lovely Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz).With the possible exception of the South Park movie, never has a film managed to so gleefully and successfully tear apart the Disney tradition of animated musicals as well as Shrek.  Scenes are set up in the traditional Disney manner, then shredded with such razor-sharp wit and flair; it's amazingly funny.  The humor ranges from over-the-top (Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode) to the wickedly subtle (the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled . . . she's not easy.)  Shrek veers wildly between loving reverence and sneering disdain for the traditions of Disney animated films -- the reverent scenes will most likely appeal more to kids, while adults will definitely appreciate those of disdain -- but regardless of the tone, the structure and the direction of Shrek is usually incredibly funny.  It doesn't hurt that the cast of voices adds immeasurably to the film, either Mike Myers plays the ogre Shrek with an oddly peculiar but funny amount of patience and practicality (I also suspect he only agreed to the part so he'd have another venue for his outrageous Scottish accent); John Lithgow is perfect as the pompous, overbearing Lord Farquaad; and Cameron Diaz manages to bring just the right amount of outrage and sweetness to Princess Fiona -- I found her to be the best character in the film.  Personally, I found Eddie Murphy (as Donkey) to be the most annoying character in the film -- true, he is very funny, and has some of the best lines, but he's a little too much to take at times.  The first third of the movie, he was brilliantly funny; the second third of the film, only mildly funny; and by the last third of the film, just irritating.  I don't fault Eddie Murphy at all for this, but I do fault directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson for not toning the character down.The main fault with `Shrek', though, lies in the fact that it tries to appeal to two distinct audiences.  It's not that such a feat can't be done (Disney's Aladdin, actually, does this flawlessly), but that Shrek juggles between the two audiences so poorly.  For example, one of the big messages being delivered to children by this film is that appearances don't matter, that people shouldn't be judged by how they look . . . and then a significant amount of time is spent ridiculing Lord Farquaad's small stature.  What gives?  When the two aspects of a film like this -- the child aspect and the adult aspect -- can exist simultaneously and separately, the results can be wonderful.  Aladdin is a prime example of this, as are nearly all of the Chuck Jones-directed Bugs Bunny cartoons of the early 1950s.  When the aspects start contradicting each other, though, it's confusing, and not very funny.  As it affects Shrek, the contradictions aren't enough to significantly drag the film down, but they are quite noticeable, and they do cause the film to stumble.  (And another thing . . . okay, a minor rant . . . please, enough with The Matrix parodies.  They're officially now like all those stupid I'm so scared Blair Witch parodies .. . not even remotely funny.  Stop beating the dead horse.) Regardless of the mixed messages, there's no denying that Shrek is a very clever, funny movie that will no doubt be entertaining for both children and adults.  There will be a few moments, though, when kids will be utterly puzzled by what's occurring in the film . . . and other moments that will have adults gagging from the nauseating sweetness.  Still, Shrek is very, very good, and in the end, maybe that's all that really matters.  It's certainly better than most standard Disney fare, and is still the best animated film of 2001 . . . not too shabby, huh?

It's definitely not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. --Robert BoydIf anything, Peter Berg's Very Bad Things triggers a response, regardless of the nature. My initial reaction to the dark, disturbing parody was bleak and unpleasant. The movie displays sick, demented behavior and despicable, annoying characters. It's not humanly possible to like anyone in the movie. Christian Slater's character is cruel and selfish. Cameron Diaz displays a whiny, obsessive portrayal. I needed an aspirin during this unfunny mess.I viewed the film a second time; surprisingly, my opinion differed greatly. I liked all the same parts, but this time, my attitude changed. I watched with more of an open mind-the film is advertised as a dark comedy, but-although a few explosively funny moments occur-the film seldom provokes laughs. It's important to watch abstractly, with no remorse or guilt for enjoying the unholy revelation of events. Everything that happens here makes perfect sense under the circumstances. If you don't expect a light hearted, laugh a minute comedy, then Very Bad Things fulfills a long-needed niche in Hollywood.Very Bad Things is, like the tagline notes, a very savage comedy. It does not paint a happy portrait of our society-it's a scathing satire on American values. It's needlessly racist, sexist, and vulgar. It depicts a gross portrayal of modern families, the delicate but perverse male mindset, disgusting bachelor parties, and even the happiest day of many lives-the wedding day.Cameron Diaz plays Laura Garrety, a selfish, whiny bride-to-be. She's getting married in three days to a handsome fellow named Kyle Fisher (Jon Faveau from Swingers). She isn't happy with his decision to travel to Vegas with his friends for a bachelor party. They include two bickering brothers, Adam (Daniel Stern), and Michael (Jeremy Piven, who stepped into the role after Adam Sandler stepped out to make The Waterboy.), as well as an organized but cruel real estate agent named Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), and a quiet mechanic named Charles Moore (Leland Orser).Once they arrive in Vegas, a stylistic montage sequence shows the five friends gambling, snorting cocaine, and drinking lots of alcohol. They settle in for the night at a fancy hotel, where a stripper (Carla Scott) arrives and lap dances the guys into a frenzy. Michael takes her into the bathroom for sex, but accidentally drives the stripper's head into a towel hook, instantly killing her. The rest of the men panic and want to call for help, but Boyd has a better idea. He wants to bury the body in the nearby desert. The intrusion of a hotel security guard complicates the issue. Boyd kills him with a corkscrew during a particularly unpleasant scene. The rest decide to use a chain saw to cut up the bodies and carry them to the desert in suitcases, where they do indeed put the unfortunate souls underground.Although not for the easily offended, Very Bad Things takes us on a roller coaster ride through immorality and its consequences. It's fun watching the sequences of events, the bodies piling up, and the exaggeration of our most improper impulses.  A great cast demonstrates their fine acting abilities. The script, also by Peter Berg, features very smart, witty dialogue. Berg directs the chaos with an engaging style-especially during the scenes in Vegas, and keeps the momentum throughout the movie. If the filmmakers played the material as straight drama, it might have worked even better, but as it is, Very Bad Things is a joy ride through harsh satire.

The script, also by Peter Berg, features very smart, witty dialogue. Berg directs the chaos with an engaging style-especially during the scenes in Vegas, and keeps the momentum throughout the movie. If the filmmakers played the material as straight drama, it might have worked even better, but as it is, Very Bad Things is a joy ride through harsh satire.

It is a good story, with good acting and very little special effects. Other commenters on this being sa truly scary movie are correct. Those who are critical about it have probably seen too many Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street blood, guts and nudity flicks to know the difference between truly horror and scary things as opposed to shock for shock values sake. This low budget, by Hollywood standards movie, proves you don't need CGI and gross blood and guts to tell a very good story.Subtlety like a door opening by itself, a strange noise and voice coming from nowhere can achieve the same results.

And they adapted it to issue an ending halfway between the book and the Schaffner film.(spoiler ahead) Halfway is never the right way (sat half-buttocks between two chairs as we say in French) and the Burton ending looks more like a quick way for him to get to an end with such a painful script.

All I could remember about the book was that it was a good adventure story, but speed-reading through it did not help me in the way of comprehending it. Then I realized there was a movie too, and further figured why not, and then picked it up at the video store. I watched it, and to my surprise, it WAS a good adventure story! I had actually understood what I read in a book!The story is centered around a dying Indian tribe, the Mohicans. There are only two left, the chief, Chingachgook (Russell Means), and his son, Uncas (Eric Shweig). They have taken under their wing a White man, Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), found abandoned in the forest. Hawkeye is raised as one of their own, and might as well be called a Mohican save for the fact that he was not born one. The Last of the Mohicans are caught in the middle of a war between the French and the British for control of New France, or British North America, respectively. A powerful British colonel asks that his daughters and one of his troops be put under the watchful eye of Magua (Wes Studi), a forest-savvy member of the Huron people. Little do they know that Magua has already conspired with the French general, Marquis de Montcalm. Magua turns on the colonel in favor of the French and attempts to take the daughters hostage as revenge on the British for killing his own family.The Mohicans, meanwhile, are bitter rivals to the Huron, and are forced to choose sides in this colonial war by rescuing the British girls. Both girls, Alice (Jodhi May) and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), fall in love with Uncas and Hawkeye, respectively. They set off through the forest, doing all they can to avoid Magua and the Huron so that they may bring the girls back to their father at Fort William Henry. Their problem is that the Huron act on revenge, and at their own expense, not for the French. This makes their desire to take the girls even greater, now that they are under the watchful eye of their rivals. A minimally-spoken adventure-drama, The Last of the Mohicans is a gorgeous film to watch and listen to. The cinematography depicting the early colonies is simply marvelous to look at, and gives the film a sense of grandeur in its visual style. Then there's a beautiful musical score by veteran composers Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, not doing much to help the story or the events but still a pleasure to hear just the same.The actors also deserve some mention, particularly Daniel Day-Lewis, who proves that he is an excellent actor by several other standards then just his voice. This film uses its visuals and actions to tell a story, and is very underwritten to evoke that. It is an excellent move by superb director Michael Mann, who certainly knows how to stage a production on a grand scale with the smallest amount of dialogue possible. However, this may not appeal to some who are accustomed to hearing actors truly acting, by which I mean saying lines and displaying emotion that way. In summary, this film is a violent, emotional, spectacular adventure that will certainly find its place in the hearts of those who crave period pieces, romance, and action. It delivers well on all counts. I give this film 3 stars on a five star scale.

If this is the nouveau style of French film-making, give me yet another blockbuster instead. It simply can't be worse than this. And it really hurts to see that the rating here is 8.2 (19 votes), when I started to write this, and that this film won a couple of awards in Cannes. Not that Cannes can be taken seriously anymore, but still...The film is about a piano teacher (don't confuse this film with THE PIANO However!), who doesn't want any of her students to surpass her, who gets involved with a brilliant new student in a perverse sexual relationship, and who is dominated by her insane mother (who, in the end, doesn't seem so insane anymore, after all that we saw before). Read the previous line again, save yourself the money, and send it to me instead if you really want to throw it away. Haneke's FUNNY GAMES was a masterpiece, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 90's. This films is one of the worst. They're both about sick minds, but whereas FUNNY GAMES was shocking and definitely had substance, this film is just boring and shallow. It's about sex, sexual perversion, people who aren't able to express their feelings, ... did I say that it was about sick people? Anyway, unlike BAISE-MOI, ROMANCE and INTIMACY, there is almost no nudity or pornography shown in this film. Just a video that the teacher is watching. Apparently, Haneke didn't have the guts to go all the way. Instead, he bores us to death with long close-ups and sick thoughts, and again, and again... Even the beautiful classical music used plentiful in this film, doesn't seem so beautiful after all here. A real accomplishment!Wanna see a film about sick minds? Rent FUNNY GAMES. A film where sex and nudity are being used to enhance the story? Watch INTIMACY. But please, don't watch this, you'll be very sorry.
