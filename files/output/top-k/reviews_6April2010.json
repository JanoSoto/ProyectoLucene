However...it still fails to deliver. I wonder why? First, this film is a very difficult watch. It is a tangle of under-developed plots and situations...and it assumes the viewer has already read the book...a grave fault. The film was made ten or twenty years too late...the plots characters and situations have all been visited before...and in better form in other films. To have a film like this boil down to a matter of who gets the gold and who gets the girl is nearly an automatic cheap shot at the intelligence of the intended viewing audience. People walked out because there was nothing to see that they had not seen before, and there was no incentive to make them stay. Perhaps the main grave flaw of this film is Travolta himself. His imprimateur is all over the film, from production to acting. But, to my view, one of the most fatal flaws of the film is the awful acting of Travolta. I am a Travolta fan, but Travolta simply failed to demonstrate that he had the depth of feeling... the broad spectrum of acting that was needed to pull off his character simply was not present, and support from the cast could not lift him to where he needed to go. He needed to be more oily, more villainous, more focused and more concentrated. I saw none of this in the film. His pitch--tone and timbre--simply did not match up to what was needed in this role, and I suspect his heart was not fully into playing this character. Travolta thought he was a bit old too play the protagonist...I dis-agree. Reversing the roles for Travolta--from villain to hero--could have made all the difference in the world as per the outcome of this very sad sci-fi romp. My suggestions might have done little to save the film...but there were some things he could have done to keep the film from being so bad that even the dogs in the pet shelters wound up panning it. I did not see much that would be suggestive of Scientology to my eyes...they seemed to be playing it by the book...trying to deliver sci-fi entertainment, not so much message speak. Though the film was a hard watch for me, it did have--as said before--good production values...but it falls short in continuity, in flow, in ideas...and, most tragically ...in acting. I can recommend this only to those who are sturdy of heart and who can manage to sit through this dreadnought. There are worse films, but though this film was really bad, it does not fully qualify for the worst film designation...however it does deserve the bad ink it got. Travolta could have done a better job. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 April 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" OK ! It sucks.
