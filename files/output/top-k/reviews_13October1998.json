But when the episode of Northern Exposure aired where the famous Russian comes to town and performs in the local bar while the female store owner swoons, I nearly laughed myself off the couch.  There was an identical scene in Local Hero. Local Hero captured a certain magic and mystery; haunting and poetic while remaining lighthearted and warming.  One could not blame the creators of Northern Exposure for wanting to capture that same magic, but they could have been just a little more original.  I love Bill Forsythe's movies.

And if it is, then I'm bloody glad I wasn't 18 in 1944...The most moving part of the film for me was when the troop attacked some kind of radar installation, on the way to finding Private Ryan. After the attack one chap lies there with bullet holes in his chest, whilst his mates try and help him. Slowly he starts slipping away, and cries out for his mother, and his home. It's a scene that's still with me, weeks after seeing the movie. Another splendid side of the film for me was that there wasn't a clean cut, gung - ho, invincible hero to be seen...just normal, ordinary, and very scared men.Any flaws? Well, for me personally, the very end was a little too sentimental, but that's the directors trade mark, I suppose.
