[{"date":"26 March 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Saw this movie back in 1999. Still as chilling as it was back then, even more so some 13 years after 9-11. Jeff Bridges plays Michael Faraday, a college history professor who's wife, an FBI agent, died in a Waco\/Ruby Ridge-style raid gone wrong a few years back. Michael finds a new girlfriend and raises his son in a nice bedroom community outside of Washington, DC. Things are going well for Michael until his new neighbors move in across the street. Oliver and Cheryl Lang, played by Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, respectfully, seem like the perfect neighbors until Michael starts to notice strange and even dangerous happenings going on. After launching his own little investigation, he suspects his new neighbors are really domestic terrorists and tries to enlist the help of his FBI connection. However,everyone, including his girlfriend, thinks it's all in his head, and that maybe he's trying to carry on his dead wife's work in her name. Things soon barrel out of control and we end up with one of the best plot twists in cinema history. I give it eight stars. The reason it doesn't get more is the plot is a bit over the top and some of the incidents that unfold are based too much on chance with the probability of them falling in line in real life, unlikely. With that in mind, viewers must keep in mind that it's a Hollywood production, and if things didn't unfold so precisely the way they do, then Arlington Road would be one boring movie. Also of note is the striking news scenes in the movie that seem so much like the real news footage we saw on 9- 11. It makes the film seem that much more real, and eerie, considering it was released some 2 years earlier to the day that changed the world. On a lighter note, you're not gonna be wowed by great special effects or cinematography here, but you really don't need it because this thriller is driven by a great script and a veteran cast. I highly recommend it! ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Saw this movie back in 1999.

Bauer this time, makes the mistake of falling in love, on the account of a diary he steals, among many other possessions of this rich couple. When reading it, he becomes aware of the woman's pent up fantasies if she were another character, loose and daring. Trapped in a marriage, with a successful yet egotistical writer of children's books, we can tell deep down, she yearns for more. Obviously this marriage isn't perfect, where entire fault lies on the husband's ignorance, that finally drives this woman to accept the sexual advances of Bauer, posing as an interested client of her decorating business, where soon he's making his fantasies a reality, without laying it on too thick of course, so she doesn't put two and two.... This of course brings jealously from husband (the versatile Getz) where eventually things go out of control, which has Bauer slugging him. And honestly Getz deserves it. Even Getz's friend (George Wendt) explains his problem of narcissism, to which really his point falls on death ears. Actor Bauer is something of a surprise. He brings a magnetism and mystic character to this sexy stranger who sends the love boat of this married couple rocking. With it's highly original premise which set a lot of other films apart, Thief Of Hearts can't overcome a slight if enigmatic dullness about it. Not exactly a money spinner, there are some sexy moments and some cool scenes, like the slick robbery pulled off at the Davis house, in it's opening. Speaking of openings, it's opening song I loved, more than it's title song, the opening night shot of the Golden Gate bridge in what looks like heavy fog breaking, I must say is one of the best bits. We also see younger hottie Windsor, a street hustler, earning some bucks, candidly f..king Bauer, who declines, his mind preoccupied with another woman. A few scenes later, he passes again on another offer, this time two college girls, making some extra lucre. We also see a beaver shot of Windsor, slipping into a pair of jeans, before she's over compensated for her troubles. What happened to her after Howling 4? This dull, yet intriguing movie, that entices you with it's story, is also slightly 9 and a half week'ish, it's ending I thought was cool when first seeing the movie at fifteen. Although I mentioned a dullness about it, it's just the way I saw it, in no way, it's story rushed. Not to say, this doesn't without recommendation, though for some impatient viewers, it might have them a little vexed in the two's slow building relationship of this movie, some scenes almost ceasing to exist.

And while Spider-baby is some kind of pop-art exploitation psycho grind-house milestone, this is the film that annoyed me so much that I wanted to grouse about it on IMDb. (This may tell readers more about me than I'd like to admit).I've seen movies by Elmer that I've thought were enjoyable and well done, so I had hopes for Detour. And there are some nice touches here and there. The creative team behind this movie made the absolute most of their budget in terms of scenery, music, cinematography, sound design, art direction etc.But my gripe with Detour is that the hero is such an idiot that it's hard to identify with him. I found myself yelling at Tom Neal's shabby little guy seemingly every 30 seconds Idiot! Why are you hitchhiking across the county to rejoin your girlfriend? Just work a couple more weeks, and then just ride a bus to Hollywood, instead of taking weeks and months to hitchhike there! Moron! Even back then, the police could do autopsies to discover the actual cause of death of your driver friend. 10 seconds in an morgue would absolve you of any wrong-doing....WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???? Dope! You can dump Vera anywhere along the highway on the way to California...just throw her out of the car and drive off without her, and assuming she ever actually makes it to California,who is ever going to believe her story when she has no proof other than hearsay? Just deny everything and you are golden! Of course, it's entirely possible that Ulmer and the screenplay writer WANTED me to feel this way. Certainly Tom Neal plays the character as a weak willed schlub who deserves the audience's contempt and ridicule.(I am reasonably sure these were acting choices, not simple limitations).Wow...it's been three weeks since I've seen Detour and I'm still arguing with the screenplay in the back of my head.
