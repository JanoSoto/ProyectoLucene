ED-209 and Robocop looked and sounded cool, eye (and ear) candy.  But this did not assure success. Murphy the man, finding his humanity even after being sentenced to the iron suit, made the audience care about him, and gave Robocop a loyal fan base.  That was what made Robocop more than your average sci-fi shoot-em up. Robocop 2 was received with less enthusiasm, but most Robocop fans and the general movie going public liked it.  It was violent and dark, like the first, and the effects while somewhat dated today were unbelievable then. Then came Robocop 3.  First Orion rushed the film into production before Robocop 2 was out of the theaters, then was forced to delay the release by two years after being bought out by MGM. When it was released in 1993, Robocop 3 was a spectacular disappointment. The dark violence from the first two films was dropped in favor of a more kid friendly version, infuriating fans.  But worse, Robocop was no longer Robocop, police officer, he was Robocop Super Hero. The idea of giving Robocop a gun arm is an obvious toy marketing ploy, as was the ridiculous jet pack.  The goal of these things was to make Robocop a super hero, but when you do that you lose Murphy the man, the most important element to the movie.  Trying to make Robocop into a whole new character but make up for it by having him sympathize with a little annoying kid, have overdone memories, experience sexual attraction (?!?), and make him highly talkative (Robocop is the strong silent type, but in Robocop 3 he says things like `I am fine, thank you.' and, `I don't have many... friends.') was the final straw.  Robocop fans were stabbed in the back, and Orion forced a real piece of kiddy friendly trash on us. Robocop also started destroying OCP police equipment, for no reason.  He destroyed the police car, something Robocop from the first two movies would never do. His partner (Nancy Allen) hardly gives her best performance, and at what should have been her best, most moving scene, was just overdone and stupid. The show made all the same mistakes, and I hope the new Robocop Prime Directives will make up for this.

I didn't find it hard to fathom.  Events like these happen to people all the time.What many reviewers have not discussed much is how 'Selma', played by Bjork, has so many obstacles in her life.  Selma didn't ask for these, but has to deal with them nonetheless.  She is handicapped, is in a male-dominated culture, and is an immigrant from a Communist (1964 Czech.) country.  Selma is poor, a daydreamer, maddeningly principled just when she should not be, and has a dependent - a son.  Yet I didn't find her situation removed from reality.  The working poor of the world have a very tough life.  Gary Oldman's Nil By Mouth is a valid comparison for lifestyles.In this film, we see how the American system treats a poor, defenseless woman - horribly, mercilessly, unthinkingly.  Among its other messages, it spoke to me as an indictment of capitalism and American culture.  It illuminates in a cold light some deadly characteristics of American society the crushing poverty many live in, the narrow-mindedness of many people, the lack of concern of companies for their workers, the government's neglect of the handicapped, an ignorance and distrust of foreigners, sexism, materialism, religious fundamentalism, and a morbid obsession with violence.

Director von Trier shows how these societal flaws twist and wreck ordinary people.I liked the musical numbers, as they provided a welcome contrast to the relentlessly gloomy reality of Selma's situation.

It's not a story about addiction It's an experience of addiction.I noticed several times that I was sitting with my jaw hanging open as I followed the story from summer to winter.  The characters' lives are so screwed up that spring is not possible. The bathos of finding a future satisfying for the younger characters is unimaginable.I loved the film even though it was the most disturbing film I have ever seen.  It's not a ride in the park, and it's not dark like _The Piano_ was dark.  Not even close. Don't take friends unless you know they like high style and can handle bleakness.  Most people will leave the theatre if this is not their cup of tea.

Comparing the two, Alien had certain qualities that Aliens was lacking, but Aliens, of course, had much more action and plenty of satisfying eye-candy (especially the ending!).  Alien was almost unbearably suspenseful, and left me as frightened as Ripley in the end, but Aliens left me disappointed that it was over and begging for more. Whether or not that's a good thing, I still have yet to decide.  It seems that every time I watch it, it gets better.  Seeing it on the big screen would have really made a difference.I'd have to say that the alien effects in this film really stole the show. Believe me, you will not be disappointed with them.  Most of them look as real as the most top-notch computer animation of today, maybe even more real.  How this was accomplished still amazes me.  Everything else seemed outdated, but passable just the same.Following Ridley Scott's example, director James Cameron, whom will always remain one of my favourite directors, didn't spend too much time revealing the form of the aliens.  This makes the attacks against the marines ten times more frightening.  When you did see an alien, you were never sure of which part you saw, because they either moved too fast or the camera angle changed too quickly.  Cameron only showed what he wanted you to see, and the more he showed of the aliens, the more your heart begins to pound.  This all adds up to the gripping ending Ripley's confrontation with the alien queen.Another element Cameron took up from Scott was excellent character development, especially on Sigourney Weaver's behalf.  Her display of both fear, anger and heroism were especially touching, and the use of Newt, a little girl and the last survivor of the infested colony, to create a mother-daughter relationship greatly increased the emotional aspect of the film, which normally doesn't work in action\/sci-fi.Bill Paxton, in a role somewhat out of place, works particularly well as Hudson.  His display of confidence before landing on LV-426 quickly takes a pitfall after the first battle against the aliens, and refuses to go anywhere with a remote chance of being attacked again.  His feelings are so clear, we become just as traumatized as he is when he is forced to face them again.Other characters, such as Burke and the marines, are noticeably well done as well.  Burke, who's got a hidden agenda of his own, can easily be felt as that typical person who you feel you can trust but in the end cares only for themselves.  The other marines, on the other hand, are detailed enough so you actually care for them when they die, even if they don't seem like nice people.There are pros and cons to the special edition; I never found digitally remastered sound to make much of a difference, and I can see why some of the scenes were chosen to be cut from the original release.  Mostly, the scenes of the colony before the disaster were not particularly well done, and I suppose the film's sense of abandonment carried from the original would have worked better without them.  Of course, one scene I can't understand why it had been cut was with Burke telling Ripley that her daughter had died at age sixty-six, two years before she had been found.  Ripley explains that she had promised her that she'd be back for her eleventh birthday.  This was an especially emotional part of the film that explains why Ripley decides to accept responsibility of Newt so easily.Overall, this movie cannot be watched only once.  If you do, you'll soon find yourself desperate to watch it again.  If you haven't seen it yet, buy it, don't rent it.

That something was an urge to become a better film, to break away from the over used scenes and space cliches. All the elements were in place, great direction, a capable cast, good dialogue, lots of action, only it's too much like the other recent space films.The plot is more plausible than most space flicks, a bleak vision of the future, where humans have depleted all of the Earth's resources and must find a new planet to colonize in order to survive as a race.

The writing is good, though not great, but the story is so compelling that I find myself reading 200 pages each time I sit down to read.Left Behind The Movie widens the gap between the great story, and the mediocre writing and directing used to convey it to the audience. While the film certainly has some exciting moments - most of the time they are accompanied with either silly dialogue or stilted acting that unfortunately distract the viewer from what's really going on.The acting is either great or terrible, depending on who you're referring to. Kirk Cameron is great as Cameron Williams, and Janaya Stephens is excellent as Chloe Steele. Other performances are adequate, such as Brad Johnson's Captain Rayford Steele, and Chelsea Noble's Hattie Durham. Unfortunately, a couple of the performances were just plain awful. Gordon Currie was completely unconvincing as Nicolae Carpathia, especially in the few scenes that really were important in his character's development. He looked way to young to play the part, and he made Carpathia into a stiff and boring leader, completely opposite of his charismatic presence in the books.However, Currie's performance looks like Oscar material compared to the awful portrayal of Bruce Barnes by Clarence Gilyard Jr.  Bruce's lamentation at the church after the disappearances is easily the worst few minutes of the movie. To be fair though, Gilyard's lines are easily the worst of the script. Emotions that could have been conveyed with a slow zoom in to a teary eyed and broken man were instead explained literally by Bruce himself. It would have been less distracting for the film to just stop and ask everyone to turn to page 135.That brings up another problem I had with the film - it seems to assume that the viewer has read the book. Nicolae's presence as a political leader is never explained, and his rise to power is depicted in only about two minutes. Some of the most compelling scenes in the book are those that allow us to learn more about this mysterious leader. These moments are glaringly absent from the movie.The last thing that I have to mention is the music. The music is by far the worst thing about Left Behind.

What should have been the most moving scene of the movie is marred by the fading in of some cheesy Christian pop song.Overall, the story is still good enough to keep the movie going.

The story of Red Planet is as thin as the Martian atmosphere, and the characters have as much depth as an overnight frosting of carbon dioxide.  My 'implausibility meter' was almost always in the red -- in keeping with the film's title and with the tint of the surface imagery.

Overall I got the impression that the film was most probably conceived as a commercial vehicle for Carrie-Anne Moss, who made a strong presence in The Matrix.  If I'm right, her strengths were effectively diluted in this film. There is virtually no authentic science expressed in Red Planet.  Imagine science as just one of the khaki colors of a mercenary incursion on the movie-going public.  The known facts of Mars, space, and space travel are treated mostly as inconvenient details that are glibly ignored or warped.  Like in the odious but sometimes hilarious film Battlefield Earth, we are expected to believe that fragile decades-old equipment left on the surface of Mars (i.e., the American Sojourner rover, and a fictional Russian sample-return spacecraft) can be jury-rigged for a surprise victory over adverse circumstances. Yeah, right. The chief science officer (Terence Stamp) was, at the very beginning of the film, characterised as the soul of the mission.  (Hello?  What does this mean?)

Except for one mildly interesting positive comment by an improbably cast 'gene-coder' (Tom Sizemore), science was otherwise demoted several times in mock-serious asides that made the scientific method seem to be inadequate as an approach to illuminating the details of the universe, let alone its essential nature.

However, the life that is found on Mars isn't really the emphasis of the film.  This film is more of a survival story, like Apollo 13, in which everything is going wrong and the crew must use every resourceful bone in their bodies to stay alive.  Most of the story is believable.  Though where the life on Mars came from (the bugs, not the algae) is kind of a mystery. (I thought the theory of spontaneous generation had been disproved!)The story has some occasional flashbacks in the narrative that, I thought, worked well.  The budding romance between Bowman and Gallagher is believable.  These two characters are very likeable, and so is Sizemore's. Moss is going to continue to grow as an actress in the film industry, mostly because directors in Hollywood are going to want her in their films.  She conveys an inner strength, like Weaver did in Alien and Aliens.  She's very sexy, yet she can easily be believable as a Ph.D like in Red Planet.  And she doesn't bring so much of a personality or ego to the screen like most stars do.  (though perhaps that's because she's just begun as an actress)There is some exciting scenes in this film, with excellent special effects that never dominate the film.  The directing is good--some scenes were quite effective emotionally.  The dialogue is good, ten times better than the dialogue in Mission To Mars, which was terrible at times.  Red Planet has some good humor too.  And Red Planet's climax\/ending was far better than the hokey climax of Mission to Mars (which was conveniently narrated to the intellectually challenged).I give Red Planet three stars (or an 8 rating on here).  Science-fiction devotees certainly should not miss this one.  Nor should those who are interested in space and space exploration in a more scientific, less fictional, way.  Some of the vistas on Mars are very impressive.  However, one thing that might bother the truly scientific was the artificial gravity on the ship.  Mission to Mars used a centrifuge, which is much more believable (even though it was too small and moved to slow to be truly effective).

Here is how I sum it up Mission tried to be a realistic story but ended up with gobs of implausible events and actions to mess up the works. Red Planet tries only to be a 'classic' sci-fi film of the kind we don't see much of now-a-days. Except in its computer enhanced look, it harks back to those old black & white films of spacemen landing on the unknown planet, finding something unexpected, then having their numbers whittled down while they race to save the day using only their native resources. In the regard I thought Red Planet to be a pleasant surprise. SPOILER ALERT The quickie spoiler Earth has been sending probes to mars for years, trying to seed the planet with algae which will convert the atmosphere to one with more suitable chemistry for humans. The experiment seems to be working, but then the stuff mysteriously disappears, and a crew is hurriedly dispatched to investigate. Things go wrong, and the commander is left stranded in orbit on a disabled ship whilst the rest of the crew bail out to the surface, expecting to hole up in an existing habitat from a robot mission. Both parties (in orbit on on the surface) lose touch due to landing damage, a couple of crew die of injuries, the military robot (hastily brought along for its navigational capabilities) goes into it's 'kill everyone' mode, the habitat turns out to have been ravaged and devoid of foodstuffs, and the race begins. The commander (Carrie-Anne Moss, in her best Sigourney Weaver-in-Alien resourceful mode) battles against time to restore enough functionality to the ship for a return trip home, thinking that the guys below are dead. The guys meanwhile think she's dead, and that their time is numbered (remember the robot stalking them one by one?). As their number dwindle, the hero (Val Kilmer, depressed by the loss of his buddies and by the supposed loss of his secret beloved in orbit above) outwits the robot, finds an early NASA probe and salvages its radio to re-establish contact with the commander above, then hightails it to find a larger Russian probe, abandoned but capable in theory of giving him a lift back into orbit for a ride home if the boss can manage to fix the ship. In the process, of course, he discovers the secret of the missing alage and the barren habitat, both of which will save the day for Earth if he can just get off the planet alive!The film's basic plausibility is decent, at least within the standards of this kind of science fiction. Most things are suitably likely given the genre. There are a few things that really stretch credibility (why would they have every put THAT on the ship unless they knew this unlikely scenario was going to happen?), but still the crap-o-counter was reading lower than with Mission to Mars.The film's script has been called bland, wooden or just plain boring. I thought that there is nothing wrong with people talking to themselves when they are basically alone, and astronaut types are not required to spew witty lines when in a crisis situation. The dialogue served its purpose, but was not the main point of the film.There are some cool things. The landing of the pod with its air cushion balloons, everything about the military robot, the finding and use of the NASA probe, the cute yet somehow foreign user interface on the Russian probe, and of course the answer to the algae question.I give it three out of four stars.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"11 November 2000","score":"","review":"  'Swimming with Sharks' may be the best example of a neglected and forgotten film ever. I mean, Trimark didn't even bother transferring the movie onto tape in it's entirety, the tape runs out half way through the end credits. I first caught this film on late night TV up here in Canada, and I was amazed at how good it was, and how I could've missed it earlier. After that I spent the next four months searching every video store in Calgary for a copy to rent, eventually finding one in a small store on the other end of town. Once I took it home, I was ecstatic, popping it into the VCR immediately. It was as good... no, better than I remembered. I saw it five times that weekend.Spacey's portrayal of Buddy Ackerman, the boss from hell, is right on target, and will go down as his best performance up until 1999's 'American Beauty' (in my opinion it was better than Beauty, but the critics apparently didn't think so). Frank Whaley, as Guy, the films protagonist, is Spacey's equal, or pretty close, he gives a great, underrated performance here. Michelle Forbes and Benicio Del Toro also provide great support in two pivotal roles.The script couldn't have been better. The one liners fly in fast and furious, mixed in with some drama and a great ending, all wrapped up in an unconventional format, moving between the present and past effortlessly. George Huang's direction is also superb, he creates a great atmosphere and it lasts throughout the entire film, no small feat. It's too bad he hasn't gone on to bigger and better thinks yet, as he has a wealth of untapped talent.Still, despite the great acting, writing and direction, the best part may be the haunting piano music, which stays with you long as the film has ended. The most incredible part of it all is that the soundtrack only contains a single short track from the movie's score, with the rest coming from a random assortment of songs by famous artists that don't even appear in the movie.A brilliant, twisted character study, with an ending coming right out of the blue. I don't understand why people disliked the ending so much, to me it was one of the best parts of the film.
