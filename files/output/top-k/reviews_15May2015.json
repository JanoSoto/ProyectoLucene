It is New Years Eve 1981 where girls wonder the street in search of the big party. This is in fact a party that no one has shown up to and the hostess is literally counting the minutes. There is a virgin experiencing sex, a guy who spends the evening complaining about the women who dumped him, a bartender who constantly gets stood up. The energy is there in the setup and director Risa Bramon Garcia follows each individual about interesting locations and situations. It is basically a series of subplots with an ending where everybody seems to wake up with somebody. Great ensemble cast including Christina Ricci who searches for the party. Courtney Love celebrates her friend's birthday before countering his complaints with sex. Dave Chappelle plays a cab driver who sees all and is the film's observer. Casey Affleck mourns over broken relationships. Martha Plimpton plans a big party but is disappointed when only one person appears while others form the other subplots. It relates to the teenage fearless persona where actions are believed to have no consequences. Entertaining film right down to the last cigarette.
