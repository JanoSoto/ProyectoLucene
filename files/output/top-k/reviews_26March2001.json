But of course I forgot all the rules. Don't get them wet, keep them away from bright light and never ever feed them after midnight. So they are back bigger and badder than ever before. My feeling with this film is that you don't take it too seriously and just have some fun, because that is all Gremlins 2 is trying to do, tickle your funny bone.Yesterday it was rural Kingston Falls. Today it's the Big Apple - and lots of wild anarchic comedy - because a new batch of mischievous green meanies is on the loose. Billy and Kate have moved to New York and are reunited with Gizmo, the cute little Magwai. They are also forced to save the day, once again. We told you the rules. You didn't listen. Now you'll have to face up to the consequences. And have a blast doing it. The most impressive part of Gremlins 2 are the Gremlins themselves. They are simply breathtaking. My favourite character would have to be the 'Brain' Gremlin. Some of the quotes he comes out with are hilarious. In his many different situations he is just a comic. I enjoyed it when he recovers from drinking the brain serum, in the brokerage room, the TV interview and when he gets the whole Gremlin gang singing the chorus 'New York, New York'. Out of all the movies I have seen, I would have to say that the 'Brain' Gremlin is my favourite character of all-time. The voiceovers in this Gremlins were outstanding. The most dominant voice in the whole film belongs to Tony Randall, whose talents shine out as the voice of the 'Brain' Gremlin. He did those voiceovers to perfection. He stared in the 70's TV series 'The Odd Couple'. If he wasn't involved in this movie, I believe it would have been a real let down. Other Gremlins that were of great significance for this film include the Salad Gremlin, Electricity Gremlin, Funny Gremlin, Dumb Gremlin and just plain stupid Gremlin. But for truly great special effects, the greatest Gremlin is the Spider Gremlin. When he starts to chase after Kate and Marla in the hallway, it is remarkable to see him walking along and the underneath shots of him. In fact he almost looks real. This leads me to give praise to the special effects team and its leader, Rick Baker. They would have had a huge job and they did it perfectly in this film.  I must admit that the directing and producing of Gremlins 2 would have taken a lot of time and patience. Steven Spielberg and his production team did a hell of a job, as did director Joe Dante. There were some extraordinary scenes and they would have taken a serious amount of directing to get just right. Some of the scenes which standout for me include nearly all the Gremlin shots (eg. scene in the control tower, the abuse with Gizmo and of course the 'Brain' Gremlin who was just superb), with all of them causing havoc in their own wacky kind of way, the scenes in the Hi-Tech Clamp building, the Gizmo scenes are much better, considering that he is given a lot more latitude in this movie.  Voicing Gizmo for the second time is Howie Mandal and he is pretty good as well. Yet one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie would have to be in the TV Kitchen with the somewhat drunk, Microwave Marge.The human cast of this film takes second fiddle to these ugly little monsters. Back in reprising roles are Zach Gilligan and Phoebe Cates. They were great in the first movie and nothing has changed second time around. Also appearing again are Dick Miller and Jackie Joseph as the Futterman's. They were unlucky in the first film and are essential, in my opinion, in the second. I recently saw Dick Miller in the small role he had in the 1984 classic, Terminator. The new cast members in this movie include John Glover, Robert Proskey and Harviland Morris. Glover was exceptional as Daniel Clamp. His silly antics as the boss of a Hi-Tech. office building are very funny. Likewise, Proskey is hilarious as the roving reporter through all the mischief and mayhem (especially in the TV interview with the 'Brain' Gremlin just brilliant). Morris plays Marla, Billy's boss, someone who is very tense, hardworking and a terrible flirt. The story isn't that important in this movie. Ultimately it is about these little green monsters that are inhabiting a Hi-Tech office building in New York City, and having fun doing so. But the most interesting part of this script is the way that this film sends up certain well-known movies and icons. It first of all it pokes fun at the first film (with movie reviewer Leonard Maltin) and then takes off movies such as Batman and Rambo, plus there is a Gremlin version of the famous musical, Phantom of the Opera. In one scene there is a Gremlin playing with Lego, a famous line of children's toy and one who is promoting Warner Brothers themselves. This aspect of the film was truly crazy, but very funny too. Overall Gremlins 2 is a different kind of sequel. By the time it has bagged its predecessor and other known movies, musicals and famous icons, this movie is about to explode. Many sequels are criticised for not being that great. My understanding of a sequel is that it is in some way better than it's original, and I feel that Gremlins 2 fills the criteria. I wouldn't be able understand it, if people don't like the classic sequel, coz it is very original. Gremlins 2, The New Batch - 'Is that civilised? No clearly not, fun but in no sense civilised!'

He has us shrieking from the terror and dread of an actual nuclear war breaking out.  And he has us swaying our hands at the absurdity of these characters and situation that we are viewing as an unbelievable satire of this government struggling to save us from doom.  Peter Seller's performances as The President, the British officer and of course, Dr. Strangelove are brilliantly blazed onto the screen.  Sterling Hayden gives deranged generals a brand new meaning as Jack the Ripper, the man who starts the mess.  And of course, George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson.  Scott gives one of the most hilarious performances in motion picture history as a man bent on worldly destruction.  He doesn't care how many people die, he wants his nation to win the cold war.  Chaos is what makes this man go around, with facial expressions that are non-approachable from even the greatest comedian.

First we are ashamed, because we jumped to conclusions based on half truths and presumptions and we are shamefully wrong.  But these ideas take us out of the realm of the film, into things that happen in our lives, on our TV screens every night, and we wonder how often assumptions we make about things are wrong, if we make them because of the way stories are spun and we are taught to assume things.  The films brings up political and gender related issues, but not in traditional ways.  It never gets preachy, just presents a story, it is the viewer's responsibility to walk away and decide for themselves what lessons the film has taught them about these things. There are so many subtle signifiers and nuances it is impossible to understand the complexity of this film in just one viewing.I have not been as blown away by a film on first viewing since I saw American Beauty for the first time.  I watched The Contender on Friday night and I haven't stopped thinking about, talking about, or applying the ideas it conveyed to going on's in my daily life since.  Everyone should watch this film, it relates to all of us, and has something incredibly important to share with anyone with the brains to let it teach them.

Yes, it's somewhat predictable.  And yes, there's a lot of cursing.  However, all the other elements in Good Will Hunting help the film not only succeed, but soar.  The script Good Will Hunting is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it Two talented young actors, yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay-by-committee published by the major studios for the sole purpose of commercial gain.  Every line of dialog here, rather than succumbing to the pit of tired cliches, comes off original and with personality.  Every scene here, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging.  One of the best examples of this is in the fantastic scene between Will and Chuckie at the end about what Will would be doing in 20 years.  Through Chuckie's blunt honesty he shows us how true of a friend he really is, and the true depth of their relationship.  Outside of maybe Pulp Fiction, I don't think I've seen a script this original and absorbing in some time.Robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in Dead Poets Society.  Here, he's not the schmaltzy, kindhearted savior he's been in his last couple of movies.  Rather he's a good, intelligent, but flawed man who is there originally just to guide Will, but ultimately his experiences with will help him confront his own issues.  His performance is not superficial, but nuanced- knowing about life, but at the same time, not knowing, and learning along with Will.  Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius-with-an-attitude that is deeply hurt inside and grows to show us that he doesn't know everything, but is willing to learn.  Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.Looking around here, I see quite a few negative comments for this film.  Frankly, I'm stunned.  The work of everyone involved in the film, particularly Damon, Affleck, and Williams, raises what could have been a complete cliche to cinematic excellence.

It's surprising that any story does; more surprising still that it should turn out to be a story which unanimous opinion regards as a disappointment.  (Late in his life Conan Doyle published a list of his favourite Holmes stories, and Orange Pips was among them.  But this was during his spirits-and-fairies period.)  One big problem with the story is that Holmes is almost completely ineffectual his client gets killed, it's largely his fault, and Conan Doyle doesn't even seem to notice.Yet it's not a BAD story.  The classic ingredients are there, and no lover of Holmes could fail to get some kick out of them.  We can't regard it as a failure in the way that some stories (The Mazarin Stone, The Veiled Lodger) are failures.What does all this have to do with Goldfinger?  The central disappointment is the same our hero is surprisingly passive and ineffectual.  When he does do something likely as not it's an obvious blunder, even if it's not presented as such.  And (as in so many Holmes stories), the plot is silly.  I can't say more without cautioning people who haven't seen Goldfinger to stop reading.  Stop reading.After our first viewing, we know that Bond has spent most of his time caged up, but we feel he must have done something worthwhile to justify our faith in him.  What, exactly?  The first thing he does is to get Jill Masterson killed - in the process, letting Goldfinger know who he is, and thus rendering all the undercover work he will later attempt, pointless.  In stopping Tilly Masterson from killing Goldfinger - she might have succeeded, he endangers her life, too, and indeed, she dies, too.  When he's captured and about to be killed he does everything in his power to convince Goldfinger to keep him alive.  Here he succeeds - yet it was his duty, as a spy, to die.  Alive, he is Goldfinger's pawn (subsequent events show what a useful pawn he is); dead, he would be replaced by another agent, and this second agent would stand a much greater chance of thwarting Goldfinger.  (If you ask me, as soon as Bond has been spared, he realises his mistake; I think his rudeness to Goldfinger is partly an attempt to goad the villain into killing him.)  Once secure in Goldfinger's stronghold nothing he attempts amounts to anything.(Speaking of Goldfinger's schemes, would it really matter if an atomic bomb were dropped in Fort Knox?  People would be killed, but I mean apart from that.  The gold is just sitting in the ground anyway; if it were irradiated for a century or so, people would be unable to touch it, which would mean that the US government would have to leave it ... sitting in the ground.  Well now.  I can see why we can't let THAT happen.)I know what you're thinking.  Not quite ALL of Bond's plans come to nothing.  Doesn't he persuade Pussy Galore to join the side of the angels, and isn't her intervention crucial in preventing tragedy?  Yes, but this is nothing to do with Bond.  When he's asked afterwards why she did this he is as surprised as anyone, and he says, half joking, I must have appealed to her maternal instinct.  Actually, I think that's the truth.  I think that Bond in Goldfinger's stronghold was at once so resolute and so helpless that she took pity on him.  And you know what?  This single touch makes a story that would otherwise be completely pointless, interesting; as interesting as a good folktale, or one of Aesop's better fables.What really rescues Goldfinger, though, is the other parallel with The Five Orange Pips broken down into its components, it is THE classic member of its series.  There's a good brassy title song, with Maurice Binder's best title sequence.  There's a fabulous set of Bond women.  Special mention must be made of Dink, played by Margaret Nolan, who's on screen for just a few seconds, but my God she's luscious.  Then there's that Amazonian bunch of female fighter pilots ... but Goldfinger reminds us how important that the female characters be INTERESTING, at least as narrative devices; the next woman of comparable interest came along 25 years later, in The Living Daylights.  There's a good villain with absurd, yet frightening, henchmen.  There's globe-trotting and scenery-chasing.

And (as in so many Holmes stories), the plot is silly.  I can't say more without cautioning people who haven't seen Goldfinger to stop reading.  Stop reading.After our first viewing, we know that Bond has spent most of his time caged up, but we feel he must have done something worthwhile to justify our faith in him.  What, exactly?  The first thing he does is to get Jill Masterson killed - in the process, letting Goldfinger know who he is, and thus rendering all the undercover work he will later attempt, pointless.  In stopping Tilly Masterson from killing Goldfinger - she might have succeeded, he endangers her life, too, and indeed, she dies, too.  When he's captured and about to be killed he does everything in his power to convince Goldfinger to keep him alive.  Here he succeeds - yet it was his duty, as a spy, to die.  Alive, he is Goldfinger's pawn (subsequent events show what a useful pawn he is); dead, he would be replaced by another agent, and this second agent would stand a much greater chance of thwarting Goldfinger.  (If you ask me, as soon as Bond has been spared, he realises his mistake; I think his rudeness to Goldfinger is partly an attempt to goad the villain into killing him.)  Once secure in Goldfinger's stronghold nothing he attempts amounts to anything.(Speaking of Goldfinger's schemes, would it really matter if an atomic bomb were dropped in Fort Knox?  People would be killed, but I mean apart from that.  The gold is just sitting in the ground anyway; if it were irradiated for a century or so, people would be unable to touch it, which would mean that the US government would have to leave it ... sitting in the ground.  Well now.  I can see why we can't let THAT happen.)I know what you're thinking.  Not quite ALL of Bond's plans come to nothing.  Doesn't he persuade Pussy Galore to join the side of the angels, and isn't her intervention crucial in preventing tragedy?  Yes, but this is nothing to do with Bond.  When he's asked afterwards why she did this he is as surprised as anyone, and he says, half joking, I must have appealed to her maternal instinct.  Actually, I think that's the truth.  I think that Bond in Goldfinger's stronghold was at once so resolute and so helpless that she took pity on him.  And you know what?  This single touch makes a story that would otherwise be completely pointless, interesting; as interesting as a good folktale, or one of Aesop's better fables.What really rescues Goldfinger, though, is the other parallel with The Five Orange Pips broken down into its components, it is THE classic member of its series.  There's a good brassy title song, with Maurice Binder's best title sequence.  There's a fabulous set of Bond women.  Special mention must be made of Dink, played by Margaret Nolan, who's on screen for just a few seconds, but my God she's luscious.  Then there's that Amazonian bunch of female fighter pilots ... but Goldfinger reminds us how important that the female characters be INTERESTING, at least as narrative devices; the next woman of comparable interest came along 25 years later, in The Living Daylights.  There's a good villain with absurd, yet frightening, henchmen.  There's globe-trotting and scenery-chasing.  There's the sense of a spy trapped within what appears to be civilisation, unable to cry for help.  There's gadgetry and adventure.  There's a last-minute bomb defusing.  There's a memorable death.  Goldfinger has EVERYTHING.  It may be the only Bond film to do so.  And here's the amazing thing despite having a passive, ineffectual hero - this is less of a flaw than it would otherwise be because his passive ineffectuality rises to the level of mythic - all of these inessential Bond elements are enough to make Goldfinger the best Bond film ever made.  (Well, not quite.  Best is From Russia with Love.  But Goldfinger is close.)  It's here that the parallel with Five Orange Pips breaks down.

Certainly its admirers tend to praise its futuristic sets and narrative construction, diminishing its apparent thematic purpose.  On a purely plot level, the movement is definitely towards closure, to reasserting the status quo after social fissures have erupted into mass violence, reconfiguring the workers from active destroyers to passive constructors.  And certainly, the main protagonists, mostly from the ruling class, are humanised, given a psychology of their own, while the workers are an easily manipulable mass, some even given bestial features, as if they are not quite human.There is a radical tradition in German cinema, going from Lang through Sirk to Fassbinder that uses the resources of narrative to subvert its ends.  The ending of Sirk's 'Final Accord', for instance, seems to offer an exemplary image of Nazi ideology, when Sirk's procedures have been to dismantle it. The same process is at work here, and in the same terms - the film's very constituents explain why it doesn't offer closure.  This is a film about decadence.  'Metropolis' is no proto-Orwellian nightmare; the peak of absolute control is past, now large cracks are beginning to appear - even the paint seems to be peeling off.  Jon Frederson's anxious face is not that of a self-confident dictator.  This uncertainty in subject matter is matched by the form.  The narrative actually consists of four dreams.  'Metropolis' the film itself is Lang's horrified dream of the future after visiting Manhattan.  More directly, there are three cases of people literally dreaming within the film.  Freder is the one most prone to visions and hallucinations, unable to see what's in front of him without idealising or demonising it.  When he see Maria apparently wooing his father, his idealism is crushed, and he goes mad, having hysterical nightmares conflating religion, lust and death.  The important point is the way Freder dreams disrupt the film's 'objective' narration.  As in all of Lang's work, much of the plot information is filtered through point of view; if this point of view is suspect, how reliable is the plot information; and, more pertinently, its resolution?  There is a crucial ambiguity in the scene where Frederson and Rotwang reveal to the ruling class the robot Maria.  Formally, in its hallucinatory quality, its subjective focus, and in Lang's editing, the sequence seems to be Freder's dream, but it contains narrative action he is not party to.  This ambiguity is never resolved, and, as the narrative pitch heightens and becomes more excessive at this point, it is plausible that the second half is one long hallucination.  Maria too dreams, as she lies wired to the robot, who is a conventionally Freudian double for her dark desires.  Where Maria 1 is more of a spirit than a person, etherealised by light to the point where she seems like a ghost, the 'evil' Maria is all body, a sexual creature; where maria 1 is linked to children (the future), Maria 2 rejoices in the end of the world.  This fissure in Maria creates the social fissure that leads to the revolt, but it also leads to a complication of characterisation that undermines the resolution.  The final dream is that of the workers, who sleepwalk their way through life.  Like Maria, the second half of the film is a giant emanation of the Id, a Bacchic revolt.  Their political transgression is sexualised, the phallic monuments symbolising their repression ejaculating in a flood.  The geography of 'Metropolis' is also a physiology, with the city a map of the mind, broken down by warring impulses, and the wear and tear of daily modern life.This ambiguity of status - is it dream of reality - determines the whole film in motifs, for instance - the final, hesitant handshake mirrors two previous ones that betokened no good; the images of the circle and the triangle, in the shapes of buildings and objects, in Lang's composition of characters and space, proliferate throughout the film, often subliminally creating a pattern of repetition and power relations that undermine the straight line of the narrative (for instance, the vicious circle of power and revolt being part of the same cycle of repression). The site of the ending on the steps of a Cathedral symbolise a Christian and Dantean redemption, after the incendiary revolt, with 'devils' cast out in what we would now call a Hitchcockian finale (Lang, as usual, getting there first); but the Inferno continues, in the monotonous routine of the workers' lives, and in the underground setting of their work and homes. 'Metropolis' is replete with religious symbolism - Maria as a virgin mother; Freder as Christ, doubting his creator-father, his exhausted arms spreadeagled in a crucifixion pose at the dial - but these are usually ironised.  Maria's message of hope may be delivered in an abandoned Church, but it is also a catacomb, a burial place, and the scene (the scariest in cinema?) where she is hunted by Rotwang, her terrified eyes being directed towards mounds of death, tend to diminish the religious rapture, with her pacifism linked to the workers' death.  The Holy Family motif is turned by Freder's sexual neurosis into an Oedipal complex when he catches Maria with his father, unleashing visions of the Seven Deadly Sins.  The witch-burning is not a very redemptive resurgence of an older, less forgiving Christian sentiment.  The mixture of different genres - futuristic fantasy, Gothic horror, psychological thriller, suspense movie etc. - reflects the conflation of different historical timespans, which makes 'Metropolis' an archetypal post-modern space.  If history is rendered uniform and, hence, forgotten, than its lessons will be forgotten, as will the closing redemption, when we can expect the same old mistakes to be made again.  Most importantly, the investigation of voyeurism and surveillance, and its link to power and oppression, implicate both the director and the audience - the Maria 2 strip-tease to an orgy of disembodied eyes is only the most extreme case - and further deny the impulse to resolution and distance.  Lang knows perfectly well the limitations of the script, and his film is an act of opposition to it and its assumptions.

This ambiguity is never resolved, and, as the narrative pitch heightens and becomes more excessive at this point, it is plausible that the second half is one long hallucination.  Maria too dreams, as she lies wired to the robot, who is a conventionally Freudian double for her dark desires.  Where Maria 1 is more of a spirit than a person, etherealised by light to the point where she seems like a ghost, the 'evil' Maria is all body, a sexual creature; where maria 1 is linked to children (the future), Maria 2 rejoices in the end of the world.  This fissure in Maria creates the social fissure that leads to the revolt, but it also leads to a complication of characterisation that undermines the resolution.  The final dream is that of the workers, who sleepwalk their way through life.  Like Maria, the second half of the film is a giant emanation of the Id, a Bacchic revolt.  Their political transgression is sexualised, the phallic monuments symbolising their repression ejaculating in a flood.  The geography of 'Metropolis' is also a physiology, with the city a map of the mind, broken down by warring impulses, and the wear and tear of daily modern life.This ambiguity of status - is it dream of reality - determines the whole film in motifs, for instance - the final, hesitant handshake mirrors two previous ones that betokened no good; the images of the circle and the triangle, in the shapes of buildings and objects, in Lang's composition of characters and space, proliferate throughout the film, often subliminally creating a pattern of repetition and power relations that undermine the straight line of the narrative (for instance, the vicious circle of power and revolt being part of the same cycle of repression). The site of the ending on the steps of a Cathedral symbolise a Christian and Dantean redemption, after the incendiary revolt, with 'devils' cast out in what we would now call a Hitchcockian finale (Lang, as usual, getting there first); but the Inferno continues, in the monotonous routine of the workers' lives, and in the underground setting of their work and homes. 'Metropolis' is replete with religious symbolism - Maria as a virgin mother; Freder as Christ, doubting his creator-father, his exhausted arms spreadeagled in a crucifixion pose at the dial - but these are usually ironised.  Maria's message of hope may be delivered in an abandoned Church, but it is also a catacomb, a burial place, and the scene (the scariest in cinema?) where she is hunted by Rotwang, her terrified eyes being directed towards mounds of death, tend to diminish the religious rapture, with her pacifism linked to the workers' death.  The Holy Family motif is turned by Freder's sexual neurosis into an Oedipal complex when he catches Maria with his father, unleashing visions of the Seven Deadly Sins.  The witch-burning is not a very redemptive resurgence of an older, less forgiving Christian sentiment.  The mixture of different genres - futuristic fantasy, Gothic horror, psychological thriller, suspense movie etc. - reflects the conflation of different historical timespans, which makes 'Metropolis' an archetypal post-modern space.  If history is rendered uniform and, hence, forgotten, than its lessons will be forgotten, as will the closing redemption, when we can expect the same old mistakes to be made again.  Most importantly, the investigation of voyeurism and surveillance, and its link to power and oppression, implicate both the director and the audience - the Maria 2 strip-tease to an orgy of disembodied eyes is only the most extreme case - and further deny the impulse to resolution and distance.  Lang knows perfectly well the limitations of the script, and his film is an act of opposition to it and its assumptions.

Certainly its admirers tend to praise its futuristic sets and narrative construction, diminishing its apparent thematic purpose.  On a purely plot level, the movement is definitely towards closure, to reasserting the status quo after social fissures have erupted into mass violence, reconfiguring the workers from active destroyers to passive constructors.  And certainly, the main protagonists, mostly from the ruling class, are humanised, given a psychology of their own, while the workers are an easily manipulable mass, some even given bestial features, as if they are not quite human.There is a radical tradition in German cinema, going from Lang through Sirk to Fassbinder that uses the resources of narrative to subvert its ends.  The ending of Sirk's 'Final Accord', for instance, seems to offer an exemplary image of Nazi ideology, when Sirk's procedures have been to dismantle it. The same process is at work here, and in the same terms - the film's very constituents explain why it doesn't offer closure.  This is a film about decadence.  'Metropolis' is no proto-Orwellian nightmare; the peak of absolute control is past, now large cracks are beginning to appear - even the paint seems to be peeling off.  Jon Frederson's anxious face is not that of a self-confident dictator.  This uncertainty in subject matter is matched by the form.  The narrative actually consists of four dreams.  'Metropolis' the film itself is Lang's horrified dream of the future after visiting Manhattan.  More directly, there are three cases of people literally dreaming within the film.  Freder is the one most prone to visions and hallucinations, unable to see what's in front of him without idealising or demonising it.  When he see Maria apparently wooing his father, his idealism is crushed, and he goes mad, having hysterical nightmares conflating religion, lust and death.  The important point is the way Freder dreams disrupt the film's 'objective' narration.  As in all of Lang's work, much of the plot information is filtered through point of view; if this point of view is suspect, how reliable is the plot information; and, more pertinently, its resolution?  There is a crucial ambiguity in the scene where Frederson and Rotwang reveal to the ruling class the robot Maria.  Formally, in its hallucinatory quality, its subjective focus, and in Lang's editing, the sequence seems to be Freder's dream, but it contains narrative action he is not party to.
