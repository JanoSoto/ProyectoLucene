This one reminded me of Sliding Doors, but of course, Lola rennt is far more exhilarating. The opening sequence and credits are refreshing. And what a great soundtrack, totally appropriate for setting the mood of the film. It worked well with the film's rapid pace.I also adored the editing, and the insertion of mini 'sub-plots' through photographic snapshots is refreshing, and hilarious.Lola is one of the most engaging characters I've watched on screen for a long time. Isn't it amazing how different decisions can result in such different repercussions? I bet you know that already but what makes this a winner is the narration and great editing. No matter what decision Lola makes, we can't wait to find out if she can succeed in helping and getting to Manni. My boyfriend found it too short, but I thought that it was a great way to end the film before everything becomes too formulaic.What an enjoyable film! Watch it for all its brilliant creativity and exhilaration!!! ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 1999","score":"","review":"  I've always loved films that play with narration.
