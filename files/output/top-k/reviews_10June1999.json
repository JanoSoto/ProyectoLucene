[{"date":"10 June 1999","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election is easily the best movie I've seen in 1999 so far.  After The Phantom Menace, which proved to be nothing more than a high-gloss\/zero-substance F\/X-driven hype juggernaut (and I'm a huge Star Wars fan), Election surprises and delights with an acrimonious satire on high school life and elections in general.  As Tracy Flick, Reese Witherspoon plays her role perfectly, and should receive an Oscar nomination for her performance with ease.  Matthew Broderick is in his element here as well, along with the rest of the cast, whom all have scene-stealing parts. While the movie runs a bit long, the moral of the story is brought around full-circle through a wonderful conclusion.  Dialogue is crisp, and is both honest and hysterically funny throughout.  The film also has a host of fantastic visual gags, the best of which is the Welcome marquee outside the film's pivotal motel.My rating 9\/10.
