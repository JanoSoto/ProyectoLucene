Ethan Embry is a pretty good actor, as we've seen in films such as Empire Records and That Thing you Do.  But he gets stuck with a dull character whose script gives him nothing interesting to say. NOTHING!  Not one thing in 100 minutes of this godawful picture (just 100?  wow, it felt like a decade).  It doesn't help that the girl he's a had a crush on for four years (CLICHE ALERT) is played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, who isn't much of an actress in the first place, and whose character isn't any help.I don't think anything could have saved this film.  There is a ridiculous cliche in almost every scene.  It's hard to imagine this film existing with out them (though it would be fun imagine this film not existing at all).

Paul Anderson has taken a perfect shot at making a great film and ruined it with poor makeup and even poorer plot.  Number 1, i feel bad for George Romero (originaly slated for this film) for being dropped from this project, because he would have done a great job, because in the end Resident Evil is at its core a game about ZOMBIES, not super-computers.  Who knows zombies better than him???  Well after seeing this movie this wednesday at a sneek preview I can firmly say not Paul Anderson.Ideas from the game were kept, but they were re-worked into something perverted from the game, its as if the movie isnt about the game, but more about making people jump and trying to get a hip teen crowd.  Of which it is missing a key element to that thing which it trys to be...gore.  There is hardly any blood at all in a movie in which zombies are supposed to be eating the people.  Black Hawk Down had 4 times the gore this horror film did.  Even the game involves much more blood.  Dont get me wrong there is plenty of violence, and lots of 'splosions and guns, but there is no saving grace.  The most disappointing thing is the makeup and effects in the film. The zombies look just like normal people with a bad limp, barely any had any facial or body appliances to create effect of decay.  Some of the computer effects were laughable, and the main creature reminded me of the computer alien from Alien 3 in 1993 (not a good thing)! The acting is about as bad as the first game so thats the only thing close to staying true to the game.  Michelle Rodriguez contunies to be type cast as the snarling, tough female which she seems to excell with.  Even Milla Jovovich wastes her time trying to attempt to act through this one.  The rest of the cast is just kind of there, lucky them. In conclusion, ha i know ive rambled enough, if you are looking for a true survival horror film then rent something like John Carpenter's The Thing, but if you want to be throw into a world were the only survival horror youll have is to try and not walk out of the theater go see Resident Evil.  My only question is why did the drop George Romero...so sad, lets tell the man who made the films the games are based off of he cant direct the movie based on the games...good job Hollywood, Good Job.

As I watched my favorite books come to life before my eyes I was positively engrossed in this movie.To start off, the scenery must be of the most beautiful places in the world. New Zealand was the perfect place to film it and from the grassy fields to the high mountain tops, each shot was capturing and very believable. The Shire was exactly how I imagined it, with the rolling fields to the hobbits holes, with their round doors at a perfect height for the little hobbits. Rivendell was the most stunning scene out of them all, as perfect as a picture, with misty waterfalls, sparkling streams and the careful structure of the buildings and towers.The beginning told well of how the great rings came to be and Cate Blanchett has a very powerful and capturing voice. The characters all played their parts well. Elijah Wood was more than perfect and adorable in his roll of Frodo Baggins. Ian Mckellen did an outstanding job in his roll of Gandalf the Grey. One of the best characters has to be Strider\/Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen. The scene between Aragorn and Arwin was one of the most beautiful. Liv Tyler gave a great performance in her role although I do not think that Arwin was a big enough roll to be credited third. But I guess they have to intertwine women into the picture. In the movie, the two most enjoyable characters were Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). They  were quite funny as the good natured hobbits, always ready for their next breakfast. And there is no friend quite like Sam (Sean Austin). Comments about Frodo and Sam being gay are silly thoughts because its nice to see that two guys can give each others hugs with out being homosexual. Saramaun (Christopher Lee) quite frightened me at first but after reading about the actor who played him and his life,I would love to meet him. Especially since he has meet J.R.R. Tolkien. The orcs, quite yucky, but very believable and very evil. I love Gimli (John Rhys Davis) with his axe and I must admit that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) who is very quick with his bow and arrow is also very attractive. Boromier (Sean Bean) although was very tempted, in the end proved to be worthy of his master.The last thing I must comment on is the directing. Peter Jackson could have done no better. Every shot caught your eye and the graphics that went along with it made it all the while better. Also, the sound track for this movie better win its Oscar because the music is beautiful especially the Enya songs.

Now, I'm not referring to the plot elements (which were more or less intact except for Tom Bombadil.

The first item that was ruined in the first 5 minutes was the mystery of Sauron. Sauron is such an amazing character because you never get more than very small glimses of him. Tolkien keeps this throughout all the books. Jackson ruined that in 5 minutes. Next, the action always follows the hobbits. This put you in the place of the hobbits. What characters would be better for an audience to identify with? They were as much outsiders to this strange world as we are. Unfortunately, Jackson ruined that also.The directing was nothing spectacular. It was unobtrusive, but there was no style really, so it did not add any more depth to the movie.

The books are amazing but cannot work as film. Maybe that is why no one has undertaken this epic until now. What I can't understand was how people can praise all the different aspects of it. The costuming and sets were the only thing decent. My complaints? Too many liberties were taken with the book. Now, I'm not referring to the plot elements (which were more or less intact except for Tom Bombadil. If you don't know who that is, read the book!) but the style that Tolkien worked so hard to preserve in all of his books. The first item that was ruined in the first 5 minutes was the mystery of Sauron. Sauron is such an amazing character because you never get more than very small glimses of him. Tolkien keeps this throughout all the books. Jackson ruined that in 5 minutes. Next, the action always follows the hobbits. This put you in the place of the hobbits. What characters would be better for an audience to identify with? They were as much outsiders to this strange world as we are. Unfortunately, Jackson ruined that also.The directing was nothing spectacular. It was unobtrusive, but there was no style really, so it did not add any more depth to the movie. The acting was pretty good, but it could not save the movie from the unforgivable sins that the movie committed to the book.The special effects, though praised, were not good at all. You'd think since they have to do 3 films with hobbits that they would come up with a good way to do them and stick to it. Not the case! The hobbits change size drastically throughout the film depending on the technique that is being used to reduce them. Sometimes they are children, but the worst is when they just put them further from the camera. How is that supposed to work? Although we do not have depth perception in the theater, the audience can still tell when the size difference is only created by the perspective. The CG effects were not outstanding, but after seeing Star Wars Episode 1, it was nice to know costumes can still be used well.Now, if I had not read the book, would I have a better view of this film? You bet, but too many things from the book were ruined to make it more of a conventional movie. Even still, I definitely would not think it is worthy of being ranked so high on IMDB.com.

But thats not what made this movie ridiculous, in fact it lines up pretty well with the beginning of the first Resident Evil game, and the movie itself has a good plot. What makes this movie ridiculous is Umbrella's swat team sent in to control the threat of the T- Virus. This is the most absurd conglomeration of soldiers I have ever seen. Most of the people in the squad crap themselves whenever they witness anything bizarre. And Michelle Rodriguez's character Rain is absurd. Its like Paul Anderson was writing this movie and said, hmm I think I'll make one of the characters a ghetto bitch with a bad attitude. If this movie is anyones fault it is Paul Anderson's. From the opening scene where Rain tells another character to blow me Resident Evil is full of ridiculous one liners. In fact thats about all of the dialogue. The only real speaking role is that of the red queen, the A.I computer system that is in control of the lab in which the outbreak has occured. As far as gore and violence go I have no idea why this movie was rated R other than the use of the F word. Anyone who applauds the action (if you can call them that) scenes in this movie is a moron.

Confidential came up, but we had both seen those), we asked our friend if she could bring a movie that none of us had seen but that was supposed to be well-made.  Though a tall order to fill, I have to say she more than delivered when she brought American History X over.  It was powerful, brutal, beautiful, and compelling; the last type of movie most of us college freshman typically see with friends on a friday night. American History X follows the story of a young, brilliant, and very charismatic leader (stunningly played by Edward Norton) of a gang of Neo-Nazis in California, as well as his younger brother's (played by Edward Furlong) involvement in the same group.  I'm not going to tell you any more than that; one of the things I enjoyed most about it was that I knew nothing more than that, so the plot was truly captivating.  Not that it cannot stand on it's own; far from it!  To tell the truth, I had absolutely no interest in what I thought would be yet another p.c. movie hollywood decides to throw at its consumers of Racism is the ultimate evil; it's one of those subjects that has been beat to death, which makes Tony Kaye's (the director) job that much more difficult. However, Mr. Kaye does so in breathtaking fashion.  Much like Memento (which, of course, came after X), a great deal of the film is told via flashback in black and white.  Many of the movie's most violent and compelling scenes are set to a powerfully dramatic, classical score that would simply come off as cheesy in any other film I can think of.  What all this does is sober you up, grab your attention by the throat and make you seriously consider what this movie has to say. And what it has to say is both easily comprehensible, and brilliantly correct.  Instead of portraying all Neo-Nazis as stupid rednecks, demonic villains or unknowing pawns, Kaye creates characters with real dimensions to them.  Most people would find it hard to believe, but it isn't long after the movie starts that you actually care about two young racists, and even understand where these young men come from.  Another brilliant move by Kaye and X's writer, David McKenna, was to present the logical, intelligent arguments that Neo-Nazis use, and precisely show where exactly those arguments are flawed.  Unlike most movies, Kaye actually has the balls to show Ed Norton arguing with a teacher from school against integration, and shows him winning the argument! Another important element of this film is the reason it is rated R horrific violence.  What is so unfortunate is that many, many people will not see this film simply because of its graphic content, yet that is what makes it so horrifying, so gripping, and so mentally lasting.  It, along with Schindler's List, is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life; after that, you probably won't ever want to see it again.

While the film is fun at parts and stays true to its audience, it's not a very enjoyable or memorable experience.\tThe film's main draw for me was Chris Rock; unfortunately, he was greatly limited by his weak supporting roles and this wasn't one of his best performances (and it wasn't one of his best performances either).  Lance Crouther was pretty slick as Pootie Tang, a new-age blaxploitation superhero, but the gimmick of his own language without subtitles or anything went downhill really fast, especially since the same words seemed to have multiple meanings throughout the picture depending on the situation (though I'm no linguist, it could've just been misinterpretation).  The villains, a generic evil white corporate geezer and decidedly less generic brother\/dirty street dealer, served their purpose, the latter being more memorable only because of his obsession with staying literally dirty.  All other characters (most of which are urban culture stereotypes, with the exception of a couple backwoods\/redneck culture stereotypes) are introduced, serve no real purpose other than to fill space towards their one (or two) gag(s), do their gag(s), and then exit all the same without leaving a lasting impression (or, in the case of a bad gag, any laughter).\tThe problem with Pootie Tang was that the vast majority of the characters and gags just don't leave any lasting impression.  Some of them were worth a chuckle, but the rest of it just seemed like Chris Rock light, toned down and lacking his signature edge (maybe I just expected too much as a Chris Rock fan who saw his name on this).  It's quite possible that I'm just not the right audience, as it's quite apparent that the film knows its limits and caters exclusively to a specific type of cynical urban audience mind-set (as evidence for this, a friend told me when he saw it in the theatre that he, along with the rest of the audience, was rolling in the aisles with laughter).\tOne admirable and interesting thing to note is the film's soundtrack.  Unlike most urban soundtracks, where seemingly random songs plucked together and marketed to push units with few connections to the film, songs in this film are lyrically linked to and played in connection with characters and events.  This gives the songs the feel of a literal soundtrack, serving the same purpose as the score in other movies, and brings a welcome freshness that the rest of the film should have shared.\tPart of the film's plot centers on Pootie Tang selling out and going from a street hero to just another image.  In real life, this will never be an issue, because the film makes the effort but is just not funny or original enough to turn into the fun movie necessary for a worthy new franchise.
