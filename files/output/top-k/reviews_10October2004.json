This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with $20 bills &#150; Harry even buys his mother, Sara, a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news, after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high, things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price &#150; forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile, Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills, morning, noon and night.I came to this film with not even the slightest idea of what it was about but only that it was supposed to be 'good'. I was not totally prepared for a story that grabbed me from the start and delivered an intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting, amazingly stylish directing, editing and production. While this onslaught will not be to everyone's tastes, I defy pretty much anyone not to be astonished by this film although I expect many will find it to be a pretty hard ride. The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control &#150; and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is; I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and, although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine, is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing &#150; and I'm not overdoing that; hers is a fearless performance that is totally, totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be. Connelly is the next to stick in the mind, conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs &#150; an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans; I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here &#150; avoiding all the ethnic clichés that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on (as the extras on the DVD show). Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David, Baker, Weeks and Naidu only help.Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well &#150; making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course, some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see &#150; certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two, while others will look at the reference to Dark City (even though Aronofsky) or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time; this is not a rip off or a fluke, this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images, increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times, tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive &#150; whether it be the different cameras, the make up, the editing, the use of mobile stop motion, it is all impressive.Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak, relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances &#150; in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic. I am rarely left breathless by a film but I was by this one and I honestly cannot believe that this escaped me for so many years.

Connelly is the next to stick in the mind, conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs &#150; an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans; I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here &#150; avoiding all the ethnic clichés that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on (as the extras on the DVD show). Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David, Baker, Weeks and Naidu only help.Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well &#150; making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course, some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see &#150; certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two, while others will look at the reference to Dark City (even though Aronofsky) or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time; this is not a rip off or a fluke, this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images, increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times, tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive &#150; whether it be the different cameras, the make up, the editing, the use of mobile stop motion, it is all impressive.Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak, relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances &#150; in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic.

This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with $20 bills &#150; Harry even buys his mother, Sara, a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news, after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high, things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price &#150; forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile, Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills, morning, noon and night.I came to this film with not even the slightest idea of what it was about but only that it was supposed to be 'good'. I was not totally prepared for a story that grabbed me from the start and delivered an intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting, amazingly stylish directing, editing and production. While this onslaught will not be to everyone's tastes, I defy pretty much anyone not to be astonished by this film although I expect many will find it to be a pretty hard ride. The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control &#150; and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is; I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and, although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine, is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing &#150; and I'm not overdoing that; hers is a fearless performance that is totally, totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be.

Regardless of this though, Irwin must not abide by Winter's rules and become just another of the men. Looking to just serve out his time and go home, Irwin tries to accept his new surroundings, but he finds that the men look to him with a respect that he wishes would go away. However as he becomes familiar with the practises within the prison, he cannot help but assume a leadership role &#150; bringing him into direct confrontation with Winter over the brutal, domineering methods he uses.Despite being a total box office flop, I was still sufficiently attracted by Lurie and the cast he had put together to give this film a chance (albeit on DVD rather than in the cinema). The film is a mix of two types of film and it manages to do neither of them that well, but well enough to produce an enjoyable if forgettable film. The first half of the film is a sort of drama, with Irwin teaching the men the respect and humanity that (supposedly) they once had as soldiers. This half is OK mainly because the fatherly Redford makes his character work pretty well at this stuff &#150; it isn't brilliant but it is OK to watch. The second half sees the film become increasingly illogical as the contest between Irwin and Winter intensifies up to the point where a slightly silly final action sequence. I won't say enough to spoil it for anybody, but the final sequence of events grows more and more unlikely by each passing event. Happily it is also quite exciting for what it is and the temptation to scoff at it is delayed (slightly) by the distraction value of it. It is not a great story by any means but it is workable &#150; and the director and cast are just about good enough to make the weak into the watchable, the empty into the entertaining.Ex-Empire critic Lurie will always interest me because he had the guts to do what few critics could &#150; stop analysing others and make something themselves. His direction is good and he handles the action sequences well (their weaknesses being in their writing, not in his delivery). The cast are talented and do their best with a script that is not as good as their talent deserved. Redford has an easy task &#150; playing an elder statesman, full of charisma and high principles. He does this well as one would expect from an actor if his caliber. Gandolfini plays back his accent in an attempt to keep his character away from his 'Sopranoisms' but the script doesn't help him. Gadolfini plays a 'little man', one whom we half feel sorry for and half we dislike; he does well to keep both these sides out, but at the end of the film the script is only really interesting in making him a controlling monster and his performance doesn't really matter one way or the other. The support cast has quite a few well-known faces, most of who are pretty good. Lindo is more of an add-on but the ever-reliable Ruffalo who shows here why he now has the reputation of a solid support man.Collins has a simple, stuttering character but it is still nice to see him in something other than a gangbanger role. The rest of the support are good enough, even if they don't have a great deal to do.Overall this is an average film that seems to aspire to a higher level at one point and then just settle for action and explosions at later stages. None of it really amounts to much but the first half is enjoyable as a fairly clichéd drama and the second half is quite enjoyable even if it is silly and overblown. I can understand why it didn't really do much at the box office but as a DVD it works well enough to pass a few hours even if it never really does much more than go through the motions.

It is not that it makes no sense, it is more that it lacks any sense of fun at all and the dark tone is totally misjudged and the usual moments of inspired craziness is really limited to one or two moments (the best being the Fonz covered in bees!).The cr*p script is not helped at all by a cast that is either rubbish or wasted. Sadler himself falls into the 'rubbish' camp with a performance that is like his usual mugging but even more unbearable. With his twisted expression and nasty voice, he was actually painful to watch &#150; and this is not based on a hatred of Sadler (I loved him in Punchdrunk a few days ago) it is based on the fact that this is a terrible performance with nothing but a terrible idea and a terrible character to work with. The support cast is made up of plenty of well-known faces but few are used well at all and too many of them are embarrassing. Keitel falls into the latter category and he has a thankless role that is not worthy of his talent. Ifans and Lister are given hard work by mostly doing voice work with poor dialogue (in their heads) and they were not funny at all. Arquette is given nothing to do at all but still manages to be lame and annoying. The various cameos are mixed &#150; Taratino is just dumb; Dangerfield is OK but not given enough time; Weathers, Witherspoon, Witherspoon and others are all given nothing to do other than show their faces but Lovitz and Schneider at least provide some unexpected weirdness in very minor roles.Overall, Sadler films are normally average at best but I must say that I found this to be devoid of all but the slightest hint of the inspired humour that he can often create. The story is stupid and silly, the acting both bad and embarrassing, the script filled with misfiring jokes that are mostly in bad taste as well as being unfunny (a bad combination). A real waste of time that will only appeal to the most die-hard fans of Sadler and those that only like their comedy to be very basic indeed.

Blank has built up a respectable client base over the years. Ably assisted by his secretary Marcella, Martin is left free to worry about his next hit rather than the paperwork. However, when two jobs in succession go badly wrong, Martin has cause to consider his present situation. Marcella, much to Martin's displeasure, reckons that these are all signs that he should return home for his school's 10-year reunion. Martin is reluctant to take this path because that would mean confronting some painful memories, mainly related to his dumping of then girlfriend Debi Newberry on prom night. Besides, he hasn't been back to Grosse Pointe in the past decade and he doesn't feel the need to break the habit. Unfortunately, both Marcella and his therapist Dr. Oatman want Martin to reconnect with his roots via this golden opportunity. When his last, displeased clients force him to reluctantly take on a target in Detroit, near to Grosse Pointe, it seems that the fates are against Martin this time. Anyhow, the visit should allow him to avoid fellow hit man Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), who wants to form some sort of union, so this cloud has a silver lining. Arriving back in Grosse Pointe, very little appears to have changed in the intervening years. The first thing that Martin does is seek out Debi, now an anchor DJ for the local radio station.Crashing in on her live show, Martin cracks under the pressure of Debi's questioning and winds up making the situation even worse. The problem is that he doesn't know how to feel because he hasn't felt anything in a long time. What Martin doesn't yet know is that a couple of NSA agents, Lardner and McCullers, are tailing him following a tip-off.

I wanna be a hit man when I go up. Lol, I'm just joking. But this movie has it all, for me at least. For it is THE perfect movie. Hit-man's High school Reunion. That's more or less the jist of it. I could not ask for a movie that suits me more. I love the whole hit men, crime mafia type movies, TV series etc.John Cusack plays Blank, the hit man. He was borne to play this role. I can't see any body else playing Martin Blank. The same goes for Dan Aykroyd. He was perfect as Martin's arch rival, Mr. Grocer. Mini Driver is as hot as usual playing Blank's love interest, Debi. The whole movie is as fresh and original as a movie like this can get. Solid acting, excellent direction, top notch writing and most importantly, many laughs and a load of action makes Grosse Point Blank a must see.****\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"10 October 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A professional assassin by choice and temperament, Martin Q.

The plot is well told and is made interesting by the attention paid to the people involved in the situation; the drama and tension comes from them rather than false action sequences or stand-offs.

All in all, the film has no real purpose, apart from seeing Cary Elwes and Kurtwood Smith in different roles(from what I've seen them in, at least). I recommend it purely to big fans of any of the three actors and very big fans of thrillers. Everyone else should probably avoid it. 6\/10  ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"10 October 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Exit Wounds is a pure old school action flick, with plenty of set pieces and a fair old helping of violent martial arts' action to keep you entertained for the duration.Starring the charismatic lump of wood that is Steven Seagal, Exit Wounds is a cop action flick about your usual 'cop who lives by his own rules' type who gets fired from his job after one too many mistakes and transferred to 15\/15 - a hell hole dive precinct.Essentially he gets caught up in something big, and as these heroes tend to do, he takes on the world head on...Seagal is his usual quietly spoken (So we can't hear how bad an actor he is) self but his posture really is so strange, particularly when walking.

With little to go on but his testimony, Detectives Braxton and Kennesaw hook him up to a polygraph and begin to question him further. Wayland's arrogance and contempt for them immediately rubs them up the wrong way and they increasingly suspect that he is not telling them everything. They keep pushing him, aware of his illness, in the hope that he will start to crack. However what they never foresaw was that Wayland would push back, getting information on both the men and turning the tables on them.With a pretty heavy weight cast, I was attracted to this film when it went by the much better name of 'Liar' in the UK without really knowing a great deal about it. The film has an interesting premise and offers a good flashback structure with some tense interrogation scenes but the plot is not strong enough to really deliver this and ends up twisting into some silly places that fail to convince. The development of the story meant we were thrown in at the deep end &#150; not a problem at first, but I never really got a handle on the film until near the end, making sections of it unengaging. The way the plot turns and twists is also a problem, because very little of it actually rings true, with some of it seeming extreme or just plain nonsensical. It is delivered well though, the interview room is used to increase the tension and seems to become steadily darker throughout the film to produce a good mood.This tense mood is helped by a pretty good cast, in particular the lead three who have enough testosterone to start a riot. Roth plays the meatier role from the start and he does have fun even if I didn't think his epileptic thing really worked that well. Penn is OK but doesn't have much to do other than bash heads with his co-stars, but it is Rooker who manages to steal a lot of the film. Starting with the feel of just a tough guy role, Rooker delivers a much more complex person with self-loathing that is convincing (up until the script takes his character away). The three interact well and the tension between them almost covers from the fact that the story isn't actually that good &#150; but their shared scenes at least have a tough energy that makes them watchable. Support from Arquette, Zellweger and Burstyn is fleeting but adds the feeling of depth.Overall this is not that good a film; the story isn't convincing and is full of silly jumps, nor is it structured that well. However these problems are slightly covered by three tough actors in a small dark room, providing a reasonably good sense of tension and urgency. Of course without the story to back them up, the film gradually starts to come apart and delivers a deeply unsatisfying ending, but it just about has enough going for it to make it watchable.

Cindy and Bob must go to stay with him in Indianapolis, while Buck (Bob's brother) stays with the children. Cindy doesn't trust Buck. She feels extremely uneasy and nervous about leaving the kids with him. He is a 40 year old, who is not married, has no children, gambles and hates to work. He is a light hearted character, and doesn't like to take things seriously. Things start off on the wrong foot. Miles and Maisy (Culkin and Hoffmann) don't remember him, and he doesn't even remember their names. Tia instantly clashes with him, as she does with her mother. Tia is a sarcastic, angry rebellious fifteen year old girl. She keeps her life to herself, but not her opinions. Buck warns her about the intentions of her boyfriend Bug (Jay Underwood), whom he can see straight through after meeting him.We can't help but feel sorry for Buck. He grows to love the kids, yet Tia gives him an incredibly hard time. He is hated by Cindy.(She even folded him off of her and Bob's wedding photo) Chanice(Buck's girlfriend) catches Buck with flirtatious Marcie, and gets the wrong idea of what is going on, thanks to Tia, who is trying to make things miserable for Buck.However, after Tia discovers Buck was right about Bug, we see a special relationship develop between uncle and niece. When Bob and Cindy return home, there is a heart-warming moment between mother and daughter. Uncle Buck's comedy comes fast and frequently. Buck has the greatest comedic role. My personal favourite Buck moments are when he talks to bug about the hatchet in the trunk, chat with Tia about shaving heads, and drill moments. The accompanying sound effects are so well suited here. They have a sci-fi effect, and make Buck seem rather scary to the character opposite, and funny to the viewers. Also note the way that Buck carries out household jobs, such as the washing, drying and ironing. One of the greatest lines in the movie is the 'tune-up' 'ritual killing' line (if you've seen the movie, you'll know!), beaten by the question and answers sequence between Miles and Buck. Brilliant! Miles also comes across as a comedic character. He also seems quite smart and mature for his age. This film is great to watch time and time again. It never loses its comedy value. If you have some time to spare, I suggest filling it with Uncle Buck. You won't be disappointed! My rating of Uncle Buck - 9\/10.

On his return to America Shaw becomes one of the few men to be awarded the Congressional Medal Of Honour for his actions. Years pass but yet Marco cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong &#150; he remembers being in a hotel lobby during a lecture on flower arranging but in his dreams the old women become Chinese military men. When he finds that others have the same dreams he works with military intelligence to uncover their meaning. Meanwhile Shaw's mother uses him to help boost his stepfather's career in the Government, running on a hard line anti-communist ticket.Although the social and political setting is now one of history this film is still a very enjoyable film that serves as thriller, satire and paranoid conspiracy film. I will try and avoid comparisons but naturally the remake stands up better in front of a modern audience simply because it is able to use the more relevant 'big business' slant as well as presenting it as a much more consistent thriller than the original. However this film still stands up well but maybe is not as tense as it could have been because it does take a more balanced approach to the story by building around it as well. This may sound like a criticism but it is only a bad thing in regards a pure thriller, as a matter of fact it makes it a more rounded film. As a satire the film makes good mileage out of the witch hunts over Communism and the political manipulation associated with those who merely accused others with no thought or logic in a manner that swept up the public but also made others afraid to argue. This is well done but my fear is that it will continue to lose its impact as these times become longer ago &#150; sure the theme still works but the relevance is gone and it is not as involving as (sorry for the comparison) the same strand in the remake; understandably so however. The thriller aspect works well enough and is pretty tense but it is not consistent, instead it is kept for several key scenes and its cold, brutal nature is really impacting &#150; even if it is naturally dry and bloodless by today's standards. The fact that the film doesn't push the thriller aspect means that it is able to build across the board and plenty of interesting and satisfying aspects that are played down in the remake are stronger here.In particular the film develops the characters well, making more of the political side of things but also adding much needed meat to the characters of the Jordans, making us see their role in Shaw's life but also getting to know them as characters. This makes for a much more satisfying story, even if I personally preferred the more consistent paranoid and tense atmosphere of the remake. The original also brings out the complex relationship that Shaw has with his mother &#150; we are given more time with this and it is more interesting than the remake, which barely spares the time for it and makes do with a clumsily bit of suggested sexuality.The cast are all pretty good and indeed one of them was the reason I decided to rewatch this film. With Leigh just passing away yesterday, I decided to watch this film (well &#150; also because I had just watched the remake) and was surprised to find that she had so little time in this. Her character is barely used and could easily have been done away with and why such a well-known actress was put in such a minor role. Sinatra is pretty good in his role but I didn't totally buy his performance &#150; he should have been more scarred by what happened, and surely he should not have been believed as quickly as he was? Harvey is much better &#150; cold but with a real emotion underneath and his performance is the core of the film. In the acting stakes though, it is Lansbury that sticks in the memory as the domineering mother type, easily her best role. Gregory is great fun as the manipulated Iselin and Parrish and McGiver are both good as the Jordans. Dhiegh is good and provides a wonderful mix of comedy with the edge of cold menace.Overall this is a very good film that provides a well-rounded story delivering tension, thrills, laughs, shocking cold violence and a good serving of satire. Modern audiences may well find that the relevance of the remake makes it a more enjoyable film but the original is a much more rounded film that succeeds as more than just a thriller.

I will try and avoid comparisons but naturally the remake stands up better in front of a modern audience simply because it is able to use the more relevant 'big business' slant as well as presenting it as a much more consistent thriller than the original. However this film still stands up well but maybe is not as tense as it could have been because it does take a more balanced approach to the story by building around it as well. This may sound like a criticism but it is only a bad thing in regards a pure thriller, as a matter of fact it makes it a more rounded film. As a satire the film makes good mileage out of the witch hunts over Communism and the political manipulation associated with those who merely accused others with no thought or logic in a manner that swept up the public but also made others afraid to argue. This is well done but my fear is that it will continue to lose its impact as these times become longer ago &#150; sure the theme still works but the relevance is gone and it is not as involving as (sorry for the comparison) the same strand in the remake; understandably so however. The thriller aspect works well enough and is pretty tense but it is not consistent, instead it is kept for several key scenes and its cold, brutal nature is really impacting &#150; even if it is naturally dry and bloodless by today's standards. The fact that the film doesn't push the thriller aspect means that it is able to build across the board and plenty of interesting and satisfying aspects that are played down in the remake are stronger here.In particular the film develops the characters well, making more of the political side of things but also adding much needed meat to the characters of the Jordans, making us see their role in Shaw's life but also getting to know them as characters. This makes for a much more satisfying story, even if I personally preferred the more consistent paranoid and tense atmosphere of the remake. The original also brings out the complex relationship that Shaw has with his mother &#150; we are given more time with this and it is more interesting than the remake, which barely spares the time for it and makes do with a clumsily bit of suggested sexuality.The cast are all pretty good and indeed one of them was the reason I decided to rewatch this film. With Leigh just passing away yesterday, I decided to watch this film (well &#150; also because I had just watched the remake) and was surprised to find that she had so little time in this. Her character is barely used and could easily have been done away with and why such a well-known actress was put in such a minor role. Sinatra is pretty good in his role but I didn't totally buy his performance &#150; he should have been more scarred by what happened, and surely he should not have been believed as quickly as he was? Harvey is much better &#150; cold but with a real emotion underneath and his performance is the core of the film. In the acting stakes though, it is Lansbury that sticks in the memory as the domineering mother type, easily her best role. Gregory is great fun as the manipulated Iselin and Parrish and McGiver are both good as the Jordans. Dhiegh is good and provides a wonderful mix of comedy with the edge of cold menace.Overall this is a very good film that provides a well-rounded story delivering tension, thrills, laughs, shocking cold violence and a good serving of satire. Modern audiences may well find that the relevance of the remake makes it a more enjoyable film but the original is a much more rounded film that succeeds as more than just a thriller. It may not be as sharp as it once was but it is still really worth watching.
