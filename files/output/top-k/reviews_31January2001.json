[{"date":"31 January 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  CAUTION -- REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS --Ever since I had seen the first few minutes of Dinosaur as a teaser on the Tarzan DVD last year, I have been looking forward to seeing this film.  I must admit my impression from the teaser was a bit better than the film actually turned out to be. Still, it is a good film, it uses ground-breaking techniques where animation is blended with real filming of locations around the world, and it pulls it off very effectively. Overall I rate it 7 of 10.Dinosaur is about an egg which is stolen by mainland creatures, dropped into a river, retrieved by a large bird, and finally dropped into a forest on a nearby island, where it falls amongst a family of lemurs, voiced in a style similar to the apes in Tarzan. The egg hatches and the baby dino, Aladar, grows up as a member of the lemur family, and calls the older lemur grandfather.A very large meteorite falls not too far away (effects, BTW, are terrific) and the shock wave and fires basically destroy the island and its inhabitants. Except for Aladar and his immediate lemur family. With fire at his tail, he jumps off a cliff into the water, with lemurs on his back. They eventually make their way to the mainland, and encounter a large mass of dinosaurs heading for the nesting grounds. It is a long, difficult trip across a desert and not all make it. Between flesh-eating dinosaurs and drought, Aladar does a couple of things that anger the leader but helps the masses. One is his discovery of water beneath the dry lake bed. Another is his discovery of a cave that leads to the valley paradise, as the old entrance has been closed by a great landslide. He eventually convinces the others to follow him, as the leader dies after a fight with a bad dino.They get to the valley, nest, have little dinos, Aladar ends up being the new leader of the pack and is married to the sister of the old leader. And, the film ends with a monologue about hoping that their existence will have some positive effect on the future. Sounds a bit like they had this terrific film but didn't quite know how to end it.I'm not totally sure how to take this film. On the one hand you have barbaric old dinosaurs who operate like a mafia boss with his sidemen, with absolutely no concern for others around them, yet they all speak with perfect modern English. As does Aladar, the lemurs, and all the other characters.  Which is fine if you are making a light comedy, but doesn't, for me, work so well with a more serious animated film like this one is. Unlike Chicken Run, A Bug's Life, Tarzan (animated), all of which I will watch periodically and enjoy, Dinosaur does not have that same compelling allure.  It is a good film, I found it totally worth watching, but there isn't much charm there to think back upon.The DVD has both DTS and Dolby surround tracks selectable. I watched several scenes in both modes, where there was a lot of sound, and in each case I found the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound to be more pleasing, fuller,slightly more aggressive, with better low bass. The picture, of course, is fabulous. The extras on the basic DVD (sells for about $20) are spartan, but the making of and the dinosar tutorial are both very interesting.
