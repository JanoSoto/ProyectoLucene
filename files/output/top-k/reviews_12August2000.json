After seeing it, however, I have considered this movie to be one of my favorites.As most people well know, the movie displays the pressure of fame and achievement in a small football-oriented town.  The coach is feared and respected by most of the community, including the town sheriff, and insists that everything is done his way alone.  If the kids do everything he says, he pats them on the back and tells them how wonderful they are.  If anyone does anything differently from what he says, he publicly badmouths and threatens them.  Throughout the movie we see the teens begin to see the coach for whom he really is.  And some of the characters who initially don't seem to have much depth --- such as Darcy and Tweeder, in my opinion --- have their serious moments to where one might have more respect for them. Throughout the storyline they learn that they don't necessarily have to follow a single set of rules in order to become successful.However, I do have some criticisms as well.  I felt that a lot of the nudity displayed wasn't necessary.  Plus, the issue of whether Darcy had actually left Lance or whatever she had decided to do was unresolved.  Also, I felt it was a major character flaw that Jules was so set against fame and football throughout most of the movie and then suddenly told Mox to step up and play the hero.  And finally, since Mox's father knew how much of a jerk the coach was, why was he as obsessed with football and winning as the rest of the town was?Having grown up in a highly populated community, I can't judge whether the town displayed in the movie is realistic compared to actual small football towns.  However, a friend of mine in a small Texas town has told me that it is similar to her town...so I'll have to take her word for that.  In any case, what I like best about this movie is how the teens work together and give it their all in order to shine for at least that period of time. Although for obvious reasons I didn't play football in high school, I can remember that same concept in other extracurricular activities I was involved in. I especially like Mox's statement, We have the rest of our lives to be mediocre, but we have the opportunity to play like gods for the next half of football.  Having been out of high school for several years now, I can still think back to the people who stood out in my high school. Of course, I remember those who were popular, but I also remember those who weren't necessarily part of the in crowd but still made a difference somehow.I would definitely recommend this movie; although the language and nudity might be somewhat offensive, there is a lot more to it than that.

Professional football players go on strike and the team brings in replacement players to finish the season. That's it. There's no subplot or tricky twists that try to make the movie more than it's out to be.

I was totally amazed with this movie. The plot itself was so intriguing, I found myself completely forgetting I had just spent $4.00 on my popcorn. This movie was directed by David Fincher, by far, the undisputed champion of film directing, in my books (other works by him Seven, The Game, both of which are absolutely brilliant pieces of work)This movie's incredible amount of compression was what really made me love it. It seems as you watch it, that you are being tossed head first into an immense amount of information, flying past you at a thousand miles per hour. And still this movie has a way of making sure you don't miss any of it. The stunning use cinematography completely envelops you. I had the most incredible urge to find David Fincher and ask him how he does this. I just hope that in my future careers in film, I can be as talented and original as him.The cast contains not only an incredibly gifted and talented actor, Edward Norton, but a fantastic performance by Brad Pitt. I truly feel that Brad Pitt is a very underrated actor, who deserves much more then the biased ratings he gets from other critics. If you don't believe me, Seven is, I believe, his best performance in film ever, and that is NOT an insult. After seeing this movie, Edward Norton continues to be one of my favorite actors (among Kevin Spacy and Jack Nicolson).Of course, I can see why others may not like this movie. It is very violent, which has never stopped me from enjoying any movie. Furthermore, it is very thought provoking, which usually scares away most simple people, but keeps me nailed to the seat.As my conclusion, I cannot say anything bad about this movie.

I had high hopes for this movie, and it had all the ingredients for a suspenseful, engaging film; good cast, good special effects, interesting idea for a plot.  Unfortunately this project was handed to the wrong people.The plot (if you could call it that) was terrible.  The characters were underdeveloped, the story never really hit on anything interesting, and nothing was explained in detail, making it really hard to get into this movie.  The parts of the movie that were supposed to evoke feelings in the audience just seemed cheap and contrived, because there was no follow up, no big payoff.  It was like a bad TV movie with expensive special effects and big name actors.Even pricey visual effects couldn't make this movie worthwhile.

Actually, that's what the movie is about Sharks hunting humans in an underwater lab. Period. Nothing less, nothing more.It has the right ingredients to let you forget about the daily routine and enjoy.And people, please stop comparing it to Jaws. The only thing they have in common is the word shark.

I saw this film when I was twelve years old.....my late grandmother took me to a BIG downtown theatre to view this film. This possibly was the first time I had ever seen a film in a BIG theater.....I was awestruck and that was even before the film started.  The lights dimmed and the movie began.....I was quickly swept back into a black and white world of how life was back in a sleepy little town in the south. I (personally) was unaware of the racial problems that our country was suffering. At that age I was only interested in playing with my friends.....so the racially charged scenes were a bit too deep to this little kid.  BUT, what got me is relating to the children on the screen.....they were JUST like me.   The mystery of Boo Radley I found throughly engaging and rather spooky.  I played Jem the rest of the summer with the girl next door playing Scout and her brother playing Dill.  We did the rolling in the tire.....and making believe that the old man down the street was Boo Radley.  We had a BALL!!!  Scout in her Halloween costume scuffling with Mr. Ewell scared the living daylights out me and finally seeing the VERY scary Boo Radley nearly put me under my seat.....until I realized how gentle he really was with Jem and Scout.  Poor Jem with a broken arm after saving his sister.....  WOW!!!  This was powerful stuff!!! Many years later when I was a junior in high school our book assignment was to read To Kill A Mockingbird.  I read it spellbound and realized what a great film my grandmother had taken me to see.  The town of Macomb sizzling on a hot Southern day with the taste of gritty sand blowing through the air. Rabid dogs, gossipy neighbors, mysteries at every turn.  By now, I was aware of the racial difficulties that our country had and NOW I could look at the movie in a different light.  The movie was MUCH more scarier than I ever realized.....I can find NO fault whatsoever with this GREAT American film.

It isn't scary as the ads would have you believe, but I'll be dammed if it isn't one of the most entertaining horror flicks I've seen in a while. In this age of computer generated, digital effects I have a hard time telling good special effects from bad (they all start to look the same after a while), but this one has a few of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen on film. I assume this is one of the most special effect-intensive movies ever attempted (aside form the latest Star Wars), and they do dazzle, so it's a shame the story doesn't quite measure up. It starts to get a little tired in the third act, but what the hell, I was entertained.Aside form Kevin Bacon, there were no real stand-out performances in Hollow Man. The invisibility serum seems to bring on severe emotional instability in animals, so Bacon's character decides to try it out on himself. Problem is, Kevin is already nuttier than squirrel turds so this is not the smartest of decisions, but he runs the project, so he calls the shots. Mayhem ensues. This is a really clever idea for a horror film, and the smart ways the scientists think of to detect Bacon in his invisible form never ceases to impress. It's nice to see technology has finally made it so that they can do just about anything you can think of in film.Paul Verhoeven is what makes this movie most attractive for me. I really love his go-for-broke, over the top directing style, and it's put to good use in this one especially. He took a step in the right direction by distancing himself from hack-supreme Joe Esterhaus in the entertaining but flawed Starship Troopers, and now he's back on his feet again. I can just picture him screaming like a madman on set, frothing at the mouth for more blood, MORE BLOOD!. He doesn't shy away from gore, violence, sex, or anything. He just jumps right in. I like that. This movie is worth about an 8\/10 stars. Worth the price of admission for the effects alone. G'night!

I would have to ask those people, WHAT FILM WERE YOU WATCHING? This film presents skinheads and their society and says this is the way it is. It does not glorify, nor does it jump on a soapbox. Not to tip anything off, but by the end of the film I don't think there are going to be too many people saying being a skinhead is a wonderful life. In fact, I think that is why the film is so good. The subject matter is not black and white, it is very gray. Skinheads exist for a reason, they do things for a reason. The reasons might sound immoral to us, but the world is made up of different types. In fact, most of the movie deals with Hando (Russel Crowe) trying very hard to hold his skinhead bunch together. However, the destructive nature of the characters is  bringing about the destruction of their lifestyle.The performances in this film are great. In particular, Daniel Pollock is great as Davey. I was very saddened to hear that he died right after this movie. He is often silent during the film, but his facial expressions are very powerful. For anyone that is interested in examining some of the darker groups that wander around this world, Romper Stomper has a very interesting one for you to look at.
