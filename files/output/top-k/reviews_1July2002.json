His character is very interesting in this one, because he's a stranger in another land (Rome).  The people he's supposed to help don't even trust him (hilarious scenes of awkwardness between Bruce and Miss Chen).  Ha Goon plays a great comic relief (CHINESE BOXING!).  Although the movie takes a dark turn, there are many moments of laughs.  I will never forget that you can't order chinese spare ribs.    For the action, Bruce dominates as he takes on a whole gang of thugs using everything from fists and kicks to darts, a pole, and of course his awesome nunchuk scene (MOMMA MIA!!).  I love the sound effects when Bruce hits his opponents and the WOOSH sound is great!!  His training scenes show that Bruce Lee had 0% body fat and is good motivation for working out.  The finale between he and Chuck is a classic kung fu moment.  Great shots before the fight including the cat too!!This is a great film.  Another example of a great martial artist.

Few Hollywood movies I have watched in recent years have been able to do this.Spider-Man has an old-fashioned type of innocence and charm that is very much lacking in most of the movies being produced today. Tobey Maguire was brilliant as Peter Parker, and accomplished the nearly impossible task of making the premise of this movie - a teenager being bitten by genetically altered spider and ultimately becoming a superhero - seem plausible. I really cared about what happened to this character. The supporting cast was excellent, and I enjoyed almost every scene in the movie.The most surprising thing about Spider-Man was that it remained highly enjoyable even after many repeated viewings. I am not a person who enjoys watching the same movie over and over again, yet somehow I ended up seeing Spider-Man a record four times with various friends.

First things first  1) I laughed so hard at parts of this movie, I was almost kicking; 2) I laughed so hard at other parts of the movie, I was almost kicking; 3) I never expected to laugh this hard at this movie; 4) You have to like physical humor.  HAVE TO.OK.  Second things second 1) If you want a really engaging character-driven plot line, go see The Big Chill; 2) If you expect a great plot, check yourself before you wreck yourself; 3) What in God's good name did you expect from this movie?  A great plot?  C'mon, get real--it's a slapstick comedy.This movie is not about a plot.  It doesn't have to be, it has Martin Lawrence in it.  Blue Streak was boring.  Bad Boys certainly had its moments.  Life (w\/ Eddie Murphy) was OK also.  Let it be known that I am not a person who will like a movie just because it has Martin Lawrence in it. That being said, Martin Lawrence was absolutely hilarious in this movie. This was a jewel of physical comedy from him.This movie is not about some ironic\/comi-tragedy that makes you laugh intellectually or smile wryly.  This was about his situation.

Although many purists have criticised certain liberties the makers have taken with the original storyline (such as Spidey's web-shooters being organic in the film, as opposed to manufactured), none have been taken unnecessarily. If any criticism can be made, it is that some of the characterisation is not as strong as it could have been. Although Tobey Maguire brings a lot to the Peter Parker character, he did seem to be playing him as Clarke Kent. Also, Aunt May is hugely one-dimensional. Okay, this is a film of a comic book, but when the characters are flatter than those that featured in the cartoon, alarm bells ring. Characterisation aside, the film as a whole has many good points. The story is competent, although some loose ends were left. The special effects have been much discussed. Whereas many were very good, there was the occasional piece of CGI stunt-work that was so clumsy (think of the TV show Andromeda) that suspension of disbelief was brought crashing down to earth on several occasions. Another problem with this was the spectacle of the film.

Maybe it'll come to me before I finish this review. Let's see, how to begin A rich, handsome, outgoing Cuban businessman(Banderas) intentionally decides to screw up his life. Why?? Blank-out. No answer. The Plan he decides that a bad marriage will be his downfall. Okay, but how does one intentionally design a marriage to be so bad as to destroy oneself financially, emotionally, spiritually.**********MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***********************Since the antihero is handsome, rich, and outgoing he could easily marry one of any number of women, most of whom would jump at the chance. Many of these theoretical matches might possibly work out. No, no...there's got to be a worse way. I know the man must marry a complete stranger found via a newspaper ad placed in a foreign country. That's it. And to lessen the probability that she is compatible with the man, the woman must arrive in the man's country no more than 3 hours before the wedding takes place. The man and woman must know nothing about one another except the lies they've exchanged with each other in establishing contact via the mail.Okay, now here's the shocker. Are you ready for this. Hold on to your seat. Despite these elaborate plans to undermine the marriage from the start, the marriage does not in fact work out and the man is destroyed financially, emotionally and spiritually. What I have just related is the precise opening premise this movie expects you swallow in order to grab your attention for the movie's remainder. If it sounds implausible to the point of imbecility, well, that is not my fault.To be fair, although this movie in no way deserves it, the woman he marries is a con artist(Jolie) who has helped kill the actual intended bride and assumed her identity. But that absolutely doesn't matter, because it may just as well have been the con artist who answered the  man's marriage ad as any other woman.I really can't discuss this movie much further...the level of irritation Original Sin caused me makes it out of the question. Let me just say that the account I've related so far is not the most implausible element in the movie. For example, let's assume for the sake of argument that you are a psychopath. Somebody tells you they love you a total of 999 times. But you are a psychopath and it has no effect. So you decide to poison the person who loves you. Hey, it's what psychopaths do. Somehow the person finds out you've poisoned their drink and they tell you. Right before the person drinks the poison they tell you for the 1000th time that they love you. They knowingly begin to drink the poison. Suddenly, the scales of psychopathology fall from your eyes and you see everything in a different light. You spring to your feet with all the good-hearted innocence that a recently cured criminally insane person can muster and try to knock the poisoned drink from their hands.Here are the crucial questions Do you find this plausible? Possible? Psychologically realistic? If so, let me state in the strongest possible terms This movie was made for you.Hey, I just had a revelation.

Maybe it'll come to me before I finish this review. Let's see, how to begin A rich, handsome, outgoing Cuban businessman(Banderas) intentionally decides to screw up his life. Why?? Blank-out. No answer. The Plan he decides that a bad marriage will be his downfall. Okay, but how does one intentionally design a marriage to be so bad as to destroy oneself financially, emotionally, spiritually.**********MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD***********************Since the antihero is handsome, rich, and outgoing he could easily marry one of any number of women, most of whom would jump at the chance. Many of these theoretical matches might possibly work out. No, no...there's got to be a worse way. I know the man must marry a complete stranger found via a newspaper ad placed in a foreign country. That's it. And to lessen the probability that she is compatible with the man, the woman must arrive in the man's country no more than 3 hours before the wedding takes place. The man and woman must know nothing about one another except the lies they've exchanged with each other in establishing contact via the mail.Okay, now here's the shocker. Are you ready for this. Hold on to your seat. Despite these elaborate plans to undermine the marriage from the start, the marriage does not in fact work out and the man is destroyed financially, emotionally and spiritually. What I have just related is the precise opening premise this movie expects you swallow in order to grab your attention for the movie's remainder. If it sounds implausible to the point of imbecility, well, that is not my fault.To be fair, although this movie in no way deserves it, the woman he marries is a con artist(Jolie) who has helped kill the actual intended bride and assumed her identity. But that absolutely doesn't matter, because it may just as well have been the con artist who answered the  man's marriage ad as any other woman.I really can't discuss this movie much further...the level of irritation Original Sin caused me makes it out of the question. Let me just say that the account I've related so far is not the most implausible element in the movie. For example, let's assume for the sake of argument that you are a psychopath. Somebody tells you they love you a total of 999 times. But you are a psychopath and it has no effect. So you decide to poison the person who loves you. Hey, it's what psychopaths do. Somehow the person finds out you've poisoned their drink and they tell you. Right before the person drinks the poison they tell you for the 1000th time that they love you. They knowingly begin to drink the poison. Suddenly, the scales of psychopathology fall from your eyes and you see everything in a different light. You spring to your feet with all the good-hearted innocence that a recently cured criminally insane person can muster and try to knock the poisoned drink from their hands.Here are the crucial questions Do you find this plausible? Possible? Psychologically realistic? If so, let me state in the strongest possible terms This movie was made for you.Hey, I just had a revelation.

Jean Reno is making his mark as Hollywood's token-frenchy. Casting him as a Russian is a complete joke. HE overacts so much, he looks like he's auditioning to replace Captain Kirk... Chris Klein is sadly miscast; the part was made for a James Caan tough looking s.o.b., not for some 19 y.o. teen magazine front page model. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is cute, a real nice woman, but her accent sounds ridiculous and phony. I can hear the casting meeting hey, who do we pick for the babe? Hummm... What's the name of the babe who showed her b***s in X-Men? Yeah, get her! Call her agent!!Now the direction... This is a shame. I am no armchair director but the direction sucked. McTiernan can make great movies, he really can, but everything sucks in this flick. I had to rewind 20 times to understand the action scenes. The camera work is jerky, the editing is painfully fast.The script... What script? How can grown-ups come up with such a load of crap? The story looks straight out of a 15 y.o. undersexed mind. Hey, let's give them nice cars! Hey, why not have them street luge? Let's show the girl's boobs! The character's motivations make no sense... The chin strap part is hilarious in itself.Set-design and costumes... Shamefully unrealistic. This movie makes the XFL look intelligent. The track set is so visually confusing that i could not follow the action at all. The costumes are a perfect demonstration of what happens when a designer is set loose. The helmets are accidents waiting to happen. Trust me, if i was playing Rollerball, i'd wear a helmet that actually protects me, not one that increases the risk of injury.This movie is an example of what happens when the producers don't follow a production. Of course the direction sucked, but it seems obvious to me that the whole production got out of control. It's like nobody checked what the various departments were doing...The only reason this movie is not worse than Battlefield Earth is the basis of the story line.

I don't recommend seeing this for the first time alone unless you are really into scary movies and think you can handle anything. I was surprised this movie was good because I am not a fan of Stephen King movies.  From the opening credits this movie will send you chills. Whoever did the music in this movie did a wonderful job. And the direction is great, too. As you may know, the movie focuses on the Creed family as they settle into their new home in Maine. The town has a deadly secret hidden in the woods called the Pet Sematary (misspelled by children), which sits on the outskirts of an Indian burial ground. When Gage, the Creeds' toddler son, is killed on the road by a semi, things begin to fall apart and they only get worse. The death of young Gage is pretty shocking. If you read the novel then you know what's coming, but it's still a horrific thing. One thing leads to another and Gage is buried on the Indian burial ground in hopes that its powers will bring him back like it did Church, the family cat. But things never go right in a Stephen King movie, and when Gage rises from the grave he's a little different and a tad bit psychotic. The child who plays Gage is stunning. Resurrected Gage is one of the most terrifying images in horror I've ever seen. Forget Freddy, this kid walks around in funeral clothes toting a scalpel from a medical kit with a sinister grin...it's terrifying. Many critics overlooked this movie and gave it bad reviews and I cannot understand why. It's plenty scary. Sure, it doesn't lift your spirits and isn't what I'd call a fun movie, but it is above all very frightening, so what's the problem? It seems the critics don't know jack about horror. They hate the good efforts, which we fans of the genre can recognize, and they love the duds, like Halloween H20 and Scream 2. This is one of the best horror movies the '80s ever shot out. Remember this was the time of the Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th sequel nightmare. This must have been a breath of fresh air. There are several things wrong with this movie, but it's just about logic and is a little picky. For one, the characters are fine but somewhat idiots. Jud, the neighbor, knows what happens when you bury something in the Pet Sematary, then he goes and tells the father to bury his daughter's cat there. Once he's introduced to the power, he of course buries his son. Then his son comes back a lunatic and he goes and buries his wife there! Did the fact that his son was a maniac killer not tell him that the things buried there don't come back as they were? Plus, young Gage must have extraordinary powers because he somehow manages to get his mom hanging by a rope from the attic and knows how to shut himself in and use the phone by himself. He's a toddler! But all that stuff aside, this movie is the creepiest film in years and if you have any interest in horror you should see it. Don't watch the late '90s crap, this is the real stuff. Just don't blame me for your nightmares. I warned you. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 July 2002","score":"","review":"  This is one freaky flick. No matter how many horror movies you've seen, this movie proves that you are not immune to scares. I don't recommend seeing this for the first time alone unless you are really into scary movies and think you can handle anything. I was surprised this movie was good because I am not a fan of Stephen King movies.  From the opening credits this movie will send you chills. Whoever did the music in this movie did a wonderful job. And the direction is great, too. As you may know, the movie focuses on the Creed family as they settle into their new home in Maine. The town has a deadly secret hidden in the woods called the Pet Sematary (misspelled by children), which sits on the outskirts of an Indian burial ground. When Gage, the Creeds' toddler son, is killed on the road by a semi, things begin to fall apart and they only get worse. The death of young Gage is pretty shocking. If you read the novel then you know what's coming, but it's still a horrific thing. One thing leads to another and Gage is buried on the Indian burial ground in hopes that its powers will bring him back like it did Church, the family cat. But things never go right in a Stephen King movie, and when Gage rises from the grave he's a little different and a tad bit psychotic. The child who plays Gage is stunning. Resurrected Gage is one of the most terrifying images in horror I've ever seen. Forget Freddy, this kid walks around in funeral clothes toting a scalpel from a medical kit with a sinister grin...it's terrifying. Many critics overlooked this movie and gave it bad reviews and I cannot understand why. It's plenty scary. Sure, it doesn't lift your spirits and isn't what I'd call a fun movie, but it is above all very frightening, so what's the problem? It seems the critics don't know jack about horror. They hate the good efforts, which we fans of the genre can recognize, and they love the duds, like Halloween H20 and Scream 2. This is one of the best horror movies the '80s ever shot out. Remember this was the time of the Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th sequel nightmare. This must have been a breath of fresh air. There are several things wrong with this movie, but it's just about logic and is a little picky. For one, the characters are fine but somewhat idiots. Jud, the neighbor, knows what happens when you bury something in the Pet Sematary, then he goes and tells the father to bury his daughter's cat there. Once he's introduced to the power, he of course buries his son. Then his son comes back a lunatic and he goes and buries his wife there!

When I first saw the trailer for this film, I rolled my eyes, not hearing the part about it being a true story or that Ron Howard, one of the best directors of this or any generation, had directed and produced it. It was especially the title that made me think it wouldn't be very successful. I mean, A Beautiful Mind? Come ON.Well, I first started realizing I was wrong when I heard it was big at the box office, and then when I heard it had won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. But by the night of the Oscars, I was my skeptical self again. I wanted Ron Howard to win Best Director, and I didn't care if it won Best Picture, but no matter what, I did NOT want Russell Crowe to win Best Actor. I'm not sure why, but it's probably because I'm not crazy about him, since I heard what he did to the person who cut his speech short. And he didn't win.Finally, a few nights ago, I decided to see this Best-Pic winner that critics were calling moving and powerful, so I rented it--and was taken aback. I was shocked. I couldn't believe I had ever doubted this movie before I saw it. First, I'll get over with saying what's NOT good about it It does feel full of itself, if you know what I mean. Now for what IS good The makeup--they had to make the actors look older, and did a nice job. The musical score--at times it could be annoying, but most of the time I liked the mysterious music that set the tone of a somewhat mysterious film. The acting--need I say more? I admit Russell Crowe gave one of the best performances of his career, and although his accent slipped more than once, I believed him. And Ed Harris was a good addition to the cast--(MAJOR SPOILER)he seemed like a good guy, but got freakier as you realize he's not real. But the true standout performance, according to the Academy and me, was not Russell, not Ed, not even Christopher Plummer as the doctor who diagnoses John Nash with schizophrenia, but Jennifer Connelly. She's a beautiful and very powerful actress, and really made a name for herself with A Beautiful Mind--not just by winning the Oscar, but simply by playing Alicia Nash. I believed every second of her performance (except maybe the whole bathroom mirror scene; that looked a little phony), and although most probably didn't buy the this is real line, I did, and I'm not sensitive when it comes to movies. The only type of person who WOULDN'T enjoy A Beautiful Mind would probably be the type that doesn't appreciate a touching, believable drama with excellent directing and wonderful acting...and there are a few goofs to look for, so nit-pickers like me might enjoy hunting for them.
