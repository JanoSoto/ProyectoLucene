It has heart, it has true emotion and the people behind the scenes do as much as they can to not only draw you in to the scene, but also bring you closer to the characters involved. It's a mysterious movie, constantly unravelling before your eyes and you end up by the end having a lovely after taste, if movies can give you one that is. I mean it doesn't have the best start in movies but over time progresses to a level any film maker or producer would be proud of, it's timing is done to perfection and the plot just keeps you guessing. It's written beautifully as well and the script is just one of the highlights done by director including writer of the movie Phil Alden Robinson who seems to not only have an eye to get the most emotion out of an adapted book, but also the heart.Kevin Costner is the captain of the ship that is the movie and he steadies it well, he isn't perfect by any stretch but is far far away from being poor, a good show all round from him. I really liked James Earl Jones who has some of the best lines and also best scenes, him and Costner work beautifully together and you truly feel for his character and what he feels and whatever he chooses to do next.The extra cast include people such as Ray Liotta who is calm and well done here, Amy Madigan who although a little over the top at times is still pretty good as Costner's wife Annie. One actor In the movie who deserves great respect is Burt Lancaster, already very ill and unable to act at times to his full potential, he still manages to bring a little charm and even a slight bit of magic to an already talented cast.I loved the dedication and production that went into this, things like the camera work do really well and the score is hauntingly terrific with an Oscar nomination that went James Horner's way. I loved the setting of Iowa, long open spaces and it made the film able to describe it as nothing people would want to see but yet again the true magic of the movie kicks in and you find yourself backing Costner to sort out the troubles he has just for the baseball field.Back to Phil Alden Robinson and he just knows how to direct here, with lovely precision and skill he seems to make a kind of bland sounding plot come alive really well and is truly a credit to all of these kind of emotional roller-coaster films we see. Overall I just felt this was Just about very good and although not quite nearing absolute greatness, is still a cult classic and one film I will remember back to for a long time. This truly is one film you can enjoy with all the ages whether 5 or 85, the sweet plot and the warmth of the characters can even make the most hardened of movie watchers just feel an ounce of happy tears. Yes who knew looking at this straightforward plot it would bring such success and happiness to many, well you make a film like this, and they will come.

But at the same time, I found many things about this movie that I liked. Texas Rangers is a well made movie on the whole, it's not really that good as far as actual history is concerned, it's still a good movie nevertheless. Normally, I tend to be kind of uneasy with certain movies that tend to get the facts wrong, but this movie was an exception. Sure, there is little in this movie that pertains to history, but all the same, there is still much to recommend about the movie. The performances are committed, the scenery and cinematography are beautiful, and the script is will written. Texas Rangers may not be a masterpiece of the Western genre, but as a movie on the whole scale, it works, it works very well. The critics were wrong when they panned this movie, it's not a bad movie. It's not an excellent movie, but it's not bad, and is surely worth a viewing, or two.The cast gives well committed performances. Dylan McDermott gives the best performance in the movie in my opinion. He steals the show just about anytime that he is on screen. James Van Der Beek also does good in his role. I was kind of worried by Usher Raymond, because from everything that I had heard about this acting, he's not that good. However, he did surprisingly well in this movie. Alfred Molina is menacing in his role as John King Fisher, the main antagonist of the movie. Everyone seemed committed to their roles, they didn't overact or underact. The only problem that I really had besides the inaccuracies would be with Steve Miner's directing. He did a good job, but in some of the most exciting scenes, he kind of had the camera in the wrong spots. But in the climax of the movie however, he doesn't miss, he hits the target right in the middle, so he more than makes up for his earlier mistakes.In short, Texas Rangers may not be one of the greatest movies of the Western film genre, but it certainly is not all of the grief that most of the critics gave it. Although you may be turned off by some of the historical inaccuracies, the movie makes up for it with some things that you would expect to see in a Western movie. What I mean by that is, this movie has got action, gunfights, excitement, and much more. So if you want action and excitement, you'll get it if you watch this movie. However, all of the action in this film is relevant to the plot, it's not mindless and meaningless. Well anyway, if you want to see a good Western, then ignore all of the negative things that you may have heard about this movie and see it for yourself, as it's actually a good movie, and you won't be disappointed if you watch it.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A ragtag group of youngsters band together after the American Civil War to form the Texas Rangers, a group charged with the dangerous, ruthless duty of cleaning up the West.Before I begin to get criticized for liking this movie, I will say that I am aware that this movie bares little resemblance to actual history.

It comes at the halfway point in this densely layered, fully character driven, dark comedy-drama. She goes on, ...like you're not connected to anything or anyone? And that is the main question, what are these people connected to?Hard to believe this film is 17 years old, I've watched it a dozen times over the years and, like a good novel, pick something up every time. I recall the first time I watched it, I had a strange sense of awkwardness and unease, much like how the shy Iris must feel a lot of the time. It has a low key humor about it, but it is really quite dark. Iris stumbles into a group friendship at work that finally makes her feel less awkward and belonging to something that matters. All four of the ladies have their issues, mostly in some form of denial of reality. To me, the healthiest one of the bunch is Parker Posey's character, Margaret. Posey does one of her best roles ever playing a spunky, irascible but ultimately hollow young woman who is floating through life, much to the disappointment of her parents. Margaret gets it, though. She knows the score, with the BS the company puts out and even the things her friends try to hide. She has a fearlessness about her. As all good things must end, the closeness and bonding come to an end when a strange, shy almost Iris-like character from another dimension comes into the firm, Cleo. Cleo is a disturbed woman who makes up for her shortcomings but shortchanging others, in this case by targeted stealing that makes it seem as if the four temps-Cleo is permanent-are the ones stealing. It works, the four are suspected and gradually put into more and more demeaning work situations. At one point, even Iris thinks that Margaret is the one stealing. The dramatic scene of Margaret being walked out is painful, especially when it's revealed for certain it's not her, but true to her fearlessness, she does not go out without a fight. Iris finds out that it's Cleo just like Margaret suspected from the start and seeks a restitution that also winds up transforming her.Just like the characters had a special moment in time that could never come again, so to did these actors. Collette was just a few years in America having been successful in her native Australia. Posey was making a name for herself as the quirky indie film girl.

However, I don't think the movie explores any of that properly, despite providing an ideal launching pad for doing so.This is a gimmick movie that wants to ask its audience whether or not they would cheat on their partner with Robert Redford for a cool million bucks?

However, I don't think the movie explores any of that properly, despite providing an ideal launching pad for doing so.This is a gimmick movie that wants to ask its audience whether or not they would cheat on their partner with Robert Redford for a cool million bucks? (or Sharon Stone perhaps, to use an equivalent mid 90's sex symbol that would flip the issue... ) When you cast such sexual icons though, it immediately weakens the dilemma that's in play... It's relatively easy to assent to a Robert Redford or a Sharon Stone, because they represent a fantasy - and the film refuses to relinquish the notion of that fantasy for the duration of its entire running time. This has the effect of making it hard to play make-believe, when it comes to embracing the idea that serious ethical considerations are underfoot... Like the lucky coin in the movie, it's indicative of an already-done deal.I feel that, in terms of the story, as much moral importance should have been placed upon the DECISION itself, besides the rendering of its consequences being employed for sentimental manipulation.The route that the makers elected to take means that the project ends up playing out like a glossy, cheesy movie of the week, populated with several big names who were somehow unwittingly roped in... That's what some people like, I suppose, but in my opinion it seriously defaults on the complications that the initial premise should throw up... As I said, not completely without entertainment value, but only if you treat it as exploitative trash.

The latest is nothing less than a masterpiece in my opinion, a strong parable about the relation between dictatorship and art, between power and the artist, and a meditation about the human character and the tearing dilemma of the artist who has to chose between being silent and being silenced. What few people knew at the time the film was released was that in 'Mephisto' Szabo had spoken about his own life and choices.I somehow failed to see until now 'Sunshine' which is a not less ambitious endeavor describing in a big epic film the story of one Jewish Hungarian family which is symbolic for much of the history of the Hungarian Jews in the 20th century.They do not do such films any longer, some may say. 'Sunshine' is a saga spread over three generations of the Sonnenshein \/ Sors family - a family of Jewish origin whose story is followed since the last two decades of the Austro-Hungarian empire through the First World War, the Communist revolution of 1919, the inter-wars period, the horrors of the Second World War and of the Holocaust, the Communist terror that followed. The tradition of such stories is actually not rooted in Hollywood but rather in the solid novel sagas of writers like Thomas Mann or John Galsworthy. The main theme is the fate of the Jewish family trying to find its identity first in the relatively liberal Austro-Hungarian empire, the tentative to melt its identity by 'assimilation' and conversion, followed by the cruel return to reality during the Holocaust, and the temporary illusion of salvation by adopting the principles of the internationalist Communism.The 16 years that passed since the film was released make the demonstration of the futility of the identity hiding games played by Jews in Europe in general and Hungary in particular look somehow didactic on screen (but not in reality, as recent events show). Istvan Szabo had the bright idea of distributing Ralph Fiennes in the triple role of the three men in the three generations of the Sonnenschein \/ Sors family. Fiennes is a fine actor and this was one of his best roles, but the real strong and persistent character is the one of Valerie - wife, mother, and grandmother and more than all the survivor and the strong character that represents the moral and tradition compass of the whole family during the succeeding storms of the century. Two actresses - Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris play this role at different ages. They are both wonderful.

Fine acting by Antonio Banderas as Art Dodge , a roguish Miami art dealer and his twin brother Dart , as he pretends to be his own brother in order to pursue his new fiancée . Sympathetic acting by Melanie Griffith as Betty Kerner who thinks he'll make a virile third husband . In the film, Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith leave each other at the wedding altar for other people . However, in real life, the two actors fell in love during filming of this movie in 1995 and married a year later and soon became parents to their daughter Stella. Very good support cast formed by prestigious veterans such as Austin Pendleton , Allan Rich , Vincent Schiavelli , Phil Leeds , Sid Raymond and special mention to the great Elli Wallach who recently passed away . Furthermore , some known Spanish secondaries such as Gabino Diego and Santiago Segura . Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Panavision by Jose Luis Alcaine , one of the best Spanish cameramen , including gorgeous exteriors filmed on location in Miami . Jolly as well as lively musical score by Michael Camilo in Cuban style . This simple , attractive and delightful motion picture was well directed by Oscar-winning director Fernando Trueba , as the flick is entertaining and well worth your time . His first success was Ópera Prima (1980) following the style of the Madrid comedy. Trueba had major success with Sé Infiel y No mires Quién (1985) also known as  Be Wanton and Tread No Shame , starting a longer collaboration with the producer Andrés Vicente Gómez .

WW1 is the setting for this unusual look at life for German troops on the front line. Its unusual because its a 30's American film focusing on German soldiers and not the more obvious Allies of Britain, France and Russia.Starting off much like 'Full Metal Jacket' the film covers a group (a class fresh out of school) of young German lads ready to join the ranks and fight for their country. From here on we follow them through harsh training and into battle where they very quickly realise the horrors of war. One by one they are killed off as the film becomes more and more tragic, and all this in a 1930's film!The first thing that hits you are the amazing visuals and hard work clearly put into the film, its incredible! The realism of the trenches, war torn no man's land, the uniforms for both sides and the brilliant special effects, mainly revolving around some pretty big explosions near actors, are all superbly created. By today's standards everything still looks good whilst the old black and white imagery only helps the film appear more realistic and authentic. The film could easily be the 'Saving Private Ryan' of its day, its almost as good as real footage.Of course the actors are of a different era so one can expect performances without the type of grit that we are used to today. Some scenes are almost slightly pantomime-esque with some slightly funny moments of comedy and slapstick which do lighten the mood (mainly at the start before the characters enter the war). I think we all know sequences of corny acting and dialog tend to add to the charm of old movies like this, they are easily forgiven.Make no mistake though this film is a history lesson and seeing as it was made about 12 years after WW1 actually ended its amazing people watched! especially as it followed the Central Powers (the enemy). Being so close to the war is obviously why its so accurate. The harrowing sequences of men being mown down by machine gun fire, one after another without a chance, the screams of the young troops as they go crazy from the constant shelling, the mud, barren landscapes, bodies, barbwire and of course the famous bleak depressing ending for the main lead nailing home how cheap life was.I think the main point in the film is how the lead protagonist Paul Baumer (like his friends) starts out as a patriotic young German wanting to go off and fight for his country. Encouraged, motivated and inspired by his surroundings whilst being practically lied to by his school teacher Professor Kantorek into doing what is thought to be right, to save the Fatherland. Baumer then returns to his home town towards the end of the film only to find his school teacher spouting the same nonsense to more young boys, trying to get them to join up and fight. He is invited in to speak of the glory of war but instead rages how its all lies and there is nothing but misery and death for all who join up. He is shunned by his old teacher and branded a coward by the young boys, so he returns to the front line. Not long after this the film ends with his pointless needless death. A strong message which we all know of now, yet at the time people just didn't understand or realise, war was glorious and made men of the young.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Based on a novel and probably one of the most realistic war films I have ever see.

However they need American expertise to assess Discovery. Also the orbit of Discovery is deteriorating and the Americans can't get there in time. A joint American-Soviet expedition is sent to Jupiter to investigate the mysterious failed mission.

They discover something on the moon Europa but they are blocked from exploring it.This is a continuation of the story rather than getting back to the amazing artistic originality of 2001. Without anything ground-breaking, this movie suffers from being too slow. The original 2001 was also dismissed for being too slow by some critics but its artistic marks were never in doubt. The effects and the style in 2010 never leaves the audience in awe. There isn't enough whiz bang and the times have moved on anyways. The story is fine in the Arthur C. Clarke novel but filmmaker Peter Hyams fails to inject excitement into the movie. As is the case sometimes, I am amazed to find Helen Mirren in this movie. Of course, she wasn't a big star back then and there's no reason I would know who she was when I first saw this almost 30 years ago.

There's no action, no real sense of an external threat (surprising considering the setting) only a few not too interesting squabbles between the partisans.This however changes pretty much when the weather changes. As the snow begins to fall there is a new urgency to the film. Nationalist troops show up and the squabbles take on a darker edge with a real sense of menace. There is a truly superb performance from the drunkard which deserved an Oscar. Then Pilar (well played too) recounts his past history and we see him in a more sympathetic light.

I think the earliest Pryor movies I remember seeing were double acts with Gene Wilder such as 'Stir Crazy'. As for Candy I believe I first saw him in 'National Lampoon's Vacation'. I remember this being a regular flick on TV back in the day, always on in the afternoon or early evening, easy going, fun for all but also very easily lost under the radar. Believe it or not but this story is actually based on a novel from 1902 and there have been many film adaptations (as well as theatre productions). The funny thing is these older films don't have quite the same impact, for example...the 1945 version sees Brewster having to spend a mere 1 million Dollars in 60 days or less to inherit 7 million (slight alteration from the original novel which has a full year to spend the 1 million). Now that feat would probably be relatively doable these days.The plot has always been one of much debate though it must be said. A rich old relation leaves Monty Brewster (Pryor) a tough decision in his will, he can either take 1 million Dollars no questions asked right away or he can take the challenge. The challenge being he has 30 days to spend 30 million Dollars and not have any assets (that he doesn't already own) at the end of it. Further to that he must receive value for services of anyone he hires, he cannot buy something expensive and just destroy it and he can't just give stuff away as gifts. He can only donate 5% to charity and gamble 5% away, plus he cannot tell anyone of the challenge. If he manages to do this by the 30 day limit he will inherit 300 million Dollars, if he fails he gets nothing, not even the 1 million.Now this has to be a real nail biter of a decision and one that is sure to draw discussion after you've seen it. Its like that age old question...what would you do if you won a vast amount on the lottery? Personally I'd be more inclined to take the 1 million and run because surely in this day and age (or even back then) it would be impossible to spend 1 million per day for 30 days. The fact you cannot own anything by the deadline is not only painful but just impractical. The main reason being if you had that kind of money the first things most folk would buy would probably be property, cars and gifts...all of which you can't do with this challenge. If you really really think about it, it would be incredibly hard to do. But of course the lure is the 300 million, money to literately burn, but failure results in zilch.A great concept for sure with added imagination and teamed up with some stellar 80's casting. This movie really can't go wrong, what better way to produce good comedic scenarios than having an everyday bum needing to spend spend spend on whatever he likes. The film practically writes itself, you know what to expect when you read about it and having the crazy unpredictable force of Richard Pryor in the lead is a surefire winner. Sure enough its enormous fun watching Pryor go from zero to hero with his fortune. He walks around New York like he owns the city, he's hiring people left and right on exorbitant salaries for menial tasks, he's allowing people to pitch wacky preposterous inventions and ideas to him for funding, making bad bets, throwing big bashes, running a protest campaign in the local elections for Mayor which would cost tonnes of money etc...The sequence where he buys a rare stamp (the Inverted Jenny) and then posts it is actually very clever indeed, I would have never thought to do that. Although I'm not sure if a stamp that's just over 70 years of age (in 1985) would be usable for actual postage, I could be wrong. Another clever idea (although part of the plot) was hosting an exhibition game between the local baseball team Brewster plays for and the Yankees, again I wouldn't of thought of that.Whilst watching questions do pop up in my little brain though. Even if he didn't manage to complete the challenge wouldn't he be able to stash amounts he earned through whatever venture in a bank account somewhere for later. If its not part of the 30 million I'm sure you could hide earnings, especially bet winnings or stocks and shares earnings. The other thing that hit me was his electoral campaign for Mayor which he was winning hands down, if he lost the challenge he could easily of kept that job. I don't think the company that was in charge of the challenge could take that away from him. Really I'm sure there could be ways of staying rich even if you did lose the challenge.I wouldn't really say I'm nitpicking but simply putting more thought into what I would have done if it was me, just like the lottery question. This is just one of those happy-go-lucky 80's productions that was extremely light-hearted and warm. As I said anyone can enjoy this with the ever dependable Candy in full flow with his funny fat faced expressions and mannerisms. Pryor shows he could do lovable easy comedy roles just as well as more edgy adult orientated ones and of course look out for an early Rick Moranis role. Not forgetting the great range of character actors and familiar faces supporting the main leads. A near perfect old classic underrated comedy with a fun story, fun performances and a happy ending.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2015","score":"","review":" This was one of those early movies that kinda popped outta nowhere (for me).

Not to mention the seemingly insane Judge, his hatred for bankers, and his insufferable family.....Maybe it was my age when I first saw this at the cinema (14), or maybe it was due to fact that I saw the dreadful Soapdish just before it, but I always find time for this film, and its a perfect, silly film to watch every now and again.I'm not saying its a brilliant film, it's far from it, and Ackroyd's directing leaves a lot to be desired, but when you have a reliable cast like Chase, Candy, and the aforementioned Ackroyd doing what they do best, in a bonkers film, you can't help but love it.There is a little bit of a story to the whole silly thing, The judge hates bankers because a long time ago a deal was made and ruined the town of Valkenvania, but Ackroyd doesn't know what to do with the narrative, so a fun-house was created to fill in the cracks of the weak plot.But the town of Valkenvania, and the judges house, are just wonderful, and look like they were created by someone who likes a touch of alcohol. One liners are cringe-worthy, but coming from Chase, they sort of work, and Moore is just hilariously bad.Add Candy in drag, and a couple of what could only be described as blobs into the mix, and you have one of the most random movies to come out of the nineties.I like it, I can't think for the life of me why, but I always enjoy watching it.
