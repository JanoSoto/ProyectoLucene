I think what really helps when looking at Batman Forever is how you look at the movie- 1. If you look at it as a continuation of the previous noir offerings, it lacks... 2. Compare it to the seriousness of Christopher Nolan's entries, it comes across as shallow and tacky... 3. However, look at it as a partner piece to the gloriously camp and fun TV series and it comes across as a fun and enjoyable movie! Robin's Holey Rusted Metal Batman! is a classic in movie quotes!The multicoloured palette of colour on show in Joel Schumacher's Gotham is a welcome departure from the greys of the original and give the film an energy and panache which really benefits the story. Helped by the garish green of the Riddler, and the carnival feeling to many of the scenes, this is one of the film's main strengths. Undoubtedly, Kilmer's performance shows just what an underrated actor he is- after Michael Keaton was overshadowed by his foes, Kilmer brings Batman back to the forefront of the films as he should be. Similarly, Carrey epitomises The Riddler in all his gleeful maniacal persona however the real weakness of the film is Tommy Lee Jones' character of Two-Face. Whilst Carrey benefits from a real set-up and character beginning, Two-Face is rushed out in an aside. Notice that in the VG Batman Arkham Asylum, whilst Joker is the chief catalyst Riddler is seen but not heard. Reason being, two larger than life characters (Two Face and Riddler) inevitable clash and one has to come across as weaker. Some have criticised Nicole Kidman as the love interest, and this is quite a thankless role- Drew Barrymore's Sugar is a lot more memorable. I think in hindsight, Kidman's strengths have been shown so much in films such as Dogville and Birth that it's a surprise seeing her in such a sketchy role, but she acquits herself well! Similarly, Chris O'Donnell as Robin could have come across as just another teen angst on screen but with a well executed back story and some surprising martial arts moves, he adds another welcome dimension to the film.To sum up, Batman and Batman Returns may be more beloved however don't discount Forever as just another Godfather 3 because there's a lot more to it than that!

It seems one of the kids (Patricia Arquette) has a special power that can pull other people into her dreams and this here might be the one way to destroy the burned maniac. Wes Craven, Bruce Wagner, Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell are all credited with the screenplay, although there's quite a bit of debate on how much of the Craven\/Wagner story was kept here. Apparently the film suffered some production issues with the various story lines but that really doesn't show because of the story we do get, which is without question smart and certain stays clear from the dumb slasher clichés that was eating up horror films around this period. I do think there are times when the film is too smart for its own good but you have to give a horror film credit when it tries to deliver something than your typical run-of-the-mill tricks. The idea of mixing suicide, depression and other issues into the mix of Freddy was a good idea and it adds a few layers of drama to the film. It also doesn't hurt matters that we get some pretty good performances with Arquette doing the best work but we also have Jennifer Ruben, Rodney Eastman and Craig Wasson turning in good work. It's always fun seeing the young Laurence Fishburn and of course there's Langenkamp returning to the role of Nancy. Another good aspect is that John Saxon also returns and it's always nice seeing him show up. Englund is once again back as Freddy and there's no doubt that he's very comfortable in the role by now. He does a very good job bringing the character to life and this of course is where his joking started but it never crosses the line of being too silly. The make up work on Freddy is much better here than in the previous film and the rest of the effects dealing with his burned body are quite good. The murders are all pretty creative in their own right and most of the effects work except for a rather silly skeleton Freddy that comes up at the end. Russell's direction fits the material quite nicely and there's an overall fantasy-like atmosphere that works well. I wouldn't call this the greatest horror sequel of the decade but you have to respect what it was going for and especially since it did manage to pull most of it off.

Someone Freddy (Robert Englund) is invading the lives of her and her friends and soon she realizes it's because he's entering through the dreams of her unborn child. The pop icon known as Freddy Krueger was on a very high level with all the appearances on MTV and various other shows but this film is a major dud and a pretty big failure all around. Granted, Hopkins wasn't given much time to make it and while the visual style is just fine you do have to wonder how anyone gave the green light to the screenplay. I found the story to be incredibly stupid from start to finish with Freddy yet again returning without any good reason as to why and how. I do respect this series for trying to connect all the films together and to have characters returning but sometimes I think it hurt certain films and that's the case here. Wilcox is very good in her role of Alice but she's surrounded by some poorly written characters. Again we have to sit through characters we really don't care about and in the end we really don't care if Freddy gets them or not. To make matters even worse is that Freddy himself is pretty boring here. I really, really hated the make up job here as it seems like they've got him ready to appear on television and trying to make him look clean and decent. The entire mask looks fake and not a bit scary. The lame jokes are even worse here than they were in the previous film. I also didn't care too much for the murders as it seems they attempted to make them look cool rather than scary. The comic book death is a silly one as is the scene with Freddy feeding his victim to death. Director Hopkins at least makes the film look very profession and makes it appear as if they spent quite a bit of money on it. The scene with Freddy's mother inside the asylum with the maniacs was well-done and certainly the highlight of the movie. In the end it's the poor screenplay and Freddy's venture into MTV-land that really costs this movie.

This time out the people involved with the making of the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET are starting to experience strange dreams. Wes Craven appears ready to join the series again and has started writing a script but star Heather Langenkamp begins to fear that some type of Freddy is actually after all of them. This isn't the first film to deal with a horror director being haunted by his creation as Lucio Fulci did this type of thing with CAT IN THE BRAIN but there's world of difference between the two films. This one here is an incredibly smart and extremely intense venture into ones fears and how like can sometimes imitate art. It's sad to think that this film will soon be twenty years old and yet it's still never gotten the credit that it deserves. As a behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood the film works extremely well but it also works as a straight horror film. I think Craven's screenplay is so well written that we never have trouble believing what's going on. It's a pretty interesting idea to have those making movies become haunting by the fake thing they created. Not only do we get Craven and Langenkamp but we also have New Line head-man Robert Shaye and Freddy himself Robert Englund being haunted by the fake monster. Everyone acts themselves very well with Langenkamp turning in her third venture in the series and without question her best performance. She handles everything extremely well and comes off very good as the concerned mother who must eventually take on Freddy to protect her son. Englund has a lot of fun in the parts of himself but he really goes all out when it's time to play Freddy. A few other cast members from the first film make brief appearances here but John Saxon gets a very good role and does a great job with it. It's always great seeing him in anything. I think the greatest thing the movie does is get Freddy away from the one-liners and jokes and returns him to the scares of the original film. The entire look of Freddy's face, glove and clothes were changed here and I think they were all done for the better. The bulked up creation is a lot creepier here and he's able to be that menace of terror once again. Craven's direction is top-notch from start to finish with some of his best work appearing in some very disturbing scenes. One involves a freeway sequence and another is a re-enactment of one of the death scenes from the original movie. The film depends a lot on real life emotions and these work extremely well and add to the drama of what the characters are going through. It's a real shame that this film isn't given more credit as it did come before SCREAM and really was the first of the decade to go for that smart horror film.

The entire look of Freddy's face, glove and clothes were changed here and I think they were all done for the better. The bulked up creation is a lot creepier here and he's able to be that menace of terror once again. Craven's direction is top-notch from start to finish with some of his best work appearing in some very disturbing scenes. One involves a freeway sequence and another is a re-enactment of one of the death scenes from the original movie. The film depends a lot on real life emotions and these work extremely well and add to the drama of what the characters are going through. It's a real shame that this film isn't given more credit as it did come before SCREAM and really was the first of the decade to go for that smart horror film.

Armageddon came out to battle The Negotiator for the top blockbuster hit. It's clear to me that Armageddon takes the cake but The Negotiator shouldn't be forgotten being slightly inferior.While The Negotiator wasn't filled with dazzling special and visual effects and didn't have the end of the world premise, it still delivers a high level action packed film with thrills and chills that place you on the end of your seat.Immediately opening up with Samuel L. Jackson as Danny Roman negotiating with a hostage taker, we get a glimpse into the world of chaos and evil doings. After the words, I'm not going to jail are said, this movie goes round for round to keep your heart pumping faster and faster. You'll get chills and glue your eyes to the screen.It's really a weird character, Danny Roman, as he's a protagonist but he's being viewed as the hostage taker throughout 75% of the film and thus he's also the main antagonist. Jackson's opposite in the film, Kevin Spacey really shines more so than anyone, I believe. Spacey plays Chris Sabian and he's edgy but still has a comedic relief in the film.It's an educational film on a couple levels of how a hostage takeover is handled and a bunch of little extra things to learn too. Aside from the main actors of Jackson and Spacey, I really enjoyed David Morse as Commander Beck and Michael Cudlitz as Palermo. Michael really shines in his supporting role as the caring sniper who can't be against a colleague like Danny while Morse really plays the guy that we love to hate just because he's such a jerk.It's got a lot of action for being such a claustrophobic film and mainly having two sets. Spacey really shines the most because, while Jackson is seen nearly 95% of the film, Spacey doesn't appear until almost halfway through the film giving him only maybe an hour of screen time. Supporting cast really help make the leads all the better.Hardly any special effects, but what is seen is top-notch and the rest of the visual effects used are decent. Violence and profanity is kept to a minimum and it's really a dialogue oriented film. Spacey and Jackson on screen is something to behold and without these actors at each other throats, I don't think the film would be such a huge success. The Negotiator marks the moment of when I as a kid began to love Kevin Spacey's work.

If this isn't the best comedy of the decade, that's because it's the best comedy of all time.The plot seems rudimentary two stoners wake up with no memory, and can't find their car. They have a Who's on first dialogue about their car, then they go about the business of reconstructing the forgotten events of the previous day, with impossibly funny gags thrown in at an unprecedented pace.It quickly becomes clearer that what they forgot was not any ordinary day. They forgot that which is impossible to forget.A lifetime supply of jello! Thirty stolen pizzas! And that's just the appetizer. each event is quickly one-upped by an even more unforgettable event, and the writer is constantly daring you to imagine what could possibly be more unforgettable, only to reveal it, and deliver.A suitcase of money! A transsexual stripper! Making out with Christie Boner! Hot space-chicks in jumpsuits! Space-nerds dressed in bubble wrap! Nordic space-dudes! Finally, the most mysterious and powerful object in the whole universe, and it was right under your nose! And everything hangs together--- not a single plot-point is forced, everything seems inevitable, everything works. That's virtuoso writing.I know what you're thinking I could easily top these plot events by throwing in hostile ostriches and a fifty foot tall woman. You're right.The movie is like a Russian doll each outrage is a small part of an even bigger outrage. There is no cheap laugh. Even the silliest gags are rooted in deeply intelligent observations, like the way in which the idiomatic Chinese transliterated phrase and then is often used inappropriately by Chinese speakers of English. Or the way in which any folksy wisdom can be turned into funny by translating to Yoda. Or how shibby can put a Llama label your mental ostrich.Like Charles Bukowski's Pulp, the movie doesn't shy away from having space aliens in the plot with no hesitation or explanation. The dialog is written in vapid language, so that the intelligence is only revealed in the higher-level structure. This makes the movie seem superficially dumb to dumb people.If this movie were dumb, it couldn't be so devastatingly funny. I saw it when it came out, and I nearly died laughing in an otherwise empty movie theater.I assure you that every single plot point is resolved in a satisfying way, no loose threads. And that's a tall order for a movie with this many threads.The attention to detail is unbelievable. Each of the different groups of characters each have different elaborate hand signals which they use. The costumes are inspired--- the bubble wrap suits, the most perfect outfits in cinema history, cost $0 to make. The track-suits make the stoners look out of touch, the jumpsuits make the aliens look alien, the pizza outfit make Mr. Pizzacolli look like a Pizza shop owner, without any effort. This is the triumph of imagination over budget.Another effort by this director Harold and Kumar go to White Castle was very good too, but not at the same iconic level as this one.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"24 April 2010","score":"","review":" It is the almost-bio-pic of British Cellist Jacqueline Du Pre (1945-1987) and her elder sister Hilary (a Flutist). It's about the true love the sisters had for each other and how fate lifted Jacqueline to the top of fame while pushing Hilary to the bottom of it and how it affected their lives. Though the movie is about a great, talented musician Jacqueline, it is not a musical film.I haven't seen such a good real-life-account for a long time. This one is very truthful and not deviating from real-life emotions. The movie is based on the book written by Hilary. There are controversies over this book raised by Jacqueline's fans about her depiction.The movie is mostly the events, emotions and psychological account of its characters Jackie and Hilary. It's a bit of a musical too with some good sound tracks. Jackie (Emily Watson) is the star performer (even on the screen). Hilary comes next. The director has amazingly made this account. When we see Hilary's account we could feel a crushed musician's sadness and when we see Jackie's account we could feel the loneliness and the complex love of Jacqueline with her Cello as well as her sister Hilary.If you are Jacqueline's fan you can watch it only if you don't expect any musical treats of her from the film. As I am not a classical music guy I do not know what I missed about her music.Watch this powerful emotional tragic story.

And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the knights who say ni. Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents. Overall, a great comedy and a great film. 9.5\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"24 April 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After the brilliant Life of Brian, I was looking forward to watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

The fight scene at the end i think could of gone differently. I do think that Radio Raheem should of turned his radio down instead of making the owner mad. But Sal had no right to smash the radio.
