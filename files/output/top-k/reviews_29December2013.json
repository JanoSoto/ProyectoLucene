And what makes it above average is the scripted character and Kevin Costner's excellent portrayal of that character. With a look and a gleam in his eyes, he gives us a broad range of emotions in his bad guy-good guy robber-murderer. Director Eastwood also has used Costner's physical presence very well indeed in a number of scenes, both to get across his threats, his incipient and actual rage and violence, as well as his more positive feelings.The picture is an extended character study of a criminal, attained by showing the man's actions and interactions with other people. His back story is told through Laura Dern's character, but that's incidental. Mainly we acquaint ourselves with this man, Robert 'Butch' Haynes, through his words and deeds during his escape and after.The story of Haynes and his relationship with the boy Buzz (T.J. Lowther) is framed as a chase for him, the escaped criminal who has abducted a little boy as a hostage. However, the chase itself from the police side is both minimal and perfunctory, as are all of the police and government officials. They are mostly stereotypes and not well-scripted. An anachronistic feminist kind of conflict is ginned up between Dern's criminologist type and both Eastwood's Chief and the FBI assassin who is itching to be the sniper that kills Costner. This surrounding set of characters and their quite passive chase is at times treated as comic relief. Most of it adds very little to the film. If these had been treated more seriously and realistically and if the Costner-Lowther relationship had been treated a bit less sentimentally or unrealistically in places, this script could have been turned into a true classic. Apparently, this is easier said than done. But I do wonder whether a writer like Hancock who did such a great job with Haynes was influenced by Hollywood to give us the other much weaker characters or whether this was his idea.Eastwood's character, Chief Garnett is built up to some extent by making him the man who years ago saw to it that Haynes was sent to a juvenile facility, a tough one from which he emerged a criminal. There were no good options because the father of Haynes was an habitual criminal and his mother a whore. Speaking for all of us, Garnett realizes at the end how little he knows about anything.Haynes is very intelligent, but his movements are anything but smart. This is because he wants to get back at people around him, tweak them, rub their noses in the dirt of their smug world, the perfect world. He wants to get back at them for his youth and for their part in making him the criminal that he is. He doesn't want a new life as much as he wants to use his bit of freedom to exercise the power of intimidation and taking. He knows it's wrong, but he cannot control his passions. And they can erupt when he sees children mistreated by parents.I have come to appreciate and like Kevin Costner's performances. He knows what he is about and how to fashion a portrayal that will outlast the times that date movies. I've only seen a handful of his films (Revenge (1990), The Bodyguard (1992), Silverado (1985), Wyatt Earp (1994), Open Range (2003), JFK (1991), No Way Out (1997), The Untouchables (1987)). It's enough to see the merit in his acting and his acting capacities. His physicality is a resource that good directors can tap. His subdued or cooler acting style, like that of Alan Ladd, can create a role that survives the passing fashions and times.

Complete with the famous skating rink and all! -) I also liked that although the ending was very foreseeable, this is Hollywood after all, this was not evident until - well, the ending! This movie is rather like Brief Encounter from the 1940s. The same story about two people, already married, meeting by chance at a train\/train station, and falling in love against their will. Also in both movies, the couple get a chance to have sex, but they never do it. By the way, I find the fact that they do NOT have sex much more romantic than if they had. It shows that we have to do with basically decent people caught up in an unhappy situation - and because of this it is easier to sympathize with them.Brief encounter ended unhappily though. Although the men in both movies got a job far away and moved, to put an end to the hopeless relation-that-must-not-be, in the old movie he never came back and - we must presume - the lovers never met again. I suppose everything else would have been impossible in the 1940s, but in the 1980s divorce was not such a bad thing anymore, and the movie-makers could allow the illicit couple to get together in the end.I suppose this kind of story is many bored, married women's fantasy... You are bored with your husband, but there are no real problems that would make it legitimate to leave him. Also - where would you go, what would you do..? Maybe you would just turn up lonely, unhappy and poor.Although you are in mature age, you have still not quite forgotten that dream about the prince on the white horse, who are coming to save you... maybe this is still not too late, although you are 35, 40, 45, 50..? But you do not want to go out and look for a new man deliberately, because that would be too cheap and trashy. And you would not want a man who was willing to do that to HIS spouse either - because a man like that would not be worth the degree of love and passion you dream of.

I rated this title an 8 out of 10 only because I am watching it in 2013. Hats off to those who envisioned and created it in 1975.Long I had read about Monty Python being the pioneer in the new era of comedy, I had to see to believe it. I am sure my lips were kept straight only because of watching so much of Blackadder, Robin Hood Men in Tights and the variety of dead pan comedy available today on the web (and I think one episode of The Flying Circus). If I were a green viewer, the skits would have tickled my comedic senses to go for a full 10 on 10.The satire of society in general, the situational comedy, portrayal of romanticism, gallantry and heroism in the middle ages is from an angle so twisted and deadpan that in my view this movie has really set the standards for the best works which came after it. I loved the way in which the movie went a little bit after each of politics, religion, English culture, mythology, legends and even the art of movie making itself.About the movie scenes, I hope I am not putting in any spoilers but I am checking the box above just in case you don't want any bit of information before watching it. I kept on giggling from the subtitles (Please don't skip them..) to the first scene with King Arthur & his horse. I don't know whether it was creative or just a way to reduce the animal cast budget to a single rabbit and some dead cows, but it was brilliant. Being a nerd I couldn't stop laughing whenever the weight velocity ratios of unladen swallows came up. I could never have enough of such nerdy references. Another aspect I love about creative comedy is when sketches are cruelly and abruptly terminated. It leaves the mind's thirst unquenched and so much is left to the imagination. I couldn't have doubted that the Monty Python series of all would utilise this concept to genius effect. (Though I was throughout the movie waiting for a foot to drop, disappointed there.)I believe that the enjoyment that you will get from this movie really depends on your tastes as a viewer and your appetite for dry, satirical comedy involving mundane idiocy and simpleton characters.

He adopts Izumo as a mentor, learns the ways of the Ninja. After years of training, Izumo feels Sean is ready. Sean heads over to a remote island to compete in a karate tournament. He gets sidetracked by his master (Izumo) being kidnapped. He elects the help of friends, Curtis Jackson (Steve James) & Dexter (Evan J. Klisser) and a secret source to get to the bottom of it. What Sean doesn't realize is that a ruthless individual known as The Cobra is concocting a deadly virus to experiment on peopleThis bears no resemblance to the first two movies, nor is it related. The only reference we get to the first two movies is when Jackson mentions leaving Joe Armstrong (Dudikoff) in the army. Let me get this out of the way. This doesn't resemble anything close to a quality film. It's poorly acted, the plot is ludicrous, and it is badly made. But if I said I didn't have any fun while watching it, I'd be lying. There are plenty of fights to keep things lively, and lots of cheese for bad movie lovers. Those that are complaining about how awful this movie, should watch American Ninja IV & American Ninja V. It'll make you appreciate this movie ever so slightly. I have a soft spot for the now defunct Cannon films production. It introduced me to one of the greatest martial arts movie ever made, Bloodsport. I can't really explain it, but I enjoy how cheesy Cannon movies are, and this movie falls into that category somewhat. I was really impressed by some of the cinematography. Some shots are rather breathtaking if you give yourself a chance to look around. The acting is where we really run into problems. David Bradley has some natural charisma, but you wouldn't know it by watching this movie. He looks uncomfortable at times, and is as wooden as can be. Michael Dudikoff was no great shakes himself, but at least he commanded your attention at times. Bradley is very skilled when it comes to martial arts, not so much acting wise. I found his recovery from the virus by using the ways of the ninja to be extremely far fetched. Steve James is absolutely awesome. Like the first two movies. He outshines the lead in a huge way, and steals every scene he's in with his charisma. The man is obviously a skilled martial artist as well. He is so underrated. Evan J. Klisser plays the comedic relief. He's amusing in small doses, highly annoying in others. Marjoe Gotner is very bland as the Cobra He tries to be all sinister, but he failed miserably. Michelle B. Chan is wooden as Chan Lee, but fun to watch in the action scenes. What was up with the ending? It's one of the most anti-climatic things i've ever seen in my life. There is no real ending, no gratification. I don't really know what they were going for, but it stunk. I couldn't finish this review without mentioning the very good end credits song. Whether you enjoy the movie or not, stick around to listen to Cobra Strikes by George S. Clinton. You won't regret itFinal Thoughts This is a pretty crappy movie. I consider It to be fun cheese in a lowbrow way at times. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. It's pretty bad, but it can be fun at times if you ignore all of the faults.

One thing that I may congratulate is the basic premise of the movie a crime witness hiding in a traditional convent. I don't know why, but when I saw the sheriff sending her there, I kept thinking how genius these filmmakers were; that was such an original and creative plot-- hey, maybe that's why I thought that! Sometimes the whole thing looks a little formulaic and predictable, but the storyline is so charming and involving that you can easily forget about those flaws. Maggie Smith is so good at playing the Mother Superior as Whoopi is at the playing the nuts singer, showing how professional they are in their work. Another good point about this movie is that it doesn't sell an idea whether religions are right or wrong; it just shows how some religions CAN change-- if they want to-- without losing their main objective, which depends on each one. Some believe in love and peace, whilst others believe in war against the enemies, but they all have their goals-- at least, in theory. Furthermore, the movie still delivers some beautiful scenes with the nuns singing in the choir, which ended up being unintentionally?) emotional-- why mother surely would cry throughout. It's just a shame it has just a score of 6.0 on IMDb, considering it's one of the best comedies made in the nineties! Update I just found out the convent hiding thing has been used in past movies, even before this one, so it's not totally original as I thought it was.

It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good at what it does.

I was rather surprised when I exited the theater that The War of the Roses should be bundled into a Christmas release schedule when the reality was that the film was rather ruthless and relentless in its depiction of a marriage going sour and turning into two-way bloodbath of a divorce.Having done Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile together most audiences saw Douglas, Turner and DeVito on the poster and possibly subconsciously related it back to that level of comedy. I know I did after viewing the trailer before release. Even though the revenge aspect of the divorce was pretty clear from the trailer it still made things look light and flimsy even though it dealt with a serious issue - perfect Christmas fodder in fact. A comedy about the pratfalls of divorce over Christmas. It could only have one of those happy holiday endings Hollywood is so well known for. Oh how wrong, how very wrong, we we're to assume that! I remember a lot people hating this film. Most people saw it as an all out assault on the institution of marriage with many complaining it was just too dark for enjoyment. Friends of the family that were going through a tough divorce themselves each walked out respectively, although not together of course, saying the film was too much to handle given the current point they were at in their lives. In fact I remember leaving the theater thinking I'd slipped into some parallel universe and by the looks of the faces on most of the audience, they seemed to have felt that too.The War of the Roses is a tale about a love being ship-wrecked and destroyed on the shores of bitter contempt. Sure it starts out like any love story would - two young strangers meeting in a destined place discovering a passion for one another that is raw and physical - a love at first sight if you will. It doesn't take very long for those pillars to fall leaving a void that is slowly filled with kids, a bigger house and the more trinkets to fill into that bigger house than you could fit into an antique roadshow sale. No longer able to window dress the void, which has now developed into a chasm, Barbara Rose announces that she wants a divorce. Oliver Rose doesn't take her seriously, which only hardens her contempt for him. She says she wants the house - having picked it out herself and slowly filled it with the things that have made it a home. He argues that he paid for the house and everything in it. It's not long before Barbara and Oliver start sinking to new levels of depravity against one another in pursuit of the valuables that defined them during their marriage as the battle lines are drawn.The War of the Roses constantly borders on veering off the edge of comedy and into full out horror. I love black comedies but quite frankly they don't come more darker, nastier and meaner than The War of the Roses. It's a testament to DeVito's brilliant direction here that he is able to pull back at just the right moments so that the film retains its comedic edge - albeit a very bizarre comedic edge that is peppered with spousal brutality unlike anything we have ever seen. Both Douglas and DeVito are in fine form but it's Turner's brilliant turn as Barbara Rose that steals the show. She goes from a loving and caring wife and mother to a cold, aloof almost assassin like vixen by the films end. She is absolutely outstanding in the role.If I do have a slight complaint about the film, it's that it tends to want to puts its leads into  good guy , bad guy camps and somehow DeVito misogynistacly places his female character, Barbara Rose, firmly in the bad guy camp. I think this was an ill judgment on his part as he potentially alienates all his female viewers. And as we know in the messy arena of divorce, particularly the nasty ones, there really are no good or bad guys.I caught this on the TV the other night and it reminded me why it's such a much loved classic in my film library.

The film takes place in 1860's Indiana as the Civil War rages. The story is told from the perspective of a pacifist Quaker family and is based on the 1945 book by Jessamyn West.The patriarch of this Quaker family is played by Gary Cooper, who was four years past his Oscar winning performance in High Noon, and five years from his death due to cancer. His wife, the Minister Eliza, is played well by Dorothy McGuire, who the following year would play the mother in Old Yeller. The film's best performance comes from young Anthony Perkins (his second film) who of course made cinematic history as Norman Bates in the 1960 classic Psycho. Both of these Perkins characters share mommy issues and complicated decisions of conscience.The opposition to war and violence is the main theme here, and there have been many interpretations over the years. Is it religious belief or fear that prevents the men from joining the cause? At least Perkins' character is honest enough to wonder. Cooper kind of plays against type here since he was so often a man of movie action, but in reality his strength of character and belief allows him to maintain his image.Comedy relief is at hand given the youngest son's ongoing battle with Samantha the Goose, a family pet with devious attack modes.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"29 December 2013","score":"","review":" So, in 1980, the sequel to end all sequels - the movie that made a certain generation of us never quite take our parentage for granted again - was with us. Where to start with this masterclass of story-telling and galactic imagination? Well, at the beginning perhaps...After all these years, I still feel the same sense of wonder at the ice world of Hoth as I did as an impressionable 13-year-old, so vivid and *realistic* was the setting. As in the first film, special effects take a back seat to story, and we're introduced to the intimacy of the rebel base and its characters on this frozen world. Into this is injected the menace of the Imperial presence, as scouting droids zoom down from space and splash down in the snow (real snow). Immediately - but not frenetically - the crisis is set in motion, with a tapestry of captivating sub-plots from Skywalker's peril in the cave of the ice-bear to Vader's increasing 'grip' on his subordinates. Both characters, now very much the central ones, have grown. Skywalker is now a leader with awakening Jedi powers, not so much the whiny little Luke now. Vader is now 2nd only to the Emperor, and will stop at nothing to bring the rebels to heel, but he especially wants 'Skywalker' - the personal conflict is intense.The story is inherently simple the wretched but dignified lot of them are running and pursued to all corners of the galaxy. The places this takes us are unforgettable, the two stand-out ones being the swamp-world of Dagobah and Cloud City on Bespin. At this point it could almost be two separate stories - the training of Luke by Yoda, and the perils faced by Han Solo and Leia - yet they are tied together powerfully. As in all great drama, a final confrontation seems necessary as well as inevitable. That Luke is 'not ready to face Vader alone', unless his training is completed, adds power to it. Uncommonly in a film aimed to include kids in its market, we feel a real sense of dread, and doubt whether all this is going to turn out well. In fact, we wonder how the hell it is going to turn out, period. How it actually does was truly beyond the ability of most of us to predict and, let's say, 'not entirely happy' for the good guys in various ways.To divulge who lives or dies, especially the twist in the tail, would of course be spoiling. Yet folk who have grown up with the first 3 episodes will already have that knowledge, which reduces the impact (although they may still find it the best, and don't worry there's plenty of action). This leads me to suggest that any newcomer to the entire franchise should be advised to watch episodes IV, V, VI first, then follow it straight through from I to VI.
