Hackman suspects that, in actuality, the half-dozen or so MIAs are secretly being held in a remote camp by Laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor. Hackman is being paid by the wealthy Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is thought to be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only manage to buy old and out-dated weapons, though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anti-communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way.I don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the Vietnames still holding our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIAs. I think, instead, that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth. It was absurd on the face of it. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret? To add the labor supply? They need a hundred extra laborers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this movie -- with its triumphant music and high body count -- were scurrilous.But how about the movie itself? Stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated MIAs, it's a routine paramilitary actioner, no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. He's just about always reliable.Of the others, this being a formulaic plot, derived from The Dirty Dozen among others, I kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I figured one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in movies like this. (I was right two times out of three.) I also figured Patrick Swayzie as the rookie ex-officer, the youngest of the group, who'd never earned the respect of the others because he'd never seen combat, would also have to go in some heroic mode. Wrong. He becomes a hero, true, but survives intact. I thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that Hackman would have to go too, but he makes it out okay. The formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW escapee from The Great Escape is here in Fred Ward's ex tunnel rat, a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it, so that he can do a recon on the Laotian POW camp.The title, Uncommon Valor, is from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men on Iwo Jima -- Uncommon valor was common that day. Nimitz was certainly right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. Anyone who saw combat or even came near it, putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them, were heroic enough. This movie, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam war, doesn't really do them justice.

What I felt was the same kind of awe and irrepressible reverberation in my heart as when I listen to a Brahms symphony or when I see the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This movie is art it envelopes you, shatters you, and consumes you. Speaking of Brahms, this movie maintains an almost Olympian pace similar to that of the composer's great works. It propels the story forward with engrossing tension but leaves room for reflections on hope, despair and redemption. The spot-on pacing, which derives from a serendipitously good combination of scripting, directing, acting and editing, gives the movie the feel of an epic. It seems safe to declare that The Shawshank Redemption has achieved immortality, and that is its best redemption from its box office mediocrity 14 years ago.

Getting the proper script completed, she gets fellow members Sandra Petruzzi, (Jessica Cauffiel) Stanley Washington, (Anthony Anderson) Dirk Reynolds, (Michael Bacall) Graham Manning, (Joseph Lawrence) Vanessa Valdeon, (Eva Mendes) and Schorm Jabuscko, (Marco Hofschneider) to help her film her movie and must immediately get through several pretty large production problems. Soon, she starts to realize that there's a serial killer running around loose behind the scenes killing off the crew, and must stop the madman before killing off everyone connecting to the film.The Good News This here was a pretty surprising entry. One of the things it does well is that it makes a hard time of determining if what's being seen is real or just being shot for the movie. It plays the movie-within-a-movie trick to nice effect, since both are quite well-done and make it hard to distinguish from the other. It features enough to make it feel enjoyable, and the twists are really nice. There's several great ones to come from this trick, mainly it's wonderful opening sequence where a crazy couple are attacked on a rowdy plane during a severe thunderstorm, and upon coming out of the bathroom as the plane's shaking and wobbling, there's a big scene with a long chase, a rather great discovery-of-the-bodies sequence and a great fun conclusion, all to learn otherwise after the fact it's been faked. There's even more over the course of the film, and all of them are well-handled, and the non-trick ones come out rather nice as well. A sequence where the assembled cast watch the dailies, only for a strange sequence to air where one of the cast is viciously stalked and killed is screened, all but one thinking it to be a sequence shot for the film but the other positive that it's real and not staged. A murder done during the recording of a scream-test loud enough to drown out the victim's own is a great scene, leading to a thrilling chase through the recording studio and out into the surrounding countryside and pool make for some great viewing. The final confrontation in the movie sets graveyard setting is just fun, being creepy, exciting and all-around a blast. The mask worn in here is quite nice, with a simple ski mask worn over a big jacket, looking quite impressive in the few scenes it's used and hoping that more would've been nice. The last big feature here is a really nice and healthy mix amongst the kills in here. There's a decapitation here by shoving broken glass window onto their neck, slashed repeatedly with a razor, stabbing in several different areas with a knife, a gunshot and a beating with a camera lens, amongst others. These here are the film's rather good parts.The Bad News This one here only has a few flaws to it. The main one here is that the main explanation for the killing. There's a lot of things that can go wrong for how to interpret it, and it feels just too clumsy and unrealistic to be considered as believable, and becomes laughable at a certain point. This here is really weak, and serves as the main flaw in this one. The fact that the violence is toned down from anything that it should have, since, for all the creativity displayed in the kills, it isn't very bloody and with a couple of kills that could've been in here. These are the same thing that really should've fixed by taking more of those and making them more bloody. It would've taken out a mild flaw in the film rather simply. The last flaw in here is the film's maddening ability to switch between the film shoot and the real world. It's fun at times, but there's also the fact that the film tries to be clever with changing around the two and it gets a little harder to defend the longer they go on.

The point of the movie, though, is that the world is full of all kinds of heroes, and combat heroes are only one type. There's a valid heroism to be found in simply being reliable and decent, and the kind of person that knows how to be a good leader. It's less glamorous, but no less important or necessary.

It's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending. I watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad. the movie starred two actors that I like very much, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Sure they had decent chemistry together but for what? The movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder. That pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. Early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. This being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in Hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.Mr. Banderas plays a mystery man named Tony Ramirez, who comes into Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and first encounter between Tony and Sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot. And there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here. One thing that I would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot. Anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives, weird packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill Sarah, incident that say things aren't normal anymore. Overall the movie was badly conceived, the editing at times seem jumpy, and the conclusion was laughable. Another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole Orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence. It's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career. She's that rare combination of talent and beauty.

I watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad. the movie starred two actors that I like very much, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Sure they had decent chemistry together but for what? The movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder. That pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. Early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. This being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in Hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.Mr. Banderas plays a mystery man named Tony Ramirez, who comes into Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and first encounter between Tony and Sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot. And there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here. One thing that I would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot. Anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives, weird packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill Sarah, incident that say things aren't normal anymore. Overall the movie was badly conceived, the editing at times seem jumpy, and the conclusion was laughable. Another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole Orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence. It's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career. She's that rare combination of talent and beauty.

Hands down, comedy is probably the most difficult film genre. It's so much harder to make people laugh, and laugh throughout the whole film, than it is to make a dramatic drama or an action-packed action movie. The Birdcage is one of my all-time favorite comedies, if not only for the great acting. Plus, it's the subtle nuances that really add to the film's brilliance, and I think these are overlooked.In my book, there may never be a better comedic combination than Williams and Lane (I'm sorry, but the Broderick\/Lane combo in the Producers was nowhere near as complementary). The Williams\/Lane cohesion in this movie is undeniable and the delivery of the dialogue is hilarious. Some people seem to be critical of the story's obvious clichés and overblown silliness; however, they have obviously missed the point &#150; it's supposed to be clichéd and silly. Granted, without Williams and Lane, the movie wouldn't have made so much as a blip on the radar. But toss in the added bonus of Hank Azaria's Agador and Hackman's obvious presence, and you've got comedic gold.Oh I see, so you're going to a cemetery with your toothbrush. How Egyptian.

I particularly enjoyed listening to the John Williams music that echoed North by North West, Psycho and so on. There are also some motifs that found their way in to 'Star Wars' which gave the film a depth for me. Hitchcock's ear for good dialogue remains. Considering how late in his career this was made, it stands up as good comedy thriller. Hitchcock uses 2 sets of villains, one set more heinous than the other to explore his familiar themes of greed, guilt and identity. In this sense it is hardly fresh but the way he manages to keep being so watchable is remarkable.
