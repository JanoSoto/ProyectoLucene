The biggest problem?  The complete and total lack of the mention of Primus.

The comic book deals with this better than the series ever did.  In fact, the comic book is best in most respects, as it didn't kill off mass quantities of transformers, although some seemed to just show up at random.  (Like Goldbug)  Anywho, for anyone who watches the movie, learn this about Unicron In the beginning of time, there were a whole bunch of Gods, and a lot of the weaker ones got killed.  Unicron lingered, though, and like most other gods, he was able to transform into a planet.  Well, he and Primus (another God) got into a huge fight until something momentous happened and they were torn apart.  At this point Primus transformed into his planet and Unicron into his.  Primus' planet? Cybertron.  (Makes it a whole lot easier to understand why Unicron is so angry at Cybertron, doesn't it?)  Anywho, Primus created the matrix and the autobots as a defense, while Unicron created the Decpeticons to do his bidding, which was to destroy the autobots so that Primus' defenses would be destroyed.  And instead of killing off all the cool autobots, they could have merely sent them to the center of Cybertron (where Primus' head lives) and made the autobots upgrade as Megatron did into Galvatron.  A lot easier, simpler to understand, and Ratchet and Windcharger don't just whirl off into space forever.  But, really, that's just how I wanted to see it done. Otherwise, this movie was possibly the greatest animated film of all time. Hell, it was.  Even if you dont love Transformers, give it a watch. You'll enjoy it, from the voices to the music to the cryptic messages that are just so rampant in movies that continue a series.

I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters.  I saw it twice on cable, and now that I bought the DVD, I watched it again.  I was just as intrigued as when I watched it the first time!  Needless to say, the premise is extremely original.  I seem to always connect well with films involving father\/son relationships, since I don't have an ideal relationship with my father.  So it was really sweet to watch a film about a guy communicating with his deceased father, and watching them bond and chat about the All-American game.  Not only is it a touching drama, but it's also an exciting thriller.  Director Gregory Hoblit and writer Toby Emmerich couldn't have done much to make the film better. Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel both deliver great, spirited performances.  I always notice more and more flaws in Quaid's New York accent in repeat viewings, but his acting is terrific nonetheless.  Andre Braugher gives another strong performance as Satch.  And the actor who plays the villain is quite creepy.  I would expect that after seeing the movie a couple times, the ending would no longer make me cry, but the ending STILL chokes me up!  As a matter of fact, I'm about to cry just thinking about it.  I'm by no means a fan of country music, but I felt Garth Brooks' song beautifully fit the film's tone.  Tired of seeing movie's with the same plots and the same outcomes?

However, it did very well over here, probably due to a comic-book-virgin-friendly screenplay and kinetic, epilespy-inducing fight scenes. Of course, a sequel was inevitable.This time round, British director Stephen Norrington (helmer of upcoming flick LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMAN, with Sean Connery) has been replaced by Spanish horror maestro Del Toro. The script is still by David S. Goyer, and is still on the flimsy, light side. Wesley Snipes returns in all trenchcoat-flowing, shade-wearing style as Blade the vampire hunter - half-human, half-vampire, all hero...and so on and so forth. The story is that a new breed of bloodsuckers, led by Nomak (ex-pop star Luke Goss) are causing havoc in the underground world of the supernatural, and so Blade has to ally with the A-team of the fanged universe, and whup some ass. Which he does rather well. Goyer does try and make the plot at least partly coherent, but what you really want to see from a film such as this, is Snipes and co slicing, dicing, slashing, punching, shooting, kicking, and blowing-up as many long-toothed villians as possible. The film certainly delivers above par, with some truly impressive fight scenes, even enough to beat the jaw-dropping club massacre which opened the first film so brilliantly.Del Toro has created an entirely new atomsphere to this movie, making it darker, broodier, and ten times as bloody. The comic-book stylings of the original have been dropped in favour of a colder, harder look, which works fantastically. Del Toro evidently wants to make this 'Blade the horror-action movie; not Blade the comic book sequel.' He makes it his own.Snipes is great as the hero, moody and ruthless, like a hyper-up Batman. BLADE II is as superficial as movies get - it is the popcorn munching machine on hyper-drive, but is as enjoyable as any other action flick released in 2002, and actually a far deal better than xXx or disappointing 20th 007 movie, DIE ANOTHER DAY. In a world of comic-book movies with McDonalds-friendly tie-ins and 12A certificates, it is so nice to a hero cutting a baddie in half length-ways, and hearing cringeworthy dialogue like 'I feel like hammered sh*t!'

In fact, this movie seems very similar to the latter. This film was made first, so if anything, `Nurse Betty' stole some elements to make a vaguely similar movie. Both films follow a squeaky voiced, possibly insane woman across America, whilst being on the run. They both pursue travelling to Los Angeles, and have dead husbands (for different reasons). Hmm&#133; never mind. `Crazy in Alabama' is a sometimes surreal but more often compelling movie set against two different backgrounds. The first is social activism and the fight against apartheid in the Deep South during the 1960's. Meanwhile, the second is a background of glitz, glamour and superficial style in Hollywood, California. These two very different styles don't gel together and as the stories criss-cross one another, the sudden shift in tone from grim, powerful drama to darkly black comedy is unsettling to say the least. But it lifts the film out of the norm, to make it seem a bit more interesting.Banderas' directorial flare really shows in the most original credits sequence ever. As the names are shown on the screen, an image is placed beside it, describing that character's job\/role. The soundtrack is filled with nostalgic, outdated music, such as `These Boots are made for Walking', that perfectly fits in with the two tones of the film. The script is sharp and unpredictable but the cinematography is disappointing. The sets on Hollywood are convincing, but in Alabama, the sets are too claustrophobic and enclosed. Average - very good performances from the big cast of familiar faces. It's not surprising that Oscar nominee Melanie Griffith landed the lead role, after all, she is the director's wife. Nonetheless, she excels equally as the ditz, and the woman to be taken seriously. Lucas Black is good as the young white kid, but the accent drawls a bit and isn't all that convincing. David Morse and Cathy Moriarty work well with the material they've been given, not that there's much there. Plenty of good support from a nice supporting cast including Rod Steiger, Meat Loaf and Noah Emmerich. The vest characters go to Robert Wagner and Elizabeth Perkins as the respective Hollywood agent and jealous movie star.It's just too bad that they didn't get the screen time their characters deserved. The film starts when we hear that Lucille (Griffith) murdered her husband. It would have been better had we received a proper introduction, or at least an image of this character.

In fact, this movie seems very similar to the latter. This film was made first, so if anything, `Nurse Betty' stole some elements to make a vaguely similar movie. Both films follow a squeaky voiced, possibly insane woman across America, whilst being on the run. They both pursue travelling to Los Angeles, and have dead husbands (for different reasons). Hmm&#133; never mind. `Crazy in Alabama' is a sometimes surreal but more often compelling movie set against two different backgrounds. The first is social activism and the fight against apartheid in the Deep South during the 1960's. Meanwhile, the second is a background of glitz, glamour and superficial style in Hollywood, California. These two very different styles don't gel together and as the stories criss-cross one another, the sudden shift in tone from grim, powerful drama to darkly black comedy is unsettling to say the least. But it lifts the film out of the norm, to make it seem a bit more interesting.Banderas' directorial flare really shows in the most original credits sequence ever. As the names are shown on the screen, an image is placed beside it, describing that character's job\/role. The soundtrack is filled with nostalgic, outdated music, such as `These Boots are made for Walking', that perfectly fits in with the two tones of the film. The script is sharp and unpredictable but the cinematography is disappointing. The sets on Hollywood are convincing, but in Alabama, the sets are too claustrophobic and enclosed. Average - very good performances from the big cast of familiar faces. It's not surprising that Oscar nominee Melanie Griffith landed the lead role, after all, she is the director's wife. Nonetheless, she excels equally as the ditz, and the woman to be taken seriously. Lucas Black is good as the young white kid, but the accent drawls a bit and isn't all that convincing. David Morse and Cathy Moriarty work well with the material they've been given, not that there's much there. Plenty of good support from a nice supporting cast including Rod Steiger, Meat Loaf and Noah Emmerich. The vest characters go to Robert Wagner and Elizabeth Perkins as the respective Hollywood agent and jealous movie star.It's just too bad that they didn't get the screen time their characters deserved. The film starts when we hear that Lucille (Griffith) murdered her husband. It would have been better had we received a proper introduction, or at least an image of this character.

First, I viewed the trailer on the DVD and even that was kind of funny. Direct quote American Ambassador Robert Thorn and his wife Katharine are very happy about the birth of their son, Damien. My brother and I cracked up at that. Amazing, how much a few movies can affect people's association with Satan. Okay, that aside, here's the gistRobert Thorn (the amazingly talented and handsome Gregory Peck) is an American ambassador who lives in Rome with his wife Kathy (the amazingly talented and beautiful Lee Remick). He learns, before she, that their new and first child is stillborn. Robert goes to a church where some nuns show him a live baby that was also born at that time (June 6th at 6 AM, by the way), and offers him to Robert, as he could pass as their son. This puts Robert in the lose-lose situation of either telling Kathy the baby she had is dead or lying to her and saying that this baby is theirs. You can probably guess which one he chooses, since it's a matter of whether or not this movie would have been made. Anyway, they take home the cute little devil named Damien, and soon they have to move to London. Now, before I describe the first silly (supposed to be creepy) part, I'll explain that I understand Kathy and Robert are very much in love. I mean, she's absolutely gorgeous, and he's Gregory Peck, for crying out loud, but that's no excuse to be so fascinated with each other as they go for a walk that they briefly lose sight of Damien, now a toddler. And then after that there's a hanging scene (not gory, just kind of spooky), a scene where a spear stabs through an important someone (not gory or spooky; you can see it coming a mile away), two scenes where the same person falls from a high point (painful to watch, but that's good), an attack in a graveyard by about ten rottweilers (pretty bloody and subsequently followed by a sharp peak on a fence stabbing through someone's arm), and a REALLY AWESOME decapitation scene (a little blood). I normally hate gore, but c'mon, you have to praise the sfx people of 1976 to do that scene so well. Basically, Robert learns that Damien is the son of Satan. Now, although the first third of the film is unintentionally silly and sometimes over-acted, the rest is quite good, with some bits shot quite brilliantly. For instance, anyone who's seen a single Peck film has to know that he can save a movie most of the time. Anyway, Peck is brilliant as usual, as is Remick. The kid was SOOOO adorable, but did have a little devilishness about him. Billie Whitelaw (the creepy nanny) had me hating her from the second she walked into their house, especially after what she does later on (more about that later). And the score scared the hell out of me (no pun intended). When Peck walks into his house for the last time and we hear a mixture of the dog panting and a choir whispering and chanting Ave Satani, I had goosebumps. Some of the little bits I loved and\/or that scared me (some spoilers) Robert's frustration that he has to stab Damien, when he and the photographer unearth the skeletons of both Damien's mother and Robert's real son with a hole in its skull, and Kathy's blue eyes widening under that veil-like cover-up as she sees the creepy nanny approaching with that sick smile (even though it was an awful part, I have to say that was when Remick looked the most beautiful, almost like an angel, therefore the nanny had to kill her).

If you were one of the fortunate to acquire The Alien Legacy Box set with The Alien Legacy bonus tape (dvd), this movie suddenly becomes more than than just a beautiful and intricate work of art.  H.R. Giger discusses his nightmares and dreams and you can't help but be enraptured in his madness.

Macy, but you may also feel a bit of uncomfortable empathy, too.  I was prepared to be offended by this movie about a man who kills people for money, especially since when this man, the central character, is supposedly made sympathetic because he seeks out the help of a psychologist.  Perhaps this would be a dark comedy?   I'm not sure what type to consider it as a whole, but all in all, I found it very moving.  Alex, the hitman, is trained from early childhood to exercise cold control and use a gun to take a life, first a squirrel, years later as a young adult, a stranger in a car.  His father, Michael, establishes the business of being a hired killer, by wedding a woman who could help him get started in the business.  Alex's life is contradictory from early on  he exhibits the professional detachment needed to carry out hits, yet he lacks the confidence, even as a middle-aged man, to defy his father and quit the business.  Yet it is obvious that Alex wants out.  He finds himself to be considered old by a young woman he finds beautiful, yet he is helpless to turn his life in a more moral direction. He is a fairly good and certainly gentle husband and a wonderful father, despite having been raised by his seemingly sociopathic parents who are also absurd control freaks.  It is not beneath his dignity to dress up as a monster to delight the children at his son's birthday party.  But he is deeply, deeply sad.  As the movie progresses, it seems that Alex truly believes that a way out for him is pure fantasy.  One can, in their mid to late forties, turn one's life around if the faults are less severe than Alex's.  But one cannot give life back to those who were murdered.  Still, he yearns for a miracle, and to me this plays out in his half-hearted pursuit of a much-younger beautiful woman, Sarah.  He knows that a real, lasting relationship with this fantasy woman would be very unlikely unless he could transform himself into a young man of her age....perhaps when he killed his first victim.  It seems that Alex believes only time-travel could save him....back to a time before he crossed the line that he could never uncross.SOME SPOILER Alex, to me, is resolved to the idea that he doomed, yet he does eventually show the moral courage to stop his father from committing any more murders or recruiting anymore children into the business, and also to stop himself. It is, ironically, his father's contemptuous remark to Alex of Who says? (Alex had just told his father that he should not have taken Alex's son and Michael's grandson, Sammy out to the woods to experiment with shooting a squirrel).  Finally, Alex has an identity, and it is a braver one than he had known.To sum up, VERY good movie!!

The movie starts out well, and the first half-hour or so is probably as good as Goldfinger in terms of storytelling and building interest. But the movie's many underwater scenes -- which at times slow the plot to a crawl -- prove to be a big liability.That's a shame, because there are a lot of things the movie does right. Take the spectacular locations in and around Jamaica. This movie has me craving a trip to the Caribbean every time I see it, and the excellent cinematography almost makes you feel like you're there.The movie also gives us the first of the big-scale plots in which nothing less than the fate of the world is at risk. SPECTRE gets hold of two nuclear bombs and proceeds to hold the world to ransom. Bond, of course, must save the day.All this is fairly involving, and Sean Connery again manages to bring a playful quality to the role, when he's not kicking some SPECTRE butt. I particularly enjoyed the sequence at the health clinic early in the movie, and the way Bond manages to get some tender loving care from an attractive nurse after an attempt on his life fails. And for sheer viciousness, the fight in the pre-credits sequence is hard to beat.Unfortunately, that energy is what's missing from the rest of the movie. Considering that the fate of the world is at stake, there is a strange lack of suspense. The movie seems to dawdle, in fact, as Bond searches for the bombs while pursuing a romance with Domino, who is the villain's mistress. The movie should be ticking away like a wound-up clock, but instead takes its time sloshing through countless underwater scenes, in which everyone is wearing scuba gear and it is difficult to tell who is on which side.The villain, Emilio Largo, is SPECTRE's #2 agent. As played by Adolfo Celi (whose voice was dubbed), Largo looks somewhat menacing, with his eyepatch, but is certainly not in the Goldfinger league. He lacks charm, and he and his men seem more like a band of petty thugs than sophisticated criminals out to threaten the world. The standout on the enemy front is Fiona Volpe, a gorgeous SPECTRE agent who is as deadly as she is beautiful. Here is a genuinely interesting character, but unfortunately she is not given that much to do.Claudine Auger, as Domino, is rather low-key, and seems to spend most of the movie in jeopardy. She's not one of the more memorable Bond beauties. In fact, I found Paula, Bond's Secret Service liaison in Jamaica, more attractive and interesting. On the other hand, Rik Van Nutter is one of the better Felix Leiters, and it's a shame he didn't continue in the role.The gadgets are also beginning to take center stage with this film, and this is unfortunate, because Thunderball would have been much more compelling had it focused on Bond racing against time to stop SPECTRE's fiendish plot.

Or how much a pair of shoes costs in Metropolis. ` That's where I normally write my gags and do my little bits, and I felt I was wrong for it. I've never had a feeling for comic books or comic strips at all.'When Richard Lester took over as director that is what he added to Superman II. There are many scenes in the film that feature social humor like the crowd witnessing the battle between Superman and the three villains as a spectator sport. And then attack the villains when they think they've murdered Superman. Another good example is the ending when Superman returns to the diner and gets revenge for the beating he received when he had lost his powers.What differs Superman II from the original is the love story. That's where Lester was strongest. The love scenes between Lois and Clark were some of the most memorable parts in this film and the performances by Christopher Reeves and Margot Kidder were once again extraordinary. And the extreme close-up of Lois Lane gives her a real beauty and makes you understand why Superman loves her. `We had a scene where Jor-El basically commits suicide, ` says Mankiewicz. `Jor-El touches his son and rejuvenates him and `kills` himself by expelling the last of his energy. That scene was as chilling as anything you'll ever see on the screen. It was shot with Brando and was wonderful, but because they the Salkinds would have had to pay him money, Superman says, `Mother, mother` as opposed to `Father, father, ` which is what he should have done and did do in the script. Brando appeared and said, `Even though this will extinguish what is left of my life_I warned you, I told you....` And he reached out through the void. Clark is unconscious on the ground, and it's essentially God touching the hand of Adam. It's a motif I had done at the beginning when Brando sent Chris to Earth and said, `I send them my only son. ` It was God sending Christ to Earth. Brando was just wonderful.'The first film is legendary because of it's behind the scenes battle between director Richard Donner and the producers. Both films were originally shot simultaneously but because of special effects problems Donner was forced to focus on the first film. Once it was complete go on and finish the second. However, after the dispute Donner was fired and Lester was brought in to finish the project. As a result the film lost a lot of it's epic and fantasy aspect that the first film was full of. This film had the chance to surpass the original but as a result of a lose it didn't. Regardless, the film is still full of excitement and imagination. Still one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all-times.RATING 4 STARSQuotes available from Cinescape.

I won't go on about the plot which is full of twists and turns except to say that it doesn't bear scrutiny.  A hard-charging thoracic surgeon with a Harvard degree, board certified in two specialties, dripping with awards, worshipped by staff and patients, a future that looks like the sun peeking over the desert horizon in Lawrence of Arabia, meets an old high school chum who is leading the sensible life as an associate dean and, upon invitation, decides to rent the upper floor of the dean's Victorian fixer-upper.  Unbelievable to begin with.  Even with the sensuous Nicole Kidman thrown in as the dean's wife. Some of the female students are being offed by a serial rapist\/murderer and some time is devoted to this problem but it has nothing to do with the story.  He turns out to have a typical serial rapist's face, resembling one of those mutated rutabagas that in its warped development seems to have acquired some human features.  He's disposed of quickly.  I have no idea what he's doing in this flick.There is, as it turns out, a conspiracy involving Baldwin and Kidman, a very well-disguised conspiracy, and one almost impossible to pull off, except in a screenplay where a character can say something like, I was leading a double life, without having to explain how he could do it.Then we're asked to believe that Kidman voluntarily befouls her own ovaries and submits to an operation in which they are removed, ostensibly by mistake (but actually by design) by Baldwin as part of the plot.  The goal is to set up a situation in which Baldwin seems to have made a mistaken diagnosis, resulting in the removal of both ovaries, although the movie makes the decision seem plausible enough, done necessarily on the spur of the moment.  The ultimate plan is for Kidman to sue Baldwin until his clock is cleaned and then they both go to the seashore and live together.  Baldwin is properly crucified.  The insurance company pays his fine.  You know how much the fine is?  Seventeen million dollars.  Repeat seventeen million dollars.

Not that the director doesn't use standard typical shock techniques involving impenetrably dark backgrounds.  You've seen them used dozens of times before.Kidman is even greedier than the more pragmatic Baldwin.  She really IS greedy.  She has an offensive habit of shooting people who disagree with her when she proposes another murder.  She holds a pistol on Baldwin, scowling and telling him not to come any closer.  So what does he do?  Exactly what any cretin would do in such a situation.  He walks slowly towards her, his hand outstretched, coaxing her, Give me the gun, Traci.  Come on.  Give it to me.

It seems as if every time I try to have an entire viewing of this film, I usually just fall asleep or turn of the TV after about an hour and a half of this film.  Why?  Because the movie is BORING AS HELL.  We have to wait that long for Superman to actually make an appearance in the flick.  All the previous time is wasted on making him become Superman.  Some scenes that should have been shortened include when Clark journeys to the Fortress, Kal-El's arrival on Earth, and Krypton's Explosion.  I could rant on other scenes that need to be shortened, but I still have the rest of a summary to go on.Like I said, by the time Superman finally shows up, I'm too bored to care about the rest of the film because everything else has been wasted.  But, one time I actually managed to watch the entire movie, did the lack of Superman get made up for in the end?  Did we have a good plot?  Hell no.  Lex Luthor isn't some insane criminal who wants to take over the world, whether it be by force or, as the Luthor post-1986 did, manipulation, but a common crook who wants to take over some.... real estate in California.  REAL ESTATE?!  The only thing that's making him a threat is because he hijacks two nuclear missiles(pretty pathetically, I might add).Also, the ending is horrible.  I mean poorly-thought out horrible, similar to what helped kill the Matrix.  You see, Superman solves all these disasters, but as a result can't save Lois.  She gets killed, and Superman decides to do the one thing he promised not to do... alter history.  He turns the world around, and sets time back by, I don't know, five minutes.  Then he goes down to see the now-living Lois.  BUT WAIT!!!!  SINCE IT'S FIVE MINUTES AGO, SHOULDN'T ALL THOSE DISASTERS THAT WERE HAPPENING BE OCCURING AGAIN!?  Also, Lois was killed in the flick by being buried in a landslide.  For some unknown reason, when he turns back time the landslide itself is not occuring again.  With plotholes like this, one can wonder what the writers were doing all this time.  It's also hard to believe that this film was scripted by the same person who wrote the Godfather.Okay, I've been ranting about the bad all this time, so what's good?  Well, Christopher Reeve is actually able to give off a believable performance as Superman.  His emotions can actually feel real, and make us be actually care for him.  When Lois does kick the bucket in the movie, we can actually feel his grief, and how he must make the difficult choice of either obeying his father's wishes or bringing back the woman he loves.  And of course, there's John Williams's brilliant musical score, with some of the best soundtracks on the face of the earth.Of course, good music can't be the only factors in making a good production(I said the same thing about Final Fantasy VII.)  All in all, a disapointing film.  However, it is better than the even worse second film.BOTTOM LINE  If you want a real comic-based movie, see X-men, or Batman, or Daredevil ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2003","score":"13 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE SUPERMAN MOVIE!For the past 6 years, I have constantly been asking myself one question  Why am I never able to finish watching the original Superman movie?  It seems as if every time I try to have an entire viewing of this film, I usually just fall asleep or turn of the TV after about an hour and a half of this film.  Why?  Because the movie is BORING AS HELL.  We have to wait that long for Superman to actually make an appearance in the flick.  All the previous time is wasted on making him become Superman.  Some scenes that should have been shortened include when Clark journeys to the Fortress, Kal-El's arrival on Earth, and Krypton's Explosion.  I could rant on other scenes that need to be shortened, but I still have the rest of a summary to go on.Like I said, by the time Superman finally shows up, I'm too bored to care about the rest of the film because everything else has been wasted.  But, one time I actually managed to watch the entire movie, did the lack of Superman get made up for in the end?  Did we have a good plot?  Hell no.  Lex Luthor isn't some insane criminal who wants to take over the world, whether it be by force or, as the Luthor post-1986 did, manipulation, but a common crook who wants to take over some.... real estate in California.  REAL ESTATE?!  The only thing that's making him a threat is because he hijacks two nuclear missiles(pretty pathetically, I might add).Also, the ending is horrible.  I mean poorly-thought out horrible, similar to what helped kill the Matrix.  You see, Superman solves all these disasters, but as a result can't save Lois.

The movie starts with two guys, Caine (Tyrin Turner) and O-Dog (Larenz Tate), going into a Korean supermarket to get beer. The owner says he doesn't want any trouble but also says he feels sorry for the mother of the boy O-Dog. For O-Dog this is enough to kill the guy. From the Korean guy's wife he wants the videotape from the security camera and then he kills her too. Caine doesn't approve this behavior because it was over nothing. Later in the movie we see Caine can kill as well, for bigger issues. The story is narrated by Caine, a guy who probably was a better man if he grew up somewhere else. But he didn't grew up somewhere else. He has always seen violence. When he was about five his father (Samuel L. Jackson) shoot a guy in front of his eyes for the first time. His mother dies of an overdose. Now Caine is living with his grandparents who do love him. There are some other people who really care for him. One of them is Mr. Butler (Charles S. Dutton), a school teacher, another one is Ronnie (Jada Pinkett). She was the girlfriend of his mentor who is now in jail.This is a very violent but powerful movie. It shows how it works in the ghetto. I don't know if it is like this but after seeing this movie I believe so. The performances are very strong. Tyrin Turner, Jada Pinkett and especially Larenz Tate give terrific performances. May be the movie is not for everyone because of the violence, but if you want to show the truth, you have to show the truth.
