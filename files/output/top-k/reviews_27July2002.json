It had a good cast. The actors and actresses seemed a little bit up-tight about their roles, but eventually they get more comfortable in the sequels The Spy Who Shagged Me & Goldmember.The plot is basically that back in 1967, Dr. Evil, who threatened the world, froze himself and the only person that was able to defeat him, Austin Powers, froze himself as well. Dr. Evil defrosted himself in 1997 and Austin was then defrosted too. Dr. Evil's latest plan is to steal a nuclear warhead and hold the world hostage for one million dollars...which was later changed to one hundred billion dollars. Austin, with the help of his new partner Vanessa, adapts to the '90s and together they eventually defeat Dr. Evil.There were many great laughs. The characters were creative like Alotta Fagina. I was cracking up the whole time that she was on screen or if Austin and Vanessa referred to her in some way. She's the village bicycle. Everyone's had a ride.Great perfomances by Robert Wagner as Number Two, Mindy Sterling as Frau, and Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington really made the movie. Mike Myers plays Austin Powers and Dr. Evil really well. This movie was very well done. I would recommend anyone that is a spy movie fan or just someone looking for a good laugh to rent this movie. I highly recommend seeing the sequels if you like this and even if you don't like this, I would still recommend renting the sequels because the sequels seem to get better as the series goes on.I gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.

Maybe it was the script, or the jokes or the general idea of the film but it just did not work in any way, it tried to rip off many aspects of the superhero genre in an intelligent way, but failed.Overall I have to say that watching this film was one of the most painful experiences of my movie loving life and if you ever come across a copy of this film i urge you to take the tape and burn it to prevent others from watching it. Believe me, it's for their on good.

It's just completely lacking anything to keep you interested. Sure all the people are back and all the jokes are in there that you would expect but it's just not funny this time.Now I expected to see a lot of the same things that were in the first two movies in this series. The Dr. Evil vs Scott game where Scott tries to talk and Dr. Evil tries to make him shut up, The Fat Bastard fixation on bodily functions and excrement jokes, and even the now classic Dr. Evil contacting the World Government and asking for a ridiculous amount of money to ransom the world were all right where I expected them to be.I'm not annoyed that they repeated all of this and I don't think that's the reason it wasn't funny this time around. I just think that on every one of the running gags they blew it. None of the actors seemed to be trying very hard and in almost every case the timing was off badly.The story is like some sad rip-off of the second one with less thought put into making it. The opening credits are funnier than anything else in the picture which makes for a really long movie.The girl from Destineys Child might be a hell of a singer but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Mike Meyers Austin character seems really forced and he doesn't look like he's having much fun doing it. His Fat Bastard character doesn't do anything amusing and is completely wasted. The lines he has are just gross without any comedy involved. It's almost like Meyers thought FB could just show up and we would laugh. The whole movie feels this way.Goldmember (the character) doesn't even have a previous funny appearance going for him. He's just gross without a point and if possible less funny than everyone else around him.The first one I didn't think much of when I first saw it but it got funnier with time and after running into it a couple of times I could appreciate it for what it was. Obviously Dr. Evil stole the movie. The second one was better because it focused a lot more on the Dr. Evil character and it seemed clear that Meyers had figured out what people enjoyed about the series.

Everything he touches, he cheapens. Jokes, plotlines, respectable actors credibility, everything. The seedy decline of the Austin Powers franchise slides to a disgusting new low in Myer's latest desperate cash in attempt in Austin Powers Goldmember. I won't ruin it for you, but I feel I owe you the advice...DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. The horror begins with a cheap, insencire cameorgy with uncomfaratable, hurried performances from actors painfully doing Myers a BIG favour. After that...well...coherence kind of crumbles away and yields to a disturbing collage of nonsencial, recycled, disgusting and sometimes frankly rather disturbing idiocy. Dr. Evil isn't funny. Austin Powers has lost all of his appeal entirely. His character has been reduced to a ring announcer in a circus of forced humour. He gleefully displays products for dozens of franchises, awkwardly shouts about the famous actors that have shown up for cameos, and looks generally more like Mike Myers in odd clothing than a fictional character. There was something about the original character as compared to this new, pseudo-self obsessive Michael Myers that made the whole 60s british swinger character original and hilarious. Dr. Evil and Austin Powers were JUST as hilarious. Now we have seen a disgusting degeration of talent. I felt raped by this movie. I felt ripped off, and I think Michael Myers owes me $6. He didn't have the right to do this to me. I can't get back those two hours I spent in front of that product placement laden feces party. The new character, Goldmember, is disgusting, offensive and disturbing. It is Myers trying to force humour from a situation that does not warrant any. Enough said. This is a shudderingly awful travesty of a film, and should never have been made. Take me seriously, it's a waste of your time.
