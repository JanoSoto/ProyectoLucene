The scene where a Pteranodon grabs Billy in the water was simply perfect, just like the rest of the movie. It was nice to see the dinosaurs reacting more with their environment this time around. E.g. moving bushes, eating grass, splashing water. Stan Winston also excelled himself. The mixture of CGI and live action was nothing short of perfect. It was nice to see the dinosaurs portrayed as animals rather than pure killing machines like in The Lost World. The Spinosaurus was a nice change from the T-Rex. After all. T-Rex had been the main star of every dinosaur movie since movies began. Not very 21st Century is it?The actors. Sam Neill really made his presence felt in this movie. He was his same old loving self from the first Jurassic Park. That was needed in this movie. Tea Leoni did a fine job acting Amanda - a much better improvement than Julianne Moore (Sarah Harding in The Lost World) who did not stop talking throughout the entire movie. The way Tea acted when coming face-to-face with a Velociraptor was spine-tingling. She was so scared. William H. Macy also acted his role well, as did Alessandro Nivola and Trevor Morgan. Laura Dern also made a very nice appearance.The script. Even though it was written as they filmed the movie, the script proved to be a success and had many memorable quotes. Alan's speech about Astronomers & Astronauts was by far the best piece of writing I have seen in a film in a long time.The ending was short but nevertheless good. The Pteranodons flying in the clouds was a perfect way to end a perfect movie. At last we saw something believable, unlike the San Diego scene in The Lost World. The main Jurassic Park theme was enchanting and enough to bring a tear to the eye. The original feeling of the original Jurassic Park came flowing back. Joe Johnson captured the Jurassic mood with his brilliant directing as did Don Davis with the score.As a conclusion, this movie does not deserve the bad comments it gets.  It is a true Jurassic Park. I recommend this movie to anyone. Buy the DVD or VHS now!

One of the greatest fantasy movies of all time!!!!! I remember first seeing this movie in the late 80's when I was 'bout 4 years old. I remembered enjoying it very much! This movie stayed at the back of my mind for years. It always kept popping up in my mind though every so often. It wasn't untill three years ago that I finally saw this fantastic film once again and it was great! One of the ultimate best ways to burn a babystitting Saturday night!!!!!!! Today i went to my local video store and purchased a copy, was the only one there and so I decided to not let this opportunity pass by. I had dinner once I got home and put in the movie for both myself and my three year old brother. We both loved it, my brother couldn't stop laughing. All the characters no doubt all make a great tribute to this film, however, both my brother and I loved that fox and the dog (can't remember his name), in my opinion he steals much of the show at some parts towards the end and is actually quite funny! This typical 80's fantasy is not only towards the children but for adults as well. It has a good message about life in it which I think was very well done. THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE. How true that is! Maybe 'tis just the way I happen to interpret them, but fantasy movies have always seemed to have messages about life in them and I happen to like that very much. This movie no where near has much of an impact as The Last Unicorn. This movie is a bit more of a lighter more comedic film with a simple nice message to keep the smile on your face and turn the film off happily. I think anybody should see this film at least once in their lives!!!! For people who are into fantasy and messages, I tell people to see this movie right before The last Unicorn. It will get you comfortable with the realm of fantasy and understanding. Then you can go on to the more powerful impact story. Anyways this movie was very nicely done, the actors were great, and I am glad to finally add it to my collection. I think it is fair to give this movie a 9\/10. Rent it and be amazed!

And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation. \tThe beast, however, seems doomed, as he shuts himself away, alone in his castle, taking up a reclusive existence far from everyone and everything.  Until, one day, a beautiful young woman named Belle shows up at his doorstep.  Belle is searching for her inventor father, Maurice, who disappeared while taking one of his latest inventions to the fair; and his trail leads Belle to the castle of the Beast, where she discovers he is being held prisoner, having run afoul of the Beast by trespassing while lost during the night of his journey.  Repulsed by the appearance of the Beast, Belle nevertheless strikes a bargain with him  If he will release her father, she will stay in his place.  The Beast agrees, with the stipulation that she must remain with him forever.  And as the Beast casts Belle's father from the castle and sends him on his way, Belle's fate seems sealed.  The only hope now for either Belle or the Beast lies in the remote possibility that true love may somehow prevail before the last petal of the enchanted rose falls.\tWith the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.  There's magic in this film, which holds an enchantment of it's own, and the message is presented ever so subtly and with a sensitivity that draws you in gradually until you are so caught up in the story that you become immersed and totally involved without being consciously aware of it.  It's a film that enfolds you and takes you where it will, and you go willingly.  A beautifully rendered and realized film that successfully transcends it's genre, it is the first animated feature ever to be recognized and rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Movie (quite a feat in itself, as it received the nod over such films as `The Fisher King,' `Fried Green Tomatoes,' `Thelma and Louise' and John Singleton's `Boyz N the Hood' that year).  \tThe talented cast supplying the voices of the characters includes Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (The Beast), Richard White (Gaston), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), Bradley Pierce (Chip), Rex Everhart (Maurice), Jesse Corti (LeFou), Hal Smith (Phillipe), Jo Ann Worley (Wardrobe), Brian Cummings (Stove), Alvin Epstein (Bookseller) and Kimmy Robertson (Featherduster).  There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made  As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.  And as they come together and the Beast takes Belle in his arms, sweeping her in dance across the elegant ballroom floor, it becomes one of those rare cinematic `moments' that are entirely transporting, and it does, indeed, take you away.  It's a memorable scene that exemplifies the quality and craftsmanship of this film, as does the scene in which the Beast is at last transformed; that such emotion can be captured and expressed in an animated film is an exemplary accomplishment, and it's all a part of why `Beauty and the Beast' is one of Disney's all time greatest films. \tOne final note  Stay for the credits to hear Alan Menken and Howard Ashman's title song once again, this time performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Hypnotically beautiful, this version has a magic all it's own and makes the perfect ending to an enchanting experience.  It's all a part of the magic of the movies.

After watching it myself, I would say I enjoyed it,  and was intruiged by it throughout, and while it is not fantastic, or all that unique, it has its moments.It is the real life story of George Jung, a guy from New England with ambitions as big as the lapels he wears in the film, who was the biggest cocaine smuggler in American in the late seventies early eighties.  It's interesting because he's not much of a hero, yet the film makes him sympathetic by giving him an unloving mother (and a very loving father who's too powerless to do anything) who seems to get most of the blame for George's behavior.  George leaves home for California, where people spend all day long screwing around on the beach doing pot, which the movie shows as the good days.  It's funny to say well it's cliche, cause we're talking someone's actual life here.  But just like any other coke movie (Boogie Nights, for example), the film starts off with the happy years, the great times, the fun.  It's all very sexy, shot fast, montaged, loud music.  Then of course there's the downward spiral.  This film's got about an hour of each give or take.  George also goes through death of loved ones, and betrayal after betrayal, and a bum wife, and a bad relationship with his daughter (Director Ted Demme suggests this is the theme of the film in the DVD extras; bad parenting begets bad parentings).  I must admit that the good times stuff does have some spice to it, and the bad times bits, especially the end, are very sad.  While I acknowledge and applaud the skill the filmmakers clearly had, I can always feel their influence throughout.  Calling Blow heavy handed would be putting it lightly.  Me and those puns again.

It was the first movie I ever went and very, very few movies I've seen since have that same magic. I think this movie captures the magic of Star Wars very well, though in somewhat different ways than episodes IV-VI.*SPOILERS BELOW* Like a lot of viewers, I missed the point with Jar Jar the first time I watched it. He's supposed to be annoying! He is the way he is to show that even those we don't like have a purpose as well as to help define Qui-Gon's (Liam's) character.  He tries Qui-Gon's patience as much as anyone, yet Qui-Gon believes all life has value and that everyone deserves a chance. This brings us to the key conflict of the movie - Should Anakin be trained as a Jedi or stay with his mother as a slave? Part of the greatness of the movie is that this question is left completely open for debate.The music, sound, and visual effects are wonderful in this movie as well and serve to draw you into another world rather than just look cool.  The acting of Neeson, McGregor, Portman, and McDiarmond was also wonderful.  I also really enjoyed the final lightsaber battles.  We see the serene and skillful Qui-Gon, the garish and graceful Darth Maul, and the developing character of Obi-Wan. Like Luke in the original trilogy, Obi-Wan goes from impatient and angry (enough to border on the darkside) to a hero both courageous and compassionate.My only criticisms are that I wished Jar Jar had grown some by the end of the movie and that I wish Anakin's space battle was more like those in the prior movies (or even the pod race).  If it had even had the other pilots interacting more and helping him (but Anakin still being the main hero), it would have more the magic of those other scenes.  It's missing a Wedge or Biggs or Dack type character.  All and all though, this movie rates in my all-time top 10 favorites.

The reason why is that it is so clear that Jackson made his LOTR with infinite respect and love for the original. It just permeates every scene and every frame, sets it alight even. This is a movie with a heart and a spirit, not just a cold box-office tally. Of course, there are instances where the adaptation from novel to script were a bit shocking for a Tolkien-buff like myself. And yet I had no trouble accepting Jacksons re-inventions, since they did serve to clarify the plot. After all, the movie is not made for the avid readers of the novel alone.Without giving too much away, I would like to single out a few points and scenes that stand out, both positive and negative. To start with  the latter I was a bit disappointed with the very liberal adaptation of Elronds council (that looked more like a bar-room brawl than an august meeting) and also Lothlorien seemed lacklustre in comparison to the books. Both chapters are also less important in the film as they are in the books, and I understand why. How does one bring to life the superhuman qualities of the Elves, after all? Liv Tyler works her limited resources as an actress to come up with a believable Arwen and it is wonderful to hear her speak the Elven language. But her sorceress-like behaviour at the Ford of Bruinen is probably too much for any Tolkien-reader. Luckily, the visual imagery sweeps away every trace of dismay at this very liberal interpretation of the story.I was, however, blown away by the beautiful scenes in the Shire, Isengard and most notably Moria. It is just so much more intense than anything I had ever imagined! And that is an incredible feat in itself. The scene with the Balrog in Moria is easily one of the most stunning scenes I have ever seen in my life.What is often the achilles heal in any effects-ridden blockbuster is the quality of the acting. Here, finally, we have an example where stunning CGI effects do not get in the way of a good plot and of truly remarkable acting. I found myself transfixed by Ian McKellens portrayal of Gandalf, and I would be very surprised if he did not snap up at least an Oscar nomination for his electrifying performance. And Elijah Wood captures every scene he is in, with the perfect mixture of insecurity and heroism that make Frodo such an amazing character. I did not expect anything as good as this! And though it does not do to make comparisons, I will say this one thing the cast of Lord of the Rings acts circles around their colleagues in Harry Potter or in any Star Wars flick. What I am also grateful for is the generousness with which Peter Jackson lets us drink in the beauty of each scene and set. No two-second shots of CGI-built cities here, but glorious, sweeping panoramas of incredible places. Isengard, Rivendell, Moria, and even Barad-Dur and (briefly) Minas Tirith are there in all their splendor.All in all, I found it extremely easy to surrender myself to Jacksons view of Middle-Earth and to take in the changes and additions in the script as they were presented to me.

What he found is the heart of the land for which he fought for (during the Civil War) and thought he knew. A transformational quest of consummation between the heart, cultures and ways of life. There are moments when I feel that the performances were not genuine enough, but if you think about it, the actors and movie staff had done a great job in capturing the essence of a vanishing culture. Costner's character for instance, is too naive and sweet for a white soldier of his time, but the movie must be made accessible to a wider audience in the US, hence the story is mostly told from his point of view. Having said that, the real heroes in this movie are the Native Americans, who tried to survive the wind of change brought by colonialization.The character of Dunbar has become a tool of narration that essentially tells us a beautiful story. A story about a vanishing culture, a people whose spirit and way of life are the very essence of America. The true America. When this movie was released in Asia, most of the local audiences labeled the movie as being a watchable bad-movie. The truth is the movie's contents resonanced with the local histories. We are doing exactly what the white colonial movement of that time, were doing against the native people. So those who didn't accept the message and learn from it, were disturbed.

I was only 13 years old, so the movie's contents were above my adolescent expectation. Furthermore all conversations in Sioux and Pawnee languages were subbed in mandarin; itself a foreign tongue for me.Today, ten years later, I just have watched it again in its original English format and I'm deeply at awe at the beauty of this film. Physically speaking, the cinematography, setting, lighting and costumes were very well executed\/done. But the real strength comes from Blakes' great storytelling and Costner's engaging directing. This film deserved all the credits it is dued.

He uncovers a terrorist plot to put tiny but powerful bombs in counterfeit goods and ship them around the world, soon he's up to his ears in CIA, mobsters, bombs and fake goods.The plot in one line - Van Damme saves the world from exploding jeans.  It's as stupid as it sounds... at every step the sheer ridiculousness of the plot will stay with you.  The plot tries to move away from the exploding jeans idea by introducing lots of double crosses, confusion and explosions - building to a visual showing the whole US being destroyed by exploding jeans.  But the daftness never goes away - in fact all the mobsters and CIA agents constantly showing up and switching sides just makes it all the more silly.The direction however is pretty good.  Tsui shows plenty of nice touches - zooming into and through electrical components etc (although it gets old quite quickly), and is good at handling action scenes.  In fact most of the fight scenes are pretty good - the final 20 minutes on a barge are good.  But the special effects in some of the scenes are poor - those big green explosions don't look right at all.  But Tsui does many to bring the fun out of some of Van Damme's skills - although there is some very bad wire work on the barge as Van Damme climbs up containers etc - twice he looks like he's being thrown around by invisible forces.  However, despite the fun action scenes - you'll still struggle with the sheer stupidity of the story and the laziness of some of the action, for example Van Damme walks out of a building just for it to explode killing everyone - and this happens several times!  Thrills like this are quite lazy considering.The cast are uniformly good - I'm surprised how many well-known names and faces were in this piece of rubbish!  Mind you, both Van Damme and Schneider are used to having to work with poor material - but even they struggle with this, Van Damme appears to be laughing at himself some of the times while Schneider (usually funny despite the material) is poor.  Paul Sorvino is another one capable of so much more who finds himself with a thankless role.  Similarly Michael Wong (you'll know his face) seems to turn up for a few action scenes but have nothing else to do.  Lela Rochon has the best role in the whole thing - she's sexy and dangerous and appears to be having fun, but even her material is a bit stale and she has to go through all the 'is she a good guy or a bad guy' stuff at some point.  Having said that she stills gives the best performance in the film (and well done for not doing a nude scene - you're sexy wearing whatever!)Overall the action scenes are quite fun to watch but the plot really sucks.  The performances from famous actors are mainly poor because of the material and the plot twists they must endure are stupid.....and after this I really don't want to see another person just manage to jump out of a building before it explodes! The blame for this must lie with Mr de Souza - he once wrote big hits like Die Hard, 48 hrs and errr...Commando.

Texas Rangers, Steve Miner's new take on the founding of the famous band of Old West law enforcers, was held back from release for almost a whole year, subjected to numerous re-edits, dumped into theatres without any fanfare, and greeted with apathy and pathetic grosses.  And you know what?  It's one of the most entertaining films I've seen all year.The film stars James Van Der Beek as an upright Eastern inventor's son who, on his first trip to the wild west, sees his parents and brothers killed before his eyes by marauding bandits.  Desperate for revenge, he enlists with the Rangers, a more-or-less vigilante band led by Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott), an ex-Confederate soldier with a vendetta of his own. McNelly's band of young gunslingers battle their way across the Texas border country, sniffing out bandits, doling out frontier justice, romancing the women-folk, etc., etc.In other words, Texas Rangers does nothing you can't see in any B-western on Saturday afternoon TV.  It's just that it does most of it a lot better than we've seen for quite some time.  After the rather too glossy American Outlaws, it's nice to get a Western with a gritty, authentic look.  The towns look appropriately small and weather-beaten, the costumes nice and trail-worn.  The only gloss here is on the guns...and I guess some of those young cowpokes are kind of glittery, too.Miner's direction is curiously hot and cold here.  He excels in quiet moments, dialogue and character, but his action scenes sometimes come up short.  He seems particularly to have a bad habit of always putting his camera in the wrong place when his quick action payoffs arrive (bullets hitting home, knives landing on target).  Still, the picture moves with lots of energy and excitement, and Miner is definitely to thank for that. Also, he scores in the big action climax, where the Rangers storm the desperadoes' Mexican hideout.  Here, the camera always finds the right spot, and the result is a fast, pulse-quickening blowout.A fine cast gives a lot of luster to the material.  James Van Der Beek has never been just another WB pretty boy, and he takes to the Western with grace and conviction.  Ashton Kutcher is okay as a hayseed gunman, but at times comes off a little too much like he's still on That '70s Show. Usher Raymond is nicely understated as a former-slave ranger, and while Rachael Leigh Cook's rancher's daughter is really superfluous to the plot, her gorgeous face is absolutely essential.  Fine supporting turns dot the picture, with standouts being Randy Travis and Robert Patrick as McNelly's lieutenants and Vincent Spano as a cocky, villainous gunslinger.Really, though, this is Dylan McDermott's show.  I have never been much of a fan of The Practice, and was stunned by the force and power of McDermott's work here.  He carries himself with solid-as-a-rock strength, and handles his quieter emotional moments with consummate restraint.  He also looks superbly the part, eyes glowering beneath his black hat, guns blazing away from the back of his horse.  Of course, it also helps that Scott Busby and Martin Copeland's screenplay turns McNelly into a complex and fascinating character.  Haunted by the memory of his wife and child, (stolen by bandits while he was off in the wars), dogged by a sickness that is bearing down on his soul, always trusting the gun and the noose over the badge and the lawbook, McNelly is a classic western hero, bigger than life and still movingly human.  It's a terrific performance, one of the best I've seen this year, and it makes me wish that they'll keep making westerns just so McDermott can keep acting in them.Of course, they won't keep making them if people won't get off their duffs and go see the good ones when they come along.

The special effects are over the top though and it tries too hard to be charming, but unlike the original film, the real world of Kansas is too harsh and nasty for little kids to appreciate. It is worthy to note that Fairuza Balk of The Craft was such an adorable and beautiful child in her youth, and quite a believable actress.

If you didn't know it, 'Twelve O'Clock High' was once many men's favourite war film of all time. How many people know about this now-obscure movie or realize the weight of its faded prestige, I  wouldn't like to guess. The number certainly decreases with each  generation. To  discover it on late night television, however, is the reward for the patient seeker of 'quintessentially American' films.'Twelve O'Clock High' is essentially the best depiction of a particular theatre of World War II--the extremely hazardous, aerial daylight bombing campaign over Germany. This film is the archetype for that entire lineage of war film. But it is memorable for its strong performances rather than well-directed battle scenes. In fact there are no battle scenes except for borrowed aerial combat footage. Yet few other films have the look of a 'big' WWII film better than this one--even though it is shot mostly indoors or in cramped cockpits.Gregory Peck plays an Air Force commander in England in 1943. His performance here is one of Hollywood's icons. Peck is at his best-- taut, controlled, and powerful;  flawless throughout every scene as a sensitive air commander forced to whip and browbeat a demoralized and resentful B-24 squadron back into peak efficiency. Peck runs roughshod over his new outfit, but he has a secret achille's heel--he fears he will grow too fond of the men he commands, the emotional link rendering him as ineffective as his predecessor (played by Gary Merrill).There are crisp, well-directed scenes where the stiff-necked Peck rides his men with extra fury in order to steel himself against all attachments. Yet as we and Peck learn by the end of the film, it is impossible. Despite Peck's best preventive measures, the squadron continues to suffer heavy casualties, and Peck, no matter how hard he resists, is drawn into an emotional attachment with the young pilots he must order into battle each morning. All soldiers know that comradery is the sharpest of double-edged swords during combat. You can never predict when you will lose a buddy--thus its a common practice for soldiers to keep their relationships light. This storyline has been treated loosely by a slew of later films, but never as successfully as it is done here. Every aspect of the emotional hazards of this type of wartime bond is fully dissected, and the film is filled with scenes containing extraordinary close-ups where the actor's facial expressions alone reveals the character's bitten-back response. This is especially gripping during the film's many vehement, man-to-man exchanges involving discipline, implied cowardice or dereliction of duty.In particular there are two wonderful subplots to the film look for the subtle interplay  between Peck and Gary Merrill (the brother officer Peck is forced to replace) with regard to the filling of someone else's shoes and an actual pair of flyer's boots that they borrow back and forth between them. Then there is another bit of business between Peck and a recalcitrant executive officer, Hugh O'Brian. The scenes between Peck and O'Brian, in particular, will almost make you wince, if you have ever in your life been chewed out by anyone or tried to 'measure up' to what you thought was expected of you.  The relationships between Peck and the other officers exposes issues about the choices men must make about each other and about their duty in wartime; and lays bare the emotions involved when they are forced to depend on one another; as well as what happens when they are forced to fail one another. Its simply outstanding. 'Twelve O'Clock High' stands quietly in the ranks of  the few really great American films, without any ego or hype.  If you can still  remember how important it can be to feel part of a team, even if it was only on a kickball or dodge-ball field that when you last had that feeling then you will admire this film. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor for his role as the reservist, and there are fine performances from every other actor as well. Millard Mitchell, an absolutely wonderful character actor, is without peer in a role he played often, that of a salty WWII general. And Peck, as we know, walks away with his role. If you have ever pondered  what the real meaning of over-used words like 'loyalty' and 'devotion' mean then this film is for you. The unfettered treatment of these hard-to-pin-down ideals is what makes it one of the few really great war films, for my money (yes, guys, sorry to say, its better than The Great Escape).

About ten minutes in, the first tear popped out of my eye, and by the end I was a wreck. Sometimes I will cry a little at the end of the movie, but never the whole way through like I did with this film. At the same time, it's not a schmaltzy film - it walks a very fine line in that regard, and there were perhaps one or two moments in the whole movie where I felt it was too OTT - given the subject matter, that's a great achievement, as it could have been really sappy - instead it has a beautiful calm touch to it, which is rarely heavyhanded. There are very funny moments in the film as well, which make it extra-great. Sean Penn is the star of the show - he is just fantastic in the role, and deserves the Oscar hands down. There are moments when you think he is going to get angry, and he doesn't, he's just gentle instead the whole way through- and in that way he's so different in this movie from all the others he's been in. What a great achievement he made here! The music is terrific- both the score, and the stunning revamps of old Beatles tunes. The little girl delivers just a fantastic performance - I think I'd have to say it's her and Sean Penn's chemistry along with the music which really makes this movie as good as it is. Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a satisfactory performance, but it somehow doesn't hit the same high notes as everything else in this show - I knew what her character arc was going to be straight away, and never connected emotionally to her in a big way - although she still looks so stunning. The cinematography in this movie is also quite interesting - it's quite free form, with a lot of moving around, and hand held, and zooming in and out. On one level that's being so done, and it thought it would obstruct the film - but somehow it gels in the most perfect and organic way. It is a great screenplay, and the ending is very satisfying and quite unpredictable in many ways - it says so much about the integrity and heart of this writer\/director. I would highly recommend this show to anybody.

Sometimes I will cry a little at the end of the movie, but never the whole way through like I did with this film. At the same time, it's not a schmaltzy film - it walks a very fine line in that regard, and there were perhaps one or two moments in the whole movie where I felt it was too OTT - given the subject matter, that's a great achievement, as it could have been really sappy - instead it has a beautiful calm touch to it, which is rarely heavyhanded. There are very funny moments in the film as well, which make it extra-great. Sean Penn is the star of the show - he is just fantastic in the role, and deserves the Oscar hands down. There are moments when you think he is going to get angry, and he doesn't, he's just gentle instead the whole way through- and in that way he's so different in this movie from all the others he's been in. What a great achievement he made here! The music is terrific- both the score, and the stunning revamps of old Beatles tunes. The little girl delivers just a fantastic performance - I think I'd have to say it's her and Sean Penn's chemistry along with the music which really makes this movie as good as it is. Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a satisfactory performance, but it somehow doesn't hit the same high notes as everything else in this show - I knew what her character arc was going to be straight away, and never connected emotionally to her in a big way - although she still looks so stunning. The cinematography in this movie is also quite interesting - it's quite free form, with a lot of moving around, and hand held, and zooming in and out. On one level that's being so done, and it thought it would obstruct the film - but somehow it gels in the most perfect and organic way. It is a great screenplay, and the ending is very satisfying and quite unpredictable in many ways - it says so much about the integrity and heart of this writer\/director. I would highly recommend this show to anybody.

Be forewarned.Between Waking Life, Mulholland Drive, and this one, Vanilla Sky,  I'm wondering when the hell *I'm* gonna wake up.  Dreams have had a rebirth in the medium of motion pictures, and why not?  They're fertile ground for material and give the director a much more broad visual landscape.  Remember when studios had animated bugs, haunted houses and comets battling each other at the box office?  And they say the movie industry's gone down the toilet.Vanilla Sky is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film called Abre Los Ojos.  That film was directed by Alejandro Amenabar.  While I admire Amenabar's work, (He went on to direct The Others.) his source material doesn't hold a candle to the remake by vastly underrated writer-director Cameron Crowe.  Crowe has done two personal and character driven masterpieces (Say Anything... and Almost Famous.) and I must admit that I had some hesitancy to see the advanced screening that I saw this evening.  Crowe's forte is small, personal films, and the previews would have us believe that this is some super-charged erotic thriller designed purely to earn untold millions.  But in reality, Vanilla Sky is anything but.  What I love about Crowe's films is that his characters always have the right things to say.  Not so much in the dialogue sense, but in the fact that one line an actor can deliver can give a very real sense of a feeling or an emotion.And the cast Crowe has wrangled to deliver these lines is top notch.  Penelope Cruz gives off great vulnerability that would not be normally seen when her sex kitten image is taken into account.  Cameron Diaz is very good at using her face to reveal dark undertones through a sunny demeanor.  Jason Lee has a believability that could convince one that he could walk off the screen and talk to you.  But the really impressive performance is by Tom Cruise, who plays a millionaire womanizer who is horribly disfigured after a car accident.  He hits his notes of bitterness very well, considering that he's Tom Cruise and has precious damn little to be bitter about.Vanilla Sky is so full of secrets that I've probably given a few away already with out having meant to.  Sorry about that. But this movie is about the domain of dreams, and the only problem I have with Vanilla Sky is at the end, everything is explained.  This is not bad in and of itself, but Mulholland Drive, David Lynch's far superior film, deliberately didn't explain anything.  That left the viewer with an urge to make up an explanation and become an armchair Freud.  This leaves you with nothing to say but Wow.  That was a good movie.***1\/2 out of 4    ","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"11 December 2001","score":"","review":"  There are spoilers here.
