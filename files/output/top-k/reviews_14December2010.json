I think that was stretching it.What is truly great here is the story it tells, starting about a half-hour into the picture Zola's involvement in the overturning of the condemnation of French army officer Alfred Dreyfus for treason. That condemnation was one of the great stains on French history, an example of anti-Semitism and rabid militarism. When the movie tells that story, all hearts are moved.But are they moved by the WAY this picture tells that story, or just by the story itself? It is the same question one might pose concerning The Diary of Anne Frank. The difference can be seen in a true masterpiece like Shindler's List, where the story, again, is deeply moving, but the TELLING of the story is equally masterful.I don't think Dieterle's telling of Zola's involvement of the Dreyfus story is particularly remarkable. Muni gives a very fine performance as Zola, certainly. But I don't think this script, which won an Academy Award for best writing, or Dieterle's direction of it, for which he got an Academy Award nomination, are particularly good, much less great.If you don't know the story, watch this, most certainly. It doesn't disgrace it. But if you know such great movies as Captains Courageous, Lost Horizon, and The Good Earth (it was a good year for Paul Muni), don't expect this to live up to those.It must have been a strange year for the Academy they also gave Louise Rainer the Best Actress Award, when she was easily bested by all four of her competitors Irene Dunne in The Awful Truth, Greta Garbo in Camille (yes, overdone, but great even so), Janet Gaynor in A Star is Born, and Barbara Stanwyck in Stella Dallas, a weeping but powerful picture. I also don't see how Joseph Schildkraut got the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his small portrayal of Dreyfus in this picture against Roland Young as Topper, or even H.B. Warner in Lost Horizon. Why the Prisoner of Zenda got almost shut out of the Oscars that year I don't understand either.

So naturally his films today are viewed as the products of the worst director of all time. Certainly Brided of the Monster or Plan 9 are nothing but reasonably well executed b movies but Glen or Glenda is actually different. It would be an interesting experiment to show the film to people who have never heard of Ed Wood and tell them it's by an intellectual French film maker and give people the opportunity to judge the film without preconceptions. Would they see Lugosi's character and performance as camp or as legimitate surrealsim or his use of stock footage as a collage technique? It is very easy to make fun of this film because in these days the story seems trite and even camp. When watching this film you have to bear in mind that cross dressing and homosexuality (although the film actually makes the point that both are not necessarily related) were not only taboo topics but plainly illegal. Wood tells the autobiographic story of a heterosexual male who cross dresses and has to come to terms with this urge and learn to accept himself. To my knowledge that is the first film to give anyone termed a degenerate by society depth and dignity. Seeing Glen or Glenda simply as a camp classic draws away attention from the fact that Wood was a pioneer and also very courageous because he is in the lead role. The film itself is not really badly made except for the use of stock footage only loosely related to the film. The structure of the film is actually rather clever. The acting is more or less competent (certainly not worse than a lot of other b films I have watched), there are no wobbly sets and the story is coherent. Often fun has been made of Lugosi's character. I don't really see why. Yes, it's odd but Lugosi gives one hell of a charismatic performance and we don not generally call every film that employs surreal elements turkeys.

Very timely and still relevant today. This story is so common today in Hollywood yet celebrities STILL get PR people to cover it up in the press. This doesn't help the matter.Jack Lemmon as up and coming PR man falls for the lovely Kirsten Arnesen, well-portrayed by Lee Remick. She is a young receptionist, he asks her for a date, and the first dinner while he is drinking she begs off, but he finally gets her to drink a chocolate brandy Alexander, which she loves. The realistic way this occurs is very telling. At first it is merely a social past-time.In time, Lemmon, stressed from climbing the corporate ladder finds solace with his wife when he gets home from the office. He complains when he loses a job, then is demoted. They attribute it to office politics, nothing more.Eventually,she becomes bored sitting at home watching cartoons with her five year old. It is making her stir crazy. She begins drinking alone while he is at the office. At first it is just to pass the time, but then, while Lemmon is away on business in Houston, she falls asleep after a day long drinking binge, and accidentally sets the apartment on fire.At one point Lemmon is hospitalized, and he meets Jack Klugman, portraying Hungerford, an advocate for Alcoholics Anonymous. He gets Lemmon to attend a few meetings where reality is faced. Kirsten, however, does not see her few drinks as a problem. She still loves her husband, but cannot stop. While Lemmon begs her to get help, he finally lets go. Will not spoil the ending of this excellent and sad story. It is a must-see for anyone who has issues with their friends or family, or who wants to learn the subtleties of this illness.Overall this is an excellent film because of its true life narrative, how they spiral down to a cheap apartment, no ambition and depression. The key is that as Hungerford tells Lemmon, some do not hit bottom the same, some never realize it till they are airlifted from a car crash. It is a lottery he says... but people still have a choice before it's too late.If you enjoy this you will certainly like Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend, as well as the more recent My Name is Bill W. with James S. Woods. Also When A Man Loves a Woman with Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia. A sensitive and important subject which is rarely accurately portrayed by the real Hollywood machine.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is an excellent moral tale of good against evil, it's a historical film as it was Disney's first full feature animated tale and it's paced along perfect with songs and uplifting scores. This film could be classified as a musical too.Originating from a Grimms tale this is a magical moral story that will entertain one of any age as it's message is timeless. The story centers around a beautiful and kindhearted princess named Snow White and shamefully she is forced to be a working slave that scrubs floors and all this comes from her wicked and jealous stepmother the Queen. Still that doesn't hide the charm that this princess has as she charms every creature in the kingdom. Interesting and somewhat of a fortune telling experiment is the Magic mirror telling the Queen that Snow White is the fairest one of all. This enrages the Queen as she has deadly plans for Snow White so it's time for this little princess to get away.Snow White goes on an uncertain journey adventure fleeing into the forest where she meets cute animals and later she befriends the odd and strange but lovable seven dwarfs named Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy and Dopey. Lessons are learned and love is developed as these little guys learn to be neat and clean and whistle and Heigh-Ho while they work at an old diamond mine! Only a favor is returned to Snow White as the Queen's wicked transformation is pushed over a cliff with help from her seven friends. And a nice beautiful return to life from the deadly apple is provided in the form of the prince's kiss. And they live happily ever after in this wonderful fairy tale.Overall one of Disney's best a good moral tale of good against evil proving that friendship helps and that beauty will win over the wicked.

It tells the story of a Maori family in New Zealand that went through great emotional turmoil. A wife was physically abused by her husband. A daughter was raped by her father's friend and she was so emotionally distraught that she committed suicide. This film gives insight into the culture of the Maori people of New Zealand. It's great to learn about the native people of New Zealand.

A psychopath goes around killing teenagers, sometimes for several days, before someone puts two and two together and realises that the murders are committed by the same killer. And they usually happen in public places like colleges, which only demonstrates the police's worthlessness. And once enough people have died to fill a feature-length movie, a sole survivor, usually a young woman, defeats the killer. And then he comes back in the sequel.I don't like slasher movies, but as a film viewer I try not to go out of my way to watch movies I'll hate. Life is too short, the movies are too many, so I only watch movies I think (hope) I'll enjoy. Stage Fright had been on my radar for a while as a rare exception that I'd probably enjoy watching, and indeed I did. In fact it's a pretty awesome horror movie, a pure cinematic experience. But before I extol its virtues, a few words about the director, Michele Soavi.Michele Soavi, Italian filmmaker, got involved in horror early in his career; before becoming a director, he worked as an assistant for several famous horror directors Lamberto Bava, Joe D'Amato and the great Dario Argento, who made Soavi his protégé. He hasn't had a prolific career and his fame rests largely on the 1994 cult movie Cemetery Man. Stage Fright was his directorial debut and it was a pretty good start.On a stormy night, a group of awful thespians, badly in need of money, rehearse a play called The Nite Owl inside a creepy theatre. Alicia, the main actress (Barbara Cupisti), hurting from a sprained ankle, sneaks out against the orders of the dictatorial Peter, the stage director (David Brandon), and goes to a mental clinic to see if they can give her something to ease the pain. There a lunatic escapes, hides in her car and follows her into the theatre. In a situation worthy of classic suspense movies, the actors unknowingly lock themselves in with the killer and then lose the key. From here on the movie follows the formula to its predictable conclusion. But Soavi, with ingenuity and unusual camera angles, turns it into a unique experience.Where to start with my love for this movie? Let's start with the play within the movie. It's about a killer in an owlhead mask killing women. It's sensationalist (victims seducing their own killer), gory and sexy, like slasher movies. But the actual movie isn't. Soavi surprisingly keeps the nudity to a minimum, moving the characters away from irresponsible horny teenagers who are punished for being teenagers to working-class people with bills to pay. By making an artistic setting integral to the plot also seems like Soavi is saying that the genre can be more ambitious without losing its identity. His mentor, Argento, had already shown a propensity for protagonists involved with the arts &#x96; musicians, novelists, etc.Next the killer is memorable. He has zero personality, he's not charismatic, he doesn't talk. But once you see him you won't forget him. He's a mixture of the creatures we see in our bizarre nightmares and mythology; dressed in an owlhead mask, we quickly forget we're watching a man and not some evil spirit beyond human reason.Although the dialogue is poor, the movie has its share of twisted, original scenes. In one of my favourites, the actors are rehearsing a scene where the owlhead killer murders one of his victims. The runaway lunatic enters the stage, dressed in the mask. Peter, thinking he's the actor, urges him to kill the victim, which he easily does, and no one realises what has just happened until a few moments later. Here the movie pokes some fun at horror fans' morbidity. I forgot to say gallows humor is part of the movie's charm too.The camera work and sound take this movie up another notch. Soavi is no Argento, but you can clearly see the latter's influence in his use of colors and the attention given to the sets and lighting (perhaps at the expanse of the actors) The movie takes most of its place inside a theatre and Soavi fills it with strange objects and films it from several angles to accentuate its strangeness. The music, mostly diegetic, is cleverly used here, sometimes by the killer to taunt his victims, and in one of the tensest scenes noise to distract him while Alicia tries to get the theatre door's key.Although it's pretty low-key, I'm prepared to say that Stage Fright uses the art of cinema better than many so-called serious movies. It may not have complex characters, emotionally-engaging stories or powerful messages, but there are many movies out there that are little more than animated novels, that prefer to do things that novels and plays can do too instead of using the uniqueness of cinema to their advantage. Stage Fright may not have a lot of food for thought but it's unmistakably a movie in love with its medium; the effect it has on the viewer comes from a clever manipulation and mixture of sound, image and movement. Many moments of awe and terror exist in this movie that couldn't be reproduced by any other medium. I can't pay a movie a finer compliment.

Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her boyfriend. Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again.

Basically New York construction supervisor Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) and Mexican photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek) have a chance meeting while in a Las Vegas Mexican restaurant queue for the toilet. They find themselves in bed together, and they part ways without seeing or hearing from each other for three months, until Isabel comes to find Alex. She tells him that she is pregnant, even though it was a one night stand and he used a condom, which was ineffective, but she is and she wants to keep the baby. Isabel thinks it is a good idea for Alex to meet the family before she tells them the truth, so she invites Alex to a big family get together dinner, where father Tomas (Tomas Milian) is a little bit sniffy about her boyfriend. Together they decide that it is a good idea to stay together, so in a Vegas chapel, with an Elvis Presley impersonator they get married, and they do actually get on as a growing couple. Of course the whole relationship has its problems relating to living locations and clashing of cultures, so there is the point when they argue and part ways again. But don't worry, Alex and Isabel find each other again on a rainy night on the road, and that is where their baby girl is born, and in the end they have a real wedding on a canyon, with the Elvis song Can't Help Falling In Love playing, which features the lyric only fools rush in. Also starring Jon Tenney as Jeff, Carlos Gómez as Chuy, Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon as Lanie, John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real father) as Richard Whitman and Stanley DeSantis as Judd Marshall. Perry is actually quite appealing, less sarcastic than Chandler, and Hayek is sexy and fun, it may be predictable quite a lot of the time and questionable in logic, but not a bad romantic comedy.

Fortunately, what the lyrics lack in charm they make up for in hard-hitting, fast-paced content to mirror so perfectly the real pace of its subject's life and death, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is catchy and helps us to forget how terribly transcribed was this excellent story. But it is Alan Parker's images and direction that bring it all to fruition and hereon out it will be impossible to create a better-loved adaptation.There is just something magical about this film in that we can be captivated by things so flawed, even shockingly so. I have already mentioned the lyrical style, but the title character herself is an excellent case in point. Eva Duarte de Perón, one of the most polarizing women in history, is portrayed here as a cynical whore--and yet she is absolutely adorable.I tend to move in social circles that, if asked, would say they loathe the likes of the Perons and the Peronistas and I could not help but be moved by Madonna Ciccone's heartfelt bellowing of Don't Cry for Me, Argentina. Ciccone is, of course, entirely to credit for her performance here. She takes a character that could have been a cynical, cold-hearted wench and seduces us so powerfully. Jonathan Pryce and Antonio Banderas as, respectively, Juan Perón and Che Guevara are good, but neither can hope to compare next to Ciccone, at least not so far as this film is concerned.It is difficult, nay, impossible, to comment on all the clever interpolations regarding Evita's life the mixing of the sacred and profane (at Mass she receives the Eucharist under both species; normally the Chalice--blood under species of wine--is reserved for the clergy or the extremely sick who cannot ingest the gluten host--body under species of bread), the bitter hatred of the Peróns from the military and the grande bourgeoisie (whose musical numbers are correspondingly flat and bitter; those who assert this piece is anti-Evita should pay more attention to the subtleties), the internalization of political energies as personal emotions and desires...Naturally, I still loathe Peronist politics and Eva Duarte de Perón is not to be let off the hook for the role she played in luring the masses to her husband's side, but was she really just a cynical plunderer? The film does not answer this question. When she dresses herself up to the nines in furs and jewellery, she claims she does it to give the Argentine people a good show--and so convincingly does she say it that we want, so badly, to believe it is true. She wants to be a rainbow--and what a rainbow!Complex, colourful, emotional and just generally bursting with life, this film the sort of cultural product that makes me eager to visit Latin America. I'm Argentina... and always will be! promises Evita. In this movie we see both good and bad of South America, both externally and internally to the person of Evita Perón. I've never been to South America and don't know just what its complexities entail, and I don't know if the real Evita was so rich in depth of character, but this South America entails quite a splash and this Evita certainly is.

It means that all types of people can be all types of things. Not every fat and ugly person is immediately charitable and nice, and not every person who looks physically attractive is a complete bore. That may be the norm in Hollywood, but not in the real world. I've known some real fatties in my day that were some of the most horrible people I've ever met. And I've actually met some very likable woman who also were physically attractive and made friends with guys who like to lift weights that weren't complete meat-heads.This film also says that if you happen to be a little overweight, like someone of Jack Black's build, that you're not allowed to have standards and that only you will be attractive to fat and ugly people. There could be attractive women out there who don't care that much about body type and actually like personality. Granted, the standards reflected by Jack Black's character's scarred psyche were totally and utterly unreasonable, it still doesn't mean that all he deserves is only the overweight and physically unattractive.Now, I really just want to talk in great length about one particular scene. The scene where Mauricio's girlfriend claims to have tickets to a Beatles reunion, where, supposedly, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr reunited with Eric Clapton taking the place of John Lennon.I have 3 VERY LARGE problems with this scene. 1 Eric Clapton does not sound anything like John Lennon in terms of guitar playing or voice. Whoever even thought of proposing that idea and putting into this script obviously knows nothing about The Beatles, or music in general. It was a stupid idea, and the Farelly Brothers were stupid for even thinking of it, let alone sticking it into this horrible film.2. George Harrison died a few weeks after this movie was released. They should've cut that scene out of respect. You'd think that if some famous person that is mentioned in a film, passes away such a short time after the film is released that the filmmakers would've done something to pay their respects to the individual. Like... Cutting the scene altogether! It added nothing to the plot anyway, beside Jason Alexander's character being disturbed by his cute girlfriend's extra long toe, which he had already explained earlier in the film, rendering this scene absolutely pointless. If the Farelly brothers had any sense of respect for the Beatles (which they obviously don't seeing as how this scene is still in the film), they would've done the right thing. But unfortunately, they haven't, and we're still stuck with this horrible scene.3. Even if you are mildly disturbed by a disfigured toe, George Harrison didn't die, and George, Paul, and Ringo decided to do a project with Eric Clapton (although it would be HIGHLY unlikely, almost to the point of blasphemy, that they would've called it The Beatles), you do not, under any circumstances, turn down an invite to an invitation-only, acoustic set of 3 of the Beatles and Eric Clapton! Even if you claim to not be a Clapton fan, it's still 3 of the Beatles! Mauricio was an idiot!As for the actors themselves, Jack Black and Jason Alexander are both very good in their roles, as 2 slimy but likable characters. Gwyneth Palrow was miscast, I think. She's an attractive woman, don't get me wrong there, but I think that Rosemary, as Hal saw her under his hypnotism, should've been played by somebody who looked more attractive than anybody else in the film, which would've at least provided a valid excuse why Hal pursued Rosemary, as opposed to other women, who honestly (under their hypnotic appearances, of course) seemed to me to be more attractive both physically and emotionally. Paltrow just seems more like the Girl Next Door kind of beauty, as opposed to the supermodel archetype, which is what I think the filmmaker's were going for with the character, as she appeared to Hal's hypnosis.Anyway, to sum up, nowhere near as good as any of the Farelly's 90's movies.

The scene where Mauricio's girlfriend claims to have tickets to a Beatles reunion, where, supposedly, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr reunited with Eric Clapton taking the place of John Lennon.I have 3 VERY LARGE problems with this scene. 1 Eric Clapton does not sound anything like John Lennon in terms of guitar playing or voice. Whoever even thought of proposing that idea and putting into this script obviously knows nothing about The Beatles, or music in general. It was a stupid idea, and the Farelly Brothers were stupid for even thinking of it, let alone sticking it into this horrible film.2. George Harrison died a few weeks after this movie was released. They should've cut that scene out of respect. You'd think that if some famous person that is mentioned in a film, passes away such a short time after the film is released that the filmmakers would've done something to pay their respects to the individual. Like... Cutting the scene altogether! It added nothing to the plot anyway, beside Jason Alexander's character being disturbed by his cute girlfriend's extra long toe, which he had already explained earlier in the film, rendering this scene absolutely pointless. If the Farelly brothers had any sense of respect for the Beatles (which they obviously don't seeing as how this scene is still in the film), they would've done the right thing. But unfortunately, they haven't, and we're still stuck with this horrible scene.3. Even if you are mildly disturbed by a disfigured toe, George Harrison didn't die, and George, Paul, and Ringo decided to do a project with Eric Clapton (although it would be HIGHLY unlikely, almost to the point of blasphemy, that they would've called it The Beatles), you do not, under any circumstances, turn down an invite to an invitation-only, acoustic set of 3 of the Beatles and Eric Clapton! Even if you claim to not be a Clapton fan, it's still 3 of the Beatles! Mauricio was an idiot!As for the actors themselves, Jack Black and Jason Alexander are both very good in their roles, as 2 slimy but likable characters. Gwyneth Palrow was miscast, I think. She's an attractive woman, don't get me wrong there, but I think that Rosemary, as Hal saw her under his hypnotism, should've been played by somebody who looked more attractive than anybody else in the film, which would've at least provided a valid excuse why Hal pursued Rosemary, as opposed to other women, who honestly (under their hypnotic appearances, of course) seemed to me to be more attractive both physically and emotionally. Paltrow just seems more like the Girl Next Door kind of beauty, as opposed to the supermodel archetype, which is what I think the filmmaker's were going for with the character, as she appeared to Hal's hypnosis.Anyway, to sum up, nowhere near as good as any of the Farelly's 90's movies. Represents unrealistic and hurtful stereotypes about certain types of people. A scene which spits in the face of the Beatles. So, watch Kingpin or There's Something About Mary and skip this one.

But oh God was it something! The movie is very beautifully shot, the cinematographer did a good job on this one. I just loved the slow motion montage scenes with a very interesting use of music. The song the director uses for these scenes was just amazing, it really gets to you, the song makes you focused on what is going on with in the scene, when there actually is not much going on. Except for the beautiful motion of the camera and the shot in the frame. The film has a very beautiful Mise-en-scene. In the Mood for Love is a some what beautiful love story between two charters, and a little touch of comic relief. Though this is not the typical love story, the director has used a different approach to show the story between the two characters. this film is like candy for your eyes and ears. defiantly a must see for film lovers.

Freddy Got Fingered was meant to evoke shock and laughter and I think it does both of those in spades.... Of course this movie is not made for everybody, so for the people that don't like dark bizarre comedy, I don't think u are versed enough in that type of genre to actually sit down and watch a movie you normally wouldn't and end up not liking it and think u can just sit there and right a knowledgeable negative review of the movie because u can't, it's impossible because u don't know enough about the genre, I mean someone who never listened to rap before just cant pick up an album and listen to it and really know if what they are listening is any good or not, why?? Because they don't know enough about the subject... So basically what i'm saying is that if u are a fan of the type of genre that Freddy Got Fingered is then u probably will love the movie and find it hilarious like I did, but if u are not a fan of the genre then chances are that u are probably not going to like the movie...

This can be very exciting for all involved and sometimes ends up being movie magic, and sometimes not. There are a lot of films with amazing ensemble casts, but the final product is a letdown.

The film (at all times) strains too hard to be a quirky imitation of the original Dr. Seuss cartoon and is simply not up to the job. It's a mess. Furthermore, none of the supporting characters are more than mildly entertaining. TAYLOR MOMSEN is a lovely little girl but she can't sing and she substitutes a look of placid, wide-eyed wonder for acting while Carrey heats up the screen with his overacted mugging. CHRISTINE BARANSKI has a flair for comedy but she's been seen to much better advantage in other roles and looks more than mildly uncomfortable as the woman secretly in love with The Grinch. Actually, most of the time she looks as though she can barely tolerate looking at him.There's a perky background score, some over-luxurious sets, some ghastly looking costumes for the Whoville residents, and the overall feeling one gets is that the slim plot has been expanded to the point where it overstays its welcome. The over stuffing doesn't just apply to the sets and costumes and special effects. The script tries to set up a flashback of how the Grinch became what he is, but it has a dulling effect that only succeeds in slowing down the ponderous pace of the film's last hourThe script rightfully won a Razzie as worst of the year, so the blame can't be placed entirely on director or star. My advice If you want to do justice to Dr. Seuss, do it with animation and not live actors.Summing up Not a shred of charm. It's as if Opie meets Tim Burton.
