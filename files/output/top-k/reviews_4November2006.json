I am a 22 year old Film Studies graduate who has seen more than his fair share of horror movies. I remember seeing Psycho at a young age and not batting an eyelid, I have sat through The Omen, The Blair Witch Project, Halloween and all sorts of movies designed to unsettle and leave the viewer sleepless for days yet never had any trouble at all. Movies just don't scare me...except this one.I sat down to watch this with my girlfriend late one night and she promptly fell asleep, leaving me nigh on alone in a darkened room where I was drawn completely into the movie. I have not seen any horror atmosphere crafted so expertly as it was here there is no blood or violence to speak of and bar one juddering warped door, no special effects. All that director Robert Wise has at his disposal is a very talented cast, an enthralling script and an expert lighting team and with them, he creates dread unlike any seen on film.The house of course is the real star and is treated almost like a character in its own right. Alone atop a hill and with a rusty iron gate guarding it, the featureless towers and Gothic architecture make for a suffocating presence. Simply put, the location scouts deserved a bonus for finding this beauty to set the movie in. You can easily imagine the restless spirits that haunt the corridors and keep the cast awake at night.The only gripe I have with this movie though is with the choice of the lead role. Not that Julie Harris isn't a talented actress because she is, it's just that her character Eleanor is the most irritating female lead I think I've ever seen. Sure, her arrival at Hill House takes place just after her mother has died, but did she have to be such a pathetic wuss? She's so much of a pansy she starts having panic attacks after barely setting foot inside the building and is forever whimpering and bursting into tears. Throughout the course of the movie, she seems to be tilting on the edge of a nervous breakdown and yet refuses to leave the house because she's happy. That minor complaint aside however, this is still the most engrossing horror film I've ever seen. I've never been able to comprehend how a movie could scare someone before but having seen this film, I now understand fully. And considering it's over forty years old, that's a hell of an achievement.

And really rather good, considering it's lack of similarities to the first movie. Blade once again, continues to fight the good fight against creatures of darkness. Only this time, it's not the vampires he's hunting. This movie brings forth an idea about a strain of vampires being 'created'. These 'reapers' aren't what you would call normal vampires, although there are a couple of similarities between the two. They still feed on fresh human blood, sunlight fries them to a crisp, and they have the customary supernatural strength that vampires have. However, they're a little harder to kill than ordinary vampires. And they're spreading at an alarming rate. The vampire nation, disconcerted by this new breed of bloodsuckers need help to eliminate them before they infect and turn the entire human race. So they call in Blade to help them. But can the two races put aside old grudges and unite to destroy this frightening new evil? This film was made almost 4 years after the first movie, and with a different director at the helm so the look of the whole thing is entirely different. Not a bad thing though. I think with sequels a lot of people expect the subsequent films to look and feel exactly like the first one. This doesn't always work. With Blade II, there's an entirely new set of characters, a new race of vampires, new weapons and Whistler undergoes some interesting changes between this movie and the first one too. It all adds up for another serving of deliciously dark action adventure.So we have Blade teaming up with the Bloodpack &#150; an elite group of vampire warriors going after the reapers to destroy them. (Interestingly enough, the bloodpack was supposedly put together to try and take Blade out.) Some of the Bloodpack are a bit laughable though. Priest is just a bad-tempered git with an Irish accent. Lighthammer was obviously cast for his build and not his acting. Verlaine does little other than pout and look worried, and Chupa spends the entire movie having a go at Whistler whilst clad in some kind of weird chain-mail vest. Snowman and Reinhardt more than compensate for the rest of the gang's mediocrity though. Donnie Yen, who is one of the coolest martial artists alive, plays Snowman (and earns his paycheque choreographing the movie's fight scenes), and Ron Perlman (a Del Torro favourite) gives an excellent performance as Blade's nemesis-esquire Bloodpack heavy, Reinhardt. Leonor Varela is quite good as Blade's number two, Nyssa. She's another black leather catsuit-wearing hottie of the vampire-movie universe, and like Selene in Underworld, she looks rather good. Although I'll never understand why women in action films feel the need to spend two hours constantly frowning. Maybe it's the universally accepted symbol of 'hardass female'. Hmm&#133; Luke Goss plays Nomak, the lead reaper, and is amazingly good in this film. Even though his accent seems to falter somewhat. He sounds like a cockneyfied Czech which is pretty remarkable. His overall portrayal is outstanding though, he looks dark, grim and murderous &#150; he even gives Blade a run for his money in the fight scene stakes.All in all, the plot line, characters, gore, action and soundtracks are sufficiently entertaining (keep an eye out for an echo of the infamous clubscene from the first Blade movie), and although not as good as some have said, it's enjoyable enough for what it is &#150; an action\/vampire movie.

Donnie Yen, who is one of the coolest martial artists alive, plays Snowman (and earns his paycheque choreographing the movie's fight scenes), and Ron Perlman (a Del Torro favourite) gives an excellent performance as Blade's nemesis-esquire Bloodpack heavy, Reinhardt. Leonor Varela is quite good as Blade's number two, Nyssa. She's another black leather catsuit-wearing hottie of the vampire-movie universe, and like Selene in Underworld, she looks rather good. Although I'll never understand why women in action films feel the need to spend two hours constantly frowning. Maybe it's the universally accepted symbol of 'hardass female'. Hmm&#133; Luke Goss plays Nomak, the lead reaper, and is amazingly good in this film. Even though his accent seems to falter somewhat. He sounds like a cockneyfied Czech which is pretty remarkable. His overall portrayal is outstanding though, he looks dark, grim and murderous &#150; he even gives Blade a run for his money in the fight scene stakes.All in all, the plot line, characters, gore, action and soundtracks are sufficiently entertaining (keep an eye out for an echo of the infamous clubscene from the first Blade movie), and although not as good as some have said, it's enjoyable enough for what it is &#150; an action\/vampire movie.

Fifteen years later to the day, he breaks out and returns to his hometown ...John Carpenter and Debra Hill's Halloween is one of the greatest films ever made, and a peerless example of how to make a terrific movie from virtually nothing. It was made by a bunch of talented, enthusiastic kids who had very little money or equipment, hardly any experience, no famous actors, an absurdly thin script and an extremely tight schedule. Despite all this they made a modern classic which looks sensational, is deliriously scary and exhilarating and, despite being ripped-off by a thousand other movies since, still holds up nearly thirty years later as a fabulous fright flick. The simplicity of the film is its key strength; the hoary old tale of the escaped lunatic on the loose gives it a delicious creepiness and there are no complex explanations or subplots to drag it down - Michael is just the boogeyman, coming to get you ! Many critics have read all sorts of sociological meanings into it (Laurie doesn't get killed because she's chaste ! Michael is a physical manifestation of the town's social repression !) but all of that is hokum. It's High Noon in Horrorland - he's coming, he's coming, here he is !! What sends it into overdrive is the cinematic treatment, which is a textbook in visual and aural craftsmanship, the generation of suspense and atmosphere. The crucial dynamic in it is the forty minutes following Michael's escape at the end of the first reel to Annie's death - during this period, nothing really happens, and yet everything happens. On paper, some girls walk around their hometown, a guy follows them a bit and a worried psychiatrist meets the local sheriff; that should only be worth about five minutes of screen time, but what is really happening is terrific character development (Hill's girl-talk dialogue is great), physical mapping of the houses and spaces that become so crucial later, and a fabulous slow-burning build of tension. The almost unbearable suspense of the last half-hour is the payoff, and what a payoff - if you aren't hiding behind the couch or clutching your girlfriend then it's time you started ! The performances are wonderful - Curtis is the perfect smart girl next door, Pleasence is a masterful sinister narrator, building Michael into some hideous fiend in our minds before he's even done anything, Loomis and Soles are both adorable and Castle's creepy balletic movements as Michael \/ The Shape make him the definitive Psycho With A Knife. The young (he was thirty) Carpenter's direction is simply faultless, and his eerie 5\/4-time piano music is one of the most memorable and effective film scores of all time. What more is there to say about this stunning movie ? If you're a horror fan, see it; if you're not, see it anyway and become one. Halloween became so popular (though not immediately) that it wins my vote for most influential picture of all time - aside from all the imitators and direct references to it (such as Wes Craven's Scream), many of the style elements have permeated through multiple layers of cinema. In virtually all Hollywood action movies for years it's been a cliché that the villain has to die three times (you think he's dead but no, he's up again), despite the fact that this never makes sense. They're all just copying Halloween (where it does make sense, because he's the boogeyman and you can't kill the boogeyman). If you're a movie geek, this film is bursting with trivia - the Cyphers character is named after the screenwriter of The Big Sleep, Haddonfield was the name of the town Hill grew up in, Carpenter does the voice of Loomis' unseen boyfriend, the killer was named after the British distributor of Assault On Precinct 13, the kids watch the 1951 version of The Thing on TV (which Carpenter later remade), and so on.

Among those who matter, he was a wonderful writer\/director whose work was pure genius and this is probably the general tenor of reviews of his films here on IMDb. It's funny, because while I am a huge fan of screwball comedy from the 1930s and 40s, I just don't 'get' Sturgis. I've seen almost every film he's made, and with only a few exceptions (such as HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO and THE LADY EVE), I thought most of his films were pretty ordinary. All too often, his films, to me, seem to try too hard and lack subtlety or timing. Some prime examples are the laughing sequences as the chain gang members laugh to a Mickey Mouse cartoon as if they are all on LSD and Rex Harrison's bumbling with a chair and other household items in UNFAITHFULLY YOURS. These moments were just too over-the-top and lacked the charm and timing of such marvelous non-Sturgis screwball comedies like BRINGING UP BABY or MY GIRL Friday.While PALM BEACH STORY isn't a bad film, it certainly didn't do anything to turn me into a Sturgiphile. It's a good movie, but has too many improbable and over-the-top moments to keep it consistent. Some examples would include the hunting club scene on the train. While generally this was a cute sequence, it went from mildly cute to just plain stupid--using slapstick when it actually detracted from the overall plot. Having these drunk hunters running amok shooting hundreds of shotgun blasts throughout the train car just wasn't funny--it was more like something Elmer Fudd would have done, not a real life person. Also, the film's ending is way, way, way too convenient and contrived--having identical twins of BOTH McCrea AND Colbert show up out of nowhere to marry the two jilted loves (Vallee and Astor)! This defies possibility and crosses over to just plain dumb.All this is a shame, really, as apart from a few embarrassingly bad scenes (indicating that the great Sturgis COULD have used an editor), the film is a breezy and cute romantic comedy. Some elements, such as the Wienie King, were weird but somehow worked and the overall momentum of the film was good.My suggestion is that you SHOULD watch this overrated screwball comedy,...AFTER you've seen all of Cary Grant's first (they were so much better on practically every level).

For me it's one of Polanski's best &#150; certainly not as good as Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, but far better than The Pianist, Knife in the Water and The Tenant.Maybe it gets swept under the carpet because of the lurid sexual content. Or then again it could be the melodrama that puts people off. Or it could even be the fact that it features Hugh Grant. But for me all those things work wonderfully for the film &#150; the sex gives it an honesty (there's no pussyfooting about in this film), the melodrama shows the absurdity of relationships and Hugh Grant&#133; Well, Hugh Grant just makes the film funny, albeit not intentionally. (He's much funnier here in a 'straight' role than he ever was in the risible Four Weddings and a Funeral.) But even though I personally love the film, I guess it's quite easy to get the wrong end of the stick. After all, the film begins with a ridiculously stiff middle class English couple on a cruise liner (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas). You can't help but wonder if it's a joke &#150; they seem to have wandered in from a Merchant\/Ivory production. And then you have Oscar (Peter Coyote), a disabled gargoyle of man who proceeds to tell Nigel (Grant) the story of his doomed romance with Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner). At the start it's all sweetness and light, with bad clichés thrown at you left, right and centre. And it's at this point that you either get Bitter Moon or you don't. If you take the film completely seriously you'll probably think it awful, but if you realise that Polanski, with the English couple (Grant wears a blazer and slacks for heaven's sake) and the sickeningly cute courtship, is having fun, then you just might have a grand old time yourself.Just to further illustrate how obvious it is that Polanksi's having a laugh, take the first flashback. We get a slow pan from the camera, a fade and then some hilariously unsubtle 'French' music begins playing. Polanski's tongue is rooted firmly in his cheek. And then in his narration Oscar spouts bad cliché after bad cliché. But rather than annoy, this works superbly for the character &#150; Oscar wants to be a writer; however it's painfully obvious why he's never been published. And then after that we get a scene where Oscar rubs Mimi's feet on a park bench and another where Oscar tells Mimi he loves her as they fly in circles on a fairground ride. This seems to be your standard Hollywood romance on steroids pumped full of saccharine.But just when you're getting nauseous, Polanski throws in a comic sex scene. Here, in the scene in question, we see Oscar and Mimi sitting at the breakfast table. At first they just look at one another, but then Mimi dribbles milk all over her breasts. And then after Oscar's licked it off, she administers a blow job. And to cap the scene off, the toast pops up out of the toaster as Oscar comes. Now how can anyone not enjoy a film with a scene like that in it? But although the breakfast scene is amusing, it also marks the point where the film begins to darken. With the initial thrill gone, Oscar and Mimi have to resort to sex toys and sex games to get their kicks. And although that works for a while, Oscar soon tires of Mimi &#150; she bores him.The scenes that deal with the breakdown of the relationship are probably the best. They capture the way relationships can imprison people and the way people can quickly tire of one another. And after Oscar's initial infatuation it's quietly shocking to witness how unfeeling he is towards Mimi &#150; he barely reacts when she gets on her knees and begs him not to leave her. He really doesn't care anymore.But just when you think this is bad, the film takes things even further. To try and get rid of Mimi, Oscar resolves to make her life a living hell. He treats her badly, embarrasses her at a party, and worst of all, abandons her just as they're about to go on holiday. But what makes it shocking is that it's actually kind of funny. I'm sure most people have had someone they want to get rid of but can't. Therefore it's actually kind of fun to live vicariously through Oscar. As he says himself, everyone has a cruel streak.And it's fun watching Nigel's reactions to these stories. He tries to pretend that he's listening out of politeness, but despite his protestations, he loves every moment. He's a consummate voyeur. And it was a twisted stroke of genius to have Grant play the part. He's a poor actor, but there's a lot of fun to be had in his reactions &#150; his response to Oscar's golden shower story had me howling. Oh, and Grant's dancing in the party scene at the end has to be seen to be believed.To say more about the plot would be to spoil all the wonderful twists and turns that follow (the ending is magnificent), but I really don't think there are many other films that quite as accurately capture the selfishness and cruelty that is inherent in many relationships (although, of course, the film takes it to an absolute extreme). And through Nigel, an absurd cliché of the repressed masses, we're asked to recoil and salivate along with him. As squeaky clean as we try and pretend to be, and as much as we yearn for love and romance, we're more intrigued by the strange and the perverse.

This seems to be your standard Hollywood romance on steroids pumped full of saccharine.But just when you're getting nauseous, Polanski throws in a comic sex scene. Here, in the scene in question, we see Oscar and Mimi sitting at the breakfast table. At first they just look at one another, but then Mimi dribbles milk all over her breasts. And then after Oscar's licked it off, she administers a blow job. And to cap the scene off, the toast pops up out of the toaster as Oscar comes. Now how can anyone not enjoy a film with a scene like that in it? But although the breakfast scene is amusing, it also marks the point where the film begins to darken. With the initial thrill gone, Oscar and Mimi have to resort to sex toys and sex games to get their kicks. And although that works for a while, Oscar soon tires of Mimi &#150; she bores him.The scenes that deal with the breakdown of the relationship are probably the best. They capture the way relationships can imprison people and the way people can quickly tire of one another. And after Oscar's initial infatuation it's quietly shocking to witness how unfeeling he is towards Mimi &#150; he barely reacts when she gets on her knees and begs him not to leave her. He really doesn't care anymore.But just when you think this is bad, the film takes things even further. To try and get rid of Mimi, Oscar resolves to make her life a living hell. He treats her badly, embarrasses her at a party, and worst of all, abandons her just as they're about to go on holiday. But what makes it shocking is that it's actually kind of funny. I'm sure most people have had someone they want to get rid of but can't. Therefore it's actually kind of fun to live vicariously through Oscar. As he says himself, everyone has a cruel streak.And it's fun watching Nigel's reactions to these stories. He tries to pretend that he's listening out of politeness, but despite his protestations, he loves every moment. He's a consummate voyeur. And it was a twisted stroke of genius to have Grant play the part. He's a poor actor, but there's a lot of fun to be had in his reactions &#150; his response to Oscar's golden shower story had me howling. Oh, and Grant's dancing in the party scene at the end has to be seen to be believed.To say more about the plot would be to spoil all the wonderful twists and turns that follow (the ending is magnificent), but I really don't think there are many other films that quite as accurately capture the selfishness and cruelty that is inherent in many relationships (although, of course, the film takes it to an absolute extreme). And through Nigel, an absurd cliché of the repressed masses, we're asked to recoil and salivate along with him. As squeaky clean as we try and pretend to be, and as much as we yearn for love and romance, we're more intrigued by the strange and the perverse. ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"4 November 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm not quite sure why Bitter Moon is so poorly regarded. For me it's one of Polanski's best &#150; certainly not as good as Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, but far better than The Pianist, Knife in the Water and The Tenant.Maybe it gets swept under the carpet because of the lurid sexual content. Or then again it could be the melodrama that puts people off. Or it could even be the fact that it features Hugh Grant. But for me all those things work wonderfully for the film &#150; the sex gives it an honesty (there's no pussyfooting about in this film), the melodrama shows the absurdity of relationships and Hugh Grant&#133; Well, Hugh Grant just makes the film funny, albeit not intentionally. (He's much funnier here in a 'straight' role than he ever was in the risible Four Weddings and a Funeral.) But even though I personally love the film, I guess it's quite easy to get the wrong end of the stick. After all, the film begins with a ridiculously stiff middle class English couple on a cruise liner (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott Thomas). You can't help but wonder if it's a joke &#150; they seem to have wandered in from a Merchant\/Ivory production. And then you have Oscar (Peter Coyote), a disabled gargoyle of man who proceeds to tell Nigel (Grant) the story of his doomed romance with Mimi (Emmanuelle Seigner). At the start it's all sweetness and light, with bad clichés thrown at you left, right and centre. And it's at this point that you either get Bitter Moon or you don't. If you take the film completely seriously you'll probably think it awful, but if you realise that Polanski, with the English couple (Grant wears a blazer and slacks for heaven's sake) and the sickeningly cute courtship, is having fun, then you just might have a grand old time yourself.Just to further illustrate how obvious it is that Polanksi's having a laugh, take the first flashback. We get a slow pan from the camera, a fade and then some hilariously unsubtle 'French' music begins playing. Polanski's tongue is rooted firmly in his cheek. And then in his narration Oscar spouts bad cliché after bad cliché.
