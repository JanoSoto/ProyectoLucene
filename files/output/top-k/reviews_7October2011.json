Thinking of myself as a hardened horror buff I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy every second, and I did, but I was terrified! The fact that I was heavily pregnant and had to return home to an empty house as my husband was working away should have been a deterrent, but I thought I'd be fine!My sister (who loathes horror movies with a passion) had seen Blair Witch the night before and said she was disappointed in it. She said it was over-hyped and simply not frightening. How wrong she was!The film starts with 3 student film makers, Heather, Josh and Mike, heading to Burketsville to make a documentary about the legend of The Blair Witch. They visit various sites of interest, speak to local people and hear the story of Rustin Parr. Parr was a local man who kidnapped, tortured and murdered 7 local children in the 40's. During his trial Parr claimed that he was possessed by the spirit of Elly Kedward, a woman burnt as a witch in the town of Blair. Burketsville was formerly known as Blair.The trio then head out into The Black Woods. They visit Coffin Rock, the site of the murder of 5 men. As the film progresses the students move further into the woods. Inevitably they become lost. What follows still scares me to this day. As fear takes over the sensibilities of the trio they begin to fight and argue with each other. Then, when night falls, strange happenings occur. Children are heard laughing, strange objects are left outside the tents. The students slowly descend into absolute terror. To go any further would mean including spoilers, which I always hate in a review. Needless to say the frustration of the students is passed on to the viewer. Shaky camera-work (this film being one of the first 'handheld camera' movies) only adds to the fear as we are unable to see what it is that is terrifying the students.I watched this film on the edge of my seat. On my return home I was physically afraid to be alone. I actually ended up staying the night at my parent's house! That's not to say that everyone will be afraid, judging by some of these reviews I think I must be an absolute coward for being scared by a film that some people have claimed made them fall asleep!But I will leave this review by saying one thingI went into labour the next day - 3 weeks early!

Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy & Sarah Jessica Parker delivered hilarious performances as a trio of witches brought back to life to cause mischief and mayhem on the scariest night of the year. Why anyone would give it a bad review is beyond me? This film is good for fans of all ages.In 1693 the Sanderson sisters Winifred (Midler) Mary (Najimy) and Sarah (Parker) convicted of witchcraft and the death of Emily Binx (Rivera) were hanged by the townsfolk but before their death Winifred vowed they would return when a virgin would light a candle and the life force from all the children will be for them.Approximately 300 years later in 1993 teenager Max Dennison (Katz) has moved with his family from Los Angeles to the town of Salem Massachusetts, where the legend of the Sanderson sisters is still popular he believes it to be nothing more than just a stupid Halloween story made up by a candy company. He ends up taking his 8 year old sister Dani (Birch) trick or treating while his parents attend a party at town hall. They stop at house where Allison (Shaw) the girl Max has a crush on and classmate from school is holding a party, she tells them her knowledge of the sisters and that the house they lived in is now a museum. Wanting to impress his dream girl they all go to the old house where Winifred's spell book still is in a glass case.

I had seen Charlie Chaplin shorts in the past and I've always found them quite humorous, but for whatever reason it wasn't until today I sat down and finally watched a Chaplin film. A good friend of mine said this was his favourite one. Without hesitation, I bought a cheap copy of 'The Gold Rush' and I can say that it has become one of my favourite comedies.The film is about Charlie Chaplin who is playing his iconic character, The Tramp who in this film is a lone prospector in Alaska looking for gold. He barges into a seemingly abandoned cabin and begins gnawing on a bone only to find out the cabin is owned by a man named Black Larson. Soon, another prospector named Big Jim arrives. A blizzard begins to accumulate and for a while The Tramp, Big Jim and Black Larson are stuck together with a lack of food. Later on, The Tramp goes into town and experiences the 'thunderbolt' when he meets Georgia. The rest of the film chronicles The Tramp's hilarious antics as he tries to impress her whilst still being a prospector.I saw the 1940s revision of the film. Instead of the traditional black screen that silent films cut to for dialogue, Chaplin made the wise decision to remove them and replace them with narration and another soundtrack which allows the film to present itself more fluently and with greater appeal to more mainstream moviegoers. While I didn't see the original unchanged cut, I do feel that I would enjoy this one more anyway. No need for an elitist attitude in regards to film alteration in this case. I do feel that it was a good thing to do.The humor is The Gold Rush is naturally fantastic and doesn't really come off as outdated to me despite the fact that comedy of this kind is not really prevalent in modern cinema. The Gold Rush makes use of physical antics by Chaplin expressed through his use of forks and buns to 'dance' in the later part of the film. Besides this, slapstick and humor based on putting characters in situations is used. A great example of the slapstick is the scene in which The Tramp is trying to get belt for his pants but gets a dog on a leash whilst he's dancing. Also, how could one forget the classic scene towards the end in which The Tramp and Big Jim are stuck in a house sitting on the edge of the cliff, needing to be careful to make sure their weight doesn't cause it to fall off? There are so many aspects of this film that have paved the road for modern comedy and been parodied everywhere in popular culture.The acting is also fantastic. Despite being silent, you can see that Charlie Chaplin understands completely what he is doing. None of the acts look deliberate or forced and flow with the movie. It's not saying enough to call the man a comedic genius. Another great fact is that Chaplin also directed and wrote this film. His direction is fantastic and as I said, the humor is well written and translates onto the big screen well. The performances from Tom Murray, Mack Swain and Georgia Hale are also very likable.To say the least, this was Chaplin's film and his alone. Since he wrote, directed and acted in it, he clearly had a lot of control and knew exactly what he was doing. What is the outcome? One of the best comedies of all time and possibly one of the most important films to happen to cinema. The Gold Rush is an excellent film and I recommend highly. Don't miss it, it's great fun!

The rest of the film chronicles The Tramp's hilarious antics as he tries to impress her whilst still being a prospector.I saw the 1940s revision of the film. Instead of the traditional black screen that silent films cut to for dialogue, Chaplin made the wise decision to remove them and replace them with narration and another soundtrack which allows the film to present itself more fluently and with greater appeal to more mainstream moviegoers. While I didn't see the original unchanged cut, I do feel that I would enjoy this one more anyway. No need for an elitist attitude in regards to film alteration in this case. I do feel that it was a good thing to do.The humor is The Gold Rush is naturally fantastic and doesn't really come off as outdated to me despite the fact that comedy of this kind is not really prevalent in modern cinema. The Gold Rush makes use of physical antics by Chaplin expressed through his use of forks and buns to 'dance' in the later part of the film. Besides this, slapstick and humor based on putting characters in situations is used. A great example of the slapstick is the scene in which The Tramp is trying to get belt for his pants but gets a dog on a leash whilst he's dancing. Also, how could one forget the classic scene towards the end in which The Tramp and Big Jim are stuck in a house sitting on the edge of the cliff, needing to be careful to make sure their weight doesn't cause it to fall off? There are so many aspects of this film that have paved the road for modern comedy and been parodied everywhere in popular culture.The acting is also fantastic. Despite being silent, you can see that Charlie Chaplin understands completely what he is doing. None of the acts look deliberate or forced and flow with the movie. It's not saying enough to call the man a comedic genius. Another great fact is that Chaplin also directed and wrote this film. His direction is fantastic and as I said, the humor is well written and translates onto the big screen well. The performances from Tom Murray, Mack Swain and Georgia Hale are also very likable.To say the least, this was Chaplin's film and his alone. Since he wrote, directed and acted in it, he clearly had a lot of control and knew exactly what he was doing. What is the outcome? One of the best comedies of all time and possibly one of the most important films to happen to cinema. The Gold Rush is an excellent film and I recommend highly. Don't miss it, it's great fun! I can't wait to see more of Chaplin's films.9\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"7 October 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When I saw the shorts to this movie my first thoughts were, this looks stupid. and the more previews that I saw the more that I thought that it was stupid. Then my friends saw it and were telling me how good it was and quoting is constantly. I was slowly convinced that I might appreciate it. Then I said to my friends Gill and Nick Abbott that I wanted to see it and they said that it was horrid. Still, I hired it out and watched it deciding to form my own opinion. Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery would be a good movie if Mike Myers could act. I feel that his ability in this movie seriously undermines it. Now Mike Myers was in Wayne's World (playing I believe Wayne) and he played his role quite well, but Austin Powers just annoyed me. I thought that he tried too hard to create Austin Powers and it didn't come out well. Dr Evil (who went to Evil University for 6 years to get a PhD) was a little better (he was also played by Mike Myers) but I still think that it dragged the movie down. My friends quoted it much better than Myers delivered the lines. Another thing is that some of the jokes were overdone and were no longer funny. Whenever they had a henchman die they showed us that the death actually hurt people, but after a second time I was not really wanting to see another one. The toilet scene after Powers was defrosted went on too long and so was the penis enlarger joke. The joke about Danger being Austin Powers' middle name was clever but it was delivered so bad that it wasn't funny. Austin Powers is essentially a comedy which tries to poke fun at how 60's ideals are so out of date. Powers still wants to sleep around but in the 90's it has become somewhat frowned upon (according to the movie). Both Austin Powers and  Dr Evil are in another time in which all of their ideals are unknown. In the 60's Powers is a sex symbol and Dr Evil is a master villain but in the 90's all of Powers' charisma has gone and Dr Evil's schemes are no longer viable. For some reason Dr Evil wants to destroy the world but where does that get him other than watching millions of people suffer. The movie also pokes fun at how spy movies has the good guys caught and slowly tortured to death in a way that they can escape from where the 90's kid is simply telling his father to kill them with a gun. But then a gun is boring while a swarm of mutated sea bats are interesting. Austin Power, international man of mystery has a lot of potential to be a good movie but it fails to live up to what it claims to be. The opening was cool yet it failed because it didn't come out that well on the screen. When you think back to the movie you can see how it could have come out but what you see on the screen is only a pale image.

Case in point, the jolly Austrian haus-frau near the start of the movie and the afore-mentioned Trevor Howards character.The film features Joseph Cotton as Holly Martins, who plays a somewhat naive American pulp western writer. He is invited to post-war Austria, which is divided into four by the victorious allies, by his friend from high school, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When he arrives, he finds that Limes has been killed in a car accident under suspicious circumstances. The movie traces what happens when he decides to play amateur sleuth to find out what really happened to his friend.It turns out that Harry was a black marketeer who, it is implied, is responsible for causing deaths by supplying watered down penicillin. So the over-curious Martins finds out some unpalatable truths about his old friend. The plot is complicated further by Limes actress mistress, a Czechoslovakian who fears that she will be deported to Russia if it is found out she is not Austrian.

There is a really nice scene near the start of the film, set on a spiral staircase, in which dialogue between Holly Martins and an old building porter (Paul Hörbiger) is the first Martins finds out that his friend Harry has been killed in an automobile accident.I also loved the way the scenes in the sewers were lit and shot, very dark and atmospheric.

In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly.After seeing that Lime has no regrets about his crimes, Holly decides to help the international police trap Harry. Harry being a slippery character, manages to elude them all down the sewers and it ends up it is Holly who ends up shooting his old friend, as he also no longer trusts him.The scenes just before the denouement, although to my mind, sometimes pretty clichéd, with men all standing about really grim and suspicious looking in the gloomy streets are again, very nicely done for the time.There is much to admire in the movie, it being way ahead of it's time in some ways, the scenes of a bombed out Vienna, the shadows everywhere, like the shadows that were still being cast by WWII and the on-coming threat of the cold war. A vast city, often wet and damp looking, which appears almost entirely empty, adds to the air of mystery. The scene in which Welles first appears from the shadows of a doorway is one of the most famous in movie history. The camera is often tilted off the horizontal axis to help portray the sense of lurking danger and foreboding in the city at that time, a time when desperation drove people to highly questionable and criminal activities when often there was no choice. However, it seems clear that Harry was simply making profit out of the misery of others.Although not intended as a historical document, it can also be appreciated in a historical context. Cities all over Europe were lying in ruins and the repercussions of the war were still being keenly felt.I enjoyed the stylistic feel of the piece and can appreciate why some people love the movie.

Like, was this so-called horror movie really supposed to be scary? Was it!!?? Why does it seem to me that about every story that's ever been adapted for the screen from a frickin' Stephen King novel has somehow been destined to become a pathetic, little dud? Eh? Why? And, yeah, I know (all too well) that Stanley Kubrick was considered to be one of the absolute greatest Directors of his time, but, all the same, The Shining was an unquestionable misfire on his part.My opinion about The Shining's dud-factor comes from a clearly obvious flaw in Kubrick's directorial abilities. Yep. That's right. Put quite plainly, Kubrick did not, I repeat, did not understand the genre of Horror, at all.Had Kubrick comprehended the Horror genre to its fullest, then The Shining would've (most definitely) ranked right up there (in my books) with such brilliant horror classics as The Innocents (1961) and The Haunting (1963).

The driver accepts, and the car ends up crashing over the end of a bridge, landing into the water. Several hours later, while the police investigate and onlookers gather, Mary emerges from the water apparently unscathed. She carries on with her life, and goes ahead with taking her new job as a church organ player in a nearby town. Things become strange as she keeps seeing the ghostly figure of a strange man, and Mary finds herself repeatedly drawn to an abandoned carnivale.What is ultimately a micro-budgeted B-movie, Carnival of Souls has gained popularity as the years have gone by and is now considered a cult classic. With a budget estimated at around $33, 000, director Herk Harvey achieved stunning things with so little. The limited resources are visible on screen though, as the sets, cinematography and supporting actors do little to flatter the movie. But Carnival of Souls manages to overcome these relatively irrelevant limitations with a fine performance from Hilligoss, and plenty of atmosphere to boot. It's clear to see this must have been a big influence on the likes of George A. Romero and David Lynch.The film also takes some brave stylistic and artistic risks. Mary finds herself staying in a small hotel with the strange and lecherous John (Sidney Berger). While at first he seems to be your typical idiotic B- movie supporting character, he soon becomes something far more sinister. In a rare scene where we leave Mary, we see John talking to one of his loser friends in a drunken frenzy, talking about how he'll soon have her. There's a real feeling that John is bordering on raping Mary, and remember, this is a 1962 American film., when things were unheard of. Also, Mary's emotionless responses to his advances may be touching on lesbianism. It may just be because of what is revealed at the end, but it seemed to me to certainly touch on this possibility.It really hits its stride in the dream-like carnivale sequences. While the final few scenes are predictable and can be guessed in the first ten minutes or so, it's the execution that is so alarming and exceptional. The dead arise from the water, ghostly white and emotionless. They dance their waltz of the dead amongst the brightly lit fairground in several strange, soundless, and sped-up sequences that evokes the expressionist silent horror films of the 20's. It is truly beautiful, and has influenced a thousand lesser horror films. Truly one of the finest B- movies ever made, and a great example of how so much can be done with so little.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"7 October 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Mary (Candace Hilligoss) is in the passenger seat of a car with her two friends when they are challenged to a drag race by some boys.

Sure, traditions and rituals are the tools that men use to construct a feeling of immortality, as a community, hence to overcome the fatality of death. But this is even truer for a community persecuted for centuries and that couldn't even afford an attachment to a land, so the only land Jews could never leave is the one that could never leave them. Hence the powerful symbolism of the title letting the music speak for the soul of your community on a place that you might fall from. The title offers a poetic vision of a tragic historic reality, conveying the feeling that joy can anytime be followed by tragedy. So, if it can't be eternal, well at least traditions are.Still, the content of these traditions can appeal to every culture, especially oriental patriarchy, life in community, hard work, social status, marriage, and of course, Family. And all these values are incarnated by a poor farmer and milkman with five daughters Tevye, played by Topol with an electrifying mix of authority, charisma, magnetism, self-derision and some vulnerability betraying his penetrative eyes in the most dramatic moments. Topol is the friendly host of that epic journey, breaking the fourth wall to share his thoughts with us, and from the way he apostrophes God, who's like the film's second character, he powerfully embodies both the pride and the doom of being the 'chosen people'. Topol as Tevye is a larger-than-life character, carrying the film with such intensity that whenever he's absent, you feel like something is missing. In a way, he indirectly points out the small weaknesses of Fiddler on the Roof.Despite their narrative significance, I didn't feel emotionally engaged by the growing romances through the story's recurring subplots, although I genuinely liked the first two husbands, Motel the tailor and Pershik, the revolutionary student (good old Starsky). But there was something too predictable in the way it was handled. You could tell the movie's point was about traditions being undermined by modernity. First, a marriage with a non-promised, then a non-religious man with Tevye giving his blessings and permissions despite a first negative reaction ... but the twist was on the third daughter marrying a gentile, too much asking for. This time, no blessing, no permission, no on the other hand reasoning, it was the kind of deathblow to tradition that would have made Grandma Tzeitel roll over in her grave. I wouldn't have minded the predictability, but when a movie, even a light-hearted musical, spans three epic hours, you got enough time to figure out everything, then the feeling introduced by the first act inevitably fades out, especially after the exhilarating Lechaim part. Besides, there wasn't much in these daughters that could really grab me, the part where they were singing was too Disney-like and the best love story in my eyes, was still between Tevye and his wife Golde (Norma Crane). But trusting Jewison's direction, I wondered why such a long film for a a plot that wouldn't present any twists, I guessed maybe it was a deliberate choice in order to 'distract' the viewer from the real dramatic aspect incarnated by the anti-Semitic threat, the persecutions and the pogroms from the Russian empire, 'distract' as a way to elevate ourselves from this inexplicable level of violence, and keep us in a good spirit, on the roof, listening to the sound of this violin, whose notes are getting more melodramatic.After the wedding sequence, the film takes a more serious course until the inevitable happens when people leave Anatevka for Palestine, Europe or America. Tevye invites the metaphoric fiddler on the roof to accompany him for the new exodus, as to reaffirm the obligatory attachment to tradition, with two fingers pointing at the sky. I felt the ending of the film was a downer but the more I thought of it, the more I realized it was a bittersweet ending. In a powerful moment after the infamous pogrom that ruined the wedding, Tevye raises his hands in disbelief; it's hard not to see how this scene foreshadows more tragic events that would face the unfortunate descendants of these people. And while remembering this scene, from Topol's eyes, I understand and I respect how the movie speaks for a whole community.And because I knew I was going to evoke some tragic events, I'll end this review on a more positive note by fulfilling my promise with Homer Simpson's quote I have rented Fiddler on the Roof and I will watch it. Anyhoo, can I have $50,000? This desire for money I will forever associate with the iconic If I Was a Rich Man, one of the greatest moments in musicals history. Topol has such a communicative energy that I wish I could have joined his yubby-dibby-dibby-dums, to a feverish and passionate dance. This whole 'Ya Da' part, and the extraordinary To Life song with the dancing scenes evoke a sense of male fraternity reminding me that I share the same roots of these people if we go till Abraham or the hell with it that we're all part of a same humanity, with traditions, as a clever way to forget about death and raise all our glasses &#x85;&#x85; to Life !

This whole 'Ya Da' part, and the extraordinary To Life song with the dancing scenes evoke a sense of male fraternity reminding me that I share the same roots of these people if we go till Abraham or the hell with it that we're all part of a same humanity, with traditions, as a clever way to forget about death and raise all our glasses &#x85;&#x85; to Life !

I consider this film to be Cary Grant's greatest comedy performance! Priscilla Lane as his fiancée\/wife was such a beautiful, sweet blonde, sweet as honey, the two naughty aunts with their bad habits of poisoning lonely old men with their arsenic-laced elderberry wine were superb; John Alexander as the wacko-nutcase Brewster brother who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt was also a standout Charge! as he runs up the staircase, as he was as the fallen angel Doremus in Jack Benny's HORN BLOWS AT MIDNIGHT (1945), and Raymond Massey in full horror makeup (including some very realistic-looking stitched scars on his face) as a diabolically evil Karloff-knockoff horror character, Jonathan Brewster, is fantastic! Of course, those of us who have done our homework on this picture know that Karloff played this very role in the Broadway play!

He was extremely angry by this and decides to look into this matter further.Apparently,the recipient happens to be Raymond, his brother.

Charlie takes Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get his share of the inheritance. But during this road trip to Los Angeles,Charlie learns about Raymond's autism, which he initially believes is curable &#x97; resulting in his frequent frustration with his brother's antics. He also learns about how his brother came to be separated from his family, as a result of an accident when he was a baby. Raymond also sings I Saw Her Standing There by The Beatles like he did when Charlie was young, prompting him to realize that his older brother is the protective figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named Rain Man. Charlie proves to be sometimes shallow and exploitative, as when he learns that Raymond has an excellent memory and takes him to Las Vegas to win money at blackjack by counting cards. However, towards the end of their trip Charlie finds himself becoming protective of Raymond, and grows to truly love him. Eventually,he has gained a new brother and mellowed his materialistic attitude as he develops a new relationship with his brother.It is a classic movie due to Dustin Hoffman's performance alone as the autistic Raymond Babbit. I have never seen someone who portrayed a character with all honesty and accuracy. Also commendable is the chemistry between Hoffman and Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbit.Watch this movie for this reason alone.Also,it deals with the theme of a relationship between brothers and of people suffering from autism.This seemingly ordinary film as most part of it is a conversation in road trip between Charlie and Raymond presents more than what is actually does for it is truly a heartwarming film.A 10\/10 rating is only justifiable. Highly recommended.Definitely,one of the best movies during the 80's.

He also learns about how his brother came to be separated from his family, as a result of an accident when he was a baby. Raymond also sings I Saw Her Standing There by The Beatles like he did when Charlie was young, prompting him to realize that his older brother is the protective figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named Rain Man. Charlie proves to be sometimes shallow and exploitative, as when he learns that Raymond has an excellent memory and takes him to Las Vegas to win money at blackjack by counting cards. However, towards the end of their trip Charlie finds himself becoming protective of Raymond, and grows to truly love him. Eventually,he has gained a new brother and mellowed his materialistic attitude as he develops a new relationship with his brother.It is a classic movie due to Dustin Hoffman's performance alone as the autistic Raymond Babbit. I have never seen someone who portrayed a character with all honesty and accuracy. Also commendable is the chemistry between Hoffman and Tom Cruise as Charlie Babbit.Watch this movie for this reason alone.Also,it deals with the theme of a relationship between brothers and of people suffering from autism.This seemingly ordinary film as most part of it is a conversation in road trip between Charlie and Raymond presents more than what is actually does for it is truly a heartwarming film.A 10\/10 rating is only justifiable. Highly recommended.Definitely,one of the best movies during the 80's.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"7 October 2011","score":"","review":" This movie was based of a play of the same name, though the play must have been written after 1932 as there is a comment on a second Roosevelt becoming president, but more on that later. This movie is described as a classic, I just think it is absolutely hilarious. There is so much in this movie that makes it great though to really appreciate the comedy you need to watch the movie. After seeing this I have decided that Frank Capra is one of the greatest directors both this and Mr Smith Goes to Washington are brilliant movies, and his comedy is in such away that it is hilarious without being rude, crude, or simply stupid. One thing about the comedy in this movie is the way that Carey Grant is so animated. His facial expressions are something that must be seen rather than talked about, and the comedy in this movie is very visual. Some of the scenes in this movie that I like are the poor cab driver left waiting outside for the entire night and at one stage he is asked to hail a cab, which he does, before he realises that he is a cab driver. (Hey, I reckon I ought to play the cab driver! I wonder if it is in the original play). Another are the subtle political jokes about Teddy Roosevelt. The Brewster household are basically nuts and one of them thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, which leads to a lot of interesting comments, especially if you know about American History. Capra has constructed this movie as if it were the stage play. While watching it, you feel as if you are watching the play. Only the first two minutes are removed from the play, so I believe. Capra has done a very good job at it though. The BBC versions of the Shakespeare plays are similarly done but turn out really poorly. Arsenic and Old Lace could be viewed by a live studio audience. One thing that the movie raises is the question of euthanasia. It wasn't really a question back then, and is joked about as in this movie, but now it is very topical. The old ladies think that it is okay, but their son, Mortimer, is horrified, while John is shocked that they have killed as many people as he has. The movie is does not have the ladies prosecuted for this act, but it emphasizes that it is murder. Mortimer ends up committing the ladies to the mental institute. They do not get away free. Another interesting thing about the movie is the name of the sons. The evil son has a normal name, John, while the good son has a rather sinister name, Mortimer. Arsenic and Old Lace is a classic movie and deserves all the rave that it receives. I loved the movie and others that I have spoken to are just as thrilled about it. I have been approached about doing it as a play, and now that I think of it, I would love to do it.
