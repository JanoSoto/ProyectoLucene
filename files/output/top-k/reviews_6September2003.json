Sure, the plot gets a little more convoluted than it absolutely has to be, but in a way it's because William Goldman's screen adaptation of his brilliant novel takes into account the all-too-human character flaws of his heroes and villains, and the mistakes people make when they're fearful and paranoid. While the performances are uniformly fine (with Roy Scheider deserving a place in The Suave Hall of Fame for his portrayal of Doc Levy, a.k.a. government agent Scylla. If he hadn't been so charismatic and engaging, his murder in mid-film wouldn't have such impact, and the movie would suffer for it), I think the special secret ingredient that gives MARATHON MAN its punch is the atmosphere. The naturalistic, sometimes washed-out color palette almost lends the film a black-and-white film noir look. Almost every person in the film is angry, cynical, emotionally wounded, and\/or generally negative in some way. And what really struck me was that on screen, it seems like chaos and disaster are exploding all over the world. Look at the riots and bombings taking place in France in early scenes with Doc and Janeway (nicely subtle homosexual subtext there, by the way). Also, if you listen carefully to newscasts in the background, you'll notice there's nothing but bad news murders, suicides, all kinds of violence all over (including the chicken game between the old Jew and Szell's brother as the film begins). MARATHON MAN isn't a happy film -- even when our hero wins, he's already lost so much his victory seems hollow indeed -- but it never fails to grab and haunt me each time I watch it. If you love the film, you'll want to own the DVD not only for the superb letterboxed print, but also for the terrific extras, including both new and vintage making-of documentaries with Hoffman, Scheider, Keller, Goldman, producer Robert Evans and other major MM players, as well as rare rehearsal footage and the original theatrical trailer.

It works on a psychological level that can't be compared to traditional horror attempts. If you find yourself trying to get into it, you're probably wasting your time.I think this movie is best watched alone on TV at night, or with a small crowd that won't interrupt with banal comments. In fact, I don't think you should talk at all during this film because so much of it relies on being there and staying there until the end.I think many people are too shallow or short on patience to get drawn into it, and that accounts for most of the negative reviews. They are simply not describing the same experience had by those who got into it. For me, that happened shortly after the interviews with the townspeople, especially the one with the strange lady at the trailer park. When this film works on someone, it becomes reality, and reality can be overwhelming if you're lost in the woods and the sun is sinking. Negative reviewers try to dissect it with criticisms of the plot and pacing that have no bearing on how it works for a receptive mind. It doesn't need a traditional plot or special effects because it wasn't meant to work on an in-yo-face level. Notice how short some of the bad reviews are? It's as if they were told to hate it and just want to join the fray. Many probably saw it in a big, sarcastic crowd that prevented them from reaching the trance-state that creates so much of the tension.It's too bad I'm defending this film by attacking the personalities of its detractors, but I'm afraid that's necessary! To sum it up, if your main musical fare is Hip Hop or Britney Spears you'll probably find Blair Witch dull. But if you can sit still and enjoy slow classical or ambient soundscapes you may find yourself mesmerized. Flaky viewers (or those who'd never understand their own flakiness) need not apply.

And, although a few plot holes are pleasant, it was a feasible opening.===Warning, Spoilers Ahead!==> An alien facehugger has stored itself on Ripley's ship. It wakes up, and causes technical difficulties on the ship, causing Ripley and friends to be ejected to destination unknown. Ripley finds herself here in a new surrounding. It is not immediately clear what is going to happen to her, until we learn more about where she is. Alien 3 studies more views of the Alien. Alien saw us watching a group of spacemen and a single bureaucratic company agent witnessing the horrors of the alien. Aliens saw the military witnessing, and taking actions against the alien. Alien 3 sees the reaction of civilians, or rather, prisoners. These prisoners have not seen much more than each other for a long time, and are doubtful of this interloper at first. Led by the strong 'Dillon', wonderfully played by Charles S. Dutton, they take on a fundamentalist religion. As the inmates are slowly killed off, they all become more doubtful of their religion and began to take more drastic measures to ensure their survival. This evolves into a wonderfully apocalyptic showdown between Ripley and the Alien, and, nearing the end we see a familiar shadow of government greed, adding another side to the film and it's implication.It's not a bad film, but Alien Resurrection is. Believe in this film, and forget about resurrection.It'll make a lot more sense!

The weird thing is that I still love this movie now. The plot follows the three Stouffer brothers, Marty, Mark, and Marshall, following their dreams to get out of their small town and dead-end future as mechanics and go out and film animals. Not just any animals, though, the biggest bad-a**es of the animal kingdom, which results in a few thrilling, sometimes comic adventures for the three brothers. The brothers want the piece de resistance of their film to be an infamous cave where a group of bears are reputed to sleep together, the rumor that actually starts their trip and leads to the biggest adventure of all. This movie is full of hope that dreams can come true, as cheesy as that sounds, and is even better as it is a true story based on the naturalists behind Wild America.

Mercifully, Tim Burton seems of a different mind.

The script doesn't try to bite off too much; simply showcasing three of Wood's best movies, delving into his penchant for cross-dressing, and rooting itself in his friendship with Bela Lugosi. Johnny Depp is superb as the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., embodying the desire to follow your dreams no matter what stands in your way. He never asks the audience for sympathy, no matter how bad things get. He wants only to continue his quest to make movies.

Whenever he tries creating moods, whether in 'Apes, Batman 1 & 2, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks!, or Edward Scissorhands, he is always trying to make something funny or lighthearted about his topics.  Imagine if Kubrick did the same, would he be so great?With Ed Wood, Burton tries to create a story about an unfathomable loser.  Depp, one of the most diverse actors I have ever seen--no wonder Burton keeps using him, is wonderfully inspired, but it isn't him or anyone else dominant in the cast--not even Martin Landau--that is the standout.  I am, of course, referring to Vincent D'Onofrio's fleeting moment as Orson Welles.  Had Welles himself seen it, I bet he'd have thought it was effective.  Granted, Burton strips such a vibrant character of much detail in order to make a B&W version of Robin Williams' character in Dead Poets Society.  Still, the amount of elaboration that Vincent puts into the character, even the mannerisms, make him the highlight.  He also has some great delivery with milking the audience, if they're smart enough to catch it.Burton uses his camera more like a stage appliance this time.  He probably knew that this was going to bomb upon release, but he made it anyway.  Thus he is no different than the character he is making.  The fact that Burton's movies keep winning or getting nominated for Makeup awards shows how he focuses on altering the acting element of filmmaking to create props out of people, not characters.  Best example Beetlejuice.Overall, not as good as the IMDb rating would suggest.  I still think Batman Returns is Burton's best work.  This isn't too bad, though, for the extreme minority that it appeals to.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

Clint Eastwood made these movies for a pittance and I saw his movie unforgiven, I think he acts better when he is paid a pittance!. Eli Wallah, an incredible actor and the best of the lot. If cheek bones were any indication of meanness Lee Van Cleef,probably the meanest looking character ever. The haunting, resonating music of the master Ennio Morricone that hugs the landscape and made this movie a Classic. When you are fed up with oil dripping fast food like Beutiful Mind. Lord of the Rings, this is an Italian gourmet. The ace is Sergio leon a Lawyer turned Film Maker and marvellous at it. Eli Wallah, from Spagetti Western's to God Father, one versatile actor. There will never be a trilogy like-GOOD the Bad and the Ugly.
