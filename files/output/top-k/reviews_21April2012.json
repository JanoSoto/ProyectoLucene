It's about an ogre and a donkey who save a princess from a castle guarded by an evil dragon. The princess was cursed by an evil fairy godmother and every night she turns into an ogre, but every night she waits up in the top of the tower and is hoping that her true love will come for her and break her curse by kissing her. Instead an ogre named Shrek comes with his pal named Donkey and saves her. Shrek kisses Fiona (the princess's name) and turns Fiona into an ogre forever, but Shrek and Fiona end up falling in love and they all end up living happily ever after.Please watch the movie because it is a must see!
