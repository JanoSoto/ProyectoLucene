Harrison Ford makes the role his own in the amazing adventure flick, Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fantastic epic about the race between America and Nazi Germany to claim the fabled Ark of the Covenant, a super-weapon infused with the power of God.As Indy is returning from a botched adventure in South America, he is recruited by the US Government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do and use it as a weapon in WWII. Indy first has to find the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, the key to finding the Ark in the ancient city of Tanis. He travels to Nepal, meeting up with his ex-girlfriend Marion who was the daughter of his Mentor, Abner Ravenwood, and after a bar fight, the two go to Egypt to find the Ark with the help of Sallah, an Archaeologist in Cairo. As they search for the Ark an old enemy of Indy's returns, Rene Belloq, who has his own personal reasons for finding the Ark.Raiders of the Lost Ark is probably the best Adventure film ever and one of the greatest films ever made. Harrison Ford is Iconic as Indiana Jones, everyone's fav hero. He's gruff yet charming and kicks major butt. Karen Allen is a perfect leading lady for the film. She's attractive but 3-dimensional and she's not a helpless heroine also. True, she isn't as tough as Indy, but she holds her own in both the barfight and the massive Streets of Cairo fight sequence. Paul Freeman is a perfect villain. He is, and I quote, 'A shadowy reflection' of Indiana Jones. He's as charming as Indy but is sinister and evil, and it's impossible to say who is the better Indy villain Belloq or Donovon. John Rhys-Davies is charismatic and funny as Sallah and his scenes are unforgettable while Denholm Elliot has a good small role as Marcus Brody that is quite memorable.Crew wise, this film is just as good. This is definitely one of Steven Spielberg best works together. Same as his buddy George Lucas. The two of them should work together on other projects (Cough*Star Wars*Cough). John Williams score is the stuff of legends, most importantly the famed Raiders theme. Lawerence Kasdan's script is brilliant and worthy of the famed Director.

While this is probably his most well-known activity, Jones is also a popular historian, specialized on the European Medieval period, who has published several books on this and other subjects of ancient history. In 1983, after the dissolution of Monthy Python, Jones published a children's book named The Saga of Erik the Viking, where he explored this interest of him in the story of a young Viking. Years later, he wrote the screenplay for a movie version inspired in the children's book, although dealing more mature themes. Erik the Viking was the name of the movie and it is possibly the movie that best describes Jones' persona, as it mixes the style of Monthy Python comedy (although it is not a sketch-based movie) with Jones' special taste for ancient history.The film is the story of Erik (Tim Robbins), a viking who after the murder of an innocent woman during one of his tribe's expedition, discovers that he is not really happy with the whole raping and pillaging customs of his people. Looking for advice, Erik asks the wise old woman Freya (Eartha Kitt) for a solution, and she tells him that since Fenris the Wolf has swallowed the sun, the age of violence, Ragnarok, has begun. Worried by this revelation, Erik decides to travel to the legendary land of Hy-Brasil, in order to find the Horn Resounding, the magic artifact that will take him to Asgard and awake the Gods. With this in mind, Erik prepares an expedition and sails to adventure; but Halfdan the Black (John Cleese) and Keitel Blacksmith (Gary Cady) are not so happy about finishing the lucrative business of war, so both decide to follow Erik in order to make him fail.While the movie is not exactly an adaptation of Jones' children's book, his love for history is still all over the movie, as it's filled with countless references to Norse myths and Viking culture. Python's style of comedy is present in a subtler (although no less hilarious) way, and like in his previous work, Jones uses Erik to make fun of concepts as the social establishment, war, and religion. This last theme is represented in a very interesting way, with the concept of faith and beliefs playing a very important (and amusing) part of Erik's quest to awake the Gods. However, despite Jones' love for history, people expecting a true and realistic representation of a Norse Edda will be sorely disappointed, as Jones takes many liberties for the sake of comedy (and probably to make his movie easier to understand for people not familiar with Norse mythology).In this his third solo effort as director (two of the Python films were co-directed with Terry Gilliam), Terry Jones shows the evolution of what was started in Life of Brian, as while his movie is a story of epic proportions, he keeps the film focused on his characters and their many funny traits. This really works for the movie, as while Erik's crew is numerous, each one is highly detailed and Jones dedicates enough time to get to know everyone of them, developing them as characters and as a team, and making the audience care for them. This take is also beneficial as lessens the damage done by the poor special effects (due to low-budget) of some scenes, although to Jones' credit, the way he fuses realism with magic surrealism is also a brilliant move. The somewhat restrained way that Jones uses to approach to comedy this time (keeping it focused to the plot instead of using sketches) is also more in tone with Life of Brian than with the other Monty Python films.Tim Robbins is perfectly cast as Erik, as his really becomes this good hearted, yet extremely naive adventurer, decided to stop the wars of the world. Robbins' career was at an early stage when he did this film, but already shows his talent and is very good with Jones' style of comedy. Monthy Python's John Cleese is fabulous as Halfdan the Black, and steals most of the scenes he is in. Overall the actors playing Erik's crew are really excellent and truly are a key factor in this success of the movie. Imogen Stubbs plays Aud, the princess of Hy-Brasil who tries to help Erik in this quest. Stubbs is effective for the role, although sadly the rest of the cast overshadows her without problem. Mickey Rooney and Terry Jones himself have small yet very funny roles too, and both make the most of their small scenes.Personally, I think that the movie's biggest problem is actually Terry Jones' background with the Pythons, as this may make fans to expect something keeping the style of the troupe's previous films. While Erik the Viking does have it's fair share of Python's humor, it would be wrong to call it a Python movie. Other than the probably too high expectations it probably won't meet, the movie really doesn't have many flaws and it's an excellent satire that delivers the goods without false pretensions. True, it has some serious problems with special effects that could had been better with a bigger budget, but Jones makes the movie work with his mix of wit and charm, as well as his knowledge of medieval cultures.Erik the Viking is definitely an unfairly underrated comedy that while never on the level of classic Monty Python's Flying Circus, it provides some fun intelligent comedy paired with an interesting story of action and adventure. It's flawed, but has a special charm that just makes the whole movie work without problem. As a satire it's really good, and despite its few historical inaccuracies, it's a nice piece of Viking action.

Indy laughs and shrugs it off, telling Donavon to talk to his Father, Henry Jones. However, Donavon has. Henry Jones is missing and now Indy has to take up the mantle of finishing his Dad's search to find the grail. He and Marcus travel to Italy to find a marker telling where the Grail would be entombed and meet Dr. Elsa Schneider, an Austrian Archaeologist who falls in love with Indy. They find the second marker entombed with a dead knight of the First Crusade and Indy goes then to rescue Henry from the Nazis, who are after the Grail as well. However, a terrible surprise awaits for both the Joneses at the Castle of Brunwald in Austria and the Last Crusade to find the Holy Grail begins! The Last Crusade is a little more comedic than Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it still is one awesome film. Why? Five words Harrison Ford And Sean Connery! Ford returns again to play his beloved character and Mr. James Bond himself plays Indy's old man. Harrison Ford is, as usual, gruff but charming while Sean Connery is fantastic as a bumbling yet charming professor. Denholm Elliot's role is much bigger than his cameos in Raiders and he has some great scenes. I was disappointed in John Rhys-Davies, however. I was expecting the usual charismatic Sallah from Raiders and instead Sallah is the comedy relief of the film, plus, he's a little more stereotypical than in Raiders. The villains, on the other hand, are specatacular. Julian Glover is pure evil as the Grail Obsessed Walter Donazvon, a man using the Nazis power to claim the Grail and live forever. Alison Doody is the first Indy girl to fall in love with Indy and be the bad guy at the same time. She and Ford have good chemistry and she is often torn between her loyalty to Germany and her love for Indy. Finally, there's the Nazi Commander Vogel who is sinister beyond belief and has some great scenes also.The action in this movie is worthy of an Indiana Jones film and washes away all those bad memories of Temple of Doom. Right from the start we get a cool fight scene all over a Circus train, followed by a chase scene in Venice, a riveting Escape from Castle Brunwald, a sweet Dogfight, and an amazing battle scene onboard a nearly-unstoppable tank. Finally there's the scenes where Indy must retrieve the Grail and save his dying father, which are pure magic. Also, the way Donavon gets his comeuppence when he drinks from the false Grail is very satisfying. John Williams, as usual, provides his usual spectacular scores while Steven Spielberg and George Lucas do well directing the Last Crusade. All in all, all three Indy films are fantastic and should not be missed by anyone. They should satisfy us, by the way, until the much-wanted Fourth Indiana Jones film is finally released.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector ","genre":null},{"date":"16 February 2007","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Dear Readers, After a cool flashback, Indy finally captures the Cross of Coronado, the first relic he ever went after.

After delivering it to Marcus Brody's Museum, he is approached by Walter Donavon, a mysterious Relic Collector, to lead an expedition to find the Holy Grail. Indy laughs and shrugs it off, telling Donavon to talk to his Father, Henry Jones. However, Donavon has. Henry Jones is missing and now Indy has to take up the mantle of finishing his Dad's search to find the grail. He and Marcus travel to Italy to find a marker telling where the Grail would be entombed and meet Dr. Elsa Schneider, an Austrian Archaeologist who falls in love with Indy. They find the second marker entombed with a dead knight of the First Crusade and Indy goes then to rescue Henry from the Nazis, who are after the Grail as well. However, a terrible surprise awaits for both the Joneses at the Castle of Brunwald in Austria and the Last Crusade to find the Holy Grail begins! The Last Crusade is a little more comedic than Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it still is one awesome film. Why? Five words Harrison Ford And Sean Connery! Ford returns again to play his beloved character and Mr. James Bond himself plays Indy's old man. Harrison Ford is, as usual, gruff but charming while Sean Connery is fantastic as a bumbling yet charming professor. Denholm Elliot's role is much bigger than his cameos in Raiders and he has some great scenes. I was disappointed in John Rhys-Davies, however. I was expecting the usual charismatic Sallah from Raiders and instead Sallah is the comedy relief of the film, plus, he's a little more stereotypical than in Raiders. The villains, on the other hand, are specatacular. Julian Glover is pure evil as the Grail Obsessed Walter Donazvon, a man using the Nazis power to claim the Grail and live forever. Alison Doody is the first Indy girl to fall in love with Indy and be the bad guy at the same time. She and Ford have good chemistry and she is often torn between her loyalty to Germany and her love for Indy. Finally, there's the Nazi Commander Vogel who is sinister beyond belief and has some great scenes also.The action in this movie is worthy of an Indiana Jones film and washes away all those bad memories of Temple of Doom. Right from the start we get a cool fight scene all over a Circus train, followed by a chase scene in Venice, a riveting Escape from Castle Brunwald, a sweet Dogfight, and an amazing battle scene onboard a nearly-unstoppable tank.

The Lady Eve is one of the best examples of that, With the success that Preston Sturges had with Christmas in July and The Great McGinty the year before, Paramount decided now they could trust Sturges with a big budget and an A list pair of leads. In fact they borrowed Henry Fonda from Darryl Zanuck and signed the then freelancing Barbara Stanwyck.This was a banner year in the career of Barbara Stanwyck. She did Meet John Doe, The Lady Eve and Ball of Fire in the same year, the last one she got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The Lady Eve came first and paved the way for a similar role in Ball of Fire.She's a street smart dame in both films, in the Lady Eve she's a shill for her conman father Charles Coburn and in Ball of Fire she's a nightclub singer and moll for gangster Dana Andrews. In both films she falls for rather withdrawn, naive, and bookish sort of men who bring out the mother instinct in her. In fact she has similar nicknames for them, Gary Cooper is called Pottsie and Henry Fonda is Hopsie.Stanwyck, Coburn, and Melville Cooper are a trio of con artists who are looking for a fresh pigeon and they find one in Henry Fonda who is a millionaire's kid. Fonda today would be called a trust fund baby, but he has an interest in science and he's coming back from the Amazon on a boat when meets up with the slick trio.Of course Stanwyck falls for the shy and bumbling Fonda, but there are many hurdles to overcome before these two find happiness.This may have been Henry Fonda's best comedy part. And like Joel McCrea in other Preston Sturges films, Fonda does so well in the part because he plays it absolutely straight. No tongue in cheek, no winks at the audience, Fonda plays it straight and sincere.The usual Preston Sturges stock company is here and prominent in the cast is always William Demarest as the mug that is a kind of bodyguard factotum for Fonda. Hired of course by Eugene Palette in another one of his crotchety millionaire father roles.Best scene in the film is right at the beginning as Stanwyck analyzes all the moves a lot of the other females on board are using to attract Fonda before she decides on a very direct approach.The Lady Eve holds up very well as do all of Preston Sturges's work after over 60 years.

The plan seems perfect, but once the deed is done Walter's nerves start to fail him and a cunning fraud investigator at his office begins to dig a little too close to the truth ...Billy Wilder's career was just a bit too acclaimed and strewn with accolades for me, but this classic adult film noir is deserving of all the praise it receives. The script, by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is a dazzling adaptation of James M. Cain's pulp fiction classic. The murder sequence is both exhilarating in its detail and chilling in its realism - these are not gangsters or psychopaths, but ordinary people who do something monstrous borne out of lust and greed. Both MacMurray and Stanwyck (despite a silly blonde wig) give career-best performances which are charming, dazzling, amusing and chilling, all at the same time. Stanwyck is the ultimate cold-hearted femme-fatale (just pipping Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth in my opinion), and right from the moment she first appears (dressed only in a bath-towel), she eats up the screen. MacMurray is brilliant as Neff; a sap, but not a fool, who learns all too late he doesn't have what it takes to be a killer, and that women are never quite what they seem. Both are surpassed however by old pro Robinson as the wily claims investigator, who can smell a phoney setup a mile away. Robinson is amazing; a man for whom facts and statistics are never wrong and rule human nature, at least when it comes to money - a sad but profound truth. Equally good is the extremely dark photography by John Seitz (see also Sullivan's Travels, This Gun For Hire, Invaders From Mars and many others), with daring foreground shadows (Neff looking out his apartment window), stunning use of closeups (the big one of Phyllis while the dirty deed is being done) and many rule-breaking moments (when the husband is talking and signing the forms the focus should be on him, but it's on Phyllis). Best of all is Chandler's ricochet dialogue, which revs up the frisson and tumbles crookedly out of the actors. There are too many classy lines to mention, but my favourite is when Phyllis says, I wonder if I know what you mean., and Walter hits back with, I wonder if you wonder.. Although movie adaptations of Dashiel Hammett's books kick-started this genre (The Thin Man, The Glass Key, The Maltese Falcon), this is the pivotal Hays-Code-ignoring lurid murder potboiler of the forties, followed by such greats as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Deadly Is The Female\/Gun Crazy and D.O.A.

(and later Blood Simple and Red Rock West). This is a stylish, extremely well acted movie of a great book, and a real treat for all fans of classic crime fiction.

Everything about the movie is spot on--the cast, the writing, the direction. I like Sandra Bullock, but I've never seen her as good as she is here--she's totally believable and willing to look like her character should look.
