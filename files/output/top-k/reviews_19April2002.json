does he hate making movies. i felt the whole way through that david lynch was sitting at home laughing at me as a grasped franticlly at little details, trying to figure out what was going on. ive never been a lynch fan, but since mullholland drive got such great reviews, i thought id give it a try. never again. lynch is deranged. was the first part before the last part or was it the part that was with the part before the part. did the blue cube represent treachery or the lady with the blue beehive. its ridiculous! nothing had to do with anything! its as if he made twenty different movies, took out all the important parts and then taped the rest together. mullholland drive IS what got left on the cutting room floor of somebody's nightmares. its enough to f**k with sigmund freud's head.ive heard and read a dozen times that, even if you dont 'get' lynch's  movies, you can still appreciate the art of it. but what art is there to insanity. is it supposed to stir up some emotion within me, like some abstract painting? is the point of lynch's work simply chaos? i think anyone can throw together loads of fickle nonsense, but to make sense out of chaos is what art really is about.if you ask me, lynch's point to mullholland drive was simply to p*** me off and drive me crazy. i liked twin peaks, to some extent, but maybe thats because lynch was not alone in writing it. maybe he needs a sane person to even him out. if he ever finds someone to work with again, then and only then, will i watch one of his movies. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 April 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  to begin, what the hell did i just see?
