I really can't understand why they changed Krueger from a mass murdering scary figure to a Jerry Lewis clone.  They should have given the role of Krueger to Robin Williams.  At least he is good at comedy.  That would be something I would pay to see.  I have seen the first Nightmare about 50 times, I have seen Craven's last one maybe 5 times, the others are just a waste of time and they are not even worth one viewing.  I can't tell you how much I despise the way that horror films have evolved.  From all of the Fridays after the fourth, all the Nightmares after the first and before the last and all the Scream clones, they are mostly terrible.  There have really only been perhaps 3 films in the 90's that scared me.  One was Wes' New Nightmare and the two others are this summer's biggest surprises, that being The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense.  They are movies that scare, chill and make you jump in ways that this and every other Nightmare could only dream of.  If you have a morbid curiosity of what else I think of this film, review A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre along with the other two films that I mentioned.  Then you will see that those films are the exact opposite of what this one if.  And that is a scary thought.  I just hope that horror films are on the rise again seeing as we now have names like Myrick, Sanchez and Shyalaman that have emerged onto the scene.  Perhaps they can bring us back to what horror films used to stand for.  We used to have scares and chills, now we have comedy in place of all that is a horror movie.  If that is your thing then watch this one along with movies like Idle Hands.  But if you are a purist, stay away from this one and go rent some classics.  Thank the movie Gods for video.  To sum it up, in case you didn't get it, this is a disgrace to what Freddy originally stood for.  This is a terrible horror movie.

By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.The film isn't all that it was hyped to be.  Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters?  The commercials tell you everything!  Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched We're Back, Pete's Dragon, All Dogs Go To Heaven or E.T. (all children\/family movies) then you've already watched this film.  It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings.  For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself.  There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on.  Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.Furthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing.  Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures Quest For Camelot and The King and I were complete flops).  If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands.  Space Jam was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of old characters brought new life to their persona.  In several aspects, Space Jam was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to The Iron Giant.  Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, The Iron Giant aimed for the commercial.  Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up.  Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.Lastly, there's the objectional material.  For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons.  Why does such a scene need to take place?  All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its victims.

Cool J was interested in playing the character of Blade and was doing his best to get the film made. Naturally, when Wesley Snipes got the film off the ground and into production, the thought of Blade I had was a cheap straight to video title that would fade into obscurity with other comic-book movie adaptations such as the Punisher with Dolph Lundgren and the rare Fantastic Four movie. Little did I expect what I saw. When I first viewed the trailer, I was hooked. I love Hong Kong action films and escapist Sci-Fi cinema such as Blade Runner, and the trailer gave this movie elements of both such genres. To top that off, it did not portray Blade as a comic book character, but as a rather subdued anti-hero. Still, I was in for a shock when I actually saw the film. In my opinion, I must say that the opening fight sequence is the most brutal and violent action sequence I had ever seen in a Western film. It was fast, well-paced, and graphically violent. But therein laid the problem I had with the film. Blade seemed to be an unstoppable killing machine capable of dispatching vampires left and right (which he did in several key action sequences), but the vampires themselves were portrayed as somewhat wimpish, almost begging to be staked. I would have expected that vampires would be a little more difficult to dispatch, given the nature of what they are, but they seemed to go down like grass before a lawn-mower. Maybe I was missing something here, but most of the other movies I have seen with vampires in them (like Bram Stoker's Dracula and Fright Night), vampires didn't always just crumple up and die. They usually put up a good fight. Its like this in Buffy the Vampire Slayer on the WB as well, but they tend to fight back more than in Blade. But as I watched on, this concern seemed to take a back seat to what I was witnessing. Some of the other points about the way vampires lived in society seemed to be taken from the White Wolf game Vampire the Masquerade, and some of the other factors of vampiric biology seemed a bit of a stretch (like a cure for vampirism), but once again I tended to let this slide as I was watching on. But these problems nagged me, and hampered my overall enjoyment of this film. I doubt many of these issues would be addressed in the sequel, which I hope to see in the summer of 2000, but there is always hope that they will take the time to reason some of these faults out. I personally hope that with the death of the Batman films and with Superman's new movie being placed on the backburner at Warner, Blade will fill the niche left open by a lack of a cool comic book film. However, it will have to be an incredible sequel as it is likely that the X-Men movie will be out the same summer. As long as they stick to the look and feel of the first film, and iron out some of those pesky bugs, they may have a successful franchise on their hands.

The main person in this whole series and movie, is Agent Cooper. Most people just think that this whole series is just about a small town murder. It's not! There's more to it, much more. It's Cooper's story. The whole reason that Laura was killed was to get Cooper into Twin Peaks. You find much more about that in the final episode in the series. There's the thing called the 25 year cycle. Notice how they always speak of 25 years in the show. Like when Cooper talks to Laura in his dream 25 years later in Episode 3. Anyways, there's a 25 year cylce that has someone new come into a small town and get possessed. That may sound kind of crazy but when you think about it, it all makes sense. Wyndom Earl was possessed 25 years ago by Bob, Cooper became his partner a couple years before the series started, Cooper fell in love with his wife, Wyndom Earl found out and killed his wife and wanted to find Cooper. So the same thing is going to happen. As we saw in the final episode, Cooper was possessed by Bob. Cooper will later marry Annie, get a young partner, the partner will fall in love with Annie, Cooper will kill Annie and he will track his partner doen to a small town, and the same thing will happen to his partner. We saw in the final episode Bob sucking out Wyndom Earl's soul, that was Bob's soul. It may sound crazy, but it really does make sense if you think about it. So everything that happened was all for Cooper. The whole murder, everything. That is the unbelieveable! It's all for Cooper. Bob's character is the character that represents the evil in all of us. And now he's in Cooper. I think the movie lacted a little from the show, but it was still good. The whole beggining investigating Teresa Banks was really cool and mysterious. David Lynch's best work came from the T.V series. You'll never see anything like that on T.V anymore. First of all the violence, second of all for some strange reason the producers think that we'd rather see Luke Perry return on 90210. New's flash! We could watch 90210 in any other show.

Even after you find out the murder of Laura Palmer, still don't watch it. There is so much to this movie. Not all just about Laura Palmer. The main person in this whole series and movie, is Agent Cooper. Most people just think that this whole series is just about a small town murder. It's not! There's more to it, much more. It's Cooper's story. The whole reason that Laura was killed was to get Cooper into Twin Peaks. You find much more about that in the final episode in the series. There's the thing called the 25 year cycle. Notice how they always speak of 25 years in the show. Like when Cooper talks to Laura in his dream 25 years later in Episode 3. Anyways, there's a 25 year cylce that has someone new come into a small town and get possessed. That may sound kind of crazy but when you think about it, it all makes sense. Wyndom Earl was possessed 25 years ago by Bob, Cooper became his partner a couple years before the series started, Cooper fell in love with his wife, Wyndom Earl found out and killed his wife and wanted to find Cooper. So the same thing is going to happen. As we saw in the final episode, Cooper was possessed by Bob.

Both have confusing plots, both are film noir in a way and both are richly acted and very well written.  What I enjoyed most about this was the excellent performances of Spacey, Pearce and Crowe.  All three carried out their roles superbly.  When Crowe( Bud White ) was mad ( which was quite a bit ) you could feel his anger.  It was written all over his face so that when he lashes out you understand why.  Spacey ( Vinsensse ) was a bit of a hotdog in the film but he slowly changes and eventually doesn't like what he sees in the mirror.  He also has one of the key scenes in the film when he discovers the main culprit.  When he utters the name of the man that supposedly killed Pearce's father, that gave me chills.  It was such a well written scene and carried out beautifully by Spacey.  I admired Pearce's character ( Ed Exley ).  He was not so much a political cronie as he did what he felt was right, all the time.  He had integrity and he never wanted to jeapordize that, for any reason.  That is why at the conclusion of the film I was left feeling strange when the denoument carried out the way it did.  Pearce shoots the bad guy as he walking away.  He didn't defend himself in the line of duty, but he killed a man that deserved to die.  This man was a cop killer, a murderer, a rapist and a man who thought he was above the law.  Does that make it right to shoot him?  I'm sure we all think so, but for Pearce to shoot him would have taken alot.  Asking moral questions the way the film did was one of its great strengths.As for the comparison with Titanic.  Titanic was a superb film that did everything right and deserved to win everything that it did.  These are completely different kinds of movies and Titanic got its just rewards.

Instead Mr. Breast believes that by placing star credentials and production values above all else we the audience will be gullible enough to lovingly swallow his shallow love story. Not only that, we'll pay him 10 bucks for the privilege of doing so.I'm not gonna bore anyone with the plot because there isn't one. It's just a pure waste of time. Seriously, in three hours you can manage to convey some quite profound feelings (Godfather, Shortcuts, Schindler's List) but Meet Joe Black didn't make me feel anything. It hoped to latch on to the same elements that made Titanic a smash hit (love story, length, evil fiancées, floppy hair) but least that had decent special effects to salvage its hollow characterisations. Even the car accident that provides Joe with a ticket to `our' world looks crap. Brad Pitt wasted his talents in this week affair, as did Hopkins. Both of them look as if they are quite unsure of why they are here in the first place. As for the characters that comprise of Hopkins family, well what I was just hoping for was that Joe would have a sudden change of heart and decide to kill em all for being so darn ungrateful. I really can't hack listening to rich white people complain about how horrid life is because they can't find `true love'. I don't think that you need a three-hour time frame in order to accomplish that. These are the very same things that annoyed me about Notting Hill, yet that film at least didn't take its self as seriously as this drivel.As for all this talk about Claire Forlani, well yes she is one amazing looking bird but she sure can't sustain a leading female role by herself. All she did is look like a sulky rich girl drifting from room to room, suffering from major existential teenage angst. She was about as animate as my Granny's antique wardrobe. It's a case of great face but zero charisma.You know what, this might have turned out into quite memorable film if ... In the end you have enough time to think about the emptiness of it all and feel like cursing yourself for having gone to see it in the first place.It's not just that it's such a pointless film that annoys me. Rather more it is the actuality that it cost $90 million to subsidise this wet, soppy, nonsensical mess. If you have a great desire to see what a personification of Death may look like, I wouldn't waste my time watching this filth&#133; you may as well wait for the real thing!

Instead Mr. Breast believes that by placing star credentials and production values above all else we the audience will be gullible enough to lovingly swallow his shallow love story. Not only that, we'll pay him 10 bucks for the privilege of doing so.I'm not gonna bore anyone with the plot because there isn't one. It's just a pure waste of time. Seriously, in three hours you can manage to convey some quite profound feelings (Godfather, Shortcuts, Schindler's List) but Meet Joe Black didn't make me feel anything. It hoped to latch on to the same elements that made Titanic a smash hit (love story, length, evil fiancées, floppy hair) but least that had decent special effects to salvage its hollow characterisations. Even the car accident that provides Joe with a ticket to `our' world looks crap. Brad Pitt wasted his talents in this week affair, as did Hopkins. Both of them look as if they are quite unsure of why they are here in the first place. As for the characters that comprise of Hopkins family, well what I was just hoping for was that Joe would have a sudden change of heart and decide to kill em all for being so darn ungrateful. I really can't hack listening to rich white people complain about how horrid life is because they can't find `true love'. I don't think that you need a three-hour time frame in order to accomplish that. These are the very same things that annoyed me about Notting Hill, yet that film at least didn't take its self as seriously as this drivel.As for all this talk about Claire Forlani, well yes she is one amazing looking bird but she sure can't sustain a leading female role by herself. All she did is look like a sulky rich girl drifting from room to room, suffering from major existential teenage angst. She was about as animate as my Granny's antique wardrobe. It's a case of great face but zero charisma.You know what, this might have turned out into quite memorable film if ... In the end you have enough time to think about the emptiness of it all and feel like cursing yourself for having gone to see it in the first place.It's not just that it's such a pointless film that annoys me. Rather more it is the actuality that it cost $90 million to subsidise this wet, soppy, nonsensical mess. If you have a great desire to see what a personification of Death may look like, I wouldn't waste my time watching this filth&#133; you may as well wait for the real thing! At least I bet it'll be more interesting this movie.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"24 August 1999","score":"","review":" People seem to have extreme opinions of this film -- as usual. It's tiring to read THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST EVER!!!! and THIS MOVIE WAS THE WORST EVER!!! with glib explanations why.Event Horizon is an unusual movie, but I like it. Unlike other horror films, this one has a soul, and a theme. The theme is regrets.First off, the characters and actors are first-rate. Laurence Fishbourne and Sam Neill particularly stand out. Fishbourne's character is more subtle than any roles I had seen him in -- save perhaps his Boyz N the Hood Furious Styles character. Sam Neill has the unenviable job of playing a character who goes whacko -- and not only does he have to go completely over-the-top, but he has to do it in an emotionally believeable manner.Neill's character, before his transformation, is very sympathetic. In fact, one can't help but root for him to save himself. Hints of his extreme loneliness are echoed from the first shot of the film -- him inside a lonely sphere within a vast maze, constantly pulling back -- reminscient of the opening shot of Star Trek First Contact. He battles the demons within of his dead wife (having committed suicide due to her depression and obvious abandonment issues.)There is evil in this movie, and it uses regret and loss to conquer. Neill's character is unable to deal with the pain of the loss of his wife, so evil provides him with an escape.On another level, the movie is a fun terror ride. There is not as much gore as implied in these other posts. The movie's darkness is capably lightened somewhat by Jason Isaac's character.One note The movie's opening score probably marks the first time a hard-driving dark metal-techno beat was used to open a score -- but it works, in a big way. It's jarring enough in its incongruity for a horror sci-fi film it actually WORKS.
