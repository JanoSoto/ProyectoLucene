If you haven't seen the film you shouldn't read my remarks.  Be wary of reading other peoples', too.I could have lived with a woman falling in love with her kidnapper.  No doubt it happens.  Even if it doesn't happen, there's no reason why it shouldn't serves as the basis of a good story.  It sounds like the basis of an excellent story.One thing to make clear - although it's an obvious enough point - the film has no message, let alone the message If you really love a woman, and want her to love you, kidnap her.  That's in the form of an imperative, and Almodóvar's film, whatever else it is, is not in imperatival; form.  (This is not trivial; some films ARE imperatival.)Even if there were a message of some kind, it would not be easy to work out what it is, since it's next to impossible to work out what relevant truths hold in the world of the fiction.  Is the love that develops between Marina and Ricky ultimately a healthy love, or not?  Do Ricky's extreme tactics work in general, or do they only work on people whose lives are like Marina's?  Or do they only work in this particular case?  Are Ricky's actions meant to be justified - in the world of the fiction - or are they unjustified even there?  All of these are hard to tell.  I'm not sure if this is a bad thing.What I am sure is a bad thing is that the heroine, Marina, is too passive.  (I mean too passive in its literal sense; I'm not using it as code for not feminist enough.)  She should have made a genuine effort to escape - just once.  Or she should have been more cunning - at least on occasion.  Or she should have spoken out more.  Or, just once, she should have snapped.  She comes close to doing all of these things, but she always draws back.  It's frustrating.I've realised - just as I was typing the previous paragraph - that she DOES make one concerted effort to escape; it's when Ricky is out getting beaten up by thugs.  And to be fair, it IS dramatically apt that this attempt occur just before she finds she's fallen in love with him - otherwise the story would be the even more unsatisfying one of how Ricky gradually wore her down.  Still, it would have been better if she had been a more active character, in SOME respect, earlier on.-Okay, so maybe I'm wrong about the too passive thing, but my other two complaints still stand.  Firstly, and less importantly, Ricky never pays any price either for his actions or for the prize he eventually wins.  He never has to experience guilt; he never loses any battle, on any front, with Marina.  (He gets beaten up, of course, but that doesn't count it's for the unrelated crime of pinching drugs.)  Secondly, the kidnapping story is all the more unsatisfying because it's basically all we get.  The other two Almodóvar films I've seen both have a rich undergrowth of supporting character and sub-plot, which this one lacks.  While not all films need such an undergrowth, this one does.  -It's not that there are no other characters.  Take the lecherous old director, for instance.  He steps on stage to spark off part of the story, but thereafter Almodóvar does NOTHING with him.  Yet we continue to see him every so often.  Why?  I suspect because Almodóvar wanted to cut away every so often, and needed something to cut away to.Tie me up, etc. has many typical Almodóvar strengths - glorious colours, fascinating characters, strong narrative grip - but it's all a bit flat.

Since the other reviews cover the bad adequately, I'll stick up for the good pointsFor starters, George Clooney made the best Bruce Wayne out of anyone to play him. In the much exalted animated, Bruce is a rich, handsome celebrity attending many gala functions amongst Gotham's social elite, and so he is portrayed in this movie. Far better than the quirky, curly haired nerd that no one in Gotham recognizes in Batman 1 and Batman Returns. However, Val Kilmer looked far more intimidating in the Batsuit than either George or Michael Keaton.The cinematography from B&R and Batman Forever trounces Burtons movies. Seeing Batman falling through the air with cape flowing looks cool, and is a Batman trademark. Either because of technology limitations, or Burton's lack of vision, all we see from Burton's movies is one scene of Batman hang-gliding. I love the enormousness of Gotham in the Schumachers movies. Contrary to Burton fans whining, GOTHAM CITY IS NOT ONE HUGE DARK GHETTO! No major city, such as NY or LA is. While it's okay for Batman to hang out in the ghetto to beat up tw0-bit thugs, I can't really see him doing battle with anyone in his rogues gallery there. Can you picture Poison Ivy, the Riddler or Mr. Freeze hanging out on dark alley like Skid Row???Some scenes involving Bruce & Alfred, and Freeze & Nora are actually quite on the money, and have much more depth than anything seen in the other 3 movies.The movie was not a box office bomb. It made more than GoldenEye. This obviously isn't the movie most batfans were looking for, but was meant to be more of a comedic, lighter toned interpretation of Batman.

With this film and Copland, I think Stallone is better in recent years than he has been in a long time.I think Rachel Cooke played an emotionally difficult role well.I'd rate this an 8\/10.  Anybody who puts this in the 10 worst movies of the year category (as I've seen) needs to go see Battlefield Earth and Scary Movie again to see that Get Carter doesn't belong anywhere near those cinematic abortions..

American Psycho is a satire. A very dark and horrific satire, but still a satire.American Psycho, the book, is the most mind-blowing piece of fiction I have ever read. It is a very cleverly written book, yet the violence depicted is so explicit that I found it hard to continue reading in parts. The film is only for those with thick skin, but compared to the book, its Disney.Those who criticize the film for not being as violent as the book obviously fail to realize that if it was, it would have been banned in every country on the planet. While the majority of violence happens off-screen, I don't feel that this is in any way a disgrace to the book.The best part of American Psycho is not the violence (which serves mainly as a distraction), but the narrative from Bateman, and the opportunity to go inside his head as see what pushes him over the edge. Patrick Bateman is a very wealthy, handsome, young, intelligent Wall St yuppie in the late 80's, who seemingly has everything. So the question put to the viewer is What would turn a man like Bateman into such an angry, evil, sadistic psychopath? The answer is The society and people around him.Bateman's world, and that of his friend's, who all share similar lifestyles to him, is one that is dominated by image, one-upsmanship, and, most importantly, rampant materialism. From the examining of business cards, to demanding of having reservations at top restaurants even when not hungry, to Bateman's flawless knowledge of fine business suits, it is the never ending excessive materialism of the New York yuppie which drives Bateman insane. As Christian Bale quoted of his character with Bateman the clothes really do make the man.While Bateman comes off as a completely ruthless man who is a master of everything in his environment, in reality its completely different. The materialism which consumes Bateman and his friends, also leaves them nameless. Often, Bateman is mistaken for someone else by a colleague of his. It is only Bateman's bloodlust which makes him feel like an individual.For those who have never read the book, and watch this movie for the first time the twist at the end (the most redeeming twist ever) may seem ridiculous. However, this is a film that when watched for a 2nd time will make complete sense. There are so many subtle hints throughout this movie (such as in the opening titles when what appears to be dripping blood in fact turns out the be decorative sauce on one of Bateman's ultra expensive power lunches) that will seem so obvious the 2nd time, but were understandably ignored the 1st time around when confronted by Bateman's violence. Remember, this entire film is narrated though the eyes of Bateman, so things are not always as they seem.All in all this was an amazing film. The acting was flawless. Christian Bale absolutely stole this show. To get inside Bateman's head and do it this convincingly was quite a feat .The imagery was deceptive and clever, and the musical score fitted the film perfectly.10\/10 - the best film of 2000p.s. does anyone else find it extremely difficult to even imagine Leonardo DiCaprio playing Patrick Bateman? No way could he have pulled this off.

The Nazis, who are also interested in the Grail, are in competition with Jones. (I guess they are still ticked off over that whole Lost Ark thing.) Anyway, Jones goes missing. So son Indiana travels to his fathers last known location, Venice, to try to find out what happened to his father and also see if he can't complete his father's search for the Grail. He travels with longtime friend, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), and the hook up with the elder Jones' assistant, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody).

Some have complained that not only are these gentleman bad guys, but they have no redeeming qualities due to there dedication to criminal life.  Yeah, and?

For whatever reason, gangsters with no (or few) redeeming qualities score big at the box office, but not Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh.

Unless I have missed something in previous Coen movies, while these co-script-writing brothers are obviously literate, this is the first time they have based the plot of a movie on a classic story, but it is not the first time they have told a story set in that vast part of the US which many movie-makers ignore.

Perhaps this is allowed precisely because such folk are themselves famously politically incorrect, or more to the point, they too often look on political correctness as alien to common sense.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"8 February 2001","score":"","review":"  The Coen brothers have made a mark on the movies since their 1980s debut, Blood Simple. They reached a mass audience with Fargo. Now they have given us another skewed vision with O Brother, Where Art Thou. The question is, a skewed vision of what? Of Homer's Odyssey? Of America's fly-over country? Unless I have missed something in previous Coen movies, while these co-script-writing brothers are obviously literate, this is the first time they have based the plot of a movie on a classic story, but it is not the first time they have told a story set in that vast part of the US which many movie-makers ignore. On the other hand, some residents of fly-over country might prefer to be ignored. The Coens paint America's hinterland with broad and comical strokes. I laughed at the antic characters in this movie, but I winced, too. The Coens make sport of hicks, hayseeds, rubes and hillbillies--the only people it is still politically correct to make fun of. Perhaps this is allowed precisely because such folk are themselves famously politically incorrect, or more to the point, they too often look on political correctness as alien to common sense. (If one becomes genuinely sophisticated as opposed to being a poseur, one realizes that the rubes are often right.) A sense of fair play makes me think that rural folk ought not to be picked on so much. On the other hand, I want to say, Yeah, but this is really funny! That, of course, would be regarded as a poor defense of any comedy made at the expense of some politically correct sacred cow. That said, O Brother Where Art Thou is so full of fun that I can hardly wait to see it again. Homer's tale becomes a departure point whereby every cliche about 1930s rural America in general and Mississippi in particular is rendered larger than life. You have chain gangs, ole timey country music (the way it was before Nashville discovered electric guitars), folksy politicians, new Deal hydro-electric projects, dirt-poor farmers covered with real dirt, women with seven or more children, bank-robbers who drive fast cars while wielding tommy guns, and even the Ku Klux Klan.

Like all good movies, it is not really about the subject at hand - in this case, the abortion issue - but about something deeper and more far reaching. Citizen Ruth is about people who get so devoted to a cause they think important to humanity that they forget to consider actual human beings.Of course, the unavoidable problem with a movie such as this is that almost all of the characters are unsympathetic.  Regardless of what opinion one has on the abortion issue, both factions behave badly and they do it supposedly on behalf of the most irresponsible, irredeemable, unlikable (but still watchable) glue sniffer around, Ruth.  The effect can be a little wearing, especially at the end.The movie alleviates this problem by including one wonderful character, Harlan, the cynical Gulf War vet.  He unceremoniously plunks his prosthetic leg on the kitchen table.  He eats shirtless standing over a sink.  He sees Ruth as a person, albeit a diminished one, and is willing to give her what she really wants (money) in order to, as he says, level the playing field, even though he knows she will squander it in a matter of days and tells her so.  While he is on the prochoice side, he sees the humor in the situation, as evidenced by his wonderful grin and does not seem to lose track of his own humanity.  His dialogue is priceless. Where everybody else speaks in rhetoric he cuts to the chase. My favorite retort of his occurs when the sanctimonious Dale, a pro-lifer, spouts out some Biblical condemnation at him and he responds by giving the exact location in the Bible of the quote.  Naturally the actor playing the part, M. C.

Great music, beautiful scenery, fair cast with Herods and Peter a cut above, notorious all-star problem less of a problem with every passing year.
