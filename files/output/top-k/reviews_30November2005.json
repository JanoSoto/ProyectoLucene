[{"date":"30 November 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Milos Forman has made a lot of great films such as Hair, and some more than decent ones such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, and this Man on the Moon is probably his best. It beats One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest in pure entertainment value, one of the only things that prevented One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest from being a great film. And it beats out Hair with the fact that it has a story and is not just a bunch of songs that will stick in your head and try to make you forget its aberrant lack. Man on the Moons is chop full of energy, it zooms along like a very entertaining bullet, it is truly vibrant as is Jim Carreys, well not performance more embodiment of Andy Kaufman, he proves that the academy is truly dumb for not even nominating him once he has deserved it four times for Eternal Sunchine of the Spotless Mind, The Majestic, The Truman Show, and most of all for his best performance in Man on the Moon. Paul Giamati also deserved a nomination as did the script and the director and the entire film. Man on the Moon is a vibrant and hilarious film homage to the great Andy Kaufman.
