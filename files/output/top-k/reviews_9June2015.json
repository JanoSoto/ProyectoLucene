Pecker is the story of obsession, weather it's about the main character's obsession with photography, his girlfriends obsession with her laundromat, or his managers obsession with him, everyone has a strange obsession. Pecker (Edward Furlong) is a teenager from the small town of Baltimore, Maryland, who has been taking pictures for years. Finally, he's having a show at the fast food restaurant he works at and to everyone's surprise, a New York City gallery owner shows up to make Pecker he new protégé. The whole family goes to the big city, where Pecker becomes a star, putting his town and his whole family under a microscope. As is common in Water's films, the characters are as strange as can be, and for the life of me, I can't figure out why he decided to portray Baltimore as a small town. Edward Furlong stars as Pecker, and even though he has long been one of my favorite actors, even he couldn't save this film. I like weird and admire something different, but Pecker was so far out there, that it became a farce of itself. The characters are uninteresting, the penis jokes are old, and the obsessions are just so above and beyond believable that it turns the whole film into one bad joke.

From his grandmother who talks to the virgin Mary to his sister who is the biggest gay pimp in Baltimore, all the obsessions blend into one big gay, confusing, ridiculous ending.

Like so many films of the '40s, the plot focuses on two people who have committed and\/or been witness to a horrible crime. Their knowledge is what holds them together, but is ultimately their undoing. This storyline is evident in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Double Indemnity (1944) and Out of the Past (1947). What makes Ivers unique is that it is one of only a handful of film-noir movies to be nominated for an Oscar.The story opens in Iverstown, 1928, Young Sam Masterson (Hickman) and Martha Ivers (Wilson) are planning to run away together. Martha is quickly stopped by the police, but Sam escapes. Martha is the niece of the evil Mrs. Ivers (Anderson), the town matriarch. The police take Martha home, where she, her aunt and Martha's tutor, Mr. O'Neil (Bohnen), exchange harsh words.Martha is sent up to her room where Mr. O'Neil's son Walter (Kuhn) is waiting for her with her cat. Sam sneaks in through a window to tell Martha he's leaving town. But before Sam can go, Martha's cat runs downstairs. Sam goes after the cat, but he's forced to hide when her aunt comes into the stairway. Mrs. Ivers hates cats so she begins to beat the tabby with her cane. Martha rushes towards her, grabs the cane and gives her aunt a blow to the head. Her aunt falls down the stairs and breaks her neck.When Mr. O'Neil hears the commotion he comes running from a room downstairs. Martha tells him that a strange man came in the house and attached her aunt. Walter, who witnessed the murder, lies to his father by verifying Martha's story. Mr. O'Neil suspects what really happened and uses that to his advantage by taking the place of Mrs. Ivers.Eighteen years later Sam (Heflin) gets in a car wreck just outside Iverstown and is forced to remain in town for a few days. Much to his surprise, he learns Martha and Walter are married and the two of them own most of the town. His first night in town, Sam meets Toni, a down-and-out recent parolee (played by the vastly under-rated Scott). Sam is content to romance Toni while he waits for his car to be fixed, but Martha and Walter have other plans.Walter and Martha are convinced that Sam, who's a professional gambler with a long police record, has blown into town to blackmail them for the murder of Mrs. Ivers. Contrary to their beliefs, Sam never witnessed of had knowledge of the crime. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of intrigue and murder. The ending is bittersweet, which is usual for this type of story, but the writers added an interesting twist not seen before, or since.Watching Douglas you'd never guess this was his first film. His depiction of Walter gives strength to an overall weak character. This character is unlike Douglas' later tough guy roles, but he pulls it off beautifully. Originally he was slated to play the part of Sam, but when Van Heflin returned from WWII, Douglas was told he could play Walter instead. To add insult to injury, the studio insisted that Douglas do a screen test against four other actors for the part. The actors, who all had stage experience but had not yet made films were John Lund, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark and Wendell Cory.Stanwyck is fascinating as Martha, an unconscionable femme fatale. Many film historians have compared this role to her portrayal of Phyllis in Double Indemnity, but Stanwyck's exploration of Martha goes much deeper than that of Phyllis. Martha displays resentment about the marital trap in which she has found herself, but she also seems as though she wants the love that Walter offers her.Seeking love and understanding, she throws herself at Sam, but when he rejects her, she attempts to kill him. Martha is still the young girl who thinks that any problem can be solved with murder.

Spider-Man has been my favorite superhero since I was 10 years old, mainly due to his extreme relatability and his sheer selflessness as a character. And, as you may have guessed, I do think the original Sam Raimi Spider- Man is a very, very good movie. That said, I don't think it's a GREAT movie. I don't think Marvel would give us any GREAT movies until 2003 when we got Daredevil and Ang Lee's Hulk (And I know that it's extremely controversial and perhaps unwise for me to say that, but that is my honest opinion), and while there IS a great movie buried deep in here, there are is one BIG problem that keeps it from being great.That problem is the romance. This film tries to make the romance the heart and soul of the movie, but when the two leads have so little chemistry and so little reason to truly be in love, you're in big trouble. Such is the case with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker and Kristen Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. Mary Jane is a very unlikable character here to be perfectly honest; she's unsupportive, weak in her convictions and honestly seems to mess with Peter a fair amount, even if not intentionally. And of course, she is quite possibly the biggest damsel in distress in comic book movie history. She's not so much a character as a plot element inserted to help PETER develop. To be fair though, Peter isn't much better. Throughout the film I am completely stumped as to why he loved Mary Jane apart from her beauty. There is simply no other reason for him to be attracted to her, and it makes Peter seem very shallow romance wise.The effects are also EXTREMELY dated too. When I was watching Spider-Man swing across New York, I didn't feel like I was watching a real superhero. I felt like I was watching a cut scene from an Xbox 360 game.That said, if the romance had been executed better, this would truly be a great superhero movie. Apart from a mediocre Kristen Dunst (And her performance is NOT her fault. The script simply gave her nothing to work with), most of the acting is good. Tobey Maguire is fairly on and off. He perfectly captures the awkwardness and geekiness we know and love in Peter Parker, and he can really give us some true emotional depth in the more touching and tragic scenes of the movie, but he never really gives the alter-ego of Spider-Man much personality. And, of course, he has no chemistry with Kristen Dunst. I'd give his performance a B; not anything mind-blowing, but decent. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and Willem DaFoe are all fantastic in their roles; I can't imagine anybody more perfect for the roles of Uncle Ben, Aunt May and Green Goblin, it was like watching the comic book characters come to life. For a die-hard Spidey fan like me, it was a riot to watch them breathe so much life into these roles.Then of course, there's J.K Simmons as J.J Jameson...What can be said about this performance that hasn't already been said? At the end of the day, all I can tell you is this; there's a reason why Spider-Man fans want him to come back as J.J in the new Spider-Man films. Simmons alone was born to play this role. The pacing is some of the best I have ever seen in an action or superhero movie. There is not a single moment in Spider-Man where you will be bored or disinterested, it's very fast paced and does a perfect job of grabbing and holding onto your attention in both action and character development. Sure, Mary Jane doesn't really develop much beyond crushing on Peter, but Peter's transition from immature teenager to selfless guardian of New York is handled very well, and Norman Osborne's descent from well-intentioned scientist to schizophrenic madman is tragic, terrifying and captivating all at once. The action sequences are all spectacular, feeling extremely source to the source material in style and choreography without coming across as goofy or over the top. And lastly, the musical score. Danny Elfman's Spider-Man score is rousing, exciting and truly iconic to a Spidey fan like myself. It's impossible for me to listen too without smiling, and it really captures the tone of the movie and character perfectly.Spider-Man is a really good movie, but I'm not quite willing to call it great. Yes, I do have only 2 criticisms of the movie, and only one major, but the fact remains that when the romance is the heart of your story, you damn well better make it work. And Spider-Man really, really doesn't. However, the movie get's nearly everything else right, from MOST of the character development, to the casting, to the action, to the score, to the pacing...Yeah, it's still a really good movie. I personally just don't think it was GREAT. Now the SEQUEL on the other hand...

Formidable may be the word most associated for Peck, and yet in Roman Holiday somehow William Wyler got a fantastic performance from him, full of warmth and great comic timing.It doesn't hurt, only helps, that Peck's playing opposite Audrey Hepburn, who is, of course, wholly beautiful and the ideal of a Movie Star (in caps) here. More than that - whether her hair is long or short, she's one of those beauties of the screen that the film camera loves to take in. It's mostly in the eyes, but it's really the whole package, her grace and own sense of comic timing that works so well. Take when she first gets out of her royal palace and goes about in Rome at night, increasingly getting tired until she's just mumbling a poem by Yeats (sorry, it's Shelly), and keeps nodding off with her new friend played by Peck.I sometimes don't like characters in romantic comedies, who may be more like figures of a plot wheeling forward than having any great personality. But between recently seeing The Philadelphia Story and then this, I have a better appreciation for this kind of ebullient filmmaking. Here especially the backdrop makes things lively, it's basically like you're there on vacation with them in the mid-section of the film, and Rome is of course the third star of the film, to use the cliché. I was worried at first the sort of colorful side characters might be over-exaggerated. And maybe a few are. But I think Wyler's casting of non-professionals helps a great deal, and even people with more than one line like the house-manager Peck's staying at or the cab driver get to have moments showing their character well for the sake of the story.It's a fairy tale set up - I could picture a Disney movie taking this very same path (actually, come to think of it, Aladdin had a few scenes that followed the Princess-Goes-out-in-Public sequence of events) - and it has that level of innocence. Even when figures who may bring doom to our characters come forward, such as the men in suits at the dance at night, they're just coming to take her back to the palace. The writing and directing has a lighter-than-air quality that is hard to resist, and in large part because the director gets Peck to open up a bit as a star, and makes Hepburn one in just under two hours.If you got a date, and they like classic movies, this is one to show them for its class, its real sense of fun, and the charm of the two stars.

Rather than the more Action-oriented style of most of the other Bond films, FRWL features a good small-scaled spy story, which follows its source novel closely. The storytelling is kinda slow, focusing mainly on the plot and not on the Action. Adding to that, Bond acts more like a real spy in the movie, not as a much like a detective as in Dr. No or a Super Man character as he does in some later efforts. Because of this, Russia might seem to lack intensity and be moving at a snails pace for fans of mainly later Bond entries or new Action movies in general. The differences to its predecessor, Dr. No, are quite significant. While FRWL lacks the charming vibe of Dr. No, it is all around a much better and more thrilling movie, also benefitting from what is clearly a far bigger budget. The locations aren't as exotic, though, but it is still nicely filmed and makes good use of Istanbul, the main location in the movie. The music is solid overall and far surpasses Monty Norman's performance in the aforementioned Dr. No. The decision to hire long-serving Bond composer John Barry proved to be a good one. Even then, I find Russia to be dry sometimes, which is common among older movies where music usually was used more sparingly. Also, in certain parts of the movie I find it sounding extremely dated.The quality of the scenes in the first half of From Russia With Love is overall not of much variation. But there are certain sections that are a little weaker. As an example, the gypsy scenes (apart from the, by this movie's standards, big Action scene) seem somewhat out of place in a Bond movie and drag a little. The second half however is really good and thrilling overall, containing most of the Action scenes. The highlight of the movie is the whole section on the Orient Express, culminating in a terrific showdown between Bond and Grant. Now, on a more negative note, the movie is obviously a product of its time, and as such looks and feels old. Unfortunately isn't up to par when it comes to the technical details. There are quite a few minor errors, such as obvious backdrops, fast forwarding and dubbing.Sean Connery gives a fine performance in the lead role, more akin to Fleming's James Bond from the books rather than the more common cinematic Bond that was introduced fully in Goldfinger. His acting is especially convincing in certain parts of the train sequence.The supporting cast was very good as well.Daniela Bianchi looks good and acts well as Tatjana Romanova. She is visibly dubbed, yes, but the voice-actor luckily sounded very convincing.Robert Shaw and Lotta Lenya are excellent in their respective roles as the two villains Donovan Red Grant and Rosa Klebb. Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz also did very well, this being his last ever performance before committing suicide later in 1963.Recurring characters already appeared in Dr. No, such as M (Bernard Lee), Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and Felix Leiter. Peter Burton also made his sole appearance as Mayor Boothroyd, more famously known as quartermaster Q, but was replaced before filming of From Russia With Love by Desmond Llewelyn, who would reprise the role in every official Bond film until his death in 1999, save Roger Moore's debut, Live And Let Die, from 1973. As always, the scenes with these characters are a joy to watch and instantly make you feel that you're watching Bond, even though the usual irritated (and for Bond's part teasing) relationship between Bond and Q wasn't established until the following Bond movie, Goldfinger.All in all, solid but unusual Bond film.

The film shows creatures, better yet, a world, that I'm sure most kids fantasized about exploring when they were young come to life in a way that balances the mystique, the adventure, and the peril all in one collective package. There's no need to give dinosaurs voices or two-dimensional personalities; seeing them come to life and enthrall is all that we needed.The story revolves around a company known as InGen, run by billionaire CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), who decides to allow four individuals, in addition to his two grandchildren, into a theme park he has created, housing living dinosaurs. What unfolds, however, is a catastrophic miscalculation, with dinosaurs running amok and people's lives being put in danger. Dennis Nedry (the always likable Wayne Knight) is the park's architect and computer engineer, who works to make sure that all goes well with the park, despite the outcome.On top of being a love letter to our childhood dreams of being immersed in a world of real life dinosaurs, Jurassic Park really formulates what a summer blockbuster is - realistic special effects, a team of rather likable actors shuffled in the mix, and a grandiose platform on which to play. Jurassic Park's main asset, however, despite its beautiful effects, is the sense of danger it conjures up. Ultimately, while still exercising the principles of science-fiction, the film plays like a horror film at times with its suspense and buildup. Consider the scene when Hammond's grandchildren are hiding from a gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex, as the dinosaur careens over where they sit, lurching over them like an engulfing shadow.The intensity Spielberg and company conjure up is akin to the kind of slowburn buildup Spielberg worked to predicate Poltergeist off of several years earlier. There's a liberal amount of time that allows for a setting to be created, characters to be introduced, and a sense of danger to build. After the first hour or so, the film goes from a rather calm and collective drama concerning the erection of Jurassic Park to a full-blown, high-octane adventure revolving around our wildest imagination.While Jurassic Park is a winning spectacle of special effects and danger, it still falls prey, however, to the typical pitfalls of being a summer blockbuster. As somewhat expected, character development is sparse, as the characters before us (with the exception of Knight's Nedry) speak with the kind of technical jargon that makes them less characters running a park and more vessels to advance the plot. Being that there's little in the way of development for these souls also means it's hard to truly feel anything for them when they're put in danger, the primary reason we should be so invested in the peril on screen. In addition, there is also a lack of the exploration of the man playing God that is usually instilled in these films. Hammond has great potential to be the anti-hero here, working against popular opinion or science to develop real-life dinosaurs, ignoring all opinions and simply going for what he feels is right rather than what others see as morally right.But perhaps I'm turning Jurassic Park, a film firmly stitched into the fabric of American cinema, into something it was never meant to be. One of the biggest gripes I get as a film critic is the assertion that I can never take films at face value or pieces of entertainment. The entertainment provided in Jurassic Park is sufficient enough to warrant a recommendation, and the film has already transcended the impact of a summer blockbuster.

The Hollywood director acts as if the writings of the young boy are his owns and uses them for his next big blockbuster. The antagonist is basically the typical liberal left wing Hollywood type, if you ask me, always making up elaborate lies to control the media and the entire freaking country under Barack HUSSAIN Obama's rule. The protagonist could be argued as symbolizing the poor, innocent Christian conservatives being deliberately attacked by the liberal agenda.I did enjoy the film immensely, probably on par with great works such as The Godfather or Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel. Although I did love this movie, I will say that really this film could just be called Kind of a Liar I guess when compared to the story about I am about to tell you. Paul Giamatti will look like a saint or George Washington (he never told a lie) when put up against the deceiving little devil that is my wife.I married her back in 2009, madly in love. I was taken aback by her from the moment I first laid eyes on her. She was elegant in every way. I mean, when she walked into a room, all heads turned.Although, only recently did I realize that the reason heads were turning was because everyone was trying to get a glimpse of the town transsexual! Yeah, you heard me right. I was duped into marrying a dude!We were together for a year before the marriage, and she never bothered to tell me that she used to have man junk. Not only did she not tell me, but none of my so-called friends did either. They just thought it was a real hoot and waited until the day I found out and laughed hysterically at my misfortune.WHY DID SHE HAVE TO LIE TO ME? Now what am I supposed to do? Am I gay? Am I straight? Or am I bisexual since I've been attracted to a woman but also kind of had relations with a man? THERE'S NO GUIDEBOOK TO THIS! If someone had told me as a kid that one day I would marry a woman who used to be a man, I would have told you that you're full of crap. I'm a God-fearing man and I want to go to heaven, not to have carnal relations with this abomination from Lucifer, the demon overlord of hell.Now, I'm in the process of getting a divorce.

With his entire family forcibly deported to a Nazi concentration camp, Guido attempts to make the best use of his wit & imagination to shield his son from the horrors of the Holocaust.Co-written & directed by Roberto Benigni, Life Is Beautiful brims with an irresistible charm from its opening moments, introduces all its characters in a captivating manner, and turns darker as the plot progresses. The two halves of the narrative are entirely different in mood, with first-half serving as a pleasant n hilarious love story while the other half is closer to a survival tale in tone.The screenplay adds ample depth to its characters in the first act & succeeds in making the audience invest their emotions into these characters which makes the next part all the more heartbreaking & difficult to watch. Set pieces are in tone with the depicted timeline, Humour is cleverly infused into the story, Cinematography makes expert use of warm colour tones & handles the camera very efficiently throughout its runtime.Editing lets the story unfold at its own pace & its 116 minutes of runtime is without any dull moments while the soundtrack simply consists of beautiful, elegant & heartwarming tracks that further elevate the whole experience. Coming to the performances, every cast member chips in with vital inputs but it's Roberto Benigni once again who steals the show in the role of Guido, and his confident, charismatic & cheerful work goes a long way in making the film work.The scenes involving Guido & his wife Dora, brilliantly played by Nicoletta Braschi, and then between Guido & his son Giosué are a delight to watch and the chemistry Benigni shares with his co-stars is pure bliss. However, the film tends to get a lot of useless flak for using comedy in a Holocaust-related drama but frankly, it isn't even about Holocaust in the first place, and that part is quite evident if one tries to view it from Guido's perspective & what he really was trying to do.On an overall scale, Life Is Beautiful is a powerful amalgamation of love, family & sacrifice that wonderfully balances its elements of comedy, drama, romance & tragedy to illustrate the great extent a caring father goes to protect his son's innocence, and presents Roberto Benigni in complete control of his craft, both in front n behind the camera. An extremely melancholic & deeply heartfelt cinema that's equally amusing & emotional, Life Is Beautiful is one of the finest gems to come out of Italian cinema, and is highly recommended to every film lover out there.

Basically the film tells the true story of radical American journalist John Reed (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Warren Beatty), during the First World War and the Russian Revolution, interspersed throughout with surviving witnesses from the time periods who knew Reed, the many of the people he encountered and giving their views on his exploits. Reed met married socialite Louise Bryant (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Diane Keaton) in 1915 at a lecture in Portland, Oregon, she is intrigued by his idealism, and over the course of an interview on international politics, which goes into the night, she realises writing is her only escape from the high society lifestyle. Bryant eventually leaves her husband to join Reed Greenwich Village, New York City, along with the local community of activists and artists, including anarchist and author Emma Goldman (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Maureen Stapleton) and the playwright Eugene O'Neill (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson), they later move to Provincetown, Massachusetts to concentrate on their writing, and become involved in the local theatre scene. Bryant becomes a feminist and radical in her own right through her writing, while Reed becomes involved in the labor strikes of the Reds of the Communist Labor Party of America, he becomes obsessed with changing the world, and in 1916 grows restless and moves to St. Louis to cover the Democratic Convention, during his absence Bryant has a complicated affair with O'Neill, Reed discovers this on his return, and realises he still loves her. Reed and Bryant secretly marry and make a home in Croton-on-Hudson, north of New York City, but desires for others are still conflicting them, Reed admits to his infidelity, and Bryant leaves on a ship to Europe to be a war correspondent, while Reed has a kidney disorder and is warned not to travel excessively and cause himself stress, but ignores this to join her, they reunite as professionals and rekindle their passion, while swept into Russia's Czarist regime ans the events of the 1917 Russian Revolution. The second half of the film is set ten days after the publication of Reed's book Ten Days that Shook the World, Reed is filled with idealism and tries to bring the spirit of Communism to the United States, because he is disillusioned by the imposed policies of Grigory Zinoviev (Jerzy Kosinski) and the Bolsheviks from Communist Russia, he is imprisoned and interrogated in Finland at one point trying to leave Europe, he is eventually reunited with Bryant in Moscow, Russia at a train station, his kidney disorder however has weakened him, Bryant nurses him until his death.

It has a complicated plot which can sometimes drive you crazy. However, the storyline is quite interesting and original, for the time.

What this strives to be is a colourful, bright and breezy sci-fi comedy with an all-star cast riding high at the peak of their careers. What it turns out to be is a mess of stupid dialogue, dumb comedy situations, and a general lack of cohesion all round.I was hoping this would be a musical along the lines of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, and yet as it turns out the songs are few and far between and seem to have been included just to pad out the running time. Geena Davis is given little more to do than parade around in either her underwear, her nightdress, or a bikini, and even though she looks great this film hardly stretches her acting abilities. She plays a frustrated housewife who embarks on an odd adventure when a spaceship containing three aliens crash-lands in her swimming pool.Jeff Goldblum plays the lead alien and is probably the best actor in this, adding some of his kooky charm, even though he isn't given much to work with all things considered. A pre-fame Jim Carrey plays another of the aliens and is irritating as ever, making weird noises and doing stupid stuff all the while, like an overactive child. The special effects are adequate, but there's no real content here, no lessons learned. The whole film is just an example of '80s excess at its worst.

Treat this as a fictional tale about a fictional hunt for a fictional assassin in Prague.The historical facts are too depressing anyway. Heydrich was murdered by two guys. The Nazis tortured Czechs until one of them squealed. Then they tracked the assassins to a church and the two killers committed suicide. The Nazis then destroyed a village that had nothing to do with political events. See Operation Daybreak.Here, we have Brian Donlevy as a doctor in Prague who shoots Heydrich. He then has to seek immediate shelter in the house of strangers, in this case, the home of Professor Walter Brennan and his family, including daughter Anna Lee.The Gestapo are understandably upset and they organize a manhunt for the killer, which centers around Donlevy and around the family that sheltered him. The Nazis round up and execute Czechs at random but nobody talks. And, in the end, the underground frames a Nazi agent for the crime.The Nazis aren't shown as stupid brutes. Alexander Granach, the Gestapo Inspector, is positively clever in a swinish, almost comic way. Fritz Lang has him with a haircut that the punk rockers of the 80s would have envied. His military mustache curls up at the ends, as in a morale-boosting poster left over from World War I and his plump neck hangs over his collar. His gestures are operatic, his perceptions acute, his consumption of beer heroic.Not far behind, if in fact he's behind at all, is Reinhold Schünzel as the uniformed Gestapo officer. He smiles pleasantly, leaning back and tripling his chin, while describing the torture that a suspect is about to undergo, but in an avuncular way, as if about to buy a child an ice cream cone. While the victim stands shivering, Schünzel grins, swivels in his office chair, and cracks his knuckles one by one.Less of an actor but more of a straight figure is Tonio Selwart as the Chief of the Gestapo. Less of a caricature, more of a character. He doesn't smile or squint. He speaks quietly and with sweet reason. And he wears those great uniforms with riding breeches and boots, and he wears a monocle, and Fritz Lang shows us Selwart peering into a mirror and squeezing a zit on his cheek.The good guys are much less interesting. Brian Donlevy is referred to as a young man but he's a little old for that. I mean, the guy was in Mexico with General Pershing in pursuit of Panch Villa, wasn't he? And anyway, he's practically ligneous. If his expression ever changed, I missed it, and he walks with his chest thrown out like a pigeon's. Dennis O'Keefe, in a minor part, is harmless as always. Walter Brennan, toothless old Walter Brennan, comic sidekick, does rather well by the role of a professor of history, and Anna Lee as his daughter is cute as hell. Slender, wide-eyed, shivering with fright. I love her. The problem is that all the good guys stand around spraying patriotic clichés just as a lawn sprinkler sprays water.No, it's not Fritz Lang's best picture but neither is it is worst. The script credit goes to Berthold Brecht but I understand he didn't contribute much. Still, I'm glad he was in Hollywood instead of (gulp) elsewhere. His songs for the comedy Where Do We Go From Here? are memorable. Lang was a popular director in Germany and was asked by Goebbels to head the movie propaganda program of the Third Reich. As he describes it, he replied, I'm tickled pink, and was on the next airplane out of Berlin. He brings some of his expressionism and originality with him. The dark, deep, dramatic shadows of films like Ministry of Fear are already adumbrated, so to speak.And he does something that should earn him a medal. Lang was fond of using mirrors in his films for some reason. (Check out Woman in the Window.) Here, he has Granach run to a mirror to inspect some smeared lipstick on his cheeks. And -- guess what -- Granach looks AT HIS OWN REFLECTION and not at the camera lens. When the actor looks at the audience instead of himself, it's a jarring estrangement for the viewer, who is hit over the head with the realization that this is not just a movie, but a clumsily directed one, an insulting one, at that.You know, considering that so many of the cast were born in Germany, you have to wonder just how often directions were given in English. Lang was quite an authoritarian. I can see him now, strutting about with his boots, riding breeches, and monocle, bellowing orders through a bullhorn.
