Yes there have actually been reports since the Fifties that after a UFO or Flying Saucer encounter, many People reported being visited by enigmatic Agents dressed all in black and wearing sunglasses.But the reports were anything but amusing to those who had the unfortunate visitation. They were usually told quite forcefully, in short, to shut-up or pay the price. These were sinister, ominous, and frightening People that some reported as being really strange with pale white skin, awkward demeanors, and uncomfortable in domestic situations. In other words they didn't quite have a handle on the Human thing and were themselves Aliens masquerading as Government Operatives.The Movie takes the concept and turned it into an offbeat Comedy that works quite well. After all, those Real-Life situations were nothing more than anxiety prone, easily traumatized, Folks who were imagining such things at best, and at worst outright Hoaxes. So none of it is to be taken seriously.Given that, this succeeds on many levels. it taps into the whole Ufology thing and spins a wild tale of a mostly benign Alien Invasion. But there are so many different types of Lifeforms that occasionally some become a threat and so the Black Ops Government tries to keep a watch on the goings and comings. This is all handled in such good spirits here that it becomes an infectious, silly romp that is immensely entertaining and a lot of fun. It holds up well with good Performances and Direction, wacky SFX and make-up, and a good score. Not quite as good as Mars Attacks (1996), but still quite a Show.

One of the main issues is the fact that this one is quite a bit longer than necessary, it's running time dragged out by the inclusion of scenes that really serve no purpose being there to begin with or simply taking far too long to get it's point across when some streamlining could've been incredibly beneficial. Take five to ten minutes off this one and it's golden, if it would've bothered to answer several rather important questions within that would've helped make this one more enjoyable, one of which is even voiced by a character in the film which is never a good sign. There's still a lot to like here with plenty of exciting, grandiose action scenes that really work well, including the vampires' initial escape from the facility, a dash across the English countryside to corral the creature and some high-scale scenes of city destruction in the finale that offers more of a science-fiction spectacle that horror-based thrills. Still, the creature's continuous threat and historical significance played into their back-story are nice touches overall, and when matched with some nice gore bits and continuous nudity from those well-able to provide it makes for a pretty entertaining effort.Rated R Continuous Full Nudity, Graphic Violence and Language.
