[{"date":"17 June 2012","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Fight Club Is without a doubt the craziest film I have ever seen. The twist in the film was spoiled for me so I won't spoil it for any of you guys. It took me way too long to finally watch this film and I regret not watching it earlier, it stars my favourite actor, Edward Norton, who's performance in American History was jaw dropping and another great actor known as Brad Pitt who stars in se7en which is also directed by David Fincher. Fight Club see's a no named man known as The Narrator (Edward Norton) go through his life dealing with insomnia. During this remarkable journey he meets a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on plane. After an accident which causes The Narrator's apartment to explode, then leads to him living with Tyler. After a night of drinking, the two drunk friends then start to fight each other, however, it isn't a fight to do with hate, the two remain friends. They fight once again after another night of drinking but this time they are spotted. The two that found Tyler and The Narrator fighting then ask if they can join in, this leads to more and more people joining in. They decided to call it Fight Club. I won't go any further as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone. Fight Club is probably my favourite film of all time and it should be watched ASAP. The acting and story make Fight Club arguably one of the greatest films ever made. I give Fight Club 5 stars.

It takes a truly wretched movie to kill off one of those franchises. Joel Schumacher did it. He killed Batman. Schumacher's first Batman film, Batman Forever, was an abomination. But Warner Bros. let him make another one. Mistake. Big, huge, giant, franchise-killing mistake. If you thought Schumacher camped it up in the last one wait until you get a load of this. The hideously unfunny puns, the absurdly out of place innuendos, Gotham lit up like a neon amusement park. And nipples. Yes, the Bat-nipples are back. Codpieces too. Schumacher turned Batman into a joke.Val Kilmer was smart enough to steer clear of this mess so we get another new Batman. It's George Clooney this time and he doesn't make much of an impression at all. Sadly that's the nicest thing you can say about any of the film's stars. While Clooney is neither notably good nor notably bad, just kind of there, his costars all fail miserably. First there is the woefully miscast Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Mr. Freeze. Schwarzenegger spends the whole movie spouting some of the worst one-liners ever put to film. There are only so many jokes about ice and cold which can fall flat before you want to start throwing things at the screen. Meanwhile, surrendering every last bit of indie film cred she had accrued, there is Uma Thurman playing Poison Ivy. The character is a total dud and Thurman hams it up to an absurd extent. You want some menace from your villains in a superhero movie? Sorry, you've come to the wrong place. Mr. Freeze is a joke. Poison Ivy is a joke. Everything in this movie is a joke. Which brings us to Chris O'Donnell. Yes, whiny Robin's back but you probably guessed that from the film's title. But for this film one whiny, spoiled brat would-be superhero wasn't nearly enough so Batgirl gets tossed into the mix. Alicia Silverstone mopes her way through the film in that role. If you think her acting is terrible, and it is, just wait until you see her fight. Worst. Fight. Ever. Is there anything nice to say about anyone at all? Well, Michael Gough, playing trusted butler Alfred, is a fine actor and deserves so much better than to be surrounded by so much garbage.In big-budget extravaganzas like this even if the story stinks and the acting stinks and the directing stinks you can usually say, well, at least the effects look great. But alas, in this movie even the effects are terrible. Strictly amateur hour. Apparently the film's entire budget went to Schwarzenegger's and Clooney's salaries. The lame, cheesy effects fit right in with everything else about this debacle of a movie. The script is an atrocity. The action scenes are absurd, often incoherent, and largely just wastes of time. The hockey scene? Ugh. The motorcycle race? Double ugh. Robin yelling Cowabunga! as he surfs to Earth on the remnants of an exploded rocket? Oh dear God. The only thing which could make this movie worse is if Batman whipped out a Bat-credit card. Oh, he did. Where does the credit card company send the bill I wonder? Does Batman have a P.O. Box? Well now I've really digressed but that's much better than actually continuing to talk about this movie. What's left to say? It's awful, terrible, hideous. Don't ever watch it. There is one legitimately funny thing in the movie though. Unfortunately it's a laugh at the movie, not laugh with the movie type of thing. It comes at the end when the movie tries to set up the next sequel. But we know there would be no next sequel. Because this movie was so bad it did the impossible, it killed Batman. Of course no comic book hero can ever truly die. So let's just go watch the Christopher Nolan movies and pretend this never happened.

And it's not necessarily a bad thing. The artistic techniques to put a four hour seminal epic like Gone with the Wind on screen were quite different and limited back in the days, however the inventiveness to tell a great story and choose the right means was disproportionately higher - and it shows.The brainchild of powerful producer David O. Selznick, the filmed version of Margaret Mitchell's best seller does nothing that hasn't been done before, but everything with utmost perfection and teems with high production values every way you look at it. The list of what Gone with the Wind lifts high above other films just goes on and on There's of course that great story of the Old South dealing with a generation entangled in the throes of the American Civil War. This however is only the backdrop of one of the greatest romances of all time, which is not presented as sugar-coated, tear-jerking escapism, but as a wild clash of sexes through strong personalities, driven by egotism and vanity, mirroring the downfall of a whole civilization. The narration is shown in lush Technicolor cinematography, at key points composite storybook images are used with layers upon layers of painted images added to the shots in order to exude the required sense of drama and give it a fairy-tale, almost dreamlike quality. Hundreds of costumed extras fight and litter the street of dying men the heroine Scarlett walks through to give just one shining example, Max Steiner's score is grand and epic, and the cast headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable is legendary as their sensual tension is deep and intensely felt by the viewer. In short Gone with the Wind is a marvel of cinematic brilliance, and more. And to everyone who thinks otherwise Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
