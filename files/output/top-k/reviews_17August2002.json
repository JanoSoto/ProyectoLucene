I just think it's funny that I've seen an entire DC Original Movie. Pray for me, my children. Anyway, it turns out that while light in story and character development, the stunning oceanic cinematography really saved the day here. I could watch those foaming, crushing waves all day, and some of the camera tricks were really creative. Whouda thunk? But we obviously can't spend ALL of our time out on the water, so there is a simple story here about a girl who used to be the greatest gal surfer on the beach, but after a near-drowning accident she's lost her spirit. Sound familiar, sports movie fans? She lives with two friends and her younger sister in the perfect beach bum shack, living from paycheck to paycheck by working as a maid in the nearby fancy hotel. There's a rich love interest, a sub-plot about the kid sister smoking, but none of it really goes anywhere. Everything really depends on the Big Surfing Contest at the end of the film, where if our heroine wins she will get all kinds of sponsorship and realize her dream of putting female surfing on the cover of every magazine. This inevitable showdown is really handled well, and I genuinely rooted for the girl as she tried to catch the perfect wave. My only problems revolve around the expend- able boyfriend and sister characters, who don't really do anything except spout out lines like, Belive in yourself. You can do it!

The problem was, the audience of the first movie saw it and was expecting it to be like a continuation of the original. That simply wasn't the case.

The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960's finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800's. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah's story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there're some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter &#150; I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It's not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like 'Spider-Man' and the teen movie 'Bring It On.' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy's brother Peter, but he was okay. I don't think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he'll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don't like mild terror, but I doubt you'll have to, especially on video (I'll admit the theater added some more terror). It's not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he's seen, I think he's way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a 'should be PG-13' because it's not. It's great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4\/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.

He's uses these talents to steal the cars of congressmen who protest against rap & videogames. He videotapes the stunts so that he can recieve all the attention he feels he deserves. Oh, it gets cheesier than this. The U.S. government makes him become a secret agent for their organization (in exchange for a clean criminal record), to stop a group of Russian ex-military anarchists from using a submarine to detonate missiles of a deadly virus over the world's major city.Yorgi (the villain) and his band of goons, called Anarchy 99, are laughably bad Russian villian stereotypes, and only one of them even looks like he came from northern Europe.Xander Cage (XXX), shouldn't really be compared to 007, but more to John McClane (Mr. Willis' character from the Die Hard trilogy). He holds a very human quality to all of the events in the film, he complains, he wisecracks, he acts like this whole thing is a big pain in his butt, but in the end he knows it's the right thing to do.

Samuel as always is loveable.As far as the stunts, well they are the star of the show. My jaw was almost on the floor with the avalanche scene. All of the stunts may be impossible to pull off, but they look extremely good and extremely exciting. The one I had a real problem with believing is when XXX uses a small metal food tray as a skateboard to grind down the railing of some steps. Of course now that I think about it, I'm sure we could get a castmember of Jackass to pull that off.Other cool features are the cameos, including rap-starlet Eve (waaaay better than having Ja Rule in it), Tony Hawk, Matt Hoffman, Leila Arcieri, and the best one, the German industrial rock band, Rammstein.I can definately recommend XXX to all movie fans who like to laugh at B-movie plots and acting, and I can recommend it to anyone who really likes movie stunts.

As a matter of fact, you'd be hard pressed to find more cheese anywhere outside of a Wisconsin dairy farm.Juni and Carmen Cortez (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) are back, now officially a part of OSS, and officially recognized as Spy Kids.  But the OSS, just like every other government bureaucracy, cannot resist expanding upon a good thing, so now there is an entire army of spy kids at their disposal; but Juni and Carmen are, of course, the most renowned. Within in the first opening minutes of the film, which takes place in a truly inspired theme park, we quickly discern that Juni and Carmen have rivals the Giggle kids (Matthew O'Leary and Emily Osment) who dearly covet the Cortez' fame and status.  With help of their conniving father (Mike Judge), the Giggles do what they can, not only to surpass the Cortez family, but to humiliate them as well.Once again, we find the greatest threat to the OSS is the OSS itself, along with the internal politics and treachery which played a small but significant part in the plot of the first film.   It seems as if the OSS is more of a threat to world peace than a help, and one wonders why Uncle Sam doesn't just shut the operation down and call it a day.  Perhaps it would prevent the making of any more Spy Kids movies, which I'm beginning to think would be a very good thing.The plot revolves around a device known as a transmooker  -- which can be best described as the ultimate cloaking device, even able to cloak entire islands off the map.  It also has the wonderful ability to render all electronic devices useless, which is quite a thorn in the side of the intrepid Spy Kids, who's reliance on James Bond style fancy gadgets is only a shade less than an alcoholic's dependence on his next drink.  Of course the transmooker itself is an electronic device, but somehow is immune to its own nasty effects.  (Only in Hollywood....)So our two heroes, Juni and Carmen, locate the cloaked island, where the stolen transmooker was taken, and attempt to find it before their rivals, the Giggles kids, do.  The island turns out to be a retirement resort for every single monstrous creature ever created by Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, 7th Voyage of Sinbad, etc.).  Except we are told that they were created by the socially insecure and somewhat troubled scientist Dr. Romero (Steve Buscemi) who was looking for some companionship, and a portable zoo.  But of course those of us who've seen a few movies in our time know better.  During the same time, there is a completely boring and totally unnecessary sub-plot involving Carmen & Juni's parents and grandparents.  The only reason the subplot exists is to cloak this poor homage to Harryhausen as a family film.  Yeah, right.  I certainly fell for it.Hollywood films, especially action-adventures and sci-fi flicks, often  ask the audience to suspend logic and rational thought while the plot thickens.  It is the price we pay, beyond the ticket price, for the pleasure of being entertained.  But Spy Kids 2 doesn't just ask for a suspension of belief, but a wholesale slaughter of anything remotely resembling intelligence.  That's a big price to pay, and one I was unable to justify. If Daniel Rodriguiez is such a fan of Harryhausen, then he should make The 8th Voyage of Sinbad or some such thing, rather than trying to find a way to incorporate Ray's creatures into a movie allegedly about espionage.  The CGI recreations of Harryhausen's monsters was one of the more enjoyable aspects of this horrid film, but not enough to pull it out of the slimy pit in which very poor writing knocks it into.  The dialogue is stupid, even for kids to listen to.  Most of the jokes fall as flat as the acting.   Much of the cuteness and fun of the first Spy Kids film is completely lacking in the sequel.  Instead, we have a very disjointed plot, an adventure that leads to nowhere, and a subplot that should have been locked in the submarine where it mostly takes place.

It seems as if the OSS is more of a threat to world peace than a help, and one wonders why Uncle Sam doesn't just shut the operation down and call it a day.  Perhaps it would prevent the making of any more Spy Kids movies, which I'm beginning to think would be a very good thing.The plot revolves around a device known as a transmooker  -- which can be best described as the ultimate cloaking device, even able to cloak entire islands off the map.  It also has the wonderful ability to render all electronic devices useless, which is quite a thorn in the side of the intrepid Spy Kids, who's reliance on James Bond style fancy gadgets is only a shade less than an alcoholic's dependence on his next drink.  Of course the transmooker itself is an electronic device, but somehow is immune to its own nasty effects.  (Only in Hollywood....)So our two heroes, Juni and Carmen, locate the cloaked island, where the stolen transmooker was taken, and attempt to find it before their rivals, the Giggles kids, do.  The island turns out to be a retirement resort for every single monstrous creature ever created by Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, 7th Voyage of Sinbad, etc.).  Except we are told that they were created by the socially insecure and somewhat troubled scientist Dr. Romero (Steve Buscemi) who was looking for some companionship, and a portable zoo.  But of course those of us who've seen a few movies in our time know better.  During the same time, there is a completely boring and totally unnecessary sub-plot involving Carmen & Juni's parents and grandparents.  The only reason the subplot exists is to cloak this poor homage to Harryhausen as a family film.  Yeah, right.  I certainly fell for it.Hollywood films, especially action-adventures and sci-fi flicks, often  ask the audience to suspend logic and rational thought while the plot thickens.  It is the price we pay, beyond the ticket price, for the pleasure of being entertained.  But Spy Kids 2 doesn't just ask for a suspension of belief, but a wholesale slaughter of anything remotely resembling intelligence.  That's a big price to pay, and one I was unable to justify. If Daniel Rodriguiez is such a fan of Harryhausen, then he should make The 8th Voyage of Sinbad or some such thing, rather than trying to find a way to incorporate Ray's creatures into a movie allegedly about espionage.  The CGI recreations of Harryhausen's monsters was one of the more enjoyable aspects of this horrid film, but not enough to pull it out of the slimy pit in which very poor writing knocks it into.  The dialogue is stupid, even for kids to listen to.  Most of the jokes fall as flat as the acting.   Much of the cuteness and fun of the first Spy Kids film is completely lacking in the sequel.  Instead, we have a very disjointed plot, an adventure that leads to nowhere, and a subplot that should have been locked in the submarine where it mostly takes place.

As a matter of fact, you'd be hard pressed to find more cheese anywhere outside of a Wisconsin dairy farm.Juni and Carmen Cortez (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) are back, now officially a part of OSS, and officially recognized as Spy Kids.  But the OSS, just like every other government bureaucracy, cannot resist expanding upon a good thing, so now there is an entire army of spy kids at their disposal; but Juni and Carmen are, of course, the most renowned. Within in the first opening minutes of the film, which takes place in a truly inspired theme park, we quickly discern that Juni and Carmen have rivals the Giggle kids (Matthew O'Leary and Emily Osment) who dearly covet the Cortez' fame and status.

I don't know if it was the way she played Kate, or the way the scriptwriters wrote Kate, or the way the directors directed Meg, or a combination of the above, but I could not stand this woman!  And that goes beyond the dislike for her twitty, totally dense nature. I don't know if we were meant to like her, but I certainly didn't. By the end of the movie, I didn't want her to go back in time simply because I didn't want anything nice to happen to her.  I thought it would serve her right to spend the rest of her life sucking up to her philandering fake of a boss. If it wasn't enough that she was clueless about people and had totally backward priorities, her mannerisms and her appearance were completely irritating.  And what on earth happened to her hair??  Is this even the same person who was in Sleepless in Seattle?  I know it's not trendy to be pretty these days, but has it gone so far that an actress making millions of dollars for a film has hair (and at times clothes) that a scarecrow wouldn't be caught *dead* with??  In short, I never thought I would see a mediocre movie where Meg Ryan was the weakest spot, but now I have.Hugh Jackman was OK, and he acted his part well.  However, the writers had him adapt a bit too easily to life in the 21st century, even for an inventor who would take things in stride a bit better than most.  He adopted modern mannerisms too naturally, in my opinion.Among the few bright points in the movie were Kate's administrative assistant, Darcy and her brother Charley, with Jackman's gallantry having a minor role in pulling the movie out of the worst I've ever seen category.  Maybe the producers would like to hire these three to star in a movie that would actually be romantic and funny.  It would have to be better than Kate and Leopold, anyway.

Is this even the same person who was in Sleepless in Seattle?  I know it's not trendy to be pretty these days, but has it gone so far that an actress making millions of dollars for a film has hair (and at times clothes) that a scarecrow wouldn't be caught *dead* with??  In short, I never thought I would see a mediocre movie where Meg Ryan was the weakest spot, but now I have.Hugh Jackman was OK, and he acted his part well.  However, the writers had him adapt a bit too easily to life in the 21st century, even for an inventor who would take things in stride a bit better than most.  He adopted modern mannerisms too naturally, in my opinion.Among the few bright points in the movie were Kate's administrative assistant, Darcy and her brother Charley, with Jackman's gallantry having a minor role in pulling the movie out of the worst I've ever seen category.  Maybe the producers would like to hire these three to star in a movie that would actually be romantic and funny.  It would have to be better than Kate and Leopold, anyway.

We rented it tonight and we were quite disappointed for several reasons.First and foremost was Meg Ryan's character.  I don't know if it was the way she played Kate, or the way the scriptwriters wrote Kate, or the way the directors directed Meg, or a combination of the above, but I could not stand this woman!  And that goes beyond the dislike for her twitty, totally dense nature. I don't know if we were meant to like her, but I certainly didn't. By the end of the movie, I didn't want her to go back in time simply because I didn't want anything nice to happen to her.  I thought it would serve her right to spend the rest of her life sucking up to her philandering fake of a boss.

Because I was told I had an inadequate amount of evidence to prove my point!  So here I go.Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly, nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes.  It seemed that the whole movie revolved around an insomniac!  And that's true--this movie is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep.  For over half of it seems to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what kind of main character is known only as The Narrator?), and a crummy soundtrack.  I was SO disappointed.Plot Outline A man disillusioned by what his life has become encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of life.Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't come in until WAY later.  And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it is hardly shown.  Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm sorry, but how utterly boring!  From the commercials and video cover, I was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group that doesn't serve a purpose.I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter.  Hey, lady, you did excellent in Planet of the Apes!  But in this movie she plays as a rival counseling group member (speaking of which, what purpose do these groups serve for the movie?  NOTHING!).  Basically, her character is a slut and we see her naked once or twice (ooh, yeah, maybe THAT'S why everyone liked the movie!).The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so cool) is fighting himself, is utterly pathetic.  How boring.  And then the buildings topple... and that's the end.  Ho!  Wait!  I see a naked man from the waist down at the ending!  Maybe this is the second reason people liked this stupid, boring movie so much.  It shows both female AND male anatomy.How stupid!  Repulsive!  I DESPISED this movie.  Now you know why.  If, in fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely1.  Boring 2.  No plot (adds to number 1) 3.  Shallow characters 4.  Actual film has hardly anything to do with its title 5.  Constant swearing\/nudity that sickened me 6.  Music was cruddyBasically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity.  I was so sick of it before the first half hour was up.I will never watch it again.  And I hope my review will help keep you from watching it as well.
