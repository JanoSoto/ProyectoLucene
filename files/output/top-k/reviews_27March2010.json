And yet Leon is also a great coming of age tale, with Natalie Portman putting in a great performance in a difficult role that would be above the ability of many young actresses.As much as i really like Jean Reno, he is not a nuanced actor. he is likable, charming in a dumb sort of way, but subtlety isn't his forte. good thing Leon is required to speak little, and basically maintain a gruff exterior and stoic facial expression the entirety of the movie...seriously, his beloved pot plant is more expressive (ok thats a tad harsh, i know). it seems besson tried to inject some quirkiness into the character (his best friend is a pot plant, he seems to exist purely on a diet of milk, he likes gene kelly etc) in order to make him more interesting an unique, but these traits seemed tacked on.Then we go to the other end of the spectrum with Gary oldman's performance....haha, i mean WOW....great actor and I'm a fan of his overall body of work, but he so completely overacts and chews up the scenery every time he's on screen, it severely dampens my enthusiasm for the movie. every bit of body language, every word that he screeches, just sets my teeth on edge. just taking a pill (supposedly to curb his psychotic tendencies? hmm, maybe up the dosage...) involves shaking the little capsule tin up to his ear (???) then swallowing the pill, and having a full body convulsion, neck twisting while he groans loudly...i mean, a simple bodily function turns into a grand opera in oldman's hands, its ridiculous.This ridiculousness in the acting also extends to the story, which in some moments just made me shake my head in disbelief. the climactic action scene, where it must be close to 100 swat team are trying to storm an apartment to kill one man, (oh, and using rocket launchers for gods sake) is so over the top it robs the scene of any true tension, as its all so unrealistic. there are a multitude of such stupid, unrealistic moments that i could list at least another 10 without thinking about it. anyway, the movie has some serious flaws, i think I've made that pretty clear by now.But the Pro's do outweigh the Con's. as mentioned before Portman made the world sit up and take notice with her performance here.Between Reno's stonefaced acting, and Oldman's histrionics, sits a balanced, mature depiction of a girl on the cusp of puberty. Portman is magnetic and you cant help but fall in love with her like Leon does. So where do i sit with the whole age gap thing? to be honest its never really bothered me, bloody oldmans acting and the stories ridiculousness have always been my gripes with the movie. Portman and Reno certainly have a chemistry that works on screen, their scenes together are among the best, as their relationship grows from a father\/daughter relationship to something deeper.And as mentioned before, Besson is a brilliant visual artist, no denying that. for all the weakness of the story, the visual beauty carries the film for all its 2+ hr length. Its just a shame that the films acting and plot leave me almost laughing in disbelief at its ridiculousness. Nevertheless, id give it a 7 out of 10, as its entertaining and re-watchable.

Strong premise certainly- a man finds himself indestructible, and there's another man who is at the other extreme, and whose bones break constantly. A man looking for a hero- the reverse of himself. OK. We watched it with an open mind, expecting a decent movie. I have to say, this is the slowest, dullest movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it dull, but it off the scale in terms of pretentiousness and self-importance. It's one of those movies where, if you think it's dull, then you're just not intelligent or you just dont get it. The actors all seem to sleep through their roles here, like they're waiting for the ending to come, just like we were. Too many artists (in all media) with breakout successes follow it up with a second effort that is overblown and misses the point of what made them successful. Unbreakable is a perfect example. What a pointless mess, with the big M.Night twilight-zone TWIST at the end... hit me like, OK, yeah, I get it. Nothing NEAR the impact of the twist, and the conclusion, of the Sixth Sense. His next effort, Signs, is an underrated movie that gets better when you see it a second, third time. After that... M. Night's career just spiraled out of control. Most of them are formulaic and borderline-unwatchable. It's as if he is desperate to re-create the magic of his first movie, but clueless how to go about it. If he gets another chance- and anyone with the vision to create an amazing movie like The Sixth Sense should have as many chances as they'll give him- I hope he goes back to what made that movie great. Snappy pacing, great acting, intricate plot that rewards the audience consistently, ending that ties everything together and satisfies while shocking at the same time.

I re-watched the original and this one after seeing writer\/director Christopher Nolan's take on the popular comic book character with Batman Begins and the Dark Knight which are so much better than Burton's no offense. Director Tim Burton does an okay job making this sequel but some problems weigh it down which I'll get into later. Michael Keaton reprises the role of Bruce Wayne\/Batman whose decent as the character but he isn't as good as Christian Bale in my opinion. He wasn't able to bring the presence Bale brought to the character. Keaton however does what he can with what very little he was given. Danny Devito had a little more to work with as The Penguin and he's okay despite shouting a lot of his lines. DeVito is a good actor but this isn't his best performance. It maybe because I just don't find the Penguin that interesting of a villain but DeVito still turns in a solid performance none the less as the short grotesque and deformed enemy of the Dark Knight. Michelle Pffiefer fared much better as Selina Kyle\/Catwoman turning in a solid performance as the dangerous femme fatale. Burton probably should have chosen just one of them to be the villain for this film because their story arcs felt rushed at times because Pfieffer does an impressive job with her role. Well done. Christopher Walken does his best as Max Shreck a psychotic businessman who helps The Penguin run for mayor. Walken sort disappears for much of the second half only to reappear for the third act but he's okay in the role. The rest of the cast are so-so but none of them are memorable. Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon have what amounts to a few extended appearances which is disappointing because their characters could've been handled much better. They both do what their roles require I guess though. The action sequences are well executed but none of them are exciting or intense as the ones in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. The dialog was once again cheesy at times and many characters like Harvey Dent for one aren't even in it or mentioned making their appearances in the first one seem totally pointless. Like Burton's first Batman one of the biggest problems is that this sequel seemed to focus mainly on the Penguin and Catwoman instead of the title character himself especially in the first hour. Keaton doesn't even show up until over 12 minutes into the film. He makes a brief extended appearance with very little dialog for an action sequence and then his character disappears until almost 40 minutes into the movie since most of the beginning centers on The Penguin and Selina Kyle's Catwoman. For a while it seemed Keaton has a cameo in his own movie which didn't help in the long run. After that initial first 40 minutes luckily he's in it more but Keaton seemed to get cheated out of some more much needed development and screen time again. I didn't realize just how little these films actually focused on the Dark Knight until I decided to recently re-watch them. It's always not a good idea to focus more on the villains than the main character because he's the one the audience is going to care about. I thought this problem was solved with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight because at least those films focused much more on Bruce Wayne\/Batman especially Begins. The Dark Knight felt like an ensemble piece and by the end I think Bale got just as much screen time as the late Heath Ledger, Aaron Echkhart, and Gary Oldman. That film focused on the four of them evenly giving all four actors plenty of moments to develop their characters and shine. Overall Batman Returns isn't that bad of a sequel it just could have been better. I recommend Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to any fan of the comic book character because both films are entertaining fast paced action crime dramas and worth the time to watch. Batman Returns had potential to be a good sequel only it ended up being somewhat of a letdown compared to Nolan's two superior films on the Cape Crusader. Yeah it has some cool action, a little dark humor, and solid performances by the cast (Keaton, Devito, and especially Pfeiffer) but I just wish the film itself was a lot better than it turned out to be.

Walken sort disappears for much of the second half only to reappear for the third act but he's okay in the role. The rest of the cast are so-so but none of them are memorable. Michael Gough as Alfred and Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon have what amounts to a few extended appearances which is disappointing because their characters could've been handled much better. They both do what their roles require I guess though. The action sequences are well executed but none of them are exciting or intense as the ones in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. The dialog was once again cheesy at times and many characters like Harvey Dent for one aren't even in it or mentioned making their appearances in the first one seem totally pointless. Like Burton's first Batman one of the biggest problems is that this sequel seemed to focus mainly on the Penguin and Catwoman instead of the title character himself especially in the first hour. Keaton doesn't even show up until over 12 minutes into the film. He makes a brief extended appearance with very little dialog for an action sequence and then his character disappears until almost 40 minutes into the movie since most of the beginning centers on The Penguin and Selina Kyle's Catwoman. For a while it seemed Keaton has a cameo in his own movie which didn't help in the long run. After that initial first 40 minutes luckily he's in it more but Keaton seemed to get cheated out of some more much needed development and screen time again. I didn't realize just how little these films actually focused on the Dark Knight until I decided to recently re-watch them. It's always not a good idea to focus more on the villains than the main character because he's the one the audience is going to care about. I thought this problem was solved with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight because at least those films focused much more on Bruce Wayne\/Batman especially Begins. The Dark Knight felt like an ensemble piece and by the end I think Bale got just as much screen time as the late Heath Ledger, Aaron Echkhart, and Gary Oldman. That film focused on the four of them evenly giving all four actors plenty of moments to develop their characters and shine. Overall Batman Returns isn't that bad of a sequel it just could have been better. I recommend Batman Begins and The Dark Knight to any fan of the comic book character because both films are entertaining fast paced action crime dramas and worth the time to watch. Batman Returns had potential to be a good sequel only it ended up being somewhat of a letdown compared to Nolan's two superior films on the Cape Crusader. Yeah it has some cool action, a little dark humor, and solid performances by the cast (Keaton, Devito, and especially Pfeiffer) but I just wish the film itself was a lot better than it turned out to be. I'd chose Nolan's two Batman movies any day over this one.

Director Tim Burton does an okay job of making this movie back in 89 but some flaws weigh it down which I'll get into later. Jack Nicholson does a good job as Jack Napier who eventually becomes Batman's arch enemy The Joker but I felt he went too over the top at times. I didn't think he stole the movie like some other people apparently did. Nicholson turns in a decent performance but I for one thought the late Heath Ledger was much better as The Joker in the Dark Knight giving audiences a creepy, mysterious, sinister, and charismatic villain who was unpredictable and he most definitely lived up to the tile of Batman's arch nemesis. Nicholson wasn't as scary as Ledger but he makes you occasionally chuckle with his dark humor. Michael Keaton does what he can as Bruce Wayne\/Batman but I was surprised at how little the movie does focus on him because it's mostly about the Joker. Keaton does what his role requires I guess but I still think Christian Bale is the best actor to play Bruce Wayne\/Batman hands down. He had a lot more to work with than Keaton and was overall more effective in the role. Keaton didn't bring the kind of presence Bale brought to the character but he turned in a decent performance none the less. Kim Basinger is okay as reporter Vicki Vale but she did get a little annoying sometimes mainly because of her almost constant screaming in the film when she's in danger. Basinger is a decent actress but this isn't her best performance no offense. She like Keaton does what he role requires I suppose though. The rest of the cast are so-so because none of them are memorable. The action sequences are well executed but they're missing the wow factor like the ones in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight which were fast paced, exciting, and intense compared to this movie. I felt the story focused too much on Nicholson's Joker with Keaton's Bruce Wayne\/Batman getting cheated out of some much needed development and screen time. The dialog was cheesy at times and many characters like Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Dent, and Alfred to name a few got the short end of the stick since they merely show up for only a handful of extended appearances. I thought Bruce Wayne's relationship with Alfred and Gordon was much better developed in Batman Begins because the three actors (Christian Bale, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Gary Oldman as Gordon) had genuine chemistry in their scenes together which always helps make a film better. I also preferred Aaron Echkarts performance of Harvey Two-Face Dent in The Dark Knight over Billy Dee Williams. He's barely in this one at all and wasn't given as much to wok with as Eckhart. Williams is okay in the role but nothing special. Another thing is that Batman doesn't kill he has morals but in this movie he does and that just didn't seem right. Tim Burton's Batman really isn't that bad of a movie don't get me wrong it's just not that great when the title character takes a back seat to the villain. Overall Batman is a decent movie based on the comic book character but none of them are even in the same league as Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. Those films at least centered a lot more on Bruce Wayne\/Batman than Burton's making you care about him. They also explained why he'd dress up like a bat and fight crime which the others only hinted at but never fully explored.

Taggart goes after his spineless son Orin Jr. (Hunt) who runs the business locally and eventually takes it to the top and sends Sr. to the big house in an anti climatic ending.This is one of Seagal's worst movies in my opinion. Even in films where the script was bad, Seagal usually would come through with some good fight sequences but even these are fairly lame in this. More often you are waiting for some action to actually happen, but rather you get to see Seagal glad hand the locals, sing, play guitars, square dance, give an environmental speech and do routine maintenance for the poor. Can you say stupid? The movie is boring and Seagal supposedly undercover stands out like sore thumb with those silly jackets. With the few action scenes you get, all are vastly inferior to those of his past greats and what kicks he had are very poor indeed. By this time in his career he was not in great shape and this may have affected the scenes in general. The best action scene in the film actually involves a big rig chasing him in truck like Red Fox's. To add to this, there is very little killing in this, not only does he push the environmental message, but he kills very few people. I mean come on, the staple of a film like this is the showdown at the end and the bad guy bites it. But no Seagal wounds the guy and arrests him. And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse.There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last.

And don't even get me started with the gas station and the flare, didn't want to hurt any bystanders I suppose. WEAK! There are plenty of fine actors in this film, not really sure why, who also come out looking thoroughly awful. Nobody usually expects fine acting from a film like this, but good actors can only do so much with a terrible script and this proves good actors can be totally wasted on poor writing. Harry Dean Stanton is great and he has such a weak hillbilly role in this, along with Helgenberger. And of course Seagal speaks as always painfully low toned and silly, like he's on depressants. If your fan of The Punisher look for Mark Collie playing a hick who can't fight. Also once Seagal started putting into his films too much of an environmental message the movies began to go down hill. Believe me, I'm for the environment, but it has very little place in these films and Seagal looks like a fool doing speeches on the subject, remember On Deadly Ground? This is worse.There very few bright spots, one being the location shots. OK nice, but I came to see action not Kentucky. For country music fans I would imagine this is a gold mine, with lots of music and stars making appearances in the films. Again, didn't come to see that. With a few one liners that are OK, there is nothing much more to say that is good. Surprisingly this was released in theaters and I can see why it was one of his last. Overall a very poor action film, with no nudity to speak of equals 1 out of 10 stars.

When someone sees the name Ken Russell they expect a lot more than what's actually on display here. The film tells the story of an archaeologist who finds a odd skull buried in his backyard.

There's a lot to admire about this film but at the same time you have to wonder why someone like Russell would be doing a picture like this and especially in 1988 when it was mainly slasher movies being made. Movies like this here dead twenty-years earlier so how this got the green light is beyond me. With that said, the director certainly brings his style to the production and on this level it works. We get the typical strange images, bizarre dream sequences and some great cinematography as well as a good atmosphere. All of this keeps things moving very well and the cast is also a plus.

The real standout is Donohoe who is magnificent as the female creature with a lust for blood.

The biggest problem with the movie is that we've seen this type of thing countless times before. This movie is in a pretty hard spot as horror fans are going to be turned off by the art-house like film-making and I'm sure art fans are going to be disappointed in what's basically just a B horror film.

That's enough to sustain any movie, and toss in that his friend and fellow manly-man John Huston directed, we have a brutally physical, man-against-nature and man-against-himself film. This is the Bogart of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), where Huston and he again create a character that is as three-dimensional, compelling, repugnant, and cutting as they get. And unlike Treasure, the public and the academy responded well. He won Best Actor in 1952.Katherine Hepburn is another story, and why she was cast for this film I'm not sure (she was chosen before Bogart, and choosing Bogart was her idea). I'll guess it's because she is so physical and fearless, a perfect tomboy in church marm clothes. She overcomes the stiffness of her part by sheer presence, but also, eventually, by her getting tough and dirty, too. She becomes less the preacher's sister and more the pioneer woman caught in the middle of World War I in Africa. She had a rough time during the location shoots, getting sick and losing a lot of weight, so some of her gaunt appearance is not acting one bit.The arrival of the Germans in two main scenes may have seemed necessary in post war American (though a different German-inspired world war). But it enters the movie at first as a curiosity and a necessity, to drive the two characters down the raging river. The second time is near the end, and it turns the movie into a farce. It's the bizarre tone of the ending that throws the movie out of balance. The sudden lighthearted, improbable, and almost goofy turn, so at odds with the rest of the drama (even at odds with the sincerely funny humor earlier on), makes you wonder, after it's over, whether the whole movie was meant to be a kind of excessive satire. If so, I missed it, and might need to see it again to read it differently.But taking it as a high adventure where two unlikely people are stuck having to depend on each other to survive, the movie still stutters. The wildlife shots (from the bow, supposedly) make it a Discover Channel safari at times. The home brew fix-it scenes are interesting but scarcely believable (he welds a metal prop for his boat with a charcoal fire on the beach, for starters). And the key scenes, the second most famous (after the leach scene, which is pretty amazing), are the running the rapids. This occurs several different times, and we have a mixture of actual shots, backscreen shots, and faked shots using a scale model in a studio in England, the boat and stiff dummies shooting down the water unguided and with a fast motion peculiarity. It's almost comical, and I took it as the best they could do for the time, and didn't let it bother me.Now, after the end, I'm wondering if they (Huston et al) never really wanted believability to be an issue.

When I borrowed this film from a local library for a three week loan, I didn't get to watch it until the 20th day and by then I still didn't want to watch it. This film maybe my worst prediction in excitement in a film. The film had me hooked from start to finish and I consider this the greatest musical ever made because it has music, drama, action, laughs, thrills, and a sense of mystery. The acting from Gene Kelly (Don Lockwood) and Donald O'Connor (Cosmo Brown) made acting for what it is now and I am proud to say that. They both were amazing and funny, especially Donald O'Connnor. Debbie Reynolds (Kathy Seldon)was the best female actress in the film. Jean Hagen (Lina Lamont) was terrible because her voice is too scream-like and her acting is dumb even though it's meant to be like that. It is very hard to like her! There was one problem which stopped me from giving this film a perfect ten and that is that the film does not have as much singing as I would have liked. There was too less music but the songs were beautifully written and sung. Since the film did not have too much music it did make way for more non-music time and that's is a great combination of skill.In 1927, the former stunt Don Lockwood becomes a successful actor with the company of his best friend Cosmo Brown forming a romantic pair with the actress Lina Lamont. In the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures, Don accidentally meets the aspirant actress Kathy Selden while escaping from his fans and fall in love for her. Lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice, and Cosmo and Don decides to dub her, using Kathy's voice, to save their movie. When the jealous Lina finds the strategy of the studio, she does not want to share the credits with Kathy and tries to force the studio to use Kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions. But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises.The film will with a doubt amaze old music lovers and just MIGHT make the kids sing What a glorious feelin.... because it surely had me doing just that. My dad smacked me because I sang it out loud in the middle of the night. The neighbors had some complaints as well. I cannot stress how far this movie is a masterpiece and how it should be watched by audiences old and young alike. Do not miss out on something that you rarely see now a days.

Carrey has proved himself time and again many times and should be taken more seriously as an actor. i can't honestly say i liked 'Dumber' or 'Ace', but movies like 'Eternal Sunshine', 'Truman', 'Man in the Moon' and 'Series of Unfotunate Events', are certainly Oscar worthy. he most definitely should have been nominated for 'Liar'. i checked the other nominees that year and his performance was better than more than a few of them. is it because Carrey is a comedian who specializes in over the top humor and slapstick? just because a man is loved by little children doesn't mean you shouldn't take him seriously.'Liar Liar' is a charming film and should be revisited by those who don't take it seriously. it has a message with heart and is a minor classic among recent films.

In Tea with Mussolini, not only does he present his genius at directing, but he manages to use a score of what must have been a maven of egos with the assembled cast. Apparently he's good at this as well. This ensemble of actors would make ANY film worth seeing. Set in Italy (primarily in Florence), this bio-pic captures the eternal beauty of the country yet at the same time presents the macabre, the unacceptable, the dis-ingenuousness of the political system (Mussolini--what more needs to be said in terms of relegating him to ogre status, the little creep!).It is 1935 when we meet the ladies (the Scorpioni, they're called, because they bit, Lily Tomlin says. A group of ex-patriot English women (and two Americans) are living la dolce vita in la belle Italia and then the war comes along. Zeffirelli's portrayal of the times, the scene, the inter-dynamics make this a movie that is one not to miss.
