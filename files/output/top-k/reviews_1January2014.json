I loved it when I was a kid... and I still love it today!The first movie I saw in 2014... and it is a classic!The film is about a private investigator who is hired to take a few photographs of a singer who is accused of cheating on her husband, TV star Roger Rabbit. But when a few photos starts a bigger investigation into murder the case soon hots up.This film was a complete break through in movies. There has been a few movies where live action was mixed with animation, but this was so far ahead of all of the others that the others were not in the same league.The whole film is so well done. The way the actors mix with the cartoons is amazing and most of the time you can't really tell they are not looking at anything. The whole cast did a fantastic job.The film stars Bob Hoskins. Bob is a legend and it is a shame that he has retired. For me this is his best film. Other cast members were Christopher Lloyd. Christopher played Judge Doom. A judge that has found a way to kill toons. He actually plays quite a scary character. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking he was freaky. Especially at the end of the movie. Joanna Cassidy was also one of the main characters. The voice work was awesome too. Charles Fleischer is the voice of Roger as well as a lot of other characters. Charles has had a great career so far. He is in a lot of movies that I have seen and didn't know it was him! Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit. Every single person in this film was brilliant.The story was like something I had never seen before. This film brings back so many memories for me. It is one of my childhood favourites and will stay with me my whole life. I will watching this film again and again. I will never get bored of it... I can't wait until my baby girl is old enough to watch it with me. I want it to be a part of her childhood too.The main thing I love about this movie is the characters that were put together... The classic Warner Brothers short characters, Buggs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosamity Sam etc, all on the same screen as Disney classics Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck... even Dumbo! Betty Boop, Tweetie Pie, Daffy Duck, Goofy... the list just goes on and on.I honestly love this film and have nothing bad to say about it. Every single child should watch this film... they would love it.I am giving this film 9 out of 10.I'm not bad.

This type of genre is not usually my thing. I've never been into this type of stuff, in all honesty. I saw this movie a few years ago, and remembered being somewhat impressed by it. I'm a huge Arnold fan. I'll watch almost anything with him in it, so I decided to revisit this movie. It is a bit plodding in the middle section at times, but this movie was a highly entertaining way to spend 2 hours or so. One thing that amazed me was how well it holds up. The production values are immaculate, the set-pieces are amazing, and the special effects are still pretty solid. Even the picturesque scenery floored me. John Milus does everything he can to ensure the viewers that he's creating some enthralling storytelling to make a memorable epic. That's exactly what Milus did. The opening packs an emotional wallop. The fact that there was very little dialog made it even more effective. Jorge Sanz (Young Conan) did a tremendous job of selling the horror of the events with perfect facial expressions. Conan himself is a pretty cool cat. The poor guy seems to lose almost everybody he starts caring about. Arnold doesn't have to do much acting as Conan, but he fits the part like a glove. He looks the part, and he had the perfect physique. It was neat to see Arnold evolve into the strong character he becomes. The love story between he & Sandal Bergman was pretty potent stuff, and I bought into it heavily. This is one of Arnold's best roles, and for good reason. Nobody else could give Conan justice like he did. Sandal Bergman is easy on the eyes, but she's also an above average actress. I thought she held her own when it came to her performance. I'd love to have her on my side in a fight. Mako doesn't appear, until around the 63 minute mark or so. He was entertaining when he was on-screen. I enjoyed him a lot. James Earl Jones is quite chilling as Thulsa Doom. He had an intimidating presence. When he speaks, you listen. The showdown at the end between him and Conan gave me chills. Gerry Lopez is a hoot as Conan's friend, Subotai. There is plenty of nudity, exciting sword fights, violence and all sorts of creative things. Aside from the laughable wigs most of the cast had to wear, the slow mid-section, I thought this movie was excellent.

The opening packs an emotional wallop. The fact that there was very little dialog made it even more effective. Jorge Sanz (Young Conan) did a tremendous job of selling the horror of the events with perfect facial expressions. Conan himself is a pretty cool cat. The poor guy seems to lose almost everybody he starts caring about. Arnold doesn't have to do much acting as Conan, but he fits the part like a glove. He looks the part, and he had the perfect physique. It was neat to see Arnold evolve into the strong character he becomes. The love story between he & Sandal Bergman was pretty potent stuff, and I bought into it heavily. This is one of Arnold's best roles, and for good reason. Nobody else could give Conan justice like he did. Sandal Bergman is easy on the eyes, but she's also an above average actress. I thought she held her own when it came to her performance. I'd love to have her on my side in a fight. Mako doesn't appear, until around the 63 minute mark or so. He was entertaining when he was on-screen. I enjoyed him a lot. James Earl Jones is quite chilling as Thulsa Doom. He had an intimidating presence. When he speaks, you listen. The showdown at the end between him and Conan gave me chills. Gerry Lopez is a hoot as Conan's friend, Subotai. There is plenty of nudity, exciting sword fights, violence and all sorts of creative things. Aside from the laughable wigs most of the cast had to wear, the slow mid-section, I thought this movie was excellent. If you're a Conan fan, an Arnold fan, or a fan of this type of genre, this movie will please you. 8.6\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"1 January 2014","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In my efforts to speak Yodaesque words of wisdom on this epic climax to the great galactic adventure, I must also try to keep the little green Jedi's objective dignity.Thus, begin I will by generously saying perhaps a film for children this is, rather than a 'bad' film.

Not because its a bad film, no movie that is considered a stone cold classic and the starting point of one of the biggest film heavyweights in history could be a bad movie but I review my films on entertainment value to me. I could list pros and cons for this film all day and all night because I feel like it has a lengthy list in both columns. On one hand if you look at it from its conception date in the late 1930's, it is brilliant, breathtaking animation. The artistic value on this film is a 20 out of 10. Still today you have to marvel at the beautiful hand drawn art and characters. But you could argue against me until you're blue in the face but I believe this is a movie that could have been told in ten minutes. They drag it out and there is many scenes in the film that are simply too long. Its an extremely dark film (as many of Disney's adventures tend to be) so much so that I personally wouldn't let very young children watch it. And while most of the songs are iconic and lovely, they are far from the best in the Disney animation classic repertoire.Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs created some of the most iconic well known figures in animation history or film history for that matter. Out of all the Disney princesses I have always felt that Adriana Caselotti was the least impressive of the bunch. There are times when her singing voice is almost irritating like sandpaper and her tones are off in various scenes. I don't know why Walt Disney took such a liking to her but she didn't do much else outside of this so I think I may be closer to hitting the nail on the head than you would think. Lucille La Verne is very good as the evil Queen cementing her place in animated villainy quite purposefully. I felt like in this most recent viewing that she was actually almost underused in the film but she does get some terrific and terrifying scenes. Each one of the seven dwarfs are fantastic. They all have such unique (albeit blatantly obvious) personalities. Everyone will find their favourite and while some get more scenes than others, they are terrific. Harry Stockwell as the Prince...well I can't say much of anything about his performance because he is probably the most underused Prince in Disney history. There is no build up to their romance and every scene he is in is very rushed and forced.That is perhaps my biggest issue with the film. So much of it dragged and too much time was spent trying to fill empty void in an effort to make it feature length and then when you hit the climax of her eating the apple...it rushes right through to the end and credits are rolling before you even know what happened. The last ten or fifteen minutes are far too rushed and compact. This film holds its credibility because of what it did for Disney studios and animation and the characters that became so iconic. The six directors that worked on this film deserve most of that credit because it really is a beautiful film to look at. Even the background of each sequence is just lovely.

This film features a cast that is 100% female and it's perhaps the greatest collection of actresses that you're ever going to see. The movie is pretty much about woman who do nothing but gossip and the effect this has on Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) when she learns that her husband is having an affair with Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Had THE WOMEN been released in any other year in the history of cinema then it probably would have walked away with a Best Picture, Director, Actress (Shearer) and Supporting Actress (Crawford) but 1939 was such a strong year with so many landmark movies that it was pretty much shut out. When viewed today it's just incredible to see so much talent in one film. Not only do we get Shearer and Crawford turning in great work but there's also Rosalind Russell, Mary Boland, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, Lucile Watson, Virginia Weidler, Phyllis Povah, Ruth Hussey, Virginia Grey, Marjorie Main and even Hedda Hopper. When the factory system of Hollywood shut down this type of cast just wasn't possible anymore so this here is certainly a once in a lifetime type of event. The story itself does start off a tad bit slow as we're introduced to way too many characters in such a quick time but once the main story kicks in things really turn to a brilliant status. There's a sequence where Shearer confronts Crawford that is so powerful you can see that the actresses are really wanting to go after one another. I'm sure there was a rivalry between the two professionals and you can see them wanting to out-do the other. Another standout is Russell who is simply wonderful as one of the villain gossipers. I will admit that it's somewhat strange seeing a movie with only one sex but there's just no denying that it's impossible to take you eyes off the screen.

The Color of Money is about Paul Newman's character, Fast Eddie Felson, and his salvation to place meaning with significance to his trying lonely life as a pool hustler. Viewers lost in the glam of hustling pool or the action of 9-ball are missing out seeing the real beauty of this film of the story told. The story and life of Fast Eddie Felson that is. And credit to Paul Newman to go along with the brilliant character of course. Newman gives his grade A+ performance, one of the best I've ever seen, from Newman, or from anybody that is. Paul Newman is beautiful. The Color of Money is one truly exceptional character piece. The Color of Money, for my money, is better than The Hustler. It's an incredible sequel. It's an incredible feature. It's one of my more loved movies, mostly for Paul Newman's performance, but also very much for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Tom Cruise as well. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the main co-star here, and Tom Cruise takes on third role. I love the beautiful Mary Elizabeth. She's so good. She has such true acting abilities, which is rarer to find in Hollywood than one might think. Tom Cruise is great as Vincent, one of his more well acted roles to go along with Jerry Maguire and Rain Man, which is his best. Tom Cruise has some true acting talent too, just not like Newman or Mastrantonio, only because that they are two of the very best. Cruise has more star quality though. Don't get me wrong. The kid can act. I just love Tom Cruise. The best of the magic of The Color of Money happens between Newman and Mastrantonio as they quietly share a magnetic connection. The magnificent Martin Scorsese is a master of his trade, maybe the best in the business, and The Color of Money is one other misperceived, under-appreciated Scorsese classic, to go along with Casino and Gangs of New York, as well as but to a smaller scale, Shutter Island, The Aviator, Cape Fear, Bringing Out the Dead, and Mean Streets. The Color of Money is a 9 out of 10 ranking, an outstanding mark, nothing less. I hope I spelled Mary Elizabeth's last name right every time, Mastrantonio. It would be too entirely challenging to revise such a mishap. But I know that I did. Mastrantonio, God, that's a terrific name.

It's an incredible feature. It's one of my more loved movies, mostly for Paul Newman's performance, but also very much for Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Tom Cruise as well. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the main co-star here, and Tom Cruise takes on third role. I love the beautiful Mary Elizabeth. She's so good. She has such true acting abilities, which is rarer to find in Hollywood than one might think. Tom Cruise is great as Vincent, one of his more well acted roles to go along with Jerry Maguire and Rain Man, which is his best. Tom Cruise has some true acting talent too, just not like Newman or Mastrantonio, only because that they are two of the very best. Cruise has more star quality though. Don't get me wrong. The kid can act. I just love Tom Cruise. The best of the magic of The Color of Money happens between Newman and Mastrantonio as they quietly share a magnetic connection. The magnificent Martin Scorsese is a master of his trade, maybe the best in the business, and The Color of Money is one other misperceived, under-appreciated Scorsese classic, to go along with Casino and Gangs of New York, as well as but to a smaller scale, Shutter Island, The Aviator, Cape Fear, Bringing Out the Dead, and Mean Streets. The Color of Money is a 9 out of 10 ranking, an outstanding mark, nothing less. I hope I spelled Mary Elizabeth's last name right every time, Mastrantonio. It would be too entirely challenging to revise such a mishap. But I know that I did. Mastrantonio, God, that's a terrific name.

The Color of Money isn't about young Vincent, or his girlfriend, Carmen. And believe it or not, The Color of Money isn't even about money. The Color of Money is about Paul Newman's character, Fast Eddie Felson, and his salvation to place meaning with significance to his trying lonely life as a pool hustler. Viewers lost in the glam of hustling pool or the action of 9-ball are missing out seeing the real beauty of this film of the story told. The story and life of Fast Eddie Felson that is.

The whole plan goes as wrong as we'd expect and the spoiler richies panic--and then these dumb rich silver spoons all turn on each other. SUICIDE KINGS boasts one of those casts that we'd expect from the latest Tarantino picture. Christopher Walken, Laura Harris, Jeremy Sisto, Brad Garrett, Jay Mohr, Johnny Galecki, Sean Patrick Flanery, Henry Thomas, Laura San Giacomo and Dennis Leary.OK, not quite the highest-of-profile names for the most part. But still, everyone does a worthwhile job. Only Walken, Leary and Galecki only really stand-out. Walken confirms the belief that any scene he's in--just flat-out works. Even when the screenplay gives him the most ludicrous insights But I come from out there, and everybody out there knows, everybody lies cops lie, newspapers lie, parent's lyin'. The one thing you can count on - word on the street... yeah, that's solid. Uh-huh. That's why so many schoolyard and water-cooler rumors are considered holy fact.Walken sees how nervous they all are (who wouldn't be?) and attempts to get them to turn on each other. Seeing as it's a typical hostage situation with the victim being tied to a chair--he tries the usual of divide-and-conquer. There's an inside guy. A mole, he tells them. But who? When they do finally start playing poker, Walken reads them easily.Leary has the most fun in his role doing what I suppose can best be described as the quintessential Denis Leary role. He's Denis Leary in the mob. Ranting about his wife and his expensive footwear. Doing a good deed and then bring down his usual Biblical wrath. Galecki is kind of fun as the rich worrywart nebbish whose family owns the place and seems a lot more concerned with mud being tracked on the floor, what happening to his father's favorite chair than the fact that a mobster is bound and he know everyone's name...All the other actors--they get a passing grade, but they don't quite stand out. SUICIDE KINGS is like that--hit-and-miss. The whole abduction is so badly planned--the movie itself even takes notice of this. At one point in the movie, Walken's character says to his captors You guys didn't think this through too good, did you? Anyone with a handful of working brain cells will be thinking the same thing. I kind of wanted to ask the filmmakers this. The amount of obvious mistakes these guys make. Oh, they're clearly not professionals.The movie's screenwriters Josh McKinney, Gina Goldman and Wayne Allen Rice take Don Stanford's original short story The Hostage from and heavily Quentin Tarantino-ize it. Some thought they paid homage real proper. Some thought all this seems like something at best he might have in the bottom of his drawer--and forgot about forever. Director Peter O' Fallon has real flair and style. He certainly films this thing with a lot of energy to spare. The kind we've seen best in... well, you know where. He gives a lot of wild-child style and so does everyone else involved.Heist\/kidnapping movies that deal with inside jobs just gotta have that moment where the ship's going down in flame and the rats all turn on each other.SUICIDE KINGS is still worth a look for a slow night. Better than a lot of the merde being crapped out of Hollywood's big uncreative anus. SUICIDE KINGS doesn't beat the house and take the pot, but like poker, it's not a bad way to spend a slow night with your friends. And in the end... Well... This is all pretty unbelievable.

Whether it's a hijacking by a villain or simple mechanical malfunction, there have been several types of films that run in a similar fashion. Airport (1970) or Executive Decision (1996), just to name a couple, all take place on a plane with the possibility of it crashing and killing a ton of lives. Unfortunately, there are only so many ways something can be done. And as for this production, nothing really stands out.This story is about a female flight attendant who gets caught in the crossfire on a moving plane that's transporting two dangerous criminals to another city jail. Problem is, she's the only person left alive to fly the plane. It would be OK if this was the only focus but the writer, Jonathan Brett decided to include another subplot - the plane is headed into a level six storm. Thus the name of the title. Not impressive. I'm sure a better title could've been created even if the subplot of the storm wasn't included.The writer, Jonathan Brett isn't a truly established professional. None of his work is well known and for the films he is given credit for, isn't considered to be even mediocre. For example, why would anyone have two licensed criminals board a passenger airplane? And, when they do get on the plane, there are only 10 passengers,&#x85;.so why is it so empty? What kind of writing is this? That's not a good sign and it shows throughout the film. The cast may surprise people though. Ray Liotta, Hector Elizondo, Rachel Ticotin Melina from Total Recall (1990), Catherine Hicks and John Finn all have number of scenes long enough for viewers to appreciate their presence. However, this doesn't mean their performances are good or even close to being any different than their past roles in films.One of the criminals who is the main antagonist is played by Ray Liotta. This isn't a surprise. Liotta proved he could play a scary character in Unlawful Entry (1992) and it was much more realistic. Here, Liotta still can be scary but his performance is either underdone or overdone. Almost like he has a split personality. That would've been more entertaining if that had been written into the screenplay. As for the other actors mentioned, they just play minor characters which is nice when they're on screen but when they aren't, the plot runs extremely slow. Lauren Holly, who plays Teri, the flight attendant isn't entertaining either. Her fear looks real but her voice is irritating and can make it hard for people to sympathize with the character.I'm honestly surprised that the direction wasn't better. The movie is directed by Robert Butler who has 3 Primetime Emmys and a few other awards. The special effects aren't bad either, they at least matched the era of the decade. At least that worked as well as Shirley Walker's score to the film. It wasn't memorable and didn't have a theme but at least it corresponded at all the right moments of each scene. There definitely was the right emotion for each particular segment. But that is it.For a thriller with a B list cast of actors from the small and big screens, one would think this would turn out at least somewhat watchable. It has OK music and special effects but the writing isn't special or even close to being a little different and the acting is poor.

(One of my classmates started his essay with If they're Chelsea fans the only gap in their lives is the one between their ears- a sentiment calculated to rile the teacher, who was of course a fan of that club). Tony Scott's film does not have much to say about the decline of organised religion, but it does explore the phenomenon of the obsessive sports fan and the possibility that such people may be trying to compensate for other gaps in their lives. The main character Gil Renard has a lot in common with William Foster, the anti-hero of another mid-nineties film, Joel Schumacher's Falling Down. Like Foster, he is a divorcée who has become bitterly estranged from his ex-wife who is trying to keep him from seeing their one child. (Here a boy, in Falling Down a girl). Both are unemployed, having been sacked from companies for which they have worked for many years, and both have become disillusioned with modern society as a whole. Foster worked for a defence contractor but was made redundant when the end of the Cold War meant a reduction in American defence spending. Gil is a knife salesman who has been fired because of poor sales figures, but who blames his sacking on the company's cynical policy of deliberately selling low-priced, low-quality products. Gil has some justification for this attitude; the firm was founded by his father, a skilled craftsman and a perfectionist, but its new management takes the view that perfection and principles have no place in business. Having lost both his job and his family, Gil's one remaining passion is for baseball. He is an obsessive fan of the San Francisco Giants and of the team's star player, Bobby Rayburn. (Gil himself was a talented player in his youth, but never played the game professionally). When Rayburn suffers from a run of poor form, causing the team's fans to boo him, and when rumours start about a developing rift between Rayburn and another Giants' star, Juan Primo, Gil decides it is time to take drastic action. This is not the first time Robert De Niro has played an obsessive fan. In King of Comedy his character, Rupert Pupkin, was an aspiring stand- up comedian obsessed with an established comedian. The two films, however, are very different in tone. King of Comedy is a satirical black comedy; Pupkin may carry out a kidnapping, but his crime is treated in a tongue-in-cheek manner and he remains an amusing, almost endearing, character. (And he manages to have the last laugh even after being sent to jail). The Fan, by contrast, is a serious psychological thriller and Gil's actions are always treated seriously. There are also certain similarities with another De Niro character, again an obsessive loner with a grudge against society, Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. In form, The Fan is a deranged stalker thriller, following the structure of something like Fatal Attraction or Single White Female, with Gil as its villain. Yet perhaps it would be more accurate to see him as an anti-hero rather than a straightforward villain. Although he kills two people, and threatens the lives of others, in some ways he is himself a victim, a victim of a court system which treats divorced fathers unfairly and of a business culture which puts a greater premium on profit than on craftsmanship and which treats employees and customers alike with contempt. Even when it comes to his favourite sport, Gil may have some cause for complaint. When he meets Rayburn he becomes disillusioned with his idol's contempt for the fans who pay his wages. Rayburn's insistence that he plays for himself, not for his team's supporters, might seem an admirable attitude in an amateur sportsman; in the case of a professional earning $40 million per annum it just seems like self-indulgence. (Incidentally, was that salary figure a goof or a deliberate exaggeration? Even today no baseball player earns that much; in 1996 the highest paid stars were earning around $10 million).De Niro made a stellar start to his cinematic career in the seventies and eighties, but since then has not always fulfilled his promise. Perhaps Godfather II and Taxi Driver were just too hard an act to follow, or perhaps he has tried to make too many films, not all of which have been of the highest quality. Some of his later films, however, have been excellent ones, and The Fan is a good example. He gives a spellbinding performance as the manically obsessive Gil, the sort of sports fan who reminds you that the word fan was originally short for fanatic and for whom baseball has become more important than life itself. He receives excellent support from Wesley Snipes as Rayburn. The late Tony Scott never seemed to be as highly regarded by the critics as his brother Ridley, one of the cinema's leading auteurs. Yet in my view Tony's talents were of a rather different sort to his brother's. When he tried to make an auteur-style film with The Hunger, the result was a pretentious mess. His talent lay in making more conventional action thrillers, but in making good ones, often with a certain amount of social comment or political significance involved. Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State were two good examples, and The Fan is another. It is perhaps the best cinematic exploration of the social aspects of spectator sport and the darker side of sporting fandom. Perhaps my classmate was more right than he knew when he said that some sports fans have a gap between their ears. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 January 2014","score":"","review":" Once during my schooldays our religious education teacher set us an essay on whether we thought that the modern obsession with sport and pop music was due to a gap in people's lives caused by the decline of organised religion.

The Mister Roberts of the title is Lieutenant Douglas Roberts, cargo officer aboard the United States Navy cargo ship Reluctant. The ship's work of keeping the Navy supplied is vital to the war effort and Roberts performs his duties conscientiously and well, but he is dissatisfied with life. This is partly due to the fact that he longs to see combat action, which he regards as a more exciting and honourable, if more dangerous, form of service, and the Reluctant's work keeps her well away from the actual fighting. It is also, however, partly due to a personality clash between Roberts and the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Morton.Roberts is not the only person with whom Morton clashes. Indeed, he seems to have a personality clash not only with Roberts but with the whole of his crew (and probably with most of the human race).He is an unpopular martinet, obsessed with maintaining strict discipline and imposing harsh punishments for minor infractions of the rules. He is also obsessed with trying to promote his own career by sucking up to the top brass; a palm tree presented to him by an Admiral as a reward for his crew's performance plays an important role in the plot. Roberts has made several requests for a transfer to another ship but all have been rejected after Morton refused to endorse them, not because he is desperate to keep Roberts as part of his crew but because he is anxious to do a bad turn to a man he dislikes. Much of Morton's dislike of Roberts is rooted in inverted snobbery; he is of working-class origin, and at one time worked as a waiter, and resents the educated middle classes, to which Roberts belongs, for the condescending way in which they treated him. In some ways, Morton reminded me of Humphrey Bogart's Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, another film from the mid fifties about a tyrannical wartime naval captain. The main difference is that The Caine Mutiny is a serious drama whereas Mister Roberts is, generally, a comedy. For most of its length the film is played for laughs with Morton as a figure of fun; the crew flirt with pretty nurses, run riot during a long- delayed shore leave on a Pacific island and spend most of their time trying to do as little work as possible and to get around their hated captain's regulations. One officer, Ensign Pulver, spends most of his time idling in his bunk. Only towards the end does the tone of the film become more serious. Henry Fonda, as Roberts, plays his role competently enough, but I still felt he was miscast. In 1955 he would have been 50 years old, too old for a junior officer, and I felt that the role should have gone to a significantly younger man. The studio (Warner Bros.) apparently would have preferred either William Holden (13 years younger) or Marlon Brando (19 years younger) but were overruled by director John Ford who insisted on Fonda. In the event this proved to be an error on Ford's part as he and Fonda repeatedly clashed on set, even though they had previously worked together on Fort Apache. Ford also clashed with another of the film's stars, James Cagney. This was to be one of the reasons (health problems were another) why Ford was replaced as director midway through filming by Mervyn LeRoy. (Both men were credited). Jack Lemmon rather surprisingly received the 1955 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Pulver. I say surprisingly because, although there is nothing particularly bad about his performance, he was up against a much better one from Sal Mineo in Rebel without a Cause. William Powell (acting in his last film, although he was to live for another three decades) is good as the kindly ship's doctor, but the best performance comes from Cagney as the bullying Morton, in my view better here than in Love Me or Leave Me for which he received an Oscar nomination in the same year. The film itself was nominated for Best Picture, a nomination which looks odd when one considers that movies as great as Rebel without a Cause, East of Eden and Bad Day at Black Rock were overlooked. This strikes me as an example of two potentially good films being incongruously joined together to produce, if not a bad one, then a mediocre one. It would have been quite possible to produce a good comedy about a wartime naval crew's battles against an unpopular captain. It would have been equally possible to produce a serious wartime drama about a naval officer who yearns for a transfer to an active combat role, despite the increased risk to his personal safety. Trying to combine both stories in a single tragi-comedy evidently proved more difficult. Comic relief can be an effective device in a predominantly serious play or film. The trouble with Mister Roberts is that it tries to do the opposite, introducing tragic relief into an essentially comic film, and the result is that the final scenes strike a jarring note indeed. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 January 2014","score":"","review":" The action takes place in 1945, in the waning days of World War II.

Isn't that a big enough story without having to add pointless add-ons like the affair and the car crash of the astronomer? Just ridiculous. 2) Tea Leoni is a lovely looking girl but doesn't have the acting skills or gravitas to carry the role with any conviction. 3) Robert Duvall appears to be on autopilot. 4) Towards the end when things are utterly desperate we have the crew on the spaceship giving us tearful farewells, on camera, with their families. Let's see the bigger picture please; we don't care enough about the crew to want to watch these farewells! 5) The spaceship gets bombarded with massive chunks of comet and they practically bounce off it. At those speeds the damage from any one of those impacts would be terminal. What's good.... 1) Morgan Freeman is great, as always. Maximillian Schell even better. 2) The whole premise is thrilling and some of the images quite beautiful.What this film desperately needed was a decent screenplay. That (& the lead actress) are what's at fault here. A better director would help but with a screenplay as woeful as this one, even Spielberg would have struggled.

Just ridiculous. 2) Tea Leoni is a lovely looking girl but doesn't have the acting skills or gravitas to carry the role with any conviction. 3) Robert Duvall appears to be on autopilot. 4) Towards the end when things are utterly desperate we have the crew on the spaceship giving us tearful farewells, on camera, with their families. Let's see the bigger picture please; we don't care enough about the crew to want to watch these farewells! 5) The spaceship gets bombarded with massive chunks of comet and they practically bounce off it. At those speeds the damage from any one of those impacts would be terminal. What's good.... 1) Morgan Freeman is great, as always. Maximillian Schell even better. 2) The whole premise is thrilling and some of the images quite beautiful.What this film desperately needed was a decent screenplay. That (& the lead actress) are what's at fault here. A better director would help but with a screenplay as woeful as this one, even Spielberg would have struggled. Hollywood; next time you're thinking of making a film like this, run the screenplay by me first; it'll save you an awful lot of trouble.

Not much info on his relationship with Al Donnelly; e.g. how good was he at his job, and why Donnelly was so quick to let him have the job with Mike. Lack of time, I guess, but I would have wanted to know more.Farley was definitely the star of the movie, which meant I had to rewind to catch the funnier moments with Spade, if the two were in the same shot. Couldn't help but think Farley wasn't all that fat in this movie, for all the fat jokes.Error alert almost immediately after Mike falls on Steve in the bunk bed scene, the bed is magically in one piece.
