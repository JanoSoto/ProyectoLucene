Since that moment although I have enjoyed a number of films including CROUCHING TIGER & TRAFFIC, I can only claim a few being as fun as THE MUMMY such as GALAXY QUEST & now THE MUMMY RETURNS. I couldn't comment on this film without first responding to critisisms to the break-neck pace which the film travels. I have always believed that action films should only rest when introducing characters who should then be developed within the action sequences, this sequel takes the logical step of assuming prior knowlege of the first film so doesn't waste time making us get to know them all over again. Not only does this give a good reason to start the film with a bang, but also provides some truly inspired ways of developing characters such as the flashback sequences with particular mention to the alternate version of the opening sequence from the first film.But the one thing that a film like this needs is action and effects and the film more than succeeds in both catergories, I know a lot of mention has been made about the final battle with the Anubis warriors and this was nothing short of stunning, on par with the final battle would have to be the bus sequence which returns the extremely cool soldier mummies from the first film and creates one of the most exhilerating vehicle sequences ever, the highlight for me was the 1\/2 mummy fighting Ardeth Bay. I also enjoyed the reworking of the face on the wall of sand sequence and found that for some reason it worked even better this time (probably because it wasn't over-hyped on the preview). Special mention also goes to the pygmie mummies which was an idea I never thought would work but was handled brilliantly with just the right level of surprise and action while also managing to never take itself seriously.The special effects all manage to impress from the subtle work done creating the small scorpian at the start of the film to the incredible creation of the oasis immediatly afterwards. The mummies all looked fantastic with a noticeable improvement made with Imhotep.However the effects I was most waiting for were the Anubis army and the Scorpian King, and while the Anubis army was amazing I felt that the Scorpian King's initial shots were less than impressive, however after about 6 seconds something happened, it starting running around taking chunks out of pillars and knocking over scenery, this is where the CGI suceeded in my opinion as the the amount of interaction with the surroundings was incredible for all the CGI creations and helped me suspend disbelief for the entire film.I had no problem with the Rock's limited screentime because it was all the film needed, it's worth noting that Anuck-sa-na-mun had very little overall screentime in the first film but has still developed into an extremely interesting character.Other elements that worked extremely well included the use of Jokes with direct reference to the first film and the great new score by Alan Sivestri which would rate as one of his best.I would give the film a 10 for delivering the fun film I wanted to see without disappointment (a rare event indeed).The short story is, go and see this film.

I have seen the usual few Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Night of the living Dead, all the Evil Dead Trilogy etc but these films tend to be pretty popular or familar with most people anyway its only when you delve a little bit deeper that you find some other spectacular work of art. I watched Zombie Flesh Eaters about a year ago and since then i have been interested to see more of Lucio Fulci's work and other italian directors famous for horror.

One other thing to note is the great musical score produced for this film, some people say its just annoying but my god it does the job.....everything about this film is eerie and weird from the outset you have a feeling of something very bad about to happen and the weird sense of evil present not only in the Hotel but the entire town.

Because I allowed myself to sit back and take the daring mental stand to enjoy it&#133;for what it is. It ain't high art, folks. Don't condemn it for not being something it isn't. It never presumes to be, yet reading through the undeservedly scathing reviews I'm reading online, so many are disappointed that it has not reinvented filmmaking. It is a big, blowsy, overblown summer action flick. Is it perfect, the best movie I've ever seen? No, by no means. Did I get my $8 out of it? Absolutely. Is there too much reliance on CGI? You betcha. Should we, the audience, DEMAND substance to go with our high-tech advances? Absolutely. All the bells and whistles are no substitute for a great script. The Mummy Returns was an amusing summer confection, something you enjoy and then you move on to more substantial fare. I certainly cannot deny that this could have been a great movie had they paid equal attention to story that they did to CGI...The fact that the studio powers-that-be see fit to bestow a star-vehicle on Johnson for the next is a sad testament to the power of the studios to mindlessly whore themselves to the celebrity-du-jour. It sickens me the amount of press our pal the Rock has received for his 8.2 second, pecs-a-ripplin' appearance. Sure, the man is charismatic, he looks buff and manly in a leopard loincloth, but blink and you miss him.  And frankly, the minions of Anubis were more realistic CGI characters than our bad guy in the end. Please. A giant badly animated demonic lobster. Ooooh,  SCARY! From what I've read, Johnson is an intelligent, savvy, hard-working, well-spoken man. I've no real complaint with him as a person, a celebrity or even, as an emerging action star. For what it is worth, I enjoyed his brief (non-CGI) contribution to the film. But give credit where credit is due.My biggest gripe has more to do with marketing that with the film itself Brendan Fraser has been robbed.This is unquestionably, HIS movie, and yet, he is forced to share his well-earned spotlight with a bit player. Fraser is a gifted, talented and charismatic working actor whose contributions to his projects are consistently rich. He and the other members of the cast deserve a great deal of credit for bringing us such a fun summer diversion. His ability to graciously accept second banana status to the Rock speaks volumes of his character.So, I suppose that what this all boils down to is this ramp down your cynicism, and go see this movie. See it for what it is, and you'll probably enjoy the ride. I did.

I certainly cannot deny that this could have been a great movie had they paid equal attention to story that they did to CGI...The fact that the studio powers-that-be see fit to bestow a star-vehicle on Johnson for the next is a sad testament to the power of the studios to mindlessly whore themselves to the celebrity-du-jour. It sickens me the amount of press our pal the Rock has received for his 8.2 second, pecs-a-ripplin' appearance. Sure, the man is charismatic, he looks buff and manly in a leopard loincloth, but blink and you miss him.  And frankly, the minions of Anubis were more realistic CGI characters than our bad guy in the end. Please. A giant badly animated demonic lobster. Ooooh,  SCARY! From what I've read, Johnson is an intelligent, savvy, hard-working, well-spoken man. I've no real complaint with him as a person, a celebrity or even, as an emerging action star. For what it is worth, I enjoyed his brief (non-CGI) contribution to the film. But give credit where credit is due.My biggest gripe has more to do with marketing that with the film itself Brendan Fraser has been robbed.This is unquestionably, HIS movie, and yet, he is forced to share his well-earned spotlight with a bit player. Fraser is a gifted, talented and charismatic working actor whose contributions to his projects are consistently rich. He and the other members of the cast deserve a great deal of credit for bringing us such a fun summer diversion. His ability to graciously accept second banana status to the Rock speaks volumes of his character.So, I suppose that what this all boils down to is this ramp down your cynicism, and go see this movie.

I laughed. I was amused by the bright, shiny, golden images of an idealized ancient Egypt. I marveled at the speed and ballet-like precision of the battles between our yin\/yang princesses. Vosloo is a kick. Oden is an honor-driven delight to watch. (Sure, the annoying parasite brother really should be fed to scarabs, but we can always hold out hope for the inevitable sequel, yes?) Weiss has crafted a character that is actually interesting (something which eluded her in the Mummy.) Fraser is a joy to watch (I still can't decide which is my favorite Fraser performance Gods and Monsters or George of the Jungle&#133;hmmm.)I enjoyed the over-the-top camp style, and yes, I found many of the CGI effects to be amusing&#133;which does not mean that I did not find many of the CGI effects gratuitous, overblown and unbelievable.

Coffy isn't really that bad of a movie if you can look past the same old revenge plot and the fact that, while she's not bustin' some hoodlum ass, Coffy is some sort of nurse in her spare time. This woman is like the black female version of Rambo, but the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough for this to be a problem.Coffy is a tough black woman who decides to take matters into her own hands when the law proves powerless to help catch the drug dealers who turned her little sister into a drugged out vegetable. To make matter's worse, a friend of Coffy's named Carter, a police officer, gets beaten (in a pathetic fight scene) and suffers brain damage, further enraging Coffy. The whole movie is about drugs and violence, and Coffy pretends to be Mr. George's newest ho so that she can get close to her enemies and bring them down from the inside. Mr. George, by the way, is a hilariously stereotypical 70s pimp, with his felt hat, ridiculous glasses, and matching pastel outfit that is so tight that he sports a cameltoe.While at a party with Mr. George, Coffy contaminates his drug supply, replacing his cocaine stash with sugar. This is the party where that classic cat-fight scene takes place, with Coffy getting into a side-splitting scuffle with all the rest of Mr. George's harem, and having committed the laughable idea of booby-trapping her hair with razor blades. Okay, now we're really getting to know how much this movie takes itself seriously. And I won't even mention the monstrous lesbian girlfriend of Priscilla, the character that was introduced just before the most idiotic fight scene in the entire film. And then there was the car chase near the end of the film in which the cop drives like a Duke of Hazzard for no apparent reason.While the movie is filled with crap like this and is therefore a definitive B-movie, there were some relatively interesting things going on. For example, it was actually pretty clever the way that Coffy was able to turn the drug dealers against each other so that she didn't have to do all of the killing herself. Also, while all of the fight scenes were awful, some of the violence was surprisingly, and often disturbingly, convincing. When George is dragged to death behind the car, for example, it was obviously a dummy being dragged but the fact that hate-crimes like this have been so notoriously committed against blacks, the emotional impact made it much more effective. Maybe that's what blaxploitation is referring to.The standard revenge plot is not given much of a twist in Coffy, and the closing scene with her walking alone on a beach at sunset doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. There is some pretty funny dialogue, though. White Zombie fans are sure to recognize her quote early in the film just before she un-heads some drug dealer with a shotgun (`This is the end of your rotten life you mother-F*CKIN'-dope pusher!'). BLAM!! Yeah Coffy! And then at the end, some guy begs for his life while in a swimming pool while Coffy points a shotgun at him, and she says, `Sheeeit, I ain't gonna kill you.' BLAM!! Yeah Coffy!It's no secret that this is not Oscar material. It's a cheesy action film with bad acting and a recycled story, but if you keep that in mind when you watch it, it's actually enjoyable, at least on a few meager levels. Maxim magazine lists Coffy as number 7 on its list of the 50 best B-movies of all time, and there can clearly be no mistake about its status as a B-movie.

I hope that True Lies 2(2002) is going to be even funnier & better than the original. You have to learn from history that you can trust James Cameron.  He is one of my greatest inspirations. I have seen all his movies several times (not the first one Pirhana II from 1981). I could not find it on IMDB witch is bizarre.  Here is the magical career of James Cameron in short sensational hit low budget movie of 1984 The Terminator. The dynamic & adrenalin kick movie of 1986 Aliens. The very special one of 1989 & the godfather of CGI movies The Abyss. The unbelievable eye candy of 1991 & another CGI godfather Terminator 2. The gigantic action-comedy of 1994 True Lies.And the most brilliant epic magic movie making of all time who was the unsinkable movie of 1997-1998 in Cinemas Titanic. What a career!! T 2 is the reason that Steven Spielberg left go-motion for CGI in Jurassic Park (1993). T 2 is also the reason that George Lucas decided to do Episode I (1999) because now the technology was right for his vision. Forget Terminator 3 without James Cameron. T 2 IS the one you should remember. Four time Oscar winning Terminator 2 IS simply THE greatest, smartest, coolest & most brilliant action movie in the universe!!!! (10\/10).

It was a fun, funny, and cool movie.  Anyone who didn't like 1999's The Mummy is not human.  Now we have the sequel.  It is entertaining, but no where near as good as the original.Seeing this movie made me appreciate the first movie.  The first Mummy was an adventure movie, through and through.  In the tradition of Indiana Jones, the movie took us to another world, made us laugh, built suspense, and was really cool.  The sequel is nothing like this.  In the first movie, we don't see the mummy Ie-Moh-Tep until almost an hour into the movie.  It used the Jaws technique of not showing the monster until the audience becomes annoyed at its absense.  The Mummy Returns goes ahead and shows us the Mummy in its first 30 minutes.  Is this bad?  Not really.  Its just different.Next, the major difference between the two movies is the pace.  The Mummy was relaxed, not moving slow, but not overdoing itself.  It kept running at a brisk pace.  Now The Mummy Returns is fast.  Very fast.  Jet speed fast. The movie does not waist time in character development (because they did that in the first movie and if you're seeing this movie you've seen the original).  The Mummy 2 runs from one action scene to another.  I found that after the first hour I was getting real tired of it.

The Mummy Returns has some of the poorest excuses for CGI special effects I have ever seen.  Okay, maybe not.  But this is ILM folks. The people who invented modern day movie special effects starting with the fisrt Star Wars movies and moving on to Terminator 2, to Jurassic Park, and the upcoming Pearl Harbor.  These guys are the best in the business.  So why are the effects so bad?  Because ILM's schedule is packed, and something had to be cut.  Think about it.  ILM is doing Jurassic Park 3, Pearl Harbor, A.I., Star Wars Episode II, Planet of the Apes, The Mummy Returns, and other movies all at the same time.  Some movie had to get shafted.  Well, this is it.  Some of the effects in this movie are great.  Any effect involving a face in some thing like a wall of water of smoke (like the wall of sand in the original) is great.  The ending battle scene is done good.  Some other scenes are great.  But there are plenty of other BAD special effects shots to make up for it.  Overall the movie just looks fake and this impacts the overall effect the film has.  Movies like this need to be fun and somewhat believable.  If the effects suck, well, so does the movie.I have one last major gripe.  I can beleive that people can be brought back from the dead.  Yea, I can.  It's part of the movie.  It's the whole point of the movie.  If you can't suspend that belief than just stop reading this and go rent Gone With the Wind.  But I cannot suspend the belief that a hot air balloon has after-burners.  There is this scene where the movie's main vehical, a hot air balloon, is being chased by the wall of water with Ie-moh-tep's face (a-la the Mummy 1).  Well, to escape, the pilot (if you can call a guy who flies a hot air balloon a pilot) hits a button and, vu-al-la, these rockets egnite and the ballon escapes in a burst of speed. The rockets are the main propulsion device on this balloon, that belief I can suspend for the sake of entertainment.  But AFTERBURNERS!?  HAHAHAH!

Then next year it'll be Hugh Grant in `Floppy Hair, Floppy D**k Donkey S**t' the next biggest UK grossing film&#133;Bridget Jones is in her thirties.  She's all on her own in much the same way William Thacker was in Notting Hill everyone's trying to get her a date. But instead of falling for an American movie megastar, she is faced with a yucky-looking Colin Firth.  But then, whilst working at her journalist job, she starts to fall for her boss, Hugh Grant.  I'd like to be able to tell you the name of their characters, but you see, I can't remember them.  I only remember Renee's character's name because it is eponymous.  So, who's she going to end up with?  Both of these men have their own quirks and vices of course, one of them is a sad mummy's boy and the other is a charismatic a**hole.  Such is the choice of everyday English men today. So, whilst hypothesising, drinking more wine, eating Tesco's Alpen cereal and generally making a right a**e out of herself (both with her friends and people she should be impressing) she dilly dallies around thinking she's made the right choice when, of course, she hasn't &#133; then she cries about it, makes a half-witty gesture, screws up some more and cries a bit more (usually in that order) until finally she ends up with someone some ninety minutes later.But being fair Bridget Jones's Diary does have its merits.  It's reasonably funny in places and the acting is generally very good.  The direction by the practically unheard of MacGuire (a woman directing a box office smash? First for the record books!) is good, but a little flaccid in places.  The film starts off with text on the screen describing how much Bridget weighs, smokes and drinks - something which I hope would have continued.  There's also a nice `f******k' subtitle in one scene when she discovers she may have `f**ked up'.  I thought those were nice touches.  However, those touches and the direction of the film gets sloppy about half way through.  Like its namesake, you can practically read the story of Bridget like a diary girls like this have to end up with the right guy and be happy, otherwise nothing is achieved.So, on to Renee herself.  She makes an adequate English woman her accent is fine and if you didn't know she was American then, A you'd be fooled and, B no-one in America would have bothered seeing this.  Renee, in terms of superstardom, doesn't &#150; and probably won't ever have &#150; the bums-on-seats-guarantee of Julia Roberts or Andie MacDowell.  Why?  Because she's not got the drop dead gorgeous look to her, unfortunately.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing, really I think Renee was an inspired choice bearing in mind that an American had to have played her a B list star is usually better than an A list in terms of quality.  But why oh why couldn't we get an English woman playing Bridget?  Keeping to the true text of the book, I would have rather Sally Phillips played Bridget Jones we already know she's a terrific comedienne and actress (I'm Alan Partridge, Smack The Pony) and I firmly believe that Zelwegger and Phillips would've been better off swapping roles.  Just a thought.Luckily, to stop the English public from running out of the cinema, the film is BLITZED with cameos an stretched-cameos (not quite constituting bit parts) from literally dozens of well known British actors and comedians. We've got Salman Rushdie as a book enthusiast, Jeffrey Archer makes an appearance as a crowd member, Lynne from `I'm Alan Partidge' plays Bridget's co-worker, Sally Phillips pops her head in now and then, David Cann from `Jam' pops up as a cameraman, `Drop the Dead Donkey's Robert Duncan shows his face as a TV director and Jim Broadbent plays Bridget's father &#150; to name a few.  Even Honor Blackman is in it for about 3 seconds.  It's a shame really because for the most part all of the above are grossly underused and are giving very little to play with.  With the possible exception of Rushdie and Archer, I would've liked to have seen these fine British actors in the film more.As it is, Bridget Jones's Diary is a big sloppy, mush-riddled mess.  None of the characters have any space to develop.  But the excruciatingly fatal mistake in the film is totally exposed none of us give a flying monkey about Bridget.  Sure, she's had it tough, she's a bit ditzy and likes to think everything will work out.  Well, sorry to be a party pooper &#150; but EVERYONE is like that.  So, essentially, is Bridget Jones' a chick flick? Yes.  None of the men who watch this, like her co-boss, will want to know her unless she gets satisfies her `Fitzherberts' and gets those jubblies out.  As such, Renee is decked out in very, very risque costume for most of the time anyway at one point she wears a bunny outfit and, lastly, the final scene just has her in knickers.  Splendid.  Bridget Jones is like a porn film with two alterations the actors are great and there's no sex. And I'm afraid women will just find this Jones exercise a waste of time &#150; especially when you arrive at the last five minutes.Now I'm hearing that they're planning a sequel?  Trust me, one is plenty. The only way you'd get away with a sequel was if you named it `Bridget Jones Gets Killed in the Temple of Doom'.4\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2001","score":"","review":"  It's funny the way these British Richard Curtis comedies come out dead in the shower of Late April, every other year.

Renee, in terms of superstardom, doesn't &#150; and probably won't ever have &#150; the bums-on-seats-guarantee of Julia Roberts or Andie MacDowell.  Why?  Because she's not got the drop dead gorgeous look to her, unfortunately.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing, really I think Renee was an inspired choice bearing in mind that an American had to have played her a B list star is usually better than an A list in terms of quality.  But why oh why couldn't we get an English woman playing Bridget?  Keeping to the true text of the book, I would have rather Sally Phillips played Bridget Jones we already know she's a terrific comedienne and actress (I'm Alan Partridge, Smack The Pony) and I firmly believe that Zelwegger and Phillips would've been better off swapping roles.  Just a thought.Luckily, to stop the English public from running out of the cinema, the film is BLITZED with cameos an stretched-cameos (not quite constituting bit parts) from literally dozens of well known British actors and comedians. We've got Salman Rushdie as a book enthusiast, Jeffrey Archer makes an appearance as a crowd member, Lynne from `I'm Alan Partidge' plays Bridget's co-worker, Sally Phillips pops her head in now and then, David Cann from `Jam' pops up as a cameraman, `Drop the Dead Donkey's Robert Duncan shows his face as a TV director and Jim Broadbent plays Bridget's father &#150; to name a few.  Even Honor Blackman is in it for about 3 seconds.  It's a shame really because for the most part all of the above are grossly underused and are giving very little to play with.  With the possible exception of Rushdie and Archer, I would've liked to have seen these fine British actors in the film more.As it is, Bridget Jones's Diary is a big sloppy, mush-riddled mess.  None of the characters have any space to develop.  But the excruciatingly fatal mistake in the film is totally exposed none of us give a flying monkey about Bridget.  Sure, she's had it tough, she's a bit ditzy and likes to think everything will work out.  Well, sorry to be a party pooper &#150; but EVERYONE is like that.  So, essentially, is Bridget Jones' a chick flick? Yes.  None of the men who watch this, like her co-boss, will want to know her unless she gets satisfies her `Fitzherberts' and gets those jubblies out.  As such, Renee is decked out in very, very risque costume for most of the time anyway at one point she wears a bunny outfit and, lastly, the final scene just has her in knickers.  Splendid.  Bridget Jones is like a porn film with two alterations the actors are great and there's no sex. And I'm afraid women will just find this Jones exercise a waste of time &#150; especially when you arrive at the last five minutes.Now I'm hearing that they're planning a sequel?  Trust me, one is plenty.

First it was Four Weddings (the biggest grossing British film in the, then it was Notting Hill (the next biggest UK grosse)r, and now it's Bridget Jones's Diary&#133; the next biggest grossing film in the UK.  Then next year it'll be Hugh Grant in `Floppy Hair, Floppy D**k Donkey S**t' the next biggest UK grossing film&#133;Bridget Jones is in her thirties.  She's all on her own in much the same way William Thacker was in Notting Hill everyone's trying to get her a date. But instead of falling for an American movie megastar, she is faced with a yucky-looking Colin Firth.  But then, whilst working at her journalist job, she starts to fall for her boss, Hugh Grant.  I'd like to be able to tell you the name of their characters, but you see, I can't remember them.  I only remember Renee's character's name because it is eponymous.  So, who's she going to end up with?  Both of these men have their own quirks and vices of course, one of them is a sad mummy's boy and the other is a charismatic a**hole.  Such is the choice of everyday English men today. So, whilst hypothesising, drinking more wine, eating Tesco's Alpen cereal and generally making a right a**e out of herself (both with her friends and people she should be impressing) she dilly dallies around thinking she's made the right choice when, of course, she hasn't &#133; then she cries about it, makes a half-witty gesture, screws up some more and cries a bit more (usually in that order) until finally she ends up with someone some ninety minutes later.But being fair Bridget Jones's Diary does have its merits.  It's reasonably funny in places and the acting is generally very good.  The direction by the practically unheard of MacGuire (a woman directing a box office smash? First for the record books!) is good, but a little flaccid in places.  The film starts off with text on the screen describing how much Bridget weighs, smokes and drinks - something which I hope would have continued.  There's also a nice `f******k' subtitle in one scene when she discovers she may have `f**ked up'.  I thought those were nice touches.  However, those touches and the direction of the film gets sloppy about half way through.  Like its namesake, you can practically read the story of Bridget like a diary girls like this have to end up with the right guy and be happy, otherwise nothing is achieved.So, on to Renee herself.

Everyone is right when they say that this movie is totally whacked! It is!!! But not in a bad way. For those of you who like to clamp down on movies as not being as good as this other movie, or the characters were not real, all I got to say is you are missing out on a lot of good fun.From the opening scene, shoot...even before that in the credits, you know that this movie is NOT going to follow the norm.  Music has been used to ADD to movies for years and not all of it has initially been met with praise. Ladyhawke, a love story about medieval lovers cursed with him being a wolf during the night and her being a hawk during the night...a wildly strange movie. The soundtrack was written and conducted by Andrew Powell but the production by Alan Parsons (The Alan Parson's Project) was a decidedly determining factor...it was a rock and roll soundtrack, ladies and Gents!! And it was, is and will always be a wonderfully wonderful movie. Streets of fire...another weird, strange and oddly addictive movie, was run through with some avant-garde music tracks and a sutle, hole laden plot and storyline but it is still one of the top cult hits out there for all to see.Now...here comes A Knight's Tale...and the music is from the 20th and 21st centuries, the movie takes an irreverent look at...well...everything and, to tell you the truth, it is done in a fun way.  If you plan to see it, take off your thinking caps and put on your party hats. Put a smile in your heart...and your mind...and just sit back and enjoy this rowsing tale of love, humor, action and fun that will join the ranks of such movies as Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Animal House, Bachelor Party, Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai, Iron Eagle, and many more movies that cannot even get in the backdoor at the academy awards, but will always be on the rental charts cause they are just darn good entertainment!!! Nuff Said!!

Everyone is right when they say that this movie is totally whacked! It is!!! But not in a bad way. For those of you who like to clamp down on movies as not being as good as this other movie, or the characters were not real, all I got to say is you are missing out on a lot of good fun.From the opening scene, shoot...even before that in the credits, you know that this movie is NOT going to follow the norm.  Music has been used to ADD to movies for years and not all of it has initially been met with praise. Ladyhawke, a love story about medieval lovers cursed with him being a wolf during the night and her being a hawk during the night...a wildly strange movie. The soundtrack was written and conducted by Andrew Powell but the production by Alan Parsons (The Alan Parson's Project) was a decidedly determining factor...it was a rock and roll soundtrack, ladies and Gents!! And it was, is and will always be a wonderfully wonderful movie.

The shot where the dock turns around is one of the only times I actually find myself biting my nails.  This film contains some of the best ideas ever concieved.  I saw it first when I was seven and I have never gone out more than five feet into the ocean.  It's suspense is masterful and the only thing that has enough class to come close to it is the shower scene of Psycho.  One of my favorites and the true American summer classic.
