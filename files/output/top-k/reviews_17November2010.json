As Jane Fonda crawls out of bed, we sense her hangover, one of those inordinately miserable mornings when nothing about you is sufficiently functional, and we also sense how accustomed she's become to these mornings as she is not only passably functional but also recognizes herself in the mirror and indeed spills some gin into a glass, speculating about the guy in her bed. Who is he? She doesn't comprehend the true gravity of her predicament until she turns him onto his back.She sees no cop is going to buy her story, so she attempts to remove all the evidence of her stopover. And then she rambles back out, into the intense Los Angeles light. And in a shot from high overhead, she seems like a lab rat, ensnared in some sort of a experiment. It's so well directed that we almost forget how preposterous it is to think this frame-up would ever work.This beginning promises an exceptional thriller. Alas, The Morning After never matches its initial potential, not as a thriller, at least. The narrative has some gaping disparities in it, and thrillers need to be impermeable. This one chalks various elements up to pure coincidence, the ultimate motives are flimsy at best and the fact that the body keeps reappearing like a cartoon or a take-off on The Trouble with Harry brings the movie too close to qualifying as '80s schlock for one to become seriously absorbed in the plot. But The Morning After merits a look anyhow, owing to the characters that it cultivates, and the performances of Fonda and Jeff Bridges in the two leads.She plays an alcoholic actress long past her heyday. He plays an ex-cop who happens to be fixing his car right where she topples into his back seat and implores him to get her away from there, quick. Bridges stays in a petty, manufactured shed, where he repairs appliances. This is all Fonda needs. She's a veteran of the live-fast-die-young subscription, her friends all bartenders and drag queens, her separated husband Raul Julia the most upmarket hairdresser in Beverly Hills. Nevertheless Bridges is reliable and sound, and she could do with a friend. Naturally it's axiomatic that they fall in love.The plot of The Morning After is not nearly as well captured or interesting as the day-by-day grinds of these characters. Actually, I can picture a movie that would omit the murder and just trail the genuine human development between Fonda and Bridges. The thriller filler isn't needed, although given that they used it, couldn't they have made it credible? The entire murder plot gets such slapdash treatment that perhaps I oughtn't have been startled by the big scene in which the killer's exposed. I've seen innumerable revelations in innumerable thrillers, but seldom one as transparent as this one, where the surprises are just announced in an improbable monologue. Indeed, the fact that nearly every opinion I've heard or read of this film seems unanimous in terms of James Hicks' script, including mine, even down to the 'It starts off well but then it gets really forced and jerry-built' gist, it seems pretty clear-cut what makes the film not quite work, though it'd be a misstep to write this movie off simply because the story is so rickety. It's worth making an allowance for due to the performances.Fonda and Bridges are superb in the film, and their rapport, founded on skeletons in the cupboard, bitterness and ulterior motives, gets especially remarkable. They create tangible unspoken feelings together, and they have some dialogue that feels more alive than most starry-eyed chatter in the movies. Before the schmaltzy final scene, not even close to prototypical of Lumet, there's a single shot in which all Bridges and Fonda do is face each other, and we know, and fee, that they want to have sex with each other. It's just energy, and it works wonders.I also admire how Lumet reinforces every color. Living in Los Angeles is part of the debilitating influence on the character played by Jane Fonda. All color is exaggerated red redder, blue filters, orange hazes. He creates an L.A. comprised of vast flat surfaces of pastels and aggressively sunlit exposed areas. He traps the inebriated Fonda on this landscape like a helplessly insignificant insect sought for squashing by unknown feet, and the imagery makes the whole first hour of the movie much more ominous than it merits. Too bad they couldn't have take steps with the script.

It stands as one of his most mysterious and creatively superb films full of suspense, tension, and a few laughs provided by the strong cast. The amazingly talented and legendary James Stewart plays L.B. Jeffries, a photographer who is stuck at home in a wheelchair and full leg cast. Bored to death, Jeffries passes the time by looking at his neighbors across the street in their windows. What begins as kind of a creepy and odd hobby, eventually becomes obsession when Jeffries believes he may have witnessed a murder. He is convinced that one of the men across the way named Lars Thorwald has murdered his wife and is now trying to cover it up. Jeffries tries desperately to prove Thorwald guilty, while no one else around him will believe what he tells them. It makes for a very riveting film full to the brim with mystery and intrigue.Rear Window is a combination of so many great elements. One of those elements is obviously the director himself, Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was a master of groundbreaking creativity in visual storytelling, and he utilized all kinds of new techniques in his films, Rear Window included. The entire movie takes place in Jeffries' apartment and the camera respects this aspect. Every shot towards the multiple people Jeffries spies on is set up at the appropriate distance that Jeffries actually is. Thus our view and audio is as limited as the actual character in the movie. In fact, every bit of audio in the film is in context. One of the people in Jeffries' neighborhood is an aspiring musician, thus all the music in the film comes from this man's apartment, and yet it is still very fitting music, as well as prevalent in most scenes where it is appropriate. Hitchcock also displays his innovative storytelling ability by telling multiple stories around the neighborhood, all of which adhere to Jeffries' view from his window. We have the story of the musician obviously, as well as a young married couple, and a lonely girl who is slowly becoming depressed when she can find nobody to love. Her story even intertwines with another towards the end of the film, allowing this neighborhood to be many individual stories, while also a collaboration of one. The main focus is obviously on the murder suspect directly across from Jeffries. And rightfully so.Another thing which drives the excellence of Rear Window is a limited, yet fantastic cast. James Stewart is just unbelievably talented and never drops below a level of complete brilliance in this film. He combines a perfect element of drama and suspense with his own comedic flare which is both sarcastic and at times sardonic. Alongside him is his lover, Lisa Fremont, who is played by the beautiful Grace Kelly. She plays off of Stewart incredibly well and the two of them become an very believable set of characters. The movie focuses on their relationship and its past, and yet it never forgets what it is truly about, which is the murder mystery. Everything in the movie works very well with each other, and never becomes too much about one thing.And if just being a fascinating and highly entertaining movie wasn't enough, Rear Window even raises some ethical questions concerning what Jeffries is doing as he spies on his fellow neighbors. The characters undergo a constant internal struggle of whether or not it is truly worth it to prove their suspects innocence or guilt. This is still a very relevant ethical debate in a society where we value our privacy more than anything in the entire world it seems. Rear Window keeps you thinking about things like this through its entirety, yet it never forgets that it is a movie where suspense and mystery are the central focus, and so it remains high value entertainment the whole way through. It's hard to find a balance between preachy and entertaining, yet Rear Window does a very good job at it.Alfred Hitchcock never ceases to amaze, and in his long list of films it's hard to find one that won't keep you at least mildly interested. Rear Window goes above and beyond mildly interesting and succeeds in becoming a fantastic mystery film with all of its own unique merits. Unfortunately, the ending is a bit abrupt and you can't help but wish for more, but everything else about the movie is so fantastic. This is a must see film.

But I won't review it as a film in it's own right, there's no point in that.Although the director made every attempt to recreate the shots, music, sound effects etc. exactly as they were in the original, he still managed to ruin the film. There are several reasons for this. One of the main reasons is the cast. My god, I don't think I've seen a worse cast in my life. None of the actors play the characters as they are supposed to be played Vince Vaughn plays Normans Bates as a psychopath, rather than a character the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for, and the scenes where he wears a wig are just laughable; Anne Hech makes the audience WANT her to die; and William H. Macy doesn't play the suspicious detective that Arbogast is supposed to be.Pouring salt into the wound, Van Sant even decides to ruin the camera work. You don't alter what is effectively perfect, and although he put in some shots that Hitchcock would have loved to have had, he adds some shots that just leave the audience wondering what the hell is going on, such as the images flashing in the death scenes.Hitchcock was very particular when it came to lighting and Mise-en-scène, and Van Sant may have had a DVD player with him to study Psycho, but he obviously didn't do a good enough job. One of the most notable examples of this is in Norman's parlour, where the lighting and prop placement is horrible, and you also see Vince Vaughn at his worst.Basically, do not watch this film. The only reason I've seen it was to compare it to the original for a Media Studies class. Now, you might say I'm defending Hitchcock because I'm a Media Studies student, but I could have been studying film for 10 years, or Psycho could have been the first film I'd ever seen, and I would still agree that it is a masterpiece. If you want to see Psycho, please watch the original, and don't listen to the reviews that say It's a great experiment or Gus Van Sant had the guts to do this, therefore it's amazing. It is not an experiment, it was supposed to be a copy of Psycho with added shots and dialogue that Hitchcock would have wanted, but it was absolutely terrible. If you want to respect anyone for having guts, respect Hitchcock. He was crossing the line of what was allowed on films, and it's unlikely that modern cinema would be as it is if it wasn't for Psycho.

You don't alter what is effectively perfect, and although he put in some shots that Hitchcock would have loved to have had, he adds some shots that just leave the audience wondering what the hell is going on, such as the images flashing in the death scenes.Hitchcock was very particular when it came to lighting and Mise-en-scène, and Van Sant may have had a DVD player with him to study Psycho, but he obviously didn't do a good enough job. One of the most notable examples of this is in Norman's parlour, where the lighting and prop placement is horrible, and you also see Vince Vaughn at his worst.Basically, do not watch this film. The only reason I've seen it was to compare it to the original for a Media Studies class. Now, you might say I'm defending Hitchcock because I'm a Media Studies student, but I could have been studying film for 10 years, or Psycho could have been the first film I'd ever seen, and I would still agree that it is a masterpiece. If you want to see Psycho, please watch the original, and don't listen to the reviews that say It's a great experiment or Gus Van Sant had the guts to do this, therefore it's amazing. It is not an experiment, it was supposed to be a copy of Psycho with added shots and dialogue that Hitchcock would have wanted, but it was absolutely terrible. If you want to respect anyone for having guts, respect Hitchcock. He was crossing the line of what was allowed on films, and it's unlikely that modern cinema would be as it is if it wasn't for Psycho.

Thankfully this film follows the more enjoyable Viet Kong War, where Robert Mitchum, Christopher Biggins, Fredo, and Diane Keaton find their small town lives disrupted by invading bad guys. They like to spend their weekends hunting harmless animals and drinking Bud but this peace is disturbed when the tables are ironically turned and they become the hunted. They hide in the jungle for a while and meet a young group of teens called the Wolverines who are also hiding out. This young group includes various Shat Pack members- Rob Lowe, Michael J Keaton, Emilio Eckhart, Patrick Swayze, and Baby. The kids have hunting rifles too and decide to wage war on the Vietnamese who have enslaved their village, but they need a distraction. De Matteo, Biggins, and co etc decide to flee and force the bad guys to follow them, giving the Wolfers enough time and freedom to free the city! Unfortunately Robbie, Chrissie, and Fredoie, are captured and pitted off against each other in a terrifying game of life and poker. 2 prisoners are picked at a time and given a deck of cards- each takes a card and whoever has the lower card gets shot with a knife while the bad guys, laugh, bet, and have a generally knee-slapping time. Our heroes have been watching this, understandably horrified, waiting for their turn. Bob De Bobbo and Baggins are pulled out for their turn, but luckily Bob gets his hands on a flame thrower and toasts the bad guys- toasts them good and quips 'You talking to me? Not anymore!' They get back to town to find that the Wolfies have chased the bad guys away and all is well, although there have been casualties- Swayze's mullet got trapped in a harvester he was driving and he was torn into confetti. Usefully though they used this confetti for the celebratory parade so it wasn't for nothing. Just when you think the film is ending though it takes a sinister turn; it turns out that Baggins has become addicted to the deadly card game which he names Park The Fleece, Master Flip, and has been running underground tournaments. When someone challenges him to a game (he has only been watching before this) he gladly accepts to prove he ain't chicken. Frodo and Nero hear about this and race to the rescue but only make it in time to see the knife penetrate their friend's brain, and watch him fall to the floor, deading. It seems the Deer have claimed their final victim.Best Scene When the friends are being airlifted out of the forest by Mountain Rescue, De Nee decides to tickle Fredo with a feather and he falls to the ground, losing his legs. De Lite feels guilty about this for the rest of the film, but to rub it in he shags Fredo's wife.

It's that this dog, really named Max, is not just a prop; he's a bona fide character. Few movies have taken it upon themselves to really give the dog something interesting to do, but this dog not only emotes to tear jerking effect but also performs exciting unexpected feats, following the bad guys' car, intercepting the mask from the bad guys, all done to please an audience of children, of course, but nonetheless done exceedingly well to that end.The opening shots of The Mask give the impression they were recovered from a distraughtly shoestring 1950s sci-fi movie. Marine salvage operations bring about the breakage of an antiquated trunk that's lay for lifetimes on the bottom of the cove, and a peculiar wooden mask drifts to the surface. Shortly thereafter, unhappy bank teller Stanley Ipkiss, an amiable geek played by Jim Carrey, is gazing into the murky waters after a frenzied night of embarrassments. When he glimpses the mask drifting with some debris, he for some inexplicable reason thinks it's a man in trouble and jumps in to save him. All he retrieves is the mask.Metamorphoses are naturally the heart of comic literature. Billy Batson yells Shazam, Clark Kent scurries into a phone booth, Bruce Wayne slides down the pole, and invariably an inconsequential pushover befits a comic-strip hero. No wonder pubescent kids react to these stories so fiercely. Think about what happens to Stanley when he dons the mask. He's instantly changed into a delirious cyclone of aggravated liveliness, clad in a banana-yellow zoot suit, a intersection congealing the Joker, Aladdin's genie, and rudiments of The Shadow.One of the crucial design choices must've entailed the Mask character's makeup. It renovates Carrey's facial appearance into a much bigger, comic-bookish caricature, while all at once the facade is still able to authentically move. The effect is a movie character who appears half genuine, half comic strip. And director Chuck Russell is up to utilizing special effects to shift easily between what might be possible and what is unquestionably not, as the Mask spins like a fast-tempo jazz hydrometer and gleefully triumphs in circumstances that would've overwhelmed poor Stanley.The plot starts with luckless Stanley utterly smitten with statuesque client Tina Carlyle, Cameron Diaz's debut. She trifles with him in the bank while taking clandestine videotape of the vault for her boss, the violent Dorian Tyrel (a quite well cast Peter Greene), who manages the Coco Bongo Club, where, sure enough, Tina's the catlike diva. The plot otherwise features Richard Jeni as Charlie, Stanley's sounding board, who familiarizes him with the charades of the Coco Bongo Club; Peter Riegert as a cop who notes the Mask's tie lookss to be of the same cloth as Stanley's unbelievable pajamas; and Milo, Stanley's dog, who's no less than as cunning as his master.It's also this manic energy and 1990's madcap patchwork that holds together a narrative that is every trace as imitative and baseless as it can be. The art design on the movie goes for the loudest possible 1940s film noir aspects of plenty of superhero comics, and the Coco Bongo Club seems reprocessed from Criss Cross or Out of the Past. Stanley's apartment looks like an adolescent boy's bedroom; all that's lacking is a sign on the outside of the door saying No Girls Allowed!

All he retrieves is the mask.Metamorphoses are naturally the heart of comic literature. Billy Batson yells Shazam, Clark Kent scurries into a phone booth, Bruce Wayne slides down the pole, and invariably an inconsequential pushover befits a comic-strip hero. No wonder pubescent kids react to these stories so fiercely. Think about what happens to Stanley when he dons the mask. He's instantly changed into a delirious cyclone of aggravated liveliness, clad in a banana-yellow zoot suit, a intersection congealing the Joker, Aladdin's genie, and rudiments of The Shadow.One of the crucial design choices must've entailed the Mask character's makeup. It renovates Carrey's facial appearance into a much bigger, comic-bookish caricature, while all at once the facade is still able to authentically move. The effect is a movie character who appears half genuine, half comic strip. And director Chuck Russell is up to utilizing special effects to shift easily between what might be possible and what is unquestionably not, as the Mask spins like a fast-tempo jazz hydrometer and gleefully triumphs in circumstances that would've overwhelmed poor Stanley.The plot starts with luckless Stanley utterly smitten with statuesque client Tina Carlyle, Cameron Diaz's debut. She trifles with him in the bank while taking clandestine videotape of the vault for her boss, the violent Dorian Tyrel (a quite well cast Peter Greene), who manages the Coco Bongo Club, where, sure enough, Tina's the catlike diva. The plot otherwise features Richard Jeni as Charlie, Stanley's sounding board, who familiarizes him with the charades of the Coco Bongo Club; Peter Riegert as a cop who notes the Mask's tie lookss to be of the same cloth as Stanley's unbelievable pajamas; and Milo, Stanley's dog, who's no less than as cunning as his master.It's also this manic energy and 1990's madcap patchwork that holds together a narrative that is every trace as imitative and baseless as it can be. The art design on the movie goes for the loudest possible 1940s film noir aspects of plenty of superhero comics, and the Coco Bongo Club seems reprocessed from Criss Cross or Out of the Past. Stanley's apartment looks like an adolescent boy's bedroom; all that's lacking is a sign on the outside of the door saying No Girls Allowed! The appearance of the film is as much entertainment as anything else. It's been alleged that one of the crucial traits of an actor is a capacity to share the delight he takes in his performance. You could say The Mask was anchored in that.

The film is beautifully photographed, but over-rated, overwrought and over-populated with extraneous characters that pad out the film's already questionable running time given its flimsy story. The film opens with a puzzling on screen typescript that ultimately becomes laughable as it has nothing whatsoever to do with the story and discusses a woman that never appears in the film or is really even discussed. Eastwood trots out his old stock character of the tired gunslinger prodded back into action by young whippersnapper Jaimz Woolvet to accept the commission set out by a group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey to avenge the disfigurement of one of their own by a local ruffian. Corrupt sheriff Gene Hackman is not too keen on the idea of cavalcades of gunslingers parading through town and naturally becomes an obstacle for Eastwood. Truthfully, this story has been done to death, and the only thing Eastwood really brings to the table is making his character aged and the entire tone of the film melancholy to the point of inducing sleep. None of the action scenes are especially suspenseful and there are so many characters that are just simply not needed. I enjoy Richard Harris, but his participation in this film is pointless. Morgan Freeman seems on hand only because Eastwood likes to stack the cast with older actors and because someone needs to die in order for him to go all man with no name on everyone. The women - who one would think should hold some sway over the film - are relatively interchangeable and given little screen time. Woolvett is little more than an irritant and is given short shrift. Eastwood looks and acts pale and decrepit. Only Hackman seems aware that he is in a film and there needs to be some energy or life to resuscitate the audience watching. The conclusion is predictable and most viewers will have little, if any, emotional stake in the outcome. A beautiful looking waxwork of a film, which copped Eastwood his first of two completely undeserved director Oscars. With all due respect McCabe and Mrs. Miller did this revisionist western thing much better more than a decade earlier and Eastwood's film merely comes across as a poor copy.

Movies of this ilk have to have a warm, sweet, sappy ending and tend to have a that'll never happen air about them - otherwise they wouldn't be holiday movies.That being said, this film takes a pretty good, and funny, route to getting to that predictable ending. Most Christmas movies deal with, and poke fun at, the nostalgia and expectations of the season - dinner with unbearable families, rotten kids (or bad ones who learn the meaning of the season), lights, and so on and so forth. This one takes aim at the overblown commercialism of the season with hilarious results. Schwarzenegger and Sinbad play off each other with exceptional comedic timing, and improvised one-liners by Sinbad (such as his cry of Rodney King! Rodney King! while being pummelled by toy store patrons) added to the humor all the more. Arnold plays his role as an overworked father trying to make up for lost time and keeping his promise of getting his son the hottest toy of the season - a Turbo-Man action figure - all the while competing against Sinbad for all it's worth.Jim Belushi as a black market-dealing Santa was a stroke of genius, and the warehouse scene (I AIN'T GOING BACK TO THE JOINT!) was inspired. Schmaltzy Phil Hartman was just that - his typical self absorbed, schmaltzy, self - and he portrayed a phony divorced dad playing on the sympathies of the neighborhood ladies with a feel of genuine fakeness that made you laugh every time he was on camera.Yes, the ending was unbelievable.

The Finzi-Continis are an aristocratic, wealthy, connected Jewish family in Italy in the 1930s-40s. Mussolini's Fascist party followed the lead of Germany's Hitler\/Nazis' anti-Semitism and purging of Jews, at first slowly following suit (denying Jews library use was among the earlier, then denying university graduation for Jews, then forbidding marriage between Jews and non-Jews, then denying any possibility of non-Jews working for Jews), etc., etc. They increasingly tightened their anti-Semitic noose.The social position of the Finzi-Continis and their walled garden seemed (at first) to keep these gathering restrictions at bay and inconsequential. E.g., when (early on) Jews were prohibited from using public tennis courts, young Jews flocked to the estate garden of the aristocratic Finzi-Continis, which had tennis courts. At first, they have little concern with the gradually tightening restrictions, the increasing anti-Semitism, and no sense there's a growing tsunami.But restrictions kept tightening much further.I saw the movie at a retired university faculty film series presenting great films. There were a number of hankies daubing eyes at the conclusion.I had problems keeping some of the film's 20-ish male characters distinct from each other (maybe those fluent in Italian wouldn't have that problem) as well as in some of the flashbacks to earlier times. Also the English subtitles sometimes quit the screen before I'd completely read them.BUT, all in all, this is a VERY important, consequential film that I've wanted to see for years.No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.

A perfect case in point was this violent, cynical fantasy about disenfranchised men getting even with an unsympathetic world by bonding together to beat the living pulp out of each other.It's called 'Fight Club', and Brad Pitt is the charismatic psychopath who kicks it (sometimes literally) into gear, enlisting insomniac everyman Ed Norton into a netherworld of black eyes and broken noses. Pitt only wants his otherwise mild-mannered new protégé to embrace his own dormant masculinity at its lowest and most honest level, and in a sense the eponymous club is presented like the ultimate touchy-feely support group, offering members the epiphany of uncomplicated pain as an antidote to the numbing monotony of modern life.But what begins as a strictly masochistic form of macho catharsis soon devolves into an underground skinhead cult promoting worldwide anarchy and destruction. And if, after reading that, you suspect this is where the plot gets derailed, give yourself a pat on the back and a blue ribbon for eagle-eyed film analysis.'Fight Club' is a disturbing movie, not least because it can, at times, be a lot of fun to watch, in an admittedly twisted sort of way. Viewers are invited to chuckle in sympathy at thoughtless acts of petty rebellion such as waiters urinating in the soup at pretentious uptown restaurants, or (my favorite) the 'homework' assignment asking club members to pick a fight at random with a total stranger, and lose &#x96; not an easy task, as it turns out. And let's face it who among us hasn't entertained daydreams of demolishing a tacky piece of corporate public art or destroying a generic coffee franchise (or, better yet, accomplishing both at the same time)? Boys will be boys, but a lot of that guilty juvenile pleasure gets pushed aside when the anti-establishment vandalism turns to wholesale sabotage and terrorism. It's too bad, because elsewhere the film presents a canny dissection of the American male psyche not an altogether pleasant topic, but certainly ripe for exactly this shade of black comic satire. Few other movies have dared to approach the same subject with such unblinking candor (the closest recent equivalent was probably Neil LaBute's 1997 feature 'In the Company of Men', a minor classic of y-chromosome misanthropy), and none with this degree of microscopic scrutiny.It even begins, pointedly, at a subatomic level, tracing the feverish sparking of nerve impulses across poor Ed Norton's sleep deprived synapses. From there the focus expands upwards and outwards, targeting all the usual suspects of our late 20th century social stalemate the credit card economy, the empty consumer culture, the slow brain-death of a television habit (of course), the empty paycheck at the end of another dull day's meaningless labor. This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time, says the desensitized Norton, a white collar wage slave unable to find any emotional release outside of other people's support networks terminal cancer patients, adult survivors of childhood incest, alcoholics anonymous, and so forth.Until the fateful moment when he first crosses the path of kindred spirit\/alter ego Tyler Durden, one of the more compelling anti-heroes (for better or worse) in recent screen memory, brought vividly to life in a typically extroverted performance by Brad Pitt. Durden is Norton's dark companion a post-modern messiah preaching a gospel of enlightened self-destruction. Forget redemption, he tells his disciples (although he doesn't actually use the word forget), we are God's unwanted children. That's a lot of philosophy to swallow in one sitting, but over most of its (considerable) length the film successfully negotiates a precarious narrative tightrope between brilliance and pretension. Unfortunately the chosen method of discourse in the adapted screenplay by Jim Uhls is non-stop voice-over narration, the laziest tool in the arsenal any hack (and a pet peeve, to be sure). Movies work best when used as a model of visual, not verbal, expression, showing (or better yet, merely suggesting) the meaning of things, instead of artlessly spelling out the intended lesson in exactly so many words.To be fair, director David Fincher does his best to open up the format and have some fun with it, for example asking Norton to address the camera directly (spoiling Pitt's aim while he's peeing in the lobster bisque), and employing a typically hyperactive visual scheme stocked with every up-to-the-minute gimmick imaginable, all set to an effective electro-shock soundtrack by a team calling themselves The Dust Brothers. The sets are likewise dressed to the acme of stylish decay (an apparent specialty of Fincher), and attentive viewers will even catch some ultra-cool subliminal foreshadowing strategic single frame inserts of Tyler Durden popping up at random, anticipating his first appearance by several scenes.But after setting up such a novel premise the script quickly runs out of first-person prose, having exhausted itself on hackneyed pearls of Occidental wisdom such as the things you own end up owning you, perfectly true, but hardly the most original observation. With nowhere else to go and nothing left to say, the story collapses quickly to a desperately over-plotted climax, losing the thread of its already subversive sexual aggression sub-text to foreground the 'Project Mayhem' conspiracy agenda, and finally introducing a ludicrous doppelganger dénouement too far-fetched for even an old Twilight Zone episode.Bottom line it's a provocative movie at odds with its own ambition, leaning hard on a necessary crutch on black (bordering on tasteless) humor. Ignoring all the stylistic window dressing, the film is also more cynical, and in many ways more original, than anything since the pre-Lucas\/Spielberg '70s think of William Friedkin's 'Sorcerer', written for laughs. That, by itself, is enough reason to recommend it, but is this where one hundred years of screen art have brought us?
