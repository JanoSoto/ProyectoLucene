For me the only reason why decided to buy it was because this movie has been positioned on the IMDb top 250 chart. Finally last summer I bought the tape and watched it with my friend. We both know nothing about it and didn't expect too much from it but the movie has exceeded our highest hopes and expectations. From any point of view Almost Famous is a terrific movie and it easily became one of my all-time favorites. It is so great, sincere and heartfelt that I simply have no enough words to describe it's beauty. Despite its R rating without a doubt it's one of the sweetest movies ever made and I believe it's the sweetest movie with such a rating. This masterpiece was written and directed by Cameron Crowe (only the second his work after another also excellent Jerry Maguire) who not only won well deserved Academy award for best screenplay but he definitely also deserved award for best director in that year. His directing is outstanding, every scene in his picture, every shot is meaningful, full of life, magically captured feelings and emotions. He created perfectly real and authentic partly based on his own experience atmosphere of the fascinating world of music when it wasn't entirely commercialized, the world of music from heart and for heart. Sadly, this time is lost forever. Now the industry of entertainment wisely called by one of the movie's characters industry of cool brings to us thousands commercial rock and pop-stars which fight for top place on different charts and sing mostly for enormous fees. Almost Famous is a story of William Miller, a talented 15 years old kid, who as a rock journalist took a tour through the all country with a rock band called Stillwater. During this travel he gets the opportunity to learn this world of music from inside so we can take a look with him, from his innocent and bright view. The band is looking incredibly real and believable, with all characters perfectly written and developed. With terrific performances of Billy Crudup, who plays the band charismatic leader and all other actors who played the band members Stillwater become so familiar and close to us that it's almost impossible think that this band never existed. Patrick Fugit who plays William also did an excellent job as young writer, whose innocence, honesty and cleverness gave him an opportunity not to lose yourself and even finally change people around him. Kate Hudson was so beautiful as Penny Lane, one of band aids (I can't believe that she didn't win best supporting actress award, but Academy nearly every year made weird choices). Last but not least among supporting casts is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs, a really existed character, clever and rock-writer, who tried to teach young William how to act in this fascinating but sometimes insane world of music. Every single word of this character is clever and quotable. Almost Famous is sometimes funny, sometimes said but always beautiful, sincere and poignant. The movie's soundtrack consist of excellent and charming music from 60-s and early 70-s. The perfect and stunning Tiny Dancer scene is undoubtedly the best music scene in the movies ever made. Almost Famous is a movie mainly about music and people related with music but it would be completely wrong to say that it's a movie only about a music. It's about so many things beyond that. Can anyone want more from the movie? I believe not. Now I have seen in more than ten times with several my friends. All of them share my opinion. For me Almost Famous become better and better with every time when I see it again.Not almost, but absolutely perfect. 10 out of 10.

There's nothing like a good set up of motivations and goals. And the version I watched (VHS 1989 full-length version) was out of focus. At times I couldn't really tell the characters apart... they all have beards and are dressed the same.I think a lot of people rate a film for how good it was when it came out. I prefer to rate how a film is doing now... that way I can use ratings to decide what I want to see today.

It's pretty much unpleasant from beginning to end, from prostitution to fratricide, and not in the least life-affirming. Everyone, from the psychopathic realtor played by Slater, to the morally vacuous and weak-willed groom-to-be is grotesque. However, I venture to add it IS funny, and it IS clever.Not merely, as Americans like to say, 'gross out' funny, but morally satirical. One of the darkest moments of the film is where the practising Jew character, the most morally developed of all in the movie has an attack of conscience as the group are preparing to dispose of the bodies of a prostitute and a security guard out in the desert.He says they must observe the Jewish practice that requires the bodies to be interred as complete, which provies impossible as both have been hacked up, wrapped up in plastic and distributed amongst four suitcases. What follows is a gruesome jigsaw puzzle of body parts, culminating a great sight gag of them lying out neatly arranged.There is a more serious premise behind the story of how five apparently ordinary guys who start out on a bachelor weekend are drawn progressively into more and more despicable acts. One of the great moral questions, from the time of the Greek moral philosophers to our own experience of the holocaust is how men come to do evil.Are there just some evil men, waiting for their potential to be awakened, or is there the potential in all of us, if we are given the excuse and the opportunity? Or is all that is required for evil, as the axiom states, that good men do nothing? Certainly, in the early part of the movie when the first death is down to an accident resulting from a series of misdemeanours, the more moral and sympathetic members of the groups are crucially transfixed by the possible damage to themselves from coming clean at that point.It's at that point that Slater's character, the charming, functioning psychopath (he does them so well) is able to seize the initiative, provide what appears to be a practical and just about morally palatable solution to their problem and a path back to normality.This is the true moral junction of the film; everything beyond that is a satirical commentary on their inability to do the one good thing required of them - come clean at the outset. Trying to read the film as totally naturalistic beyond that point doesn't work - it becomes increasingly absurd and unpredictable for comic purposes.This is a very wordy movie. The script is subtle and complex, and a large part of that is given over to Slater and his persuasive speeches on why a particular course of action should be taken at a particular time.In the beginning, he exhorts the group that they should cover up the prostitute's death and provides practical arguments to support this, seizing on the upcoming wedding as a moral defence for the actions they are going to commit. The movie's absurdity lies in the ever more extreme and disproportionate acts the group are prepared to commit simply for a wedding to take place.But there is a serious point underlying this. One common facet of 'organised evil' by apparently normal, moral individuals is the belief that unpleasant acts are necessary for a greater good. This becomes a device to obscure the badness of the bad things because the intent remains good. Should we judge acts by themselves or their intent?The film suggests, in contemporary society, we've descended even lower. We are obsessed by the appearance of morality rather than the actual practice of it. A society obsessed by symbols, ceremony and rituals rather than the truths they are supposed to represent.

Certainly, in the early part of the movie when the first death is down to an accident resulting from a series of misdemeanours, the more moral and sympathetic members of the groups are crucially transfixed by the possible damage to themselves from coming clean at that point.It's at that point that Slater's character, the charming, functioning psychopath (he does them so well) is able to seize the initiative, provide what appears to be a practical and just about morally palatable solution to their problem and a path back to normality.This is the true moral junction of the film; everything beyond that is a satirical commentary on their inability to do the one good thing required of them - come clean at the outset. Trying to read the film as totally naturalistic beyond that point doesn't work - it becomes increasingly absurd and unpredictable for comic purposes.This is a very wordy movie. The script is subtle and complex, and a large part of that is given over to Slater and his persuasive speeches on why a particular course of action should be taken at a particular time.In the beginning, he exhorts the group that they should cover up the prostitute's death and provides practical arguments to support this, seizing on the upcoming wedding as a moral defence for the actions they are going to commit. The movie's absurdity lies in the ever more extreme and disproportionate acts the group are prepared to commit simply for a wedding to take place.But there is a serious point underlying this. One common facet of 'organised evil' by apparently normal, moral individuals is the belief that unpleasant acts are necessary for a greater good. This becomes a device to obscure the badness of the bad things because the intent remains good. Should we judge acts by themselves or their intent?The film suggests, in contemporary society, we've descended even lower. We are obsessed by the appearance of morality rather than the actual practice of it. A society obsessed by symbols, ceremony and rituals rather than the truths they are supposed to represent. And Cameron Diaz is a wonderful exemplar of that ideal as the ruthless bride who steals the last 10 minutes of the movie.

The point that it is so shaky and makes no sense is because if you ever noticed, your dreams don't make much sense either. The awakenings are called false awakenings. Everyone has them. The plot of the movie is that he is trapped in a lucid dream and he won't stop having false awakenings. It seems that everyone that hates it, just doesn't understand what the movie is about.

I feel sorry for the actors, I understand that actors need to get their foot in the door somewhere even if the movie is this horrible. Whats the plot of this movie? Whatever it is, its not a very good one. I don't like Jason part 1 through 9, I don't think they are scary, just very loud and gory, but at least they are movies and somewhat tolerable. I don't understand what these random killings and hormone driven teens are doing. Why are teens a spaceship? Why does he kill everyone and why doesn't he just kill everybody already? Must he torture us with horrible movies while doing so? What is his purpose? What will he do after everyone is dead? Sit around? Why can't people kill him? When some one shoots him he just keeps coming, its gotten old and predictable. Why even fight? You know whoever fights him is gonna die. They can at least humor me and if thats the case, why even make a movie? The answer to that is money and the existence of this movie can only be explained and justified by Hollywood trying to milk another penny out of a series of movies that for one, I never liked, and two, is growing very old at a very fast rate Horrible.

If you're going to compare it against other King Arthur movies, well there is no comparison. To really appreciate the movie you do have to get around the bad acting, which can be a hard thing to do. It's not all bad... Merlin is excellent, Morgana is good, Arthur is OK... but everyone else kind of sucks. Guenivere is annoying as hell, Lancelot is too metrosexual, Mordred is ridiculous. But where this movie excels is in the sheer power of its scenes and its presentation. The musical score and the cinematography are designed to just floor you, and it works brilliantly. That's how a movie about King Arthur should be done. The combat scenes are awesome, especially the larger battles. These scenes are no BS... no over-dramatization or special effects, just raw and intense combat. The film is also extremely well-paced. So much happens throughout the movie, and it always holds your interest and is easy to follow. Suitable for today's attention spans. ) Now there is this new King Arthur movie coming out, which looks like some Van Helsing crap... I really doubt it will hold a candle to Excalibur.

While not perfect, this is still a great movie whose flaws are more than compensated for by its successes. All I can say about Micheal J. Fox's acting is wow! Most people who haven't seen this movie might not think Fox could pull off such a dramatic role, but he does and its perhaps the best performance of his successful career. The story is absolutely heart-wrenching. If you're not moved by it, you may not be human. On screen, there's one moment in particular that hits so hard, it feels like a kick to the stomach. Visually the movie is also stunning lush greens, blue skies, a few tricky camera shots, etc. If you wanted to look for flaws, I would have to say that some of the other leads besides Fox give uneven performances, including, surprisingly, Penn; but I digress.The DVD extras are decent too consisting of a Making of short, an interview with Fox, and the theatrical trailers.In short, buy this DVD!
