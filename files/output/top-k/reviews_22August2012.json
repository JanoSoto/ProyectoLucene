I originally watched the film for the first time on late night TV. There are many clues in the film as to what is actually happening, but whether someone picks up on them or not on the first viewing is another thing altogether. For myself, I did not catch the many underlying clues the first time but the majority of viewers don't and won't no matter how clever you are. This film was brilliantly assembled with the dialogue, vernacular, and visual style. Fight Club has a non stop pace in its 2 hour and twenty minute running time. The Sixth Sense, Go, Election, Memento, and Election are similar in the sense that they all replay scenes that clarify the real meaning of the film or key scenes\/information for each viewer. All of these films are very rewarding in that respect because each of these films enighten the viewer instead of frustrating them with a feeling of insipid, senseless visuals and dialogue that leaves no lasting memorable experience. All of the actors portrayals in Fight Club are exceptional even the supporting actors comprised of David Fincher usuals for those who have seen his other various other films in the 90's. The narrative in the film is intricately layed out so that even if you believe you have the full picture on film you don't until you've seen the entire film. Go features disparate characters who are connected and who intersect through one anothers lives through a drug deal gone awry and a rave party. The Sixth Sense features Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who has an intense meeting with a former patient of his at the beginning of the film and from there on set his goals on aiding an adolescent who has similar cerebral disorders as the patient who he failed to assist who broke into his home. Election features Reese Witherspoon as an overachieiving high school student who is attempting to win the presidency at carver high. Matthew Broderick plays a teacher who intevenes against her quest as president and enlists the aid of another student who is a jock to thwart her possibility of becoming the next school president. He basically is envious of her capabilities and that is why he alters the election scenario. In memento, Guy Pierce is trying to locate his wife's killer with clues that he has tattoed on himself and notes that he writes himself because his memory fades after a few minutes. The film is shown backwards and makes the audience feel as confused as Leonard(Guy Pierce) does. The film is shown backwards because Leonard's mind is backwards. The technique of showing a film like this is fascinating and unique. This film is the only film to utilize this technique setting the film apart from any other film.1999 and 2000 for the prevalent years of the psychological film. The films that I've seen from those two years up to this day include The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, The Gift, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Dogma, Memento, Snatch, American Psycho, Requiem For A Dream, Charlie's Angels, The Cell, Go, Final Destination, Cruel Intentions, Traffic, Sleepy Hollow, Stir Of Echoes, The Ninth Gate, and Analyze This. That is the full amount of films I can recall from those years that were linked in the style and overall impression that they left audiences with. I grew up with these films, I was 10-11 when I saw most of these films and the quality of these films is in no comparison to the inferior quality of the films produced today.

Gere and Lane fall for each other. Complications ensue. There is a sub plot involving alienation between Gregory Hines and his brother, a duo tap-dancing act, and they finally make up. The plot centers around -- or whirls around -- the Cotton Club, a fashionable night club in Harlem in which talented African-Americans provided entertainment for rich white couples and celebrities.Frankly, I found myself confused about some of the turns in the plot. The one thing I was able to keep straight is that all the murderers and thick-necked traitorous goons were white, while the black folk were all good. Dutch Schultz (James Remar) is particularly contemptible. The guy has no sense of humor. He's always scowling. And he gives too many orders like, Get me a cigar, and Tie my shoes, and Where is my garter belt? After a scuffle with Richard Gere and Gregory Hines in The Cotton Club, he and his sour henchmen drive to The Palace Chop House in Newark, New Jersey, where they are shot to pieces by a rival gang. I was honestly glad to see Schultz get it. With Newark the way it is today, I don't think he'd have made it as far as the chop house.The Cotton Club was famous, really famous, and Harlem was aboom in the 1920s and part of the 30s. Duke Ellington played there, Fletcher Henderson, Cab Calloway, everybody who was anybody. It was called going slumming and was a must-visit for movie stars. An unrecognizable Diane Venora plays Gloria Swanson, who gets Gere a job as an actor in a Hollywood movie.How does is the Cotton Club's entertainment fitted into the movie? Not so neatly. There are some great performers, including Honey Coles, and Coppola lets the camera roll while they do their stuff -- once in a while, for two or three numbers. But he makes the same mistake he made with Fred Astaire in Finian's Rainbow. Too often he cuts directly from a dancer's upper torso to a close up of the dancer's feet. And the cuts are too fast to allow the audience to appreciate what's going on. And there is a LOT going on during a well-choreographed dance, with the performer's whole body involved. I can say this with some certainty because I studied dance and, after a good deal of effort, found that, as a dancer, I had all the finely honed skills of a performing seal. It really puzzled me. I asked myself, Self, what the hell is wrong with your kinetic sense?, but the answer was a confusing explanation of myoneural plates and I gave up trying to understand. Some people have it. Some don't.Richard Gere is the central figure and he does all right by the role. He's edgier and more impulsive than ever, which is saying a lot. When he gets the proper role, Gere can do it to death, although I must say I found him no more than adequate as my supporting player in the poetic masterpiece, No Mercy. I had to carry the kid through the whole picture by giving him sound advice like, Just say your lines and make sure you don't look at the camera. And, I swear, whoever dubbed his trumpet solos couldn't find anything inventive in the subdued variations on the melodic theme. Listen to Gere's solos and then listen to a CD of Bix Beiderbecke or Louis Armstrong.

I give it 2 stars because I wanted to see how they were going to end it. The whole seemed pointless.I have never disagreed with so many reviewers in my life. I suspect it is because a lot of people saw it back in the day. Old movies have a positive bias I noticed. Most don't hold up that well. I just saw Patton yesterday and I give that a 10.

Those characters are Marion, Harry and Tyrone played by Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans. Jared Leto was in American Psycho(Paul Allen), Fight Club(Angel Face) and this film, all of these films were released in 1999-2000. Leto then went on to star in Daid Fincher's Panic Room with Jodie Foster and Forst Whitaker in 2002. Prior to his three film appearance in 99-00 he starred in Urban Legend a scream styled thriller also starring Rebecca Gayheart(Scream 2) Tara Reid(American Pie) and Robert Englund( A nightmare on elm street. That film was average but it gave him a decent start to the film industry. The visuals in this film are superior to many films you will ever see or have seen. Darren Aronofsky shows the characters pupils dilating after they experiment with drugs, he depicts the entire process the effect a drug has on the human body. He shows step by step how the characters take the drugs, with syringe shots, bodily cell shots, the opiate injection scenes are brilliantly shown which is exactly what a viewer would want to see in a film of this genre. There are similar shots in this film when compared to Trainspotting(1996). There are rapid motion shots in both of these films with the character's and hospital scenes. However on the contrary, Danny Boyle's film is delivered on a more amusing tone then requiem is. Requiem has a more somber tone regarding the consequences\/toll that the character's experimentation with drugs result in. But the despondent feeling that requiem leaves on each viewer shouldn't diminish the enjoyment and concept of the film. The film is extremely forthright as is trainspotting as to the exhilarating and horrifying fluctuations of incessant drug use. The real differentiation between the two films is the culmination of each conclusion. Trainspotting leaves the viewer with an uplifted cleansed feeling towards their outlook on life since Ewan Mcregregor's character Mark decides to abandon his life as a carefree drug user and move on to a more significant lifestyle that he deserves. Severing the annoyance of pesky acquaintances prodding him for drugs or support when they should be dealing with own priorities then relying on someone who is a mate as they state it in the film as the film was from the UK and is set in London.Requiem is set in the area of Coney island New York. Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's character have brooklyn accents in the film. Whereas Jennifer's and tyrone's character's have regular voices. Both these films are detailed and psychological in the vignettes they show of the characters drug use and the aftereffects of their usage. Overall both films are classics of their genre. There aren't many films that focus on the positive and negative affects of drug usage as splendidly as these two films do. The majority of the character's in both films survive their behaviour which is pretty realistic. For someone to actually succumb to their drug use involves heavy abuse of very potent substances. In trainspotting the four characters Mark, Begbie, Spud and Sick Boy diverge from each other at the end of the film. They finalize a scag deal and split up to pursue the rest of their lives solely. In requiem each character comes out of the abysmal experience of drug usage as well but for both films their next odyssey is unexplored. In Trainspotting Mark's Journey is clearly laid out by Boyle but in requiem Aronofsky doesn't delve into the character's next pursuits. Aronofsky concentrates on the fact that all four people have conquered their drug use and will likely go on to live more fulfilling lives in every aspect. With that being expounded both films end on a relatively high note. These two films are among my favorites and they both leave an indelible mark on the perspective of drug use in real life and in film. Since these two films were released I haven't seen a film that has covered the same terrain has these two do. The impact of both films is undeniable because the candor shines through in both films whether you entirely adore both films or have some qualms about the film's real messages.

Generally, The Last Days Of Disco presents a wonderfully hilarious multi-character piece that builds with multiple viewings.Alice (Chloë Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale) are a pair of young assistants to assistant editors at a mid-sized Manhattan publisher, circa The very early 1980s. How early? Disco is still going on, particularly in one local club frequented by the two girls and their college friends.Stillman movies always make for a certain disconnect. You can read it in the reviews here, about the dialogue that doesn't sound real, too term- paperish. I have another favorite writer who often has his characters speak in iambic pentameter, and I've learned to get over it. The problem with Stillman here is certainly not his inability to write clever, piquant dialogue.I still consider myself a loyal adherent to the disco movement?It's a movement?That's like something out of the Nazis!Every time you made love to me, you must have wanted to vomit!No, no, no. You're beautiful. You don't have to be some sweaty horny hetero he-ape to admire and appreciate female beauty.Of course it's formulaic. It's a formula!It's true, Des, your mouth does look gay.And for those people who say, not without merit, that Stillman can't come up with a decent piece of dialogue that doesn't involve twelve adverbs and six past imperfect verbs, I submit one from this movie that consists of a single letter H!What Disco has going for it, beyond all else, is the performances of its two stars. Beckinsale is incredibly beautiful here playing a wonderfully coy and slightly evil American vixen. She's a b-word, but with a heart of silver, not insensitive to the effect of her slings, who wins our heart despite herself. One thing I've learned is people hate being criticized, she says at one point, as if surprised herself at the insight.Sevigny is even better as the heart of the film, a gentle character whose reaction shots sell us on the story more than anyone else's words. Whether she's with the dicey but delicious Des (Stillman regular Chris Eigeman) or the quietly intense, somewhat unstable Josh (Matt Keeslar), Sevigny keeps your sympathies centered around her character to a degree no other lead in a Stillman film ever has.That's about the highest praise I can offer Last Days, that Sevigny and Beckinsale represent the best female performances in a Stillman film. It's not as well-balanced as Barcelona or Metropolitan, the two other films of Stillman's I've seen (and some of whose characters pop up here.) The disco music is welcome though the period atmosphere is lacking, as I see this as a product entirely of the 1990s, the decade in which it was made. And the joining of Alice and Charlotte's stories with that of the fall of a club which is but isn't Studio 54 doesn't gel as well as it could have.But speaking as a Stillman fan, I love this film every bit as much as his other two 20th-century offerings, even if I can't recommend it as unreservedly.

There are some truly ingeniously shot scenes, perhaps most notably being one involving holes in the ceiling and a frantic David. What Boyle manages to do is tear your feelings - you want them to get horribly mutilated because they are a sick bunch, but at the same time you want them to get away with it because, for reasons unbeknownst to you, you can sympathise with them.Maybe it's because you feel sorry for them being dragged into it. Maybe it's because you like mean people. Or, maybe it's because you're not sure you'd do any better. Whatever it is, you will enjoy it (and will probably argue with someone about the ending).

All their choices of life interact with a cruel irony. But interestingly, it's the father who seals the Family's fate. Arthur, a wealthy lawyer, (E.G. Marshall) reveals his intentions to leave the house. The declaration he makes is a masterstroke of writing, as we can hardly find his motives unreasonable. He paid all the bills, did his best to ensure his daughters a good education, so why wouldn't he be allowed to think for himself. The scene echoes the opening lines when he relates the way Eve changed from a beautiful and classy lady to a total stranger. The tragedy of all the protagonists in Interiors is that the awareness isn't enough; grieves and hurts that inhabit their hearts are so heavy that it continues to work as obstacles to live their lives without being governed by the others. However as bleak and sinister as the film apparently gets, it is not pessimistic, but it invites us to question what kind of lives we desire for ourselves. And the clues are given by the peripheral characters, Mike (Sam Waterston), Joey's husband is a filmmaker who believes that a child could cure Joey from her existential torments. Frederick (Richard Jordan) can't dissociate mediocrity from the peers' recognition, no matter how sincerely Renata compliments him; he'll feel inferior to her as long as he doesn't win a single award. And then there's Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), the vulgarian, the woman who conquered Arthur's heart, a down-to-earth nature who prefers beaches to Greek temples, eating, dancing, drinking, rather than getting caught in some intellectual masturbation about the meaning of life. She epitomizes the polar opposition from the values the three daughters grew in. With her dress, in the bleak almost monochromatic setting Eve painted to her Family, Pearl is like a bright and flashy red stain. She feels things rather than intellectually distorting them.

Even to this day it gets high marks. It's a good film...but not a great one.I really liked this film but I had a feeling I saw a similar performance by Montgomery Clift in some other film I saw...Then it came to me...The Heiress. In The Heiress he plays a guy trying to get his way to the top via social climbing via a female of a wealthy man. This is not much different. In this he plays a uneducated nephew of a To Do family whom they invite to come and get a job in their factory. When he arrives he is obviously a very timid and harmless guy but in comes Elizabeth Taylor and he's transfixed. He knows he doesn't stand a chance with her so he starts to secretly date a girl from the factory. One rule they state to him is to never date girls from the factory. To this turn he gets his girl pregnant. At the same time, or shortly thereafter, Elizabeth Taylor gives him some attention and they fall in love. What's a guy to do.The crux of the film is what he'll do when Shirley Winters (his girlfriend) turns the screws to him about getting married because of the baby.

Said like this, the film sounds predictable, whether it's for the interracial friendship or the old and grouchy befriending the gay and jovial, but the two characters here are beyond stereotypes. Jessica Tandy, in a virtuoso performance, is Daisy Werthan, an old seventy- something Jewish widow who considers herself a liberal, strong-willed and independent. Morgan Freeman is Hoke Colbrun, slightly younger but old enough to need a job in the post- war Atlanta, he's handy, good-natured, and hides behind his cheerful nature an admirable aptitude to find the right words.The film opens when Miss Daisy accidentally wrecks her automobile and Boolie, her son, played by Dan Ayrkryod suggests she gets a chauffeur because no insurance would cover her. Coincidentally, he meets Hoke, a retired chauffeur after the death of his boss, a local judge. Instead of accompanying the widow, Hoke prefers to stay in the area. Daisy needs a chauffeur but doesn't want one, Hoke needs a job and gets it, only as Boolie's salaried; he still has to convince Miss Daisy to accept him. Then what goes between the two characters is subtler than the typical pre-friendship animosity.Miss Daisy is not prejudiced against Hoke because he's African American, we understand that from her close relationship with her housemaid Idella (Esther Rolle). In fact, Miss Daisy is only reluctant to have a chauffeur because it would mislead people about both her age and her wealth; she's seriously concerned about social perception. And Hoke is a practical man, he understands that sooner or later, Miss Daisy will have to go shopping, and when the opportunity happens, he follows her with the shining new Hudson car offered by the insurance it would be a shame not to use such a good car for abstract reasons. Then she gets in and the relationship can start on good wheels.The scene is crucial because rather than a class or a racial antagonism between two people, it's mainly a difference of thinking that opposes them. Miss Daisy is not a grumpy old Lady, she's a classy retired schoolteacher who believes in some good conduct in life, 'you should be ashamed' is her defensive catchphrase, slightly betraying a life driven by social codes. Hoke is wise enough to never go too far, always respectful and understanding, he makes Miss Daisy believe she's right and make HIS point at the same time. Complimenting a bad-tempered person about her strong personality is a great way to indirectly point out how childish she can get. Hoke knows how to deal with Miss Daisy, contrarily to Boolie, who goes frontal and always loses. And if Dan Aykroyd is remarkable as the well-intentioned and responsible son, the masterstrokes of acting belong to the two leads. Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy, both Oscar-nominated, are so authentic that we never feel it's two actors playing, their interactions, their silences, their verbal exchanges speak more than anything in the film. Indeed, despite all the efforts from the director, the make-up artist, the art designer to suggest the passing of time, this is an actors' film and all we need is to live and endure the slow but powerful growth of complicity between Hoke and Miss Daisy. And each mimic, each reaction is an event by itself, a smile from Miss Daisy, her trial to help Hoke to read or finally, Hoke strongly assessing his right not to behave like a child who has to ask for permission to empty his bladder, one of the film's most powerful moments. Driving Miss Daisy is like a long, but never too slow and never too quiet, travel on a road between two hearts, the direction is only the coming to realization that there's more than a professional bond between them. It takes times to realize that, but life itself is a time-taking process. And through the beautiful friendship, the film also speaks some powerful statements about discrimination. Jessica Tandy seems like playing the same character but when you get deeper in her performance, you realize that she evolves too. She starts as a lady stuck in a world of abstractions, incapable of realizing that two cops in the South despise her as much as they do for Hoke, that the line between Ku Klux Klan's actions and synagogues burning is very thin. And in an extraordinary moment, when she's driven to a Martin Luther King's meeting and decides to invite Hoke just because Boolie couldn't go with her for business reasons, Hoke understands it's a last-minute move and his reaction says it all things might have changed in Daisy's mind, but she's still incapable to level with him. It's those subtle and powerful scenes that make a film like Driving Miss Daisy infinitely superior to emotional stuff such as last year's The Help, a movie I start to regard less excitedly. Because Driving Miss Daisy is a gem, it's one of these cinematic oddities that undermine the existence of particular rules when it comes to cinematic awards, public recognition and even personal enjoyment. The film strikes by its simplicity, a minimal casting, an unfamiliar quietness and the quasi-absence of a plot, yet the effect of its climactic declaration, on the heart is impossible to describe. And if cinematically speaking, the film does deliver what it intends to, although it doesn't feature all the requirements of many successful films, no thrilling sequences, no grandiose speeches, no breakdowns, within its own simplicity, the film is close to perfect. Maybe it deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1990, after all. And I say 'maybe' because I still would have to give it a thought had not Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing been so snubbed.

Not as an existential notion, but as daily physical condition. We take for granted our capability to walk, to speak, to eat, to drink, to think by ourselves, to be able to control our movements, our choices and decisions, but have we ever questioned the significance of these little things? To a certain extent, the word 'awakening' doesn't only relate to Dr. Sayer's patients but also to the viewers.Robin Williams plays Dr. Sayer, a shy and amiable physician who's hired in a Bronx hospital to take care of catatonic patients although he's more used to handle animal living forms. Dr. Kaufman (John Heard), one of the executives can see that and is reluctant to hire him, but the patients need a doctor so he just knocked at the right door. But the first act only provides sorrowing sights of patients stuck in an immobile position, incapable of making the slightest gesture, let alone communicating. The ward is named 'the garden' in reference to their vegetative state; indeed, they live like plants do, and even animals have much richer lives. All the patients survived the 1917-1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargy, a strange epidemic that quickly disappeared but plunged its survivors in a strange comatose state, despite a period of brief recovery.One of the film's most haunting images is the archive footage shot of a person extending her arm with a sort of crisped and desperate look in the face, the mouth wide open, the patient is like asking for something, help maybe? Is that human being even thinking, asks Dr. Sayer, disturbed as we probably are by those images. No, retorts the retired Dr. Ingham who treated them (played by Max Von Sydow). Why not? Because the alternative would be unthinkable! In other words, the very idea that these creatures would be capable of thoughts or sheer awareness but incapable to express them, like caged in their own body, would be properly intolerable. Maybe Ingham is right but then how about these little signs that Sayer starts to notice during his extensive study.The pivotal moment occurs when he treats a patient named Lucy (Alice Drummond) he notices that she caught her eyeglasses before they fell in the ground. Later, it appears that not only Lucy but also all the comatose patients are capable to catch a ball thrown at them. It's a reflex, suggests Kaufman, the reflex, according to Sayer, would be to bat the ball away. Sayer is convinced that there is still life inside the patients, that the sickness spared their faculties, only they don't have the will and can only borrow it, like the stone-face Lucy borrowed the 'will of the ball'. Sayer's colleagues concur that the theory is absurd, but it makes an impact on Nurse Costello (Julie Kavner) who encourages Sayer to go further in his investigation.Sayer focuses then on the case of Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) a man in his fifties, comatose since his early teens. Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) takes care of him everyday, resigned that she's the mother of a man sentenced to be a perpetual baby. But she admits she can communicate with him, not with words of course, but a language Dr. Sayer would understand if he had children. Sayer sure agrees with her, especially on the fact that Leonard can communicate. He proceeds to a graphical record of the electrical activity in his brain, and the resulting graph shows one peak, occurred when Sayer said his name. The 'will of the ball' theory was a fiasco but this discovery is Sayer's first little victory. He knows he's on his way.And step-by-step, the researches of Dr Sayer will lead to a theory assimilating the symptoms of his patients to an extreme stage of Parkinson disease where the movements are so acute that they cancel each other out. With the permission of Mrs. Lowe, he experiments the L- Dopa, the medicine used for Parkinsonism, on Leonard, with various dosages. Tired of waiting, Sayers almost turns to a half-doctor and half sorcerer's apprentice, he tries the highest dose on Leonard and the results are immediate and spectacular, almost miraculous. Leonard awakens from his state and is like born again, he can hardly speak but it doesn't matter because the magnificent smile on his face says enough. The eyes still have the innocence of a child, a man whose adulthood was stolen, and the smile sweeps off Dr. Ingham's theory Leonard knows and understands what he's recovering from.The film takes a magical and delightful turn into happiness and rediscovery while we follow, not only Leonard, but all the patients, awakening, learning to speak, to feel things again, to eat, to control their emotions, to live and to love. It's funny, inspiring, touching and carried by two wonderful performances by both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. De Niro's eyes and smiles convey an exhilarating attachment to life that would confine to a heart-breaking desperateness when some secondary effects moderating the enthusiasm of the first results would appear; it's one of De Niro's very best performances. On the other hand Williams's timidity, in the polar opposite of all the characters he played, enriches the film with another dimension, a realization about the little things that make life worth living such abstractions like friendship, respect or love.It's precisely in the name of friendship, respect and love that no sickness can dehumanize a person. That's the inspirational message and eye-opening vision of Awakenings. The film was Oscar-nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing and Best Acting in a Leading Role (Robert De Niro), it's based on a true story, and it's hard to imagine that miracles like this could happen, but they do. In fact, the simple act of living is a miracle by itself that we should value every day.

","genre":"Biography, Drama"},{"date":"22 August 2012","score":"","review":" If Penny Marshall's Awakenings had one effect on me, it's certainly to make me think about life. Not as an existential notion, but as daily physical condition. We take for granted our capability to walk, to speak, to eat, to drink, to think by ourselves, to be able to control our movements, our choices and decisions, but have we ever questioned the significance of these little things? To a certain extent, the word 'awakening' doesn't only relate to Dr. Sayer's patients but also to the viewers.Robin Williams plays Dr. Sayer, a shy and amiable physician who's hired in a Bronx hospital to take care of catatonic patients although he's more used to handle animal living forms. Dr. Kaufman (John Heard), one of the executives can see that and is reluctant to hire him, but the patients need a doctor so he just knocked at the right door. But the first act only provides sorrowing sights of patients stuck in an immobile position, incapable of making the slightest gesture, let alone communicating. The ward is named 'the garden' in reference to their vegetative state; indeed, they live like plants do, and even animals have much richer lives. All the patients survived the 1917-1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargy, a strange epidemic that quickly disappeared but plunged its survivors in a strange comatose state, despite a period of brief recovery.One of the film's most haunting images is the archive footage shot of a person extending her arm with a sort of crisped and desperate look in the face, the mouth wide open, the patient is like asking for something, help maybe? Is that human being even thinking, asks Dr. Sayer, disturbed as we probably are by those images. No, retorts the retired Dr. Ingham who treated them (played by Max Von Sydow). Why not? Because the alternative would be unthinkable! In other words, the very idea that these creatures would be capable of thoughts or sheer awareness but incapable to express them, like caged in their own body, would be properly intolerable. Maybe Ingham is right but then how about these little signs that Sayer starts to notice during his extensive study.The pivotal moment occurs when he treats a patient named Lucy (Alice Drummond) he notices that she caught her eyeglasses before they fell in the ground. Later, it appears that not only Lucy but also all the comatose patients are capable to catch a ball thrown at them. It's a reflex, suggests Kaufman, the reflex, according to Sayer, would be to bat the ball away. Sayer is convinced that there is still life inside the patients, that the sickness spared their faculties, only they don't have the will and can only borrow it, like the stone-face Lucy borrowed the 'will of the ball'. Sayer's colleagues concur that the theory is absurd, but it makes an impact on Nurse Costello (Julie Kavner) who encourages Sayer to go further in his investigation.Sayer focuses then on the case of Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) a man in his fifties, comatose since his early teens. Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) takes care of him everyday, resigned that she's the mother of a man sentenced to be a perpetual baby. But she admits she can communicate with him, not with words of course, but a language Dr. Sayer would understand if he had children. Sayer sure agrees with her, especially on the fact that Leonard can communicate. He proceeds to a graphical record of the electrical activity in his brain, and the resulting graph shows one peak, occurred when Sayer said his name. The 'will of the ball' theory was a fiasco but this discovery is Sayer's first little victory. He knows he's on his way.And step-by-step, the researches of Dr Sayer will lead to a theory assimilating the symptoms of his patients to an extreme stage of Parkinson disease where the movements are so acute that they cancel each other out. With the permission of Mrs. Lowe, he experiments the L- Dopa, the medicine used for Parkinsonism, on Leonard, with various dosages. Tired of waiting, Sayers almost turns to a half-doctor and half sorcerer's apprentice, he tries the highest dose on Leonard and the results are immediate and spectacular, almost miraculous. Leonard awakens from his state and is like born again, he can hardly speak but it doesn't matter because the magnificent smile on his face says enough. The eyes still have the innocence of a child, a man whose adulthood was stolen, and the smile sweeps off Dr. Ingham's theory Leonard knows and understands what he's recovering from.The film takes a magical and delightful turn into happiness and rediscovery while we follow, not only Leonard, but all the patients, awakening, learning to speak, to feel things again, to eat, to control their emotions, to live and to love.

I think he was well aware that if you just do a comedy and market it as such, it won't stand out; but if you do a comedy and mix it with a non-compatible genre, it will seem superficially out of the ordinary, and its cult status in B-movie land is assured. And so we get Braindead\/Dead Alive, a fairly conventional plot-oriented romantic comedy with buckets of red corn syrup.A film like The Evil Dead is occasionally blackly hilarious in its audacity, rather than because it's written to be. There were times when you'd laugh, but it felt wrong to laugh, delightfully wrong; it was never not a horror movie. This movie, on the other hand, is a flat-out horror\/comedy, and the laughs are transparent; it's totally telegraphed when you're supposed to be scared (never), when you're supposed to giggle, etc. The result is just too one-dimensional and unsubtle even for this sort of thing, and all the hilarious one-liners kinda stop being funny once you turn 15 or so.I think this is the exact same problem with Return of the Living Dead, the Evil Dead sequels, and all the other camp splatter comedies out there, so your mileage may vary. If you love that kind of stuff you'll love this, but I see it as something of a letdown after the distilled WTF of Jackson's previous film, Bad Taste.

It wasn't even that good and certainly not worth sitting through the rest of the movie. There wasn't even nudity to give this movie at least some value. Even when they came close to nudity it was the most lame sex scene that I'd ever seen in my life.
