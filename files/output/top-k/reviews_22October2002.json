With a solid cast, a powerful premise, moody lighting and a feel for atmosphere, it is a slick thriller with flowing action. However, if you prefer smarts to good looks there's no way to feel but cheated. This film is but a pale version of what it could have been in the hands of a serious director willing to take some risks.Certain kinds of material can't be taken lightly. If you're going to make a film about sexual violence you should be aiming at more than just entertainment. 8MM aims to reveal some of the darkest corners of the human mind, where sexual perversion goes hand in hand with extreme violence, murder and psychopathy. The mere conception that this snuff-world exists, an underground porno-industry with thematics like sexual assault, real acts of rape and murder caught on film, and that some people are attracted to this kind of material to satisfy their sick forms of desire, is absolutely scary. Private investigator Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) goes into the heart of this world to discover if such a film, of a girl being violently assaulted and murdered, is real or not, and who's behind it. It is one of the strongest premises to a film I've ever seen, and it could have been a real classic, comparable to `Seven' and `Silence of the Lambs'. The errand of Tom Welles reminded me of Friedkin's `Cruising', where Al Pacino plays an undercover cop in pursuit of a serial killer obsessed with gay sado-masochist practices.8MM promised such a descent into hell. `If you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, he changes you'. That is the key-idea of the plot. To find out the truth, the main character has to plunge deep into this world of madness, and by doing so, he'll have to risk his own sanity. Cage says that in the movie `I want to understand!'. But it's an empty plot he's working with. Although affected, Welles never looses his balance entirely. Why is he obsessed with this murder? Why does he want revenge? If this had been a brave script, the Welles character should have become obsessed with these movies. To understand the psychopathic attraction of repulse. In fact, his very own balance with insanity should have been the reason for his need for revenge. Because maybe that perversion, although repulsive to him, is also attractive to the darkest corners of his mind. The more you see, the more you don't mind seeing. And it should be that hatred, the hatred for his own weakness, that is the weakness of the human soul, that should be the drive for his need for revenge.Maybe a director like Fincher would be willing to explore that path. Joel Schumacher certainly isn't. The visual dress-up of this movie, with stylish looks, dark photography and strong colors, doesn't hide that fact. We never get to understand who Welles really is. His family problems are not explored, and the growing threat to his family is never entirely believable. The scene where Cage makes a phone call to the girl's mother before killing Gandolfini, to get `permission' to perpetrate revenge, is unrealistic and simply ridiculous. The final confrontation with the Machine character is the sum up of this movie's failure. In a script that doesn't develop this character the way it should, all you get is the Machine mumbling some psychological explanations with no consequence to the story. The simple fact that all this needs to be verbalized is a demonstration of what Schumacher was unable to show with his direction. And it's a real shame. A story like this had potential to explore tremendously strong solutions. I have nothing against happy endings, but what are we supposed to conclude from this?Just look at `Seven'. You can't have a film telling you the world is a horrible place, but they live happily ever after.

I don't see his career amounting to much of anything, but I think this single performance will wind up haunting him for the rest of his life because honestly, he will never grow out of it in the eyes of the audience. I feel Haley makes this film creepy, and keeps the suspense stirring throughout. I can see why Toni Collette got no nods for her performance here. Besides the scene towards the end in the car with Haley, I feel she does a below par job in this film. ***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Ok this is where I feel the film lost a lot of luster.

Danielle Harris was decent; nothing great, nothing too bad.  Ellie Cornell's minor role was average.  Is this film scary?  No, not the tiniest bit in my opinion.  It was predictable; way too predictable, dull, and the scenes were too slow for anything to happen in order to make me jump.  I can see that the film crew wanted to throw in some action scenes here and there.  They made a good effort but just not good enough.  The writing was awful.  I didn't realize that a script, particularly a 'Halloween' script, could be so terrible.  The lines were laughable and once again, predictable.So, I'm afraid to admit that I disliked this film so much being that the original was such a big hit with me, but I can't help it.  It almost put me to sleep!  If you're looking for a good (horror) film, I suggest staying along the same line and viewing 'Halloween 2' or 'Halloween H20'.  Now those are good 'Halloween' films.

It sounds like a fan geek's dream, but that doesn't negate the fact that it's a pretty stupid movie. To be honest, it's also kind of dull up till the last act, more on that in a minute. Director James Isaac opens the film with a stylish credit sequence and sets up the story in a fairly interesting way, at least for a slasher. There is even a cameo by cult favorite David Cronenburg. However, as it goes on, it's clear that he has no real sense of pacing, nor does he often demonstrate the ability to scare us. To be fair, that would be hard to do with such flimsy material. It doesn't help that there are a couple of groan-inducing bits regarding severed body parts.The production values are just so-so, betraying its low-budget origins. I would have been much more forgiving in this area if treated to a good story, but it was not to be. The special effects are sometimes adequate, sometimes blatantly fake-looking. I wasn't expecting anything as good as Ridley Scott's Alien, but at the very least, they should have tried to make it swift and entertaining. The sixth, seventh, and eighth entries were fun to watch in a cheesy sort of way. They were pretty silly, but certainly diverting. Jason X is just plain bad.

So underrated that, as far as I know, it hasn't been released on DVD (only on VHS and LaserDisc).Another reason (apart from being a very non-commercial and non-mainstream movie) is that the book is quite hard to get.

But for me it's a much more complicated creation, which works on so many levels. It deals with the basic and most important issues in life, society, government, wars, religion, education, brain-washing, the place of the individual, the hardship of being alone (physically and mentally), the concept of holding two contradictious thoughts at the same time, the position of the individual in history, the nothingness of being human, love, family, loyalty and betrayal, the instinct of any animal in nature to survive, and so much, much more.Being so complicated, I think it's impossible to bring all the concepts of the book to the big screen (Naked Lunch, anyone?

So underrated that, as far as I know, it hasn't been released on DVD (only on VHS and LaserDisc).Another reason (apart from being a very non-commercial and non-mainstream movie) is that the book is quite hard to get. The way I see it, everyone sees and understands something else from it. The outer layer is a political satire and most people see it only as a negative prophecy. But for me it's a much more complicated creation, which works on so many levels. It deals with the basic and most important issues in life, society, government, wars, religion, education, brain-washing, the place of the individual, the hardship of being alone (physically and mentally), the concept of holding two contradictious thoughts at the same time, the position of the individual in history, the nothingness of being human, love, family, loyalty and betrayal, the instinct of any animal in nature to survive, and so much, much more.Being so complicated, I think it's impossible to bring all the concepts of the book to the big screen (Naked Lunch, anyone? Heh, maybe Cronenberg should have handled 1984 too). So don't expect to find everything in the movie (this is the point to mention that several minor changes were made for the movie). If you like it, I recommend you to read the book. I think that together they complete each other, in the sense that the former brings life to the latter When I read the book (at least 4 times by now) I see and hear the characters as they appear in the movie. I can't imagine how the reading would be without it.Back to the movie, which, by the way, was shot on exactly the same dates (up to the day!) and locations as imagined by author George Orwell. It stars John Hurt, my favorite British actor, in what might be his best performance ever. Very few actors can give so much realism to such a demanding and difficult role (especially the torture scenes).This is also Richard Burton's last movie, and it's dedicated to him. Burton is excellent in his role, and his casting is perfect. His voice and speeches will stay with you for a very long time.All the other actors are excellent too Suzanna Hamilton as Julia, Gregor Fisher (which you might recognize from the TV Bean-like comedy The Baldy Man) as Parsons, Cyril Cusack as Charrington, and more.Dominic Muldowney did a fantastic job with the music and songs, and the Eurythmics contribution works well here, especially Annie Lennox's heavenly voice (but keep their CD-soundtrack aside - it's so much different from the movie's atmosphere, except for the end-credits song, Julia). Muldowney's score, titled Nineteen Eighty-Four - The Music of Oceania, was finally released in 1999. It's 54 minutes long and contains 24 tracks.Roger Deakins' cinematography and film-processing is excellent, giving the film the required atmosphere and aging look.And of course, Michael Radford, who also made the adaption, directed the movie flawlessly.Well, if you read this review up to here, you understand how good I think the movie and novel are. I can't recommend them enough. But be warned - both are extremely depressing and require a lot of thinking.

What do Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil actually point out? The same that a number after a movie does lack of imagination. A bit more 'obsessive' in the gaming world, but still very present in the cinematic affair as well. I am not against these inspired movies. As long as they're good, that is. Resident Evil, directed by Paul Anderson, nearly throws up the following storyline In a top-secret underground facility a deadly (and terribly contaminating) virus is set free.

All Anderson does is fit in some cool moves, some cool zombie dogs, while leaving the rest of the film to rot. I consider his attitude extremely disgusting why make a movie called Resident Evil if you don't want it to have anything to do with the game?

On the one hand, I am far from enamoured by it, but on the other it's the final act in the otherwise excellent time travel trilogy.  First off, it must be stated that this entry is the weakest of the three.  Many Future fans will disagree with me, citing Part II as the weak link.  What they overlook is that Part II has no grand finale like Parts I and III and inevitably suffers because of it.  Nothing is tied up, loose ends remain, questions go unanswered and confusion reigns &#150; so it requires the last chapter to put the world of Marty McFly to rights.  But Part II offers greater all-round entertainment, its darker tone offset by some exhilarating action and futuristic special effects.Part III is, to all intents and purposes, a love story with a formulaic Western theme.  It is more like the 1985 original in style, with much of the film taking place in one setting, with only two bouts of time travel, culminating in a rousing finale.  Unlike Part I, however, this film is lacking the extra ingredient to push it out of the pretty good and into the great.  Robert Zemeckis' direction focuses this film on Doc for the first time and perhaps it is this shift in emphasis that left me somewhat disappointed.  Interesting though Doc is, and pleasing as it is to see another side of him as he falls in love with school ma'am Clara, our hero throughout the series has been Marty.  We have rooted from him from the very beginning and Doc's romance does not hold quite the same appeal.  Consequently, I am not a fan of the introduction of the Clara character.  It's difficult to explain but I felt like Marty does in that she is forever getting in the way, a barrier to his and Doc's preparations to return home.  She is not a dislikable character but in a way I ended up resenting the amount of influence she is has over Doc and hence the storyline.  Not enough goes on in the middle of the film when, with no relatives' lives to put right, Marty is a spare part for too long.The pace is deliberately slower than Part II &#150; which was breathless throughout &#150; but the film meanders, only getting out of second gear when the time travel sequences are involved.  That's not to say it's without its merits.  Doc and Marty's friendship is explored in greater depth and to good effect.  Marty's refusal to rise to the bait of another nefarious Hill Valley Tannen, Buford &#145;Mad Dog' this time, shows a belated maturity &#150; sticks and stones and all that.  He later changes the course of his own destiny (the result of which was an unhappy and newly unemployed 47-year-old Marty in Part II), which demonstrated admirable character development.  The denouement displays some of the inventiveness lacking throughout the rest of the movie as an exploding steam train propels the DeLorean towards 88mph.  It's a gripping last half hour, the pace having been noticeably upped for the better as the time machine careers towards a ravine, with Doc choosing to save the meddlesome Clara over a return to the future with his mulletted protégé.  Upon returning to 1985, the DeLorean is destroyed by an oncoming freight locomotive, something which I was not altogether happy about.  It was such a sad moment given that the time machine had been one of the central characters throughout the whole trilogy.  Its destruction would be akin to that of the Millennium Falcon going down irreparably in Return of the Jedi &#150; not at all a fitting end for a fine piece of kit.  And the final act where a married Doc returns with pearls of wisdom, two sons and a time travelling, flying steam train is preposterous and wholly unnecessary.  Sure, let us know what happens to him but one senses that by having the train take to the skies a la the DeLorean at the end of Part I, Zemeckis was attempting to add a symmetry to the trilogy that was not needed, or at least not in that manner.  It was a silly ending and the whole the future is unwritten and it's what ever you make of it flies in the face of the first 40 minutes of Part II which was all about altering &#145;future history'.  What exactly was the point of them doing something about Marty's kids when the future, according to Doc, remains a mystery?Nevertheless, the trilogy had to be rounded off somehow and it wasn't the worst ending the filmmakers could have conceived.  It does, however, leave a slightly bad taste in the mouth which is a great shame considering what, in the previous two films, had gone before.  Back to the Future Part III as a stand alone film might well have cut the mustard.  The love element and the old West feelgood factor might be enough to win over those after a pleasant afternoon's viewing.  Throw in the spectacular ending and you've not got a bad film at all.  But it suffers by comparison to the high standard of what has gone before, not least the exemplary Part I.  Back to the Future is among the best films of all time so following it was never going to be easy.

","genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi, Western"},{"date":"22 October 2002","score":"","review":"  Back to the Future Part III is a difficult film for me to review.  On the one hand, I am far from enamoured by it, but on the other it's the final act in the otherwise excellent time travel trilogy.  First off, it must be stated that this entry is the weakest of the three.  Many Future fans will disagree with me, citing Part II as the weak link.  What they overlook is that Part II has no grand finale like Parts I and III and inevitably suffers because of it.  Nothing is tied up, loose ends remain, questions go unanswered and confusion reigns &#150; so it requires the last chapter to put the world of Marty McFly to rights.  But Part II offers greater all-round entertainment, its darker tone offset by some exhilarating action and futuristic special effects.Part III is, to all intents and purposes, a love story with a formulaic Western theme.  It is more like the 1985 original in style, with much of the film taking place in one setting, with only two bouts of time travel, culminating in a rousing finale.  Unlike Part I, however, this film is lacking the extra ingredient to push it out of the pretty good and into the great.  Robert Zemeckis' direction focuses this film on Doc for the first time and perhaps it is this shift in emphasis that left me somewhat disappointed.  Interesting though Doc is, and pleasing as it is to see another side of him as he falls in love with school ma'am Clara, our hero throughout the series has been Marty.  We have rooted from him from the very beginning and Doc's romance does not hold quite the same appeal.  Consequently, I am not a fan of the introduction of the Clara character.  It's difficult to explain but I felt like Marty does in that she is forever getting in the way, a barrier to his and Doc's preparations to return home.  She is not a dislikable character but in a way I ended up resenting the amount of influence she is has over Doc and hence the storyline.  Not enough goes on in the middle of the film when, with no relatives' lives to put right, Marty is a spare part for too long.The pace is deliberately slower than Part II &#150; which was breathless throughout &#150; but the film meanders, only getting out of second gear when the time travel sequences are involved.  That's not to say it's without its merits.  Doc and Marty's friendship is explored in greater depth and to good effect.  Marty's refusal to rise to the bait of another nefarious Hill Valley Tannen, Buford &#145;Mad Dog' this time, shows a belated maturity &#150; sticks and stones and all that.  He later changes the course of his own destiny (the result of which was an unhappy and newly unemployed 47-year-old Marty in Part II), which demonstrated admirable character development.  The denouement displays some of the inventiveness lacking throughout the rest of the movie as an exploding steam train propels the DeLorean towards 88mph.  It's a gripping last half hour, the pace having been noticeably upped for the better as the time machine careers towards a ravine, with Doc choosing to save the meddlesome Clara over a return to the future with his mulletted protégé.  Upon returning to 1985, the DeLorean is destroyed by an oncoming freight locomotive, something which I was not altogether happy about.  It was such a sad moment given that the time machine had been one of the central characters throughout the whole trilogy.  Its destruction would be akin to that of the Millennium Falcon going down irreparably in Return of the Jedi &#150; not at all a fitting end for a fine piece of kit.  And the final act where a married Doc returns with pearls of wisdom, two sons and a time travelling, flying steam train is preposterous and wholly unnecessary.  Sure, let us know what happens to him but one senses that by having the train take to the skies a la the DeLorean at the end of Part I, Zemeckis was attempting to add a symmetry to the trilogy that was not needed, or at least not in that manner.  It was a silly ending and the whole the future is unwritten and it's what ever you make of it flies in the face of the first 40 minutes of Part II which was all about altering &#145;future history'.  What exactly was the point of them doing something about Marty's kids when the future, according to Doc, remains a mystery?Nevertheless, the trilogy had to be rounded off somehow and it wasn't the worst ending the filmmakers could have conceived.  It does, however, leave a slightly bad taste in the mouth which is a great shame considering what, in the previous two films, had gone before.  Back to the Future Part III as a stand alone film might well have cut the mustard.  The love element and the old West feelgood factor might be enough to win over those after a pleasant afternoon's viewing.  Throw in the spectacular ending and you've not got a bad film at all.  But it suffers by comparison to the high standard of what has gone before, not least the exemplary Part I.  Back to the Future is among the best films of all time so following it was never going to be easy.  Part II was sufficiently bright, breezy and imaginative to keep fans of the first film happy, without ever hitting the heights of the original.  Part III though has neither the happy-go-lucky charm of the first film nor the high-octane thrills and spills of its sequel.  For fans of the trilogy, it is a solid enough way to wave goodbye to Doc and Marty.  It has the in-jokes, the music and the blink-and-you'll-miss-them touches that let you know you're watching a Back to the Future film.  But it's by far the worst of the bunch and that I'm afraid will be its damning legacy.

The United States was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession, while Japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom. Manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the US economy, and factory workers were a good example of the average American. The word downsizing hadn't entered the general vocabulary yet, but everyone knew the phenomenon. Bruce could be heard on the radio singing, Foreman says these jobs are going, boy, and they ain't coming back to your hometown. Chrysler had just been bailed out by Uncle Sam. Bumper stickers could be seen saying Buy American -- the job you save may be your own.Gung Ho does a better job of capturing the mood of the American industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period. Certainly the movie has its flaws -- some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe. But the story really is about the meeting of East and West Keaton's Hunt Stevenson personifies America, brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath. Watanabe's Kazuhiro personifies Japan, on top of the heap with a successful system, but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals. The movie's plot, flawed as it is, simply provides a framework for the conflict, and eventually synthesis, of their two personalities.Keaton's acting overshadows everyone else's, and practically makes the movie by itself. I've always admired Keaton for his ability to deliver  lines that feel improvised, no matter what script he's following. His character, Hunt Stevenson, is a likable, affable everyman, a natural leader with a wise-ass streak. But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us he doesn't want to disappoint anyone. He'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes, and even lie, rather than point out the ugly truth.Kazuhiro is the mirror image of Stevenson shy and introspective, but also, because of his Japanese upbringing, reluctant to be the bearer of bad news. The scene in which Stevenson first comes to Kazuhiro with the employees' grievances captures perfectly the Japanese approach to workplace conflict. Kazuhiro replies to Stevenson's complaints with I understand what you are saying, but won't refuse his requests out loud. Stevenson misinterprets this as agreement, and goes away saying, Okay, we've got that settled. (This is still a problem in Japanese-American business relations in the 21st century!)Ultimately, Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem get the factory working smoothly, meet production goals, and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them. In working towards this goal, they each have to take a page from the others' book. Kazuhiro's family becoming more Americanized is an obvious example. Also note that Stevenson thinks it's odd when Kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them -- and yet, later in the movie, Stevenson does exactly that himself.The plot and its resolution are a little cornball, but hey, this is a comedy. If you can overlook the movie's flaws, there is a great story about self-realization and open-mindedness here.

Certainly the movie has its flaws -- some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe. But the story really is about the meeting of East and West Keaton's Hunt Stevenson personifies America, brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath. Watanabe's Kazuhiro personifies Japan, on top of the heap with a successful system, but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals. The movie's plot, flawed as it is, simply provides a framework for the conflict, and eventually synthesis, of their two personalities.Keaton's acting overshadows everyone else's, and practically makes the movie by itself. I've always admired Keaton for his ability to deliver  lines that feel improvised, no matter what script he's following. His character, Hunt Stevenson, is a likable, affable everyman, a natural leader with a wise-ass streak. But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us he doesn't want to disappoint anyone. He'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes, and even lie, rather than point out the ugly truth.Kazuhiro is the mirror image of Stevenson shy and introspective, but also, because of his Japanese upbringing, reluctant to be the bearer of bad news. The scene in which Stevenson first comes to Kazuhiro with the employees' grievances captures perfectly the Japanese approach to workplace conflict.

There's a little bit of all his best visions and ideas throughout, so its almost a retrospective. But mostly I see Eraserhead done with an unlimited budget and a maturity of thought. The movie is long, 2 1\/2 hours, but the pace builds, keeps you involved and progressively interested. Something his recent films have just failed to do.  I have to laugh at the people who wrote negative comments, and would bet they are the same Martians who loved an infantile headache like Moulin Rouge. I've often wondered how Hitchcock or David Lean would have shot material considered unsuitable in their day. Lets just say Lynch does the girl on girl thing pretty damn well.
