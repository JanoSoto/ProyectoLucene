Or, we must return to the reliable decades of the seventies, eighties, and nineties when horror was huge. Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th was an unintentional genre-classic, that was intended as nothing more than a cash-in on the recent craze of John Carpenter's revolutionary Halloween and the Italian horror craze of the 1970's, started by Lucio Fulci.The story is simplicity in itself; we focus on a group of spry, young camp counselors spending their summer working at Camp Crystal Lake. The counselors are Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Jack (Kevin Bacon), Brenda (Laurie Bartram) and Ned (Mark Nelson), but the names do not matter to most audience members. It's the frightening way these innocent people get killed off that does.And I must say, having not seen this film in x number of years, some sequence and kills still have the impact they had upon initial viewing. With my larger knowledge on the world of horror at this point in time, as well, it has become apparent how much the film borrows from Italian horror films, specifically Lucio Fulci's Zombie and Dario Argento's Suspiria. The cinematography is placed in front of everything else, and the blood is brightly colored and incredibly stylistic. Also stylistic are the shots of the camp's wooded environment, which appear to be in their rawest possible form. Between cracking branches, brushing leaves, and every step an unsteady, everything is strong and realistic here.The film's use of darkness and suspense is surprising clear and well-focused. It's not so dark, where everything is obscure and indefinable, and it isn't so light that the intensity of the film is derailed. It is perfectly photographed through a clear, versatile lens that is easy on the eyes and pleasantly original at the same time.Friday the 13th, I must reiterate, is an unintentional classic. A film that was meant to be a shameless cash grab, but resulted in ten sequels, one reboot, a line of merchandise, and a cult phenomenon like few horror films have seen before. Cunningham's camera-work is incredibly fluent and absorbing, the suspense is jolting, and the cinematography, along with the haunting atmosphere, is nothing shy of gripping and fascinatingly raw. It's one of the better horror films of the eighties; the rare case where a cheap copy actually became an overwhelmingly unpredicted success.Starring Adrienne King, Harry Crosby, Laurie Bartram, Mark Nelson, Jeannine Taylor, Robbi Morgan, Kevin Bacon, Ari Lehman, and Betsy Palmer.

The story makes virtually no sense, the logic that drives the key components of the plot ranges from flimsy to asinine, vital characters get killed off without anyone seeming to notice that they're gone for the rest of the film, and the ineptness of Haddonfield's law enforcement is presented to us via send in the clowns circus music that inexplicably chimes in when they're on camera.A brief exposition reveals how Michael Myers survived being riddled with buckshot at the end of the previous flick he was nursed back to health by a man who lives in a shack by the river, and The Shape was apparently somehow able to reside with this clueless samaritan for a full year without being discovered or arousing any suspicion from his house-mate. Danielle Harris reprises her role as Michael's traumatized niece Jamie, but while she was a delightfully spunky young heroine in Halloween 4, she's given very little to do here besides shriek and have seizures. After repeatedly stabbing her step-mom with a pair of scissors at the conclusion of part 4 (a savage act which all of the returning cast members are evidently totally cool with) Jamie has been remanded to a children's psychiatric care facility, where she's in the hands of brilliant and capable doctors who see no problem with requiring a young girl who was stalked and nearly murdered by a deranged killer on Halloween night to participate in a festive holiday costume pageant a mere year later.The impending anniversary sparks Michael back into action, and he embarks on a mission to wipe out everyone who survived his last killing spree, and several more people who are simply around to be slaughtered (including a dude with a serious Fonzie fixation). Meanwhile, Jamie's psychic link with her uncle allows her to see his nefarious deeds while they're taking place, and she sets out to stop his reign of terror (strangely, the impetus for Jamie's intervention is the peril of her stepsister's friend Tina; Jamie's actual stepsister is the first to die, and not only does this fail to spur Jamie on, neither she nor anyone else in the film even mention Rachel again until the very end of this wretched tale).The action is driven by the requisite stabbings and slicings you'll be expecting, but the death scenes are so dully telegraphed that they have very little impact. When the film-makers attempt to integrate suspenseful elements, the results are generally pretty lame, such as the sequence where Michael uses the Fonzie wannabe's car to pick up Tina, who obtusely thinks our lovable killer is her boyfriend wearing a mask. The Shape, having his would-be victim in his clutches and at his mercy, maximizes her vulnerability the way any sensible murderous psychopath would he stops at a liquor store so she can go in and buy cigarettes, which allows her to get out of the car and promptly be rescued by the police. That same automobile also plays a pivotal role in perhaps the silliest scene in the film, in which Michael chases Jamie down ostensibly intending to run her over, but is somehow unable to get the souped-up muscle car going fast enough to match the speed of a panic-stricken nine year-old girl on foot.One of the saddest aspects of Halloween 5 is how it renders Dr. Loomis a hysterical old coot who desperately needs to be put out to pasture. The Doc's climactic master-plan involves using Jamie as bait to lure Michael back to the abandoned Myers house, at which point Loomis essentially waves off a virtual army of policemen and SWAT troopers to face his nemesis all by himself. Worse, his ploy to finish Michael off involves soothingly counseling him and entreating him to let Jamie make the rage go away. After hearing Loomis expound about Michael being the essence of pure evil and inhumanity for more than 10 years, this pop psychology tactic plays out as a resoundingly foolhardy approach.However, the most grievous crime against the series committed here arrives during the final exchange between Jamie and The Shape, which results in a close-up shot of a tear running down Michael's cheek. So essentially, according to Halloween 5, the emotionless embodiment of murderous fury we've previously seen mow down a few dozen people in cold blood is actually a sensitive monster whose heart melts when someone calls him Uncle. The coda features the true purpose of the Man In Black coming to light when the enigmatic figure uses a machine gun to single-handedly slaughter a building full of cops and busts Michael out of jail. This cliff-hanger guaranteed another sequel would be forthcoming, but considering how awful this one was, that attempt at enticement resonates more like a threat than a promise.If you're a fan of the series, any movie featuring Michael Myers is bound to offer at least a modicum of entertainment, and this entry certainly has a few moments that will keep you from ejecting the disc. But as a whole, Revenge is an absolute train-wreck. Halloween 5 may not be the worst movie ever made, but considering the unabashed disrespect it demonstrates toward the series that preceded it, it very well may be the most disappointing.
