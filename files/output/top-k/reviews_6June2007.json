Why is the lake the first shot? Eventually the scenes change to the sleepy suburban area off the coast of Lake Michigan in Lake Forest, Illinois. The town is very reminiscent of small communities in New England, with the beautiful golden leaves of Fall layering the roads and the gardens. Finally the camera rests upon a high school choir singing a transcribed rendition of Pachabel's Canon. The camera pans the many high school students contributing their sound to the musical collective. This will be a story about a certain high school student among these singers. Finally the camera rests on Conrad Jarrett played by Timothy Hutton. He is an ordinary person of high school age, or is he? In the next shot, he is jumping from sleep in a cold sweat as if from a nightmare. Something is amiss...Next we meet his parents, Beth Jarrett, played by Mary Tyler Moore in not only the role of her career but a tour De force Oscar-caliber performance, and her husband, Calvin Jarrett, played by Donald Sutherland in probably his finest performance. At first they seem to be a contented happy middle-aged couple on the upper-crust of society. They go on many vacations during the holidays, they have the finest clothes, they go to expensive restaurants and plays, and they hop-nob with the social elite of the community. Calvin is a tax attorney making very good money, enough to afford his stay-at-home wife who keeps their house neat and orderly akin to Martha Stewart. When she's not placing expensive napkins on the dinner table, she is either shopping or playing golf. All seems well. Or is it? Their only son, Conrad, is having trouble sleeping and eating. He's aloof with his friends at school, sometimes not looking at them when they are talking to him. And his mother acts, well, strangely toward him--not quite a healthy and nurturing mother-son relationship. As the story gradually unfolds we gather pieces about this family and find that not everything is as it seems. One of the most brilliant aspects of this film is its pacing. Pieces of back-story are brought gradually to the forefront. Each piece of the larger mosaic, one that is much greater than the time-frame of the actual story, comes to light only with great effort. There is a sense that the characters are purposefully engaged in hiding the larger back-story away like skeletons in the closet. When Conrad undertakes to see the psychiatrist Dr Berger, he claims that family, school, aka everything is fine to which Berger replies Then why are you here? The two things we begin to gradually understand is that Conrad was not the only son but he had an older brother now deceased. We also learn that Conrad had been in the hospital because of an attempted suicide. But these raise more questions than they answer. For one thing, with all this back story, why does the story take place at this time and place? Why did Conrad attempt suicide? How did his brother die? The answers lie somewhere within the waters of Lake Michigan...This story may not only be about what happens to its characters, and the crises they ultimately must face. On one level, the story is a commentary on the false perception of ordinary or normal people. Particularly in America, we often have a false perception of the norm. People raise families, bare children, see them off to college, etc, etc. With these larger generalities we often miss the struggles, the disappointments, the trauma, and even the tragedy that many experience, but often regarded as not happening to normal or ordinary people. Ironically, the character of Beth wants to give off the false but nice veneer of normalcy. At one point, she rages at Calvin for revealing at a social event that their son has started to see a psychiatrist. Beth sees friends at shopping malls and at parties, but she could not bare to have any of her fellow socialites know about any of the things that are really going on. And even when she is confronted by her husband to deal with their issues, she wants to go on vacation rather than the face the realities around her.In many ways, Ordinary People is about secrets. The upper-crust of American society has a tendency to keep things shut within large 2-story houses with manicured lawns in front. Many have felt that if they revealed their dark secrets they would be judged as being abnormal by their peers. In many ways, the tragic message is that many others have these same problems and secrets, but they do not understand that revealing them to others could help the healing process. Ordinary people are not ordinary people, in other words, but we do not yet know this. A philosophical book once said, There are no such things as ordinary moments.

But I was appalled at this adaptation. Not only is the acting wooden, and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book, but the theme is all wrong. The real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one, as Sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child, even when she herself is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses, which cheapens Sara's actions considerably, and seems more like it should be written on a Hallmark card than applied to this story.There are many other things wrong with this movie- too many to list, but here are just a few of the larger ones This story should be set in Britian in the mid 1800s, not America during the first world war. Miss Minchen is harsh to Sara from the start, making her actions when Sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning, as she is supposed to be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father does *not* come back, he is dead. It is his closest friend, and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds Sara, and restores her to her proper place. In fact, the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, though they are the source of Sara's wealth.All through everything that Sara has faced, she always acts like a Princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia a snotty two faced bully. Such a thing is completely out of character for her, and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what.This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that I have ever seen (with the notable exceptions of Ella Enchanted, and Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story)The plot of the book is wonderful, and skillfully written, so I do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version, which is far superior. Or better still, read the book. It will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie.

However, he had also given himself a rather large black mark in the form of an attempt to be cool with a horror-comedy where violence has no visible consequences, and everyone speaks like a reject from a teen soap opera. Individuals singing Raimi's praises will have you believe such was the best thing Raimi had done at the time. Unfortunately, what it really was was Raimi demonstrating that he had run out of ideas that he could call his own, and was now getting his repertoire fed to him by the most disingenuous money-men of the industry. In spite of a heroic attempt a few years later to return to the style of creating characters with The Gift, The Quick And The Dead can be labelled the moment where Sam Raimi, the innovative new voice behind The Evil Dead or Darkman, was gone forever.While it is all but taken as read that a Sam Raimi film will be a hamfest with more clichés than a film-making class nowadays, nobody was quite prepared for how he displayed the fact in The Quick And The Dead. They say that when you put together a film in which the characters are the story, you best have good actors behind them. Unfortunately, with the exceptions of Russell Crowe, Lance Henriksen, and Gene Hackman, every actor in this film comes off as being utterly terrible. Even Lance, who by this time had the making of great characters out of terrible scripts down to an art, comes off as a complete non-entity here. Hence, I have no hesitation at all in placing a share of the blame upon writer Simon Moore. For all of his faults, Raimi at least knows how to salvage a character in the editing process. And when your cast includes the men who played Bishop or Lex Luthor, it is hard to blame the problem on the actors. Henriksen's performance, however, will get the more ignorant placing the blame on the cast.Sharon Stone makes that an easy mistake to make, unfortunately. From the second she enters the town set, she makes it abundantly clear that she has seen one too many Sergio Leone films and thought I can do that. And to be fair, for those who have not seen The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly or Once Upon A Time In The West, Stone appears to be doing a good job. Compounding the problem, however, is that neither writer nor director seem to have any idea which scenes they should not be stealing from. The final moment when Harmonica's flashback is completed in Once Upon A Time In The West is such a gob-smacker in its original form that smart directors know not to try and ape because it was more than just a means to an end. It was literally the final word. Unfortunately, Raimi tries to one-up Leone's signature scene in a flashback where Hackman forces Stacy Linn Ramsower as the young Ellen to shoot her father dead. Not only is the tone of the scene entirely off, the total absence of any proper lead-up completely undercuts the drama of the sequence.Equally terrible is Leonardo DiCaprio as Fee, or The Kid as he is called during the film. DiCaprio has finally proved in such pieces as Blood Diamond or The Departed that he can act, but after The Quick And The Dead, anyone could be forgiven for thinking DiCaprio came straight from a high school drama. During the entire film, The Kid is only a whiny brat who starts to bawl when things do not entirely go his way. When he meets his end, the scene is so perfunctory, so devoid of weight, that while Hackman lends some much-needed credibility with his totally unmoved reactions, Stone destroys the whole thing with some incredible overacting. It is not entirely DiCaprio's or even Stone's fault, as the script gives them absolutely no development or buildup for this moment. DiCaprio is clearly in over his head playing a character that the writer and director apparently could not give two figs about. The sad thing is that with all the weight Stone was throwing around on the set, it would have done wonders if she had recognised this problem and addressed it.This partly leads me to believe others may be right when they say that The Quick And The Dead needed another hour of footage (or script) in order to accomplish its goals. With more time and development in the early stages, the constant parade of characters both minor and major could have had some impact. Unfortunately, with very few exceptions, and minor ones at that, the deaths in The Quick And The Dead are merely a parade of images. Perhaps The Quick And The Uninteresting would have been a more appropriate title. And when one remembers that this film was put together by the same man who gave us such a haunting, creepy atmosphere in The Evil Dead, or such a horrifyingly real tragic hero in Darkman, it makes The Quick And The Dead such a bitter pill to swallow. Not that we honestly could have expected much more. The Western as a genre has been thoroughly tapped out, and it would take a truly incredible film to give it new life. The kind of film that The Quick And The Dead is not.The Quick And The Dead is a four out of ten film. I have seen plenty of films that are worse, but in light of what its director used to be capable of, I have seen very few that are so incredibly frustrating.

Alien creates a dense atmosphere of paranoia, claustrophobia and sheer terror. Aliens was a fantastic continuation of the story, adding a great adrenaline rush as well as an amazing character study. After watching these two masterpieces, I was a bit uneasy about watching Alien3, mainly because of the low scores it had received. I gave it a spin anyway, and was sorely disappointed.The film is much darker than the previous ones, and opens with most of the larger roles of Aliens being killed in a crash. All right, it might still work. Ripley is held on a prison planet where the inmates have found religion. Odd, but all right. An Alien survived the crash and is now loose in the prison. Ah, the plot thickens! In the prison, there are quite a few interesting personalities, such as the insane Golic (Withnail & I actor Paul McGann) and Dillon, the spiritual leader of the inmates. The most interesting one is the doctor of the place, Clemens. We get a glimpse of his story and his life, but he is eaten by what has become a grotesque hybrid between the world's worst killer machine and a vicious chihuahua before his story reaches a conclusion.And this is the problem with the film. The most interesting characters are killed off at the beginning, Ripley just wanders around, trying to stay alive, without any real motive. In Alien, the crew wanted to get home. In Aliens, Ripley wanted to protect Newt. In Alien3, she just doesn't want to die. Sure, the whole Alien Queen thing was interesting, but it wasn't enough for the character, and so I think it ended on a sour note.The inmates are the worst, however. Where Ripley just lacks depth, these attempt to preserve a hard-boiled street style, throwing foul language and punches around meaninglessly. The whole religion-thing just seems tacked on and is largely forgotten by the end of the film (which was, by the way, far from satisfactory).And the Alien itself is just horrible as well. I like the idea of it changing with every film, but here it more resembles a dog than it does the fearsome killer we saw in the previous films. Come on, this is Alien, not Cujo! The terror of the first film is completely forgotten here, and we're supposed to be entertained by an adrenaline rush. I certainly wasn't.Alien Resurrection wasn't a good film. But at least it had a proper ending, and decent characters. Alien3 was just a misfire, and I don't think of it as canon in the Alien storyline. David Fincher is a fantastic director, and he has created some absolute masterpieces. But Alien3 isn't one of them. It could have been great, there were many interesting elements, but overall, it should never have happened. 6\/10 is being extremely generous.

I yet hear bits of it in TV exercise-for-ladies episodes--another bit that will persist--one 'killer' soundtrack--So if you want historic and accurate action, high romance, and you have not seen it?

And its romantic elements. Did you notice how Uncas clearly 'falls' for the Brit Alice, who after seeing Magua (Wes Studi) graphically kill him, chooses to leap to her death, than accept being Magua's woman--real 'reincarnation' study. As for things mentioned (doors in wrong places, scene to scene), there are numerous other small editing errors, but i've noted a lot depends on which format, VHS, DVD, you're watching. There's absolutely no explanation, at the end (much weaker on the VHS), why Russel Means declares himself 'The Last of the Anything.'?

Amazed John uses his knowledge of the future to save his father's life from a fire he is supposed to die in, at first Frank has a hard time believing it but does indeed end up surviving the fire that was supposed to kill him. At first everything seems great & John has a whole new set of memories of his father but strangely none of his mother, it turns out that they somehow changed history to the extent where John's mother & Frank's wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) has been murdered by a brutal serial killer known as the Nightingale. Both John & Frank are determined to stop it from happening & catch a killer in the process...Co-produced & directed by Gregory Hoblit this is an OK sci-fi drama that isn't really my type of film. The script by co-producer Toby Emmerich takes a while to get going & begins like some horrible Disney style sentimental drama which is just the sort of thing to send me to sleep but then it it takes a different direction & turns into a murder mystery as John uses his knowledge of the past to help his father track down the Nightingale serial killer, it's quite a neat idea actually & if not for the overly sentimental drama & slow pace this might have been a great film. To be honest many people out there still might think it is a great film as I could see people of a certain age enjoying this but anyone who likes a bit of bang & excitement in their films is going to have a hard time sticking the whole 2 hour running time out as it can be a little dull on occasions. The character's are good & well fleshed out, there is a decent enough story here & I thought it was watchable without being outstanding. One more question, why didn't Frank put a few nice little bets on the outcome of the baseball games John was telling him about? Or maybe even John could have given Frank some lottery numbers so they could get rich, you know what I mean? I'm sure I would have.Director Hoblit does alright, it's quite a measured & somewhat sedate film. It looks nice enough but there's not much style here although there is a good opening sequence involving a crashed petrol tanker & a spectacular explosion. There's not much of a mystery element as the Nightingale killer is revealed fairly early on, it's not scary or exciting either, it's just all very average & middle of the road really.With a supposed budget of about $31,000,000 I'm surprised a film such as Frequency had so much money lavished on it, I could have told anyone it was going to flop. Anyway, it has that big budget Hollywood polish about it & it's well made with good production values. The acting is pretty good as well.Frequency is an OK time waster, it may be slightly over sentimental & a tad slow for some but there's a decent enough story here.

Only 2 years after The Jazz Singer was released, sound films (talkies) became the dominant format in cinema, and slowly the silent era reached its end and with it the careers of those who couldn't make the transition. Of course, sound faced harsh opposition from many prominent artists of silent movies like directors Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin, who felt that sound diminished the art of cinema instead of elevating it. Soon, both directors would find themselves forced to get with the times and make the transition, but Chaplin wouldn't quit without a last laugh. 1936's silent movie Modern Times would be Chaplin's sweet farewell to his beloved silent era, and with it, to his most famous character the Tramp.Modern Times is the story of a factory worker (Chaplin as the Tramp), who works at an assembly line in an enormous industrial facility. The constant overworking begins to take its toll in him and suffers a mental breakdown that sends him to the hospital. After his recovery, he discovers that he is no longer an employee, as the workers are on a strike, and are now marching towards the factory. By a weird series of circumstances, the Tramp is arrested after being confused with a Communist leader, and sent to jail where he spends literally the best time of his life. After being released for good behavior, he finds himself again jobless and on a very difficult condition, so he plans to return to jail as soon as possible; however, his plans will change after he meets an orphan girl gamine (Paulette Goddard), who is living in a harshest condition than his.As usual, Modern Times was not only a movie directed by Chaplin, but also written and produced by himself; and once again he returns to his familiar mix of drama and comedy that he had been perfect over the years with monumental classics like The Gold Rush and City Lights. This time however, Chaplin takes a more politically charged approach and fills his comedy with his ideas about the harsh life of factory workers, dehumanization, and the Great Depression. While this often unsubtle use of comedy as an outlet for his ideologies could had been damaging for the story in other writer's hands, Chaplin creates a joyfully optimist and very humanist plot that helps to make easier to enjoy and understand the overtly political tone of the film. The story is written in an episodic form, but it flows with nicely thanks to its nonstop series of excellent gags that keep the fun coming.Visually, the movie is probably Chaplin's greatest artistic achievement, as he extends the themes of his screenplay to the overall look of the film. With a clever use of montage (obviously inspired by Soviet filmmakers) and several nods to German expressionism, Chaplin brings to life his vision of society slowly transforming into a industrialized monster where there is hardly any place for love and happiness. The excellent art direction by Charles D. Hall and J. Russell Spencer is an essential piece for this and it's definitely a highlight of the film, as it truly makes Modern Times feel modern. While for the most part Chaplin manages to keep a good balance between the drama and the comedy of the film, he can't help but fall on excessive sentimentalism, making the film feel a bit too preachy at times.The main cast, as in every Chaplin movie, is remarkable in their performances, and each one of them truly add a lot of their personalities to their roles. As his most famous character, the Tramp, Chaplin here is pure gold and as always, he fills the screen with his charming presence and enormous comedic talent. His body control shines in several scenes of slapstick comedy that are nowadays classics, and he also shows off his total domain of pantomime as he easily transmits the audience that joyful optimism that has become the Tramp's trademark. As the Tramp's counterpart, Paulette Goddard is simply beautiful, displaying a natural charm and freshness that makes her character the Tramp's best sidekick since Jackie Coogan in The Kid.While this movie was supposed to be Chaplin's first talkie, he quickly dismissed the idea as he considered that his Tramp character worked better without speaking; so with this in mind the legendary comedian decided to transform Modern Times into a hybrid a talkie in the silent era style, where every sound in the film is audible except the human voice. In fact, the only spoken voices that become audible are the ones that come out of machines (radio for example), keeping in touch with the script's themes of humanity trapped by the modern industrial nightmare. This could also be seen as Chaplin making fun of talkies, as while technically he shot a movie with sound, he faithfully followed classic conventions of the silent era like title cards and specially, the pantomime style of acting.Modern Times is without a doubt one of Chaplin's best films, and one of the most interesting comedies of all time. While it kind of lacks that naiveté that made The Gold Rush such an amazing experience, it offers a new and more sophisticated style of comedy. As the last movie of the silent era and the Tramp's final on-screen apparition, Modern Times is a timeless classic that even today helps us to remind that despite the advent of the modernization, there's still place for happiness, as in the Tramp's words, Buck up - never say die, We'll get along. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2007","score":"","review":" The arrival of sound to films in 1927 (in the movie The Jazz Singer) was definitely a major turning point in history of cinema, and one that would have enormous consequences in the motion picture industry of those years.

After being released for good behavior, he finds himself again jobless and on a very difficult condition, so he plans to return to jail as soon as possible; however, his plans will change after he meets an orphan girl gamine (Paulette Goddard), who is living in a harshest condition than his.As usual, Modern Times was not only a movie directed by Chaplin, but also written and produced by himself; and once again he returns to his familiar mix of drama and comedy that he had been perfect over the years with monumental classics like The Gold Rush and City Lights. This time however, Chaplin takes a more politically charged approach and fills his comedy with his ideas about the harsh life of factory workers, dehumanization, and the Great Depression. While this often unsubtle use of comedy as an outlet for his ideologies could had been damaging for the story in other writer's hands, Chaplin creates a joyfully optimist and very humanist plot that helps to make easier to enjoy and understand the overtly political tone of the film. The story is written in an episodic form, but it flows with nicely thanks to its nonstop series of excellent gags that keep the fun coming.Visually, the movie is probably Chaplin's greatest artistic achievement, as he extends the themes of his screenplay to the overall look of the film. With a clever use of montage (obviously inspired by Soviet filmmakers) and several nods to German expressionism, Chaplin brings to life his vision of society slowly transforming into a industrialized monster where there is hardly any place for love and happiness. The excellent art direction by Charles D. Hall and J. Russell Spencer is an essential piece for this and it's definitely a highlight of the film, as it truly makes Modern Times feel modern. While for the most part Chaplin manages to keep a good balance between the drama and the comedy of the film, he can't help but fall on excessive sentimentalism, making the film feel a bit too preachy at times.The main cast, as in every Chaplin movie, is remarkable in their performances, and each one of them truly add a lot of their personalities to their roles. As his most famous character, the Tramp, Chaplin here is pure gold and as always, he fills the screen with his charming presence and enormous comedic talent. His body control shines in several scenes of slapstick comedy that are nowadays classics, and he also shows off his total domain of pantomime as he easily transmits the audience that joyful optimism that has become the Tramp's trademark. As the Tramp's counterpart, Paulette Goddard is simply beautiful, displaying a natural charm and freshness that makes her character the Tramp's best sidekick since Jackie Coogan in The Kid.While this movie was supposed to be Chaplin's first talkie, he quickly dismissed the idea as he considered that his Tramp character worked better without speaking; so with this in mind the legendary comedian decided to transform Modern Times into a hybrid a talkie in the silent era style, where every sound in the film is audible except the human voice. In fact, the only spoken voices that become audible are the ones that come out of machines (radio for example), keeping in touch with the script's themes of humanity trapped by the modern industrial nightmare. This could also be seen as Chaplin making fun of talkies, as while technically he shot a movie with sound, he faithfully followed classic conventions of the silent era like title cards and specially, the pantomime style of acting.Modern Times is without a doubt one of Chaplin's best films, and one of the most interesting comedies of all time. While it kind of lacks that naiveté that made The Gold Rush such an amazing experience, it offers a new and more sophisticated style of comedy. As the last movie of the silent era and the Tramp's final on-screen apparition, Modern Times is a timeless classic that even today helps us to remind that despite the advent of the modernization, there's still place for happiness, as in the Tramp's words, Buck up - never say die, We'll get along. 9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"6 June 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is one of the most inspirational movies I have ever seen.

Most jokes from the original Beavis and Butthead series came from sexual references and jokes and while the film has plenty of these this is not where all the comedy comes from. A lot of smart humor is also present which I did not notice as a young teen when I first saw this.

Mariah Carey is the most under-rated actress! When her boyfriend died I was in tears! The emotion behind her acting was raw and real. I don't know how so many people hated it. Come on guys! don't hate Mariah for her acting, Congratulate! Not only is she an awesome actress but her singing is superb! This movie contains both which made it a real treat.

Even comparing it to the other sci-fi classic of that year, Planet of the Apes, it feels decades ahead in its visuals, its story, and its style. While Apes is fantastic, it feels like a film of the '60s, with the cheesy effects, melodramatic acting, and obvious use of soundstages. It is very much a film of its time. This one, on the other hand, could just have easily been made today. The panoramic shots of massive spaceships are breathtaking, almost a decade before Star Wars accomplished the same thing, and the amazingly accurate future inventions shown in this film reveal Kubrick's incredible vision. Undoubtedly one of the best science fiction films of all-time, and certainly a major influence upon the genre for years to come.It's certainly not an overtly entertaining or enjoyable film to watch - the long stretches without dialogue and the exceptional patience with which each scene is granted make the audience feel every one of its two and a half hours. It obviously doesn't appeal to everyone. For someone who is in awe of the care present in each scene, though, it's a breeze to sit through. The fact that the film is bookended by twenty minute-long segments of dialogue-free film doesn't bother me at all, as the images and visuals are so strong and so interesting that it makes no difference to me at all if there's dialogue or not. Plus, the dialogue that is present in the film is so purposefully inane and harmless that one is forced to focus on the visuals. Almost the entire story is presented through images; I think there's only one speech directly related to the plot.The first time I watched it, my favourite act was the third one, with HAL. That was probably due to the fact that it contained the most dialogue, had the most plot, and had that creepy robot with the eloquent speech. I thought everything else in the movie was unneeded and just dragged it down - especially that psychedelic ending. Now, I can appreciate the contribution that each act makes to the whole; how the entire story is told throughout the film. I haven't yet read the novel, but I'm interested to see just how similar it is, because this story really is quite incredible. And, though I still don't understand the ending, I can appreciate just how brilliant it is. I think I don't understand it (wholly) because we're not meant to; our first contact with extra-terrestrial will not be as linear and straight-forward as Hollywood makes it out to be, and this film reflects that.The acting is good, the dialogue is fine, and the sets are kinda dated, but this film is all about the images. From the iconic shot of the ape throwing the bone that morphs into a spaceship, to the classic appearance of HAL, to Dave's final journey to the alien intelligence, it is the visuals of this film, much more than the script, that tell the story. And, though it's nearly forty years old, it's not nearly as dated as every other film from its era. That, in itself, is an incredible accomplishment. The fact that this is a terrific film is even more amazing.
