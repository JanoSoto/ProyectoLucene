Fans of the divine Ms. Aniston will be head-over-heels for this film, watching the leggy knock-out parade around in a serious of provocative and hermetically-sealed outfits.  But guess what &#150; for as hot as Aniston is, life just ain't picture perfect!  The independent lil' lady can't advance up the corporate ladder because she's unattached and has no liabilities, meaning she has no responsibilities, meaning she could leave the firm at the drop of a dime.  On top of everything else, Kate, tired of dating an endless stream of losers, falls for bad-boy co-worker Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon), who unfortunately only dates `unavailable' woman and finds Kate `too nice.'Her colleague Darcy O'Neal (Illeana Douglas) invents a fictional fiancee for Kate based on a silly, random photo taken with a Bostonian named Nick (Jerry McGuire's Jay Mohr) at a wedding the week before.  She's only met him once, as he was videotaping the wedding.   Frustrated with everything, Kate reluctantly goes along with the harebrained scheme and gets her promotion, as well as her man, for the previously unavailable Sam is suddenly attracted to the now officially-unavailable Kate.When controlling factors force Kate into generating her fiancee, she hunts Nick down and hires him for one evening to pose as her beloved.  He agrees, and the two create a past history for their relationship, as well as a convenient break-up that will take place during a business dinner with her boss. The catch?  Nick falls in love with Kate, Kate unknowingly falls in love with Nick, and Nick becomes uncomfortable with the whole facade.  We, the audience, are forced to root for Joe Ordinary (Mohr) over Joe Cool (Bacon), knowing that his hapless, hayseed schtick is probably three yawns too tired for a city-slicker like Aniston's character.  I didn't think she should date either of them!  Still, contrived and all, it's a pretty good flick, and Aniston is always compelling as an actress (and not just as an object to ogle), mind the one scene where I fell completely out of sympathy with her for being such a crass bitch!

Obviously a lot younger in this role, she is girlishly attractive with enchanting baby-blue eyes and a killer build. Seeing her here, I wondered why she didn't launch a more substantial career (her acting never quite came to fruition, and she's known more for her relationship with Steven Spielberg, which netted her a cool $100 million, than her starring roles). Though the overblown Brian DePalma directs the piece, it isn't very engaging, despite its astronomical five and a half million dollar budget. In fact, it's actually a more toned-down version of David Cronenberg's later Scanners (1981), which was a lot more thought-provoking and entertaining. Still, The Fury is definitely entrenched in the '70s - it's half government conspiracy (like Marathon Man and the Domino Principle) and half supernatural creepy-horror (like The Exorcist, The Manitou, The Sentinel. even Shadow of the Hawk). The fundamental plot, which certainly has its problems, circles around Andrew Stevens, who I've never liked in any role, and Irving - two teens empowered with psychic powers and telekinesis.  Or so you'd think, though the film begins as a story about Kirk Douglas trying to find his kidnapped son.  Only later does The Fury evolve into a story about the plight of the two psychics, specifically Irving.  And there's actually one point in the film where you forgot about Douglas altogether (though one of the best scenes of the film revolved around his character and a woman named Mother Knuckles -- what a great name -- played by Eleanor Merriam!). So, what I like least about the movie is its splintered storyline.  Some terrorist-run shadow institute for psychic research snatches the two psychically-enhanced kids to use as. super-weapons, intelligence spies, short-order cooks?   Viewers never quite get to the bottom of the `secret' agency's intentions, though the mysterious agency certainly turns the fun-loving Stevens into an egomaniacal asshole!  When the two storylines do finally converge (spoiler coming be forwarned) -- if you're still awake thanks to the sluggish pacing -- you get the pay-off of a man being blown apart by Irving's mental prowess (which was done later in Scanners).  Oh, and there's a slight undertow in the story that delves into the old Star-Bellied Sneetch routine of being scrutinized for being different, but it never really surfaces.

The man practically came out of nowhere and suddenly he's written and directed two of the most memorable movies of the past two years. First THE SIXTH SENSE (8\/10), which blew everyone away with its ending and its unbelievable box-office success, and now this movie, whose trailer is easily the best teaser for any movie that I've seen over the past year. It's mysterious, it's intriguing and it makes you want to see the movie. Excellent! And with that in mind, I will be writing this review knowing full well that nobody wants any of the film ruined for them, so I assure you that I will not be including any spoilers about the movie's plot in this critique. I just love a good mystery and sure wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone else.PLOT Set in Philadelphia, this film stars two diametrically opposed men. One man is black and has a disease which makes his bones very easy to break. The other man is white and seems to be unbreakable. He is the only survivor of a train wreck and can't seem to figure out why. The first man helps the second man come to some kind of understanding about his situation.CRITIQUE M. Night Shyamalan continues to impress. Here's yet another original creation of his that manages to successfully slap together a unique mystery, interesting characters, real life situations to which we could all relate and a touch of the paranormal. I love this guy! I hope he keeps it up because more movies like this is what we need. Of course, much like any other great film, this one is not for everybody. The film does have quite the slow pace, might come off as repetitive to some people and also manages to parallel THE SIXTH SENSE in various ways. But for me, I was hooked-lined-and-sinkered from its first two scenes, which much like the film's teaser trailer, just made me sit up and say, What's up with that? Intriguing...now tell me more. The sequences in question basically set up the foundation of the two main characters in this film, and let me tell you, they grabbed me and that was that. I couldn't wait to find out why they were the way that they were, and what it all meant. But Shyamalan draws the film out slowly. He already seems to have developed a great eye for the camera, setting up angles just right, enough to give us a taste of the scene, but not the whole bite. There are also little hints dropped here and there, red herrings and a Hitchcockian score providing just enough background to allow for a gradual development of the richer points in the script. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan also seems to be finding himself a small part in his own films. Here, he shows up as a suspicious drug dealer at a sports stadium.But don't expect a horror with this film. That's not what it is. It's not a thriller either. No major thrill scenes in this movie. In fact, it isn't until the last twenty minutes that the film's leisurely pace is disturbed by some invigorating energy. I would consider this picture to be more like a good ol' fashioned mystery a la Twilight Zone. Set in an ordinary environment with believable characters, this film manages to creep us out with elements which just don't seem to make sense in our reality. Of course, much like any other good story, this film would not be a complete success unless we connected to the characters on the screen, and in this movie, I did. In fact, we could all relate to what Bruce's character is essentially going through. He doesn't understand his place in the world. He is confused. He is not sure why he is what he is. What is his destiny? We've all felt like him at some point or another in our lives and you learn to recognize that in his character early on.Bruce downplayed his character as much as he did the one in THE SIXTH SENSE (almost seemed like the same guy but in a different circumstance), while Sam Jackson was surprisingly restrained as the bizarre dude with the love of comic books. And as for the ending...don't worry I won't be giving anything away here, but suffice it to say that unlike THE SIXTH SENSE, a movie which I believed was taken to another level with that slap-in-your-face conclusion, this film's finish felt much more like a Hmmmmm, yeah okay, that makes sense kind of thing. Of course, some might scoff at the ending, but that all depends on whether or not you were into the film as it moved along. It certainly didn't make or break the movie for me, and I doubt it will blow anyone else away either. This film is not about the ending necessarily. It is about the journey, a journey that is deliberately unhurried, melancholic and intriguing. My guess is that anyone who was greatly interested in this film by its teaser, will more than likely be impressed with this film's brilliant manner of storytelling. It looks like Shyamalan is here to stay. Of course, once the movie is over, and this seems to be developing into a very cool Shyamalan tradition, you will undoubtedly feel the need to discuss the film with others. It's engaging, it's mysterious, perhaps even unbelievable to the more cynical in our society, but ultimately the film is an excellent demonstration of what a great director, a solid script, a deeper, meaningful message and well crafted characters can bring to a theatrical presentation as such. For me, the film worked on various levels and I hope that many others like it just as much. That's it and I hope I didn't spoil anything for you...that's half the fun!

Of course, much like any other good story, this film would not be a complete success unless we connected to the characters on the screen, and in this movie, I did. In fact, we could all relate to what Bruce's character is essentially going through. He doesn't understand his place in the world. He is confused. He is not sure why he is what he is. What is his destiny? We've all felt like him at some point or another in our lives and you learn to recognize that in his character early on.Bruce downplayed his character as much as he did the one in THE SIXTH SENSE (almost seemed like the same guy but in a different circumstance), while Sam Jackson was surprisingly restrained as the bizarre dude with the love of comic books. And as for the ending...don't worry I won't be giving anything away here, but suffice it to say that unlike THE SIXTH SENSE, a movie which I believed was taken to another level with that slap-in-your-face conclusion, this film's finish felt much more like a Hmmmmm, yeah okay, that makes sense kind of thing. Of course, some might scoff at the ending, but that all depends on whether or not you were into the film as it moved along. It certainly didn't make or break the movie for me, and I doubt it will blow anyone else away either. This film is not about the ending necessarily. It is about the journey, a journey that is deliberately unhurried, melancholic and intriguing. My guess is that anyone who was greatly interested in this film by its teaser, will more than likely be impressed with this film's brilliant manner of storytelling. It looks like Shyamalan is here to stay. Of course, once the movie is over, and this seems to be developing into a very cool Shyamalan tradition, you will undoubtedly feel the need to discuss the film with others. It's engaging, it's mysterious, perhaps even unbelievable to the more cynical in our society, but ultimately the film is an excellent demonstration of what a great director, a solid script, a deeper, meaningful message and well crafted characters can bring to a theatrical presentation as such. For me, the film worked on various levels and I hope that many others like it just as much. That's it and I hope I didn't spoil anything for you...that's half the fun!

And Phoebe Cates (Mrs Kevin Cline now), water sprinkling over her, made her famous 13-second topless appearance at 5220 into the film (but who's counting?), and in slow motion it lasts quite a bit longer, her 18-year-old breast gently swaying as she reaches out to mythically hug her admirer who is really in the bathroom jerking off.  Then at 5858 into the film, Jennifer Jason Leigh for 12 seconds in a nude reclining pose on a couch, her 19-year-old breasts and soft, rounded figure looking classically Greek. Beautiful filming.

What I got was something else.The story Firefighter loses family in terrorist attack, goes on revenge mission to Columbia to find and kill terrorist. Sounds pretty dumb to me - and, let's face it, a lot of aspects of the movie are incredibly dumb. (Mostly those parts of the movie concerned with Arnie getting to Columbia, travelling through Columbia and getting into the rebel camp)But, and here's the catch, some are not. What starts out a simple movie with linear plot evolves slowly. After the rage comes a period of reflection. There are twists and turns in the plot, and the first half is full of time-filling minutes spent getting to know yet-another-comedic sidekick, who will disappear entirely from the movie within minutes (couldn't they have stuck with one sidekick? Or not bothered at all?), but then, as the plot turns around, the audience is suddenly faced with an interesting moment (which is later ruined by cheesy dialogue). Well, this being an action movie, the smart bits can last only so long, and then it all goes to pieces in a desperate attempt to have a traditional climactic good vs bad battle. So the end is a big let-down.Still, the movie IS entertaining (apart from a few minutes of boredom and confusion in the Columbia part) and, surprisingly, well-acted. Arnie is no character actor, and the mess he made of End of Days was embarrassing. Sixth Day brought some more flexing of acting muscles, and I actually liked his performance in that movie. Collateral Damage takes all he learnt and puts it to the test. He will never manage a Bruce-Willis alike 6th Sense \/ Unbreakable career turnaround, but he acted his role well, and was convincing. Mostly, at least. The support cast, filled with aforementioned comedic sidekicks, a CIA agent, a FBI agent and the terrorist and a Columbian woman - all do their jobs well. I kept wondering where I'd seen Cliff Curtis before, until I looked it up on IMDB - he was the charismatic leader of the Iraqi resistance in Three Kings. Here, he manages to dominate the screen just as well and once again is a show-stealer. Definitely the most memorable character of the movie.So, we have good acting, good entertainment, stupid action, a stupid end and some reasonably intelligent bit somewhere along the way. The body count is high, but surprisingly, Arnold does not actually kill many people (you can count his victims on the fingers of one hand). There is a gruesome scene involving a snake, which is basically pointless, but that did not reduce my enjoyment of the movie. All in all, a good movie to watch.

Tobey McGuire is just perfect as Peter Parker, there's an innocence to him, an unassuming quality that he brings to the role, much like his roles in Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules, both movies of which I love.Then there's Kirsten Dunst, as the attractive red-headed Mary Jane. I thought she did an adequite job of the part, providing the 'heroine in distress' number for Spiderman to rescue, and an 'unreachable' number for Peter to gawk at and fawn over.Oh, and then there's William Dafoe, good ol' Dafoe...

But here, in Spideyworld, I felt he plays the part well.Ok, now, what I liked about the film was it did manage a pure comicbook fantasy and for that, it remains an entertaining piece of the new marvel crop of their comicbook revolution that began with Blade and X-Men, but, there's also some problems with the direction they chose. Namely, I've seen this story before, not just in the comicbooks, no, but in the last animated series of Spiderman of the 90s. This means very little was actually new, just a retelling, or a remake, if you will. It's not just that, but how closely it comes to it, it just feels like I've already been here before, with a few variances. I mean, it can be, in a sense, good or bad. The Green Goblin's story is much the same as it was in the animated series as well, though more spread out over the season. This is a live action version, which I enjoyed, but I would have personally rather had something more original and maybe dealt with the origin in a short flashback sequence.Now, my other minor problems came with the design for the Goblin's mask, which is fine when he's flying around, but up close, was hard at first to get used to. Course, once I did, then everything was fine. On the other side of the coin, however, the Spidey suit was excellent in every regard; perfect, for lack of a better word. It doesn't look ridiculously like a man in tights, it actually looks like a cool suit of a comicbook hero and the way it blends in with the CGI varient was pretty nice.Everything is well laid out for the most part, but another issue I'd like to mention is Green Goblin's lack of direction in the 2nd half. After he got what he wanted, his motivations didn't seem as thought out. I think another minor plotline inbred within the story that could have lasted the whole of the movie and giving him more of a purpose at the end besides just making Parker miserable, would have helped the movie as a whole feel more complete.Now, to wrap up... I can't wait to see the sequel, now that the ground work has been laid out, let's see something really cool in the next one. Lots of potential here.

There are other movies that have masterfully portrayed the negative effects of greed and materialism (The Little Foxes and Greed come to mind), but here the contrasts set up amongst the characters do not merely describe and condemn greed, but also offer a way out.The three main characters are very nicely defined and are also well acted.  Walter Huston is just right as the eccentric but wise older prospector, who takes both success and disaster in stride.  Huston gets some fine scenes that establish his character and his perspective, and even his occasional over-the-top moments fit in well with his character.  Next, the role of Fred C. Dobbs, whose better nature is gradually eroded by his greed and selfishness, is hardly one of Humphrey Bogart's more likable characters, but it's one of his finest performances.  Bogart's dry, no-nonsense approach works perfectly in the role, and his style does a much better job of bringing out what is really inside negative characters like Dobbs than does the pretentious emoting that is so overused now in such roles.  Finally, Tim Holt plays the youngest of the three prospectors, and while he has much less of a presence than the other two, that is how it should be, for his character reflects the choice that must be made between the attitudes offered by the other two.The story of their search for fortune, with all the hopes, successes, and crises that come their way, is not only a fine backdrop that reveals what is inside the characters, but is also interesting and sometimes exciting in its own right.

So what if he `finds himself' at the end by hugging Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) &#150; he's still a presumptuous and brazen maniac with severe psychological problems (and a societal mutineer that's half humanitarian, half dipsomaniac).

Eventually, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau (Breaking the Waves' Stellan Skarsgard), who saves him from a jail sentence, and he is introduced to McGuire.  Now, Robin Williams is one of my all-time favorites, but I didn't like him at all in this film &#150; he plays the role far too cutesy.  I didn't particularly believe his struggle, his stories or his fleeting tough-guy flash.  He just seemed over-emotional and gooey, downplaying his high-strung energy.

On the other hand, Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and tries to help him, is both absorbing and playful (just as she was in Grosse Point Blank).So I have some objections with the film, but it's still, for the most part, a smart, involving story with good characterization.

On the other hand, Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and tries to help him, is both absorbing and playful (just as she was in Grosse Point Blank).So I have some objections with the film, but it's still, for the most part, a smart, involving story with good characterization. It's got individual flashes of brilliance within an otherwise predictable story.  Apparently, Damon and Affleck wrote the movie years ago, and finally got to see the project made &#150; good for them!  In their defense, the two spin a great underlying theme about the working class, and how straightforward (and thus, romantic) it is to be an unassuming bricklayer.  Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) says it best when he tells Hunting, `You're sitting on a winning lottery ticket -- it would be an insult to us if you're still around here in 20 years.'  I just didn't experience the essential resolution I was, perhaps, supposed to feel by the final frame.

Occasional moments of brilliance shine through him haphazardly, but out of apathy, he just can't move forward.Fellini creates an autobiographical series of encounters between Guido and his ego, his false bravado, his failure as a human being (not an artist), and his inner demons.  As a result, Guido's past dredges up zealous parents, Catholic hypocrisy, and his attraction to the opposite sex, which begins at an early age with a stout prostitute named Saraghina who lives by the beach (the Catholic priests refer to her as `The Devil,' of course) and blossoms into full-blown public infidelity.   His intellectual, estranged wife seeks a separation, knowledgeable of his betrayal and his impish personality, yet, it matters little to him what he truly loses or gains, as there is little rhyme or reason to his social behavior.  He drifts on effortlessly like Querry, the lead character in Graham Greene's novel, A Burnt Out Case.  Alienated from his own emotions, Guido treads water in a sea of limbo (though it is clear that he loves his wife on some level that she cannot understand) and fails himself with creative paralysis.  `Accept me as I am,' he tries to say to his wife, `Only then can we discover each other.'  Words of wisdom? I feel sympathy for Felini flawed creation because it's so damn accurate!  Guido is an artist trapped by his own prospects, trying to deal with the aftertaste of an unanticipated success that has given him the freedom to experiment.  As all his jaunts into sovereignty catch up with him and spiral out of control, he questions the new perception he's skated into, astonished that no one really accepts him for who he is.  And so he resorts to deception -- fabricating different identities and feigned self-assurance for the reception of others -- while desperately trying to be true to his chaotic, unwitting spirit.  Strangely, he never really pins the blame on religion or parenting, just shows how they helped develop what was already there.

But nothing offers him escape from the demands of others &#150; from the superficiality that he has grown accustomed to -- because no one ever really wants the miserable truth.

This has to be one of the weakest films to have won the Best Picture Oscar (what about A Clockwork Orange? Flawed yes, but better than this) and this also includes one of the weakest performances ever to win the Best Actor Oscar (Peter Finch was robbed).I'm a great admirer of Gene Hackman (one of the best actors of his generation) so its ironic that his most famous role winning him the biggest award of his career is, in my opinion, his worst performance. He's miscast, director William Friedkin didn't want him and rightly so. Many people say that Hackman was supposedly the sixth choice to play the role in actual fact he was the ONLY choice and Friedkin took him because he would have otherwise lost the film.I have a higher opinion of this film than when I first saw it five years ago on an old and battered tape that had no subtitles so the dialogue scenes between the French characters drove me crazy. I didn't realise until the second time I saw it that the film DID have subtitles and some pillock decided to remove them...One thing I would like to point that I don't think anyone else has (which amazes me) is the incredibly irritating end to the film. We are taken straight from the action at the drug deal site to a series of stills stating what happened to these fictional characters as though it were fact.Not only is this a major narrative cop out but you simply can not deal with fictional characters in this way even if they are based on real life people. There is no drug dealer called Alain Charnier (nicely played by Fernando Rey) so how can he be believed to be living in France? HE DOESN'T EXIST!!!!!Its the sort of ending that makes you want to bang your head against a wall in disbelief (well I do at least) and the ending to the sequel (which makes the original look like a masterpiece) has the same abrupt ending but is even worse but thats another story...I suppose in fairness that Hackman should deserve some credit for being able to keep a straight face whilst uttering the appalling line 'You took off your shoes, put your fingers between your toes and picked your feet, NOW DIDN'T YA??!!?'

Flawed yes, but better than this) and this also includes one of the weakest performances ever to win the Best Actor Oscar (Peter Finch was robbed).I'm a great admirer of Gene Hackman (one of the best actors of his generation) so its ironic that his most famous role winning him the biggest award of his career is, in my opinion, his worst performance. He's miscast, director William Friedkin didn't want him and rightly so. Many people say that Hackman was supposedly the sixth choice to play the role in actual fact he was the ONLY choice and Friedkin took him because he would have otherwise lost the film.I have a higher opinion of this film than when I first saw it five years ago on an old and battered tape that had no subtitles so the dialogue scenes between the French characters drove me crazy. I didn't realise until the second time I saw it that the film DID have subtitles and some pillock decided to remove them...One thing I would like to point that I don't think anyone else has (which amazes me) is the incredibly irritating end to the film. We are taken straight from the action at the drug deal site to a series of stills stating what happened to these fictional characters as though it were fact.Not only is this a major narrative cop out but you simply can not deal with fictional characters in this way even if they are based on real life people. There is no drug dealer called Alain Charnier (nicely played by Fernando Rey) so how can he be believed to be living in France? HE DOESN'T EXIST!!!!!Its the sort of ending that makes you want to bang your head against a wall in disbelief (well I do at least) and the ending to the sequel (which makes the original look like a masterpiece) has the same abrupt ending but is even worse but thats another story...I suppose in fairness that Hackman should deserve some credit for being able to keep a straight face whilst uttering the appalling line 'You took off your shoes, put your fingers between your toes and picked your feet, NOW DIDN'T YA??!!?'
