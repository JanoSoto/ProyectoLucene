[{"date":"5 August 1999","score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  My only real complaint with this film is that, much like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, there is too little time for all the characters in this film.  Fast Times was based on a book, so I assume the characters got flushed out more in it.That being said, this movie was decent.  It was very reminiscent of high school in many ways; Seth Green's character in particular was a prototype for many people I went to school with.  The only thing that really is not consistent with my own experience, and it is the same with virtually all teen comedies, is the popularity thing.  I went to three different junior highs (Grades 8-10) and a senior high (11-12), and there was never a single popular group, never mind a most popular couple.  In Grade 12, for example, there were three massive groups- one was the drama group, another was the slacker group, and the last was the Indo-Canadian group (which, for anyone who doesn't know, is made up of the people whose families are originally from India or Fiji, not Aboriginal peoples).  All three groups hated each other and in the case of the first two (since the third was not really a popular group but rather the majority of Indo-Canadians in the school) really seemed to believe that they were popular.  In actual fact, those of us not in either of the groups didn't give a sh*t.  At the Grad dance, I did not even know who either the king or queen was.  There were 700 Grade 12s, and no one knew everyone.  So I am unsure whether the popularity pyramid represented in movies is an accurate picture of most people's experience or not.  My boyfriend's school had a popular crowd, but his school had only slightly more students but divided into 5 grades instead of two, making only about 300 grads, most of which a person had gone to school with for 5 years and not 2.  In this film, I believe Melissa Joan Hart says there are 500 and something grads, so everyone did not know everyone else.  Is it realistic in such cases to have two people admired by the entire school? I have no clue. About the only teen movie I can think of where there isn't this one little clique at the top is Fast Times, but that movie doesn't deal with extreme popularity or unpopularity.Still, even having gone to schools without much of a hierarchical structure, there were still enough small hierarchies to understand the popularity issues in this movie and empathise with the nerdy William or the superficially-worshipped Amanda.  I also thought that it was very realistic (and equally as realistically frustrating) that Mike Dexter realised the error of his ways only to continue acting like that; I've witnessed that story before many times.  And I certainly can appreciate this movie's demonstration of the superficiality of high school.  Thank God I got away from that and moved onto the superficiality of university.All in all, this was a decent movie, but it needed either to reduce the number of characters or to increase its length in order to truly be a really good movie.  Still, it is certainly equal to some of the better teen films of the 1980s.

I didn't like Titanic at all, but I am obviously in the minority in my feelings. If you don't like a film that is your perogative and it is what makes this country great. However, having read the reviews on this site I have come to the conclusion that most people who hated this movie really do sound stupid while trying to explain why the film is so bad.Firstly, if you didn't like this film and you want to put your comments down, please do not start your summary off with  The only thing scary about Blair is the price of admission, or the even wittier  Scary as hell!!!!!!

It is for your own good.Secondly, if you have read anything about this film, ANYTHING AT ALL, you will know it is not a classic horror film. There are no ghouls or goblins to jump out after you. Jason isn't going to get you out by the Lake house and Freddy isn't going to come for you in dreams. This is a story that is scary because it is REAL!!!!! You can't see what is in the woods, you can't see what is stalking the students because THEY can't see what is stalking them. So many negative reviews have involved comments like I kept waiting to see the witch or how could it be scary when you never see anything. One person even wrote, while commenting on how fake she believed the story was, that it made no sense for them to be screaming all the time. If I was caught in the woods, or in my backyard for that matter, with something coming after me, I would scream all the time to. Just another stupid comment.But what makes it very apparent to me that those who hated this movie are just not that bright is the fact that everyone who has loved this movie and written about it has talked about imagination. This film is about putting yourself right into the action, right with the characters, at all times. The bickering, the yelling and the screaming, are all things that, in a situation of that nature would actually happen. The day scenes, save for a few discoveries, showed the other side of terror and that was the mental breakdown of all these characters. They gave up hope, they gave up any idea of living through what was happening to them, and that comes across on screen. For those of us who were able to put ourselves in the shoes of Heather, Josh and Mike, that part of the movie was just as frightening as anything else. The night scenes are scary because you cannot see what is out there. The sounds and voices are freaky and make anyone who has ever been in a house alone at night and heard the pipes grumble a bit squirm in their seat. I DIDN'T want to see what was out there because then that would defeat the purpose of the whole movie. It would defeat the purpose of letting the audiences imaginations (those of us who have them) run wild for an hour and a half only to show them the witch, or whatever it was that was stalking the students, right at the end. Its greatness was in allowing for everyone to come away from the movie with a different interpretation of what happened.Many will assume that this review, or comment more correctly, is the spawn of a stuck up elitest who takes pride in liking something that is not main stream. Nothing could be further from the truth, as most of the time I despise ARTS movies. I like big action, big explosions. Hell, one of my favorite nights during the week is when TNT does their Movies for Guys who Like movies thing, but this movie to me is a no brainer. (or maybe a brainer, as it seems those who have them love the film) The Exorcist, Alien, The Shining, and many other great horror movies fit into the Blair category. They scare you more with what is not seen than what is seen. They build tension, never letting up until the end, so the audience goes away just as scared as they were sitting in their seats. Movies like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, the seemingly popular horror of today, put in their horror as almost an afterthought. There is no tension built, there is no breaking down of the characters, there is no squirming in seats, only gore and shock and jokes. That might be horror, but it is not GREAT horror, as Blair Witch is. Those of you with imagination, go and be scared, be very scared. Those of you who fall into the category of nothing happened in this movie, it sucked so bad, Freddy vs. Jason is in production and should be out next summer.

Personally, I wasn't impressed, and one kid in front of me got up after it was over and said it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be and all of his friends agreed. So be warned -- Your Mileage May Vary.I didn't find the characters sympathetic, and although believable, most of the time they were just plain annoying. If I had been with that group of people, I would've quietly slipped away and followed a river back to civilization and left them to wander around in circles and scream at each other like a bunch of idiots. The witch wants 'em? Great, she can keep 'em.However - the characters in this film are incidental to the overall concept, which is the real star of the show, and my central complaint. This isn't a great film - It's a great concept done in a mediocre way. Compare and contrast with, say, Silence of the Lambs, which took a mediocre concept - a cannibal serial killer meets an attractive female FBI agent - and made it into something great.

They tried to scare us without using a big bank roll, special effects, gore, monster costumes, puppets, guns, explosions, or gratuitous nudity, sex and violence. That alone is a novel idea. They used sticks and stones and sounds and darkness.

I had heard all the critics and everyone saying how bad it was in a porno way, but I was surprised, that it wasn't bad at all! I am only 14, and they said that absolutely no one under that age should see it, but I disagree. This is not as bad as every one would assume. I only found one fault with this movie. Towards the beginning, it flashes onto a couple separate scenes, which were kind of humerous looking to an extent, which really didn't belong in this movie. I found other humor in this movie to be enjoyable, it's just childish humor that makes you laugh because it looks funny just doesn't belong w\/ such a serious plot. Although, this movie was extremely well acted, and I was pleased to realize that Sarah Michelle Gellar can be other darker parts besides her regular Buffy character. Ryan Phillipe played a character that was different than any other I have witnessed. He was dark, mean and you should've hated him (At least the first half of the movie) but there was something about him that you just had to like.

As I moved throughout the large crowd (an unprecedented amount of people for the art house theater that I saw it at) to the lobby exit doors, I watched other people in the lobby with a suspicious anxiety and a slight clamped feeling within my chest. These emotions were a direct response to my Tuesday night at the movies.I came out of this film, feeling a deep dread and sorrow for these people, even though this incident didn't even actually occur. That's how compellingly realistic this film is. It's so realistic that you will swear, once you exit the theater, that you could find an article about it in an old newspaper from 5 years or something (**SPOILER The incident is supposed to take place around October 1994 **). Here's my overall view on The Blair Witch Project. ( NOTE From what I've read as I am a film major, the writer\/director team of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez wrote a general plot outline for the three main actors they hired and instructed them to improvise dialogue while encountering different locales that had been set up by Myrick and Sanchez. So, in a way, it's not clear who is exactly responsible for certain technical aspects of the film ).CAST The list of actors in this film includes extras who play town people being interviewed by the three main actors, played by Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard. This trio of actors are complete unknowns and I've never seen them before, but expect Hollywood to react to them in a big way. They are incredibly talented, especially Donahue, and their improvisational skills are top-notch. I thought I was seeing real students making a real documentary film. Donahue, in particular, is fantastic as she grows more and more frightened and bears the load of being (**SPOLIER**) the team leader (so to speak) and being the only woman out in the woods with these two guys.MUSIC (**SPOILER**) While there's no music within the film (at least not a score), there is a disturbingly simple and eerie bit of instrumental (I guess it's instrumental...?) that plays over the end credits. Kudos to Tony Cora.CINEMATOGRAPHY (**SPOILER**) While most of the film was shot with a 8mm color camcorder and a 16mm black-and-white camera (I assume those are both correct), the effect of switching back and forth from these two devices is haunting. Because of the limited focus and technical abilities of both of these camera types, you begin to feel more and more dread for what's lurking around the next tree, shrub, or bush. In addition, the matte lines (**SPOILER**) used to crop the image into the center of the projection screen create a realistic look for the type of cameras used. They also emulate a kind of restricted space for these characters to be roaming around in, even though they are wandering through a vast expanse of woods. You actually feel like they're trapped...with nowhere to go.EDITING This film feels like an actual documentary. You believe this is real and that it did indeed happen 5 years ago. That is due largely in part to the way it's edited. The various jumps from one shot of them shooting their actual project footage to shots of them just goofing off or having a conversation is an example.WRITING The story and plot is scary and frightening as hell. Even though it harkens back to the stories of witches and the banishment of them, such as was reported in Salem, the most powerful aspect of this film comes from its masterful technique and the way it was approached in its making.DIRECTING Again, I can't say who's exactly responsible for the directing, even though Myrick and Sanchez are credited for it. They didn't actually supervise the camera work or remain present at every moment (at least as far as I know). Still, their ultimate approach to filming their story with just an outline and improvisational actors is incredibly brilliant and will most likely spawn a number of copycats in the horror genre(i.e. Scream, Halloween).In closing, this is a film I will never forget. I always be reminded of it when I go hiking or camping anywhere. I always be reminded of it when I look out the window at the woods that permeate the area around my house.

It has been a long time since I have been so excited to see a film and boy did this one live up to my expectations.  In my review I would like to make several points about this film and the reactions of other people seeing the film.1.)  If you liked the string of teen slashers we have been forced to endure lately or you liked the remake of the Haunting, then please, do the people who enjoy good films a favor and do not see the film.  I have seen the movie twice and have been through two very different experiences.  The first time I saw was at a local art theaters, that is to say one of the 27 theaters that got the film on the 15th.  This was a great experience.  It was quiet throughout the WHOLE film and the atmosphere in the theater was that of enjoyment.  The people there knew what they wanted and this film delivered.  They basically felt as I did.  The second time I saw the film was at the local stadium theater after the wide release.  This was less than enjoyable. In front of me was a couple with a BABY! Behind me was a family of loud kids and and even louder parents.  They felt it their duty to inform people as to ALL the happenings on the screen and that the movie was boring.  At the end, one patron actually yelled out This movie f***ing sucks!  This was not an enjoyable experience.  I was angry at the people.  This is why I urge you not to go if you are not ready for an intelligent, psychological thriller with virtually no special effects.2.)  I urge everyone else to see this film.  If you want to be scared, see this film.  It reminds me of the first time I saw the Haunting(original). I was so scared because I had to imagine the monster.  I was left to ponder what was going on.  That was so frightening.  I have not been as scared in my life as I was after seeing the BWP.  This film is such a relief from the usually here is your cgi monster now be scared darnit flicks.Now I'm not saying all intelligent movie goers will enjoy the movie, but I do believe they will be able to see it for what it is, original.  A movie with NO script, NO name actors, and all real human experience.  That what this film captures.  The human experience, and films that do it as successfully as this film are true masterpieces and deserve a second look.

I mean, really, the whole tale seems like it could be carried by Eleanor Vance vs. the spirit world, if only they could come up with a more convincing way of getting her into the house.The character of Theo is a prime example. Catherine Zeta-Jones is gorgeous and provocative, but one can't help feeling that her sole function for being in the film is to look pretty and say outrageous things in a desperate attempt to shoehorn sex appeal into a plot that has no real room for it. In fact, the only part of her that is not shown off to good advantage is her acting skill, making it painfully obvious that her role is primarily decorative. But the sad part is... that alone makes her far more useful than most of the rest of the cast.Her scene, for example, with Liam Neeson, as Theo chastises the good Dr Marrow for his tarnished ethics and poor judgement in having put them all in this situation in the first place lacks the passion one would expect from someone who's got so much right to be angry at being made a lab rat, yet, it's just as well, as Neeson himself seems half asleep while she rants, and strikes me throughout the film as never really understanding his role.And as for Luke (Owen Wilson) --- oh, my. Has there ever been a character so utterly pointless for anything but getting himself killed by angry spirits? And the way the whole thing is put together and acted out leaves us unable to believe the whole death scene ever happened in the first place. I mean, what was that emotion supposed to be, anyway? Panic? Or just utter stupidity? If possible, this character and his portrayal are even more disfunctional than any of the others.I agree with other comments I've read, that Lili Taylor manages to pull off her role Eleanor with some degree of dignity, but even she has a hard time portraying the sense of encroaching madness one would expect under such stresses, though her role was the best one the film had to offer, and she does manage it with some degree of grace and skill.The technical effects in the film were very nice. I'm a fan of such things in general, although I was disappointed that easily four fifths of the best fx were already seen in the local TV ads, they were, in general, nicely supplemental to the incredible atmosphere created simply by the sets themselves. A house so elaborately designed as Hillhouse is portrayed would, in and of itself be an awesome effect, even without the techno trickery brought on by the plot. Regrettably, between the house and the special effects, I found myself leaving the theater wondering why the humans in this film got so much screen time.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is gorgeous and provocative, but one can't help feeling that her sole function for being in the film is to look pretty and say outrageous things in a desperate attempt to shoehorn sex appeal into a plot that has no real room for it. In fact, the only part of her that is not shown off to good advantage is her acting skill, making it painfully obvious that her role is primarily decorative. But the sad part is... that alone makes her far more useful than most of the rest of the cast.Her scene, for example, with Liam Neeson, as Theo chastises the good Dr Marrow for his tarnished ethics and poor judgement in having put them all in this situation in the first place lacks the passion one would expect from someone who's got so much right to be angry at being made a lab rat, yet, it's just as well, as Neeson himself seems half asleep while she rants, and strikes me throughout the film as never really understanding his role.And as for Luke (Owen Wilson) --- oh, my. Has there ever been a character so utterly pointless for anything but getting himself killed by angry spirits? And the way the whole thing is put together and acted out leaves us unable to believe the whole death scene ever happened in the first place. I mean, what was that emotion supposed to be, anyway? Panic? Or just utter stupidity? If possible, this character and his portrayal are even more disfunctional than any of the others.I agree with other comments I've read, that Lili Taylor manages to pull off her role Eleanor with some degree of dignity, but even she has a hard time portraying the sense of encroaching madness one would expect under such stresses, though her role was the best one the film had to offer, and she does manage it with some degree of grace and skill.The technical effects in the film were very nice. I'm a fan of such things in general, although I was disappointed that easily four fifths of the best fx were already seen in the local TV ads, they were, in general, nicely supplemental to the incredible atmosphere created simply by the sets themselves. A house so elaborately designed as Hillhouse is portrayed would, in and of itself be an awesome effect, even without the techno trickery brought on by the plot. Regrettably, between the house and the special effects, I found myself leaving the theater wondering why the humans in this film got so much screen time.
