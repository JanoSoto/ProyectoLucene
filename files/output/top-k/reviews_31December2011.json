Well... Let me tell you, I was extremely surprised and impressed! As I said, compared to all the REALLY AWFUL Horror films out there that are excruciating and badly made, and that is most of them, I was surprised that this one was made quite well. Okay, so a lot of the fans are sort of put off because it is really different from the other films. Fine... Isn't the POINT to try to come up with different angles and new approaches rather than just remaking the same film again and again...? I thought it was genuinely very creative and kept my attention very much so throughout the film. Sure, okay, it starts in space and your rolling your eyes, thinking Oh great,'LEPRECHAUN 3' ) well, it works; it really does. Obviously a LOT of thought was put into the timeline and the mythology of the box, etc., not to mention the follow through at the end. Sure, it wrapped it up rather quickly and left it kind of ambiguous, but so what?! Yes, of COURSE it doesn't have the intensity of the original or even the complexity of the next two films, but to me I was mainly impressed by their not only coming up with the new idea to show the origins, etc., but also I honestly felt that everything that made up the film was done very well considering that it is a damn 'HORROR' movie!  ) I gave it a good, strong '8' which it fully deserves considering the context and type of film. I think that people get SO jaded and expect SO dang much from sequels. I mean, C'mon, compared to what... 'WITCHBOARD' 1-9 or whatever the hell sequel they're at now, this here is pure art!Heh, if THIS one threw you, just wait until you see part 5! I just this minute finished watching that one for the very first time also a few minutes ago and that is a WILD departure from the early films. However, it was made even much better than this one; the director was actually very, very good!

I own it on DVD, and Blu-ray. I still own my old video copy of it. I am obsessed with Disney and Beauty and the Beast is my favorite animated Disney film and it is my favorite Disney film of all time. I have seen the stage version at Hollywood studios and I've seen the Broadway version. I love everything about the film except the villain Gaston. Gaston is one of the most vile villains ever to appear in a movie. He is one of the only Disney villains that I hate. I like the Beauty and the Beast was romantic, funny, full of adventure and drama and I think it is the saddest movie I have ever seen. I always cry at the end. Beauty and the Beast is the most romantic film ever made, it is my favorite musical of all time and one of my most favorite films. The Beast was mean and resentful at first but it was his fault that he was this way. He was miserable and wanted everyone else to be too. He turns out to be charming and funny, sweet and romantic. One of the best scenes is when he gives Belle his library. I love when Belle and the Beast dance to the title song. The battle between the Beast and Gaston was another great scene. I also love when Belle tends to his wounds after he saves her from the wolves. My favorite character is the Beast, but I also love Belle, Mrs. Potts, and Lumiere. I hate Gaston but his theme song is good and The Mob song is a well-written hate song. He only wanted to kill the Beast because he had a rival for Belle'a affections. At the end he completely deserved to die. My favorite songs are Beauty and the Beast, Be our Guest and Something there. Beauty and the Beast had an amazing cast. Robby Benson, Paige o'Hara, Richard White, Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Steirs, Tony Jay,and Bradley Pierce all did a wonderful job. I'v always loved Angela Lansbury mostly because of her being Mrs. Potts. I like Beast so much that I even like Beauty and the Beast 2-the enchanted Christmas. I may own the movie but I plan on seeing the 3d version. I could debate with anyone who does not love Beauty and the Beast. It is one of the greatest films I've ever seen and I think it is the best animated film I have ever seen or will ever see. On IMDb I give it ten stars but in reality I give it 170 stars.

It's partly the genre I suppose. I've just never been much into Westerns. Horses and gunfights and saloons have never been of much appeal. Beyond that, though, I simply didn't find the story here to be particularly interesting, nor did I find the movie to be as much fun as a lot of people think it is. I can't give a movie that I don't find interesting a particularly high rating or much of a positive endorsement. Having said all that, though, I do want to acknowledge that it's just my personal bias, and that there's a lot about this movie that I liked in spite of the fact that when it was all put together it didn't appeal to me that much. So, let me offer the positives.First I appreciated the honesty right off the top. There really was a Hole in the Wall Gang and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were real figures in the Old West as a part of it. The movie follows the basic outline of their life - early bank and train robberies, the escape to Bolivia and the relationship with Etta (Katharine Ross) are all based on reality. But the movie was honest. Instead of saying Based on actual events, I loved that the opening caption was Most of this is true - thus acknowledging dramatic licence in a way that most based on actual events movies don't do. I liked the pairing of Paul Newman (Butch) and Robert Redford (Sundance). They worked very well together and offered pretty good performances in the title roles. The movie did a good job of creating some tension as Butch and Sundance were being pursued by a mysterious posse. The question that kept being asked by Butch (Who are these guys anyway?) hung in the air quite well. There were a handful of amusing scenes - especially the train robberies involving Woodcock (George Furth) which I enjoyed. A sense of fun was also created by the use (only once, mind you) of the song Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head. In one sense, that song seems totally out of sync with the movie, but the scene in which it was used, in which Butch takes Etta for a ride on a bicycle, was a silly, fun scene, and a silly, fun song fit that scene, if not the overall feel of the movie, quite well.But for as much as I liked all that, what I have to keep coming back to is that I just didn't really find the movie to be all that interesting.

The grunts, the social whores, the mind numbing dinner guest who only talks about cars, the McDonald's employee who HASN'T got a college education... Nobody else could take this acting seriously.The special effects Wow, when this film came out the effects were amazing and even though it is void of any merit outside of the effects, they should be remembered for being very impressive. It's just a shame that there wasn't a single scene where these effects weren't rammed down your throat, making you choke on them. This could have been to distract the feeble-minded from the other points above.Well, there's my review, I loathe this film and I loathe even more the pseudo-intellectuals it created out of millions of complete and utter morons. How so many people can have so little to say and to say it so loudly is just staggering... I give it 3\/10.

Everything looks beautiful. Fincher has used specific things to make the movie more enjoyable, like overtones. (Now I wont say anything because it may spoil it) He has used many visual techniques to make this film more enjoyable, and in a sense, more pretty. 25\/25Film making The camera angles, the direction in this is just right, brilliant. He has everything timed out correctly, nothing out of sync, to make full effect of conversations and fight scenes. The choreography in the fight scenes are very realistic, the fight co-coordinator for the film watched many boxing matches and took martial arts lessons to get this right, and so it payed off really well. 25\/25Acting The Acting is one of the major parts about the film.

I think his early work had an imagination and timeless appeal that, frankly, his later films have utterly lacked. And the genius of Tim Burton's early work culminated in what I believe to be his true best film ED WOOD (1994). If Tim Burton were ever going to win an Oscar as Best Director for his early work, this should have been the film. And it also boasts what I think is the BEST performance of the iconic Johnny Depp's career. Depp was totally robbed of a Best Actor nomination (and had he been, HE would have been my pick for the award!).Also, ED WOOD was the BEST film of 1994! Not Forrest Gump (which won and is way too schmaltzy and sentimental for my taste)...Not Shawshank Redemption (which was nominated for Best Pic, but has way too high a rating here on IMDb! #1 of all time? Are you freakin kidding me?)....Not Pulp Fiction (also nominated for Best Pic, but has dated too much for my taste and isn't even Tarantino's best film IMHO!)...Nope, ED WOOD should have been nominated and WON Best Picture of 1994! ED WOOD is Burton's tribute to the titular filmmaker who is widely regarded as the worst of all time. And a brilliant tribute it is! Burton basically goes for the purely comic approach, with touches of pathos and reality checks thrown in for good measure. Depp's awesome, energetic, all-in performance drives the film. He stays in character for the entirety of the film and this is one of the funniest performances of any male lead in a comedy film.Martin Landau was absolutely brilliant and on-key as horror film icon Bela Lugosi. Landau totally deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Rarely do I think they get those awards right, but they sure did in this case. It's just a shame that Burton, Depp, and the film didn't get their due as well.In addition to Depp and Landau, the supporting cast is wonderful Sarah Jessica Parker as Ed's uptight first girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as Ed's true soulmate, Lisa Marie's uncanny Vampira impersonation, and the great Bill Murray as one of Ed's eccentric (was there any other kind with this man?) collaborators.Shot in black-and-white to give the film an old-school vibe and to mimic the era of film of Ed Wood's prime, the film plays like a parody of a parody. Certainly, the situations that Wood encountered didn't come across as THIS hysterical, but I think this is Burton's way of honoring the auteur, while still entertaining the general movie-going audience.Brilliant, funny film...Burton's best...Depp's best...One of THE best!

I wasn't the biggest fan of his ROCKnROLLA, and neither I was of his version of Sherlock Holmes. Hell, all the great interest I had towards Ritchie some years ago is all gone now. SHERLOCK HOLMES 2 for this New Year's Eve weekend? I'd rather watch the awesome THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN for the third time instead! So, I'm a fan of just the two first Ritchie films. I have seen SNATCH countless times, on VHS, DVD and now finally on Blu-Ray (I think the first time was back in 2003). Actually I watched it on Blu-Ray almost two weeks ago, when I wanted to share this great movie experience with my girlfriend and realized I just had it on the now completely obsolete (at least in my house) VHS format. I also realized it had been years since I watched it for the last time, so certainly it was the right time to bought it on Blu-Ray and watch it again. I was actually exciting to do it, and was not disappointed. It's still the movie I love.The quality of the Blu-Ray image ain't the best. It doesn't look as clear as some others, and maybe this is an indication that the movie won't age too well in terms of its style. But I don't really know, and the main thing here is that SNATCH is truly great stuff. As fast-paced as not many, Ritchie's second feature offers a performance that is as superb as underrated. I'm talking about Brad Pitt's one. Obviously Pitt is as acclaimed as he really deserves, and his bodywork, which even includes now a work with Terrence Malick, is something anyone will admire in the future. For me his performance in SNATCH, as a crazy as f*** gypsy, is one of his very best and one of the best things about this movie in general. I can't imagine myself recommending this movie without saying something about Pitt's awesome performance. The way he talks is the key thing certainly, and that talent was later reprised in his role in Tarantino's -Ritchie's rival director- 2009 masterpiece INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and in Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE. So, Pitt alone makes this one worth to watch. What happened to Jason Statham also? I mean, I was also a huge fan and even watched some minor movies (like CRANK, CHAOS and THE BANK JOB) just because of him. Damn, right now I don't even know by name the stuff he has been in recently. It happened the same as with Ritchie all of those movies with Statham are, if entertaining, completely forgettable, so my interest went away! I'm not even a real fan of his Transporter movies so I also stay with his two first ones. Here he ain't the action hero, but a fairly normal and clever boxing promoter dealing with all the dirt that surrounds the world of illegal sport. And he's name is just Turkish, so is all pretty darn cool. The great partnership he has with his friend Tommy is not the only one of the movie. We have from some of the worst and fattest -and most hilarious- criminals ever to some of the toughest and craziest!

Everything about this movie is perfect to be an rip roaring entertaining adventure with the perfect dash of romance. I don't mean to take anything from it but the fact remains it also doesn't bring anything to the table that makes it truly exceptional in my opinion. I suppose because its stood the test of time and features two legendary Hollywood icons that it understandably gets hyped up so much. It is worthy entertainment and a fun filled adventure with good performances!

A modern fairytale set in what appears to be 1950's American suburbia; everything about it is almost perfect. Everything from the music by Danny Elfman to the effects by Stan Winston is brilliantly done and works so well together. But I digress, here's a brief summary before I heap more praise on this wonderful film.When housewife, and Avon lady, Peg Boggs decides to visit the big ruined house on the hill, she comes back with more than she expected. There she finds a young man, Edward, who, for some inexplicable reason, has scissors for hands. We are told, in flashback, how this came to be; the inventor had made him that way but had sadly died before he could complete his work. Edward is soon the talk of the neighbourhood and when it is discovered that he can do brilliant topiary (hedge clipping) and even cut and style hair, he becomes a bit of a celebrity. He soon grows a fondness for Peg's daughter, Kim, who is going out with local rich kid, Jim. He's a bit of a bully and things are about to turn a bit nasty for Edward. I will leave my summary here or the Spoiler Police will send me back to that draughty house on the hill (again).I love the look and feel of this film; everything seems to fit in the world Burton has created perfectly. With no CGI I think the effects are really great, I'm still trying to figure out how some of it was done! Excellent performances all round and so honourable mentions go to; Johnny Depp as Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim, Dianne Wiest, who I think was really great as Peg, Anthony Michael Hall as Jim, Kathy Baker as Joyce, Alan Arkin as Bill and in one of his last roles, Vincent Price as The Inventor.There is a lot about this film to like, and much I have mentioned already. On the downside though, I did find the plot a little predictable in that there had to be a bad guy, a damsel in distress and a sacrifice. This is the only thing that lets it down. I really like this film and would love to give it a higher score, but I guess the studio had its say in the end.

The writing is well-done. The acting is great (despite the lackluster Liverpool accents), and it's packed full of music. Although a fun watch, it has some major flaws in terms of historical accuracy; not necessarily in terms of story (although there are a few), but particularly through the twisting of characters to help the story along. Such flaws reportedly were enough to make the real George Harrison walk out of the screening minutes into the film. I understand that for most people, it doesn't matter a whole lot, but if you're a die-hard Beatle freak looking for a historical account, this may not be for you. Allow me to explain... Forgive me. I'm about to geek out.1.) Important people and events from the time were not present in the movie at all, like Allan Williams, The Beatles' first manager who got them the Hamburg gig. Paul and Pete getting deported for arson is completely left out of the movie. 2.) Accounts of Lennon in Hamburg have presented him as quick-witted and good-natured, although vulgar and at times a troublemaker. Lennon is portrayed in the movie as an angry, crying, and confused person who can't control his emotions.3.) The movie portrays The Beatles as a tight, energetic, pitch-perfect band from the beginning. In reality, The Beatles were notorious around Liverpool as the worst band in town, with the worst equipment, and no stage presence. It was playing in Hamburg that made them the stomping, screaming, water-tight group they became, but their progression as a group is non-existent in the film. Also, the recording date with Tony Sheridan took place after Stu was no longer in the band. He actually attended the recording session to watch.4.) In the film, McCartney and Harrison take a sort of back seat, and are portrayed as outsiders, not able to understand the complex relationship of Lennon and Sutcliffe. This undermines the importance they had in the development and sound of The Beatles. Furthermore, although McCartney has stated that he felt he had to take a backseat to Sutcliffe, Lennon considered McCartney his musical partner, and had known him longer than Sutcliffe. It's unlikely that the friction between them was as great as shown in the film, especially considering that they agreed on Sutcliffe's sub-par playing to begin with.5.) In the movie, Astrid appears to live on her own. Actually, she lived with her mother and siblings, who took Stuart in as one of the family until he died. 5.) There is little to no support for the homosexual implications between Lennon and Sutcliffe. None of the other Beatles have ever mentioned such a thing, and Sutcliffe's own sister says the claim is probably false. Also, Lennon's crush on Astrid was another fabrication for the film. Tony Sheridan, fellow Hamburg performer and friend of the band at the time has since said that it was McCartney who was interested in Astrid, adding to the friction between he and Stu. Lastly, and most importantly, I think the viewer shouldn't over-estimate the value of Stu to The Beatles. I understand that since the movie revolves around him, he's going to be presented as a young genius, at odds with a selfish and fame-hungry McCartney, but that seems to me to be giving Sutcliffe a little too much credit. There's not enough focus on the fact that Stu could barely play bass at all. They show him as a guy who just makes mistakes sometimes, when really he could barely hold it together. It's been documented that every other Beatle, including Lennon, was never satisfied with his playing, and was often embarrassed by him. Stu Sutcliffe has been described by both McCartney and Harrison as just a school friend of Lennon's who never should have been in the band to begin with. To them, he was nothing more than that.Ultimately, he's a footnote on their page in history, and they viewed him as such. The issue with this movie is that it was billed as being about The Beatles when really it's about John and Stu's friendship. And it seems pretty obvious to me that there's a concerted effort to add gravity where there shouldn't really be any. If you want the real story of The Beatles without the Hollywood add-ins, I recommend The Beatles Anthology.

I was about six or seven at the time and didn't think much of it. I'm now 15 and watched it again several months ago. Wow. I sobbed. Landon Carter is one of the most complex characters I've ever seen.From the very beginning,when he tries to save Clay, we can see that he is not a bad guy. Even the principal sees this, when assigning his carefully- chosen punishment.Landon is a follower, he tries to be tough, he wants to be thought of as bad...but he is in no way a bad guy. Jamie puts it best when she says early in the film, You like school because you're popular and you know you'll never be on top again. He has so many layers. The scenes between him and his dad leave me a mess. The theme of faith and what it truly means to be a Christian is the one that chokes me up each and every time. A preacher's daughter, Jamie's strong belief in Christ is what carries her through everything. Landon goes to church because he is forced to, (probably so his mom can make a social statement), and even through all they go through together, his faith is never as strong as hers. Their beautiful relationship despite the differences in belief is so poignant. Also, Christ was not judgmental and would've never wanted any of His children to be...Yet even Jamie's dad, a pastor, judges and stereotypes Landon. The music is fantastically chosen, and I find myself listening to the soundtrack on an almost-daily basis. I've seen the movie more than a dozen times now, and I reflect on something different. Each character is unique and carefully developed. Eric, Belinda, Rev. Sullivan, and Landon's parents are sub-characters that help build the story and the depth in the main characters. The romantic relationship itself is only a piece of the beautiful work. They are loving, they are sensual, but not sexual. They're wise beyond their years, yet angst-y and silly. Some things do cross my mind -I wish we knew just a little more background between Landon and Jamie.They're too comfortable with each other from the get-go (on the bus, asking for a ride)...Were they friends as kids? -Doesn't Jamie's father feel cheated of time with Jamie? -I think Landon changes a little too fast...then again, maybe not--we never get a clear picture of time. -On a similar note, the relationship progresses a bit too quickly in my opinion. In conclusion, I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I laugh. I cry. I pray. I reflect on many, many aspects of my life as I feel I grow up with Landon, Jamie and everyone else.PS- if you like the movie, DON'T read the book. I got it thinking I would like it.

It's much darker, seamier, and more uncomfortable than any drama in recent years.Michael Douglas plays Bill Foster, a man who once had it all. A steady job, a great wife, and a kid. Through a series of unfortunate circumstances, Bill has lost almost everything. On the hottest day of the year in Los Angeles, he loses his patience. I'm going home he claims as he leaves his car on the freeway after a taunting, very realistic sequence at the beginning of the film. The remainder of the film shows him returning home to his wife, who doesn't want to see him ever again, so he can give his kid a birthday present.On his way home, Bill runs into all sorts of crazy, patient-testing circumstances. For example, being a few minutes after the breakfast curfew at a fast food restaurant or wandering into the wrong side of town. The outcome of each is completely unexpected and very different from what reason might tell us. The great thing about these sequences is they're genuine and discard any form of clichés we've come across in other action films.Falling Down's excellent filmmaking reminded me of a very underrated thriller I enjoyed about a year ago. It was called The Trigger Effect and was overlooked by pretty much everyone. The direction both films took was impeccable, and each created such an amazing atmosphere for their respected issue. In Falling Down, we get a great look at the seamy side of the city. Some points we feel hot-headed like the character or just plain hot from the heat that seems to be drifting from the screen into the audience. The atmosphere is exquisite, and going back to the opening scene, it depicts a plethora of things that we hear on the streets, only magnified. What makes Michael Douglas's character snap is because he is hearing horns honking, smells the exhaust from cars, feels the heat, feels a fly on the back of his neck and hears it buzzing, etc. All of these things are quibbles we have about every day life, but it's the little things that final push the character off the small edge he's standing on.In The Trigger Effect, the characters are going through a power outage. The seamy qualities of the town like looting, robbery, and low patience seem to also spill out onto the audience. That was a great thriller not only for its plot and dialog, but its believable scenarios complimented by its perfect atmosphere.I think one of the most overlooked aspects on Falling Down is its social commentary on the world we inhabit now. Arrogance in society has now etched itself in being the norm, and we look at snobby attitudes as the typical lifestyle today. It's unbelievable. What was considered low class back in the fifties, is now considered normal in the 2000's. Never did we think something like swearing, gangs, fights, guns, robbery, and just plain ignorance would be the normal lifestyle. Guess what? It is. And it has been on the rise for years.The film also silently sneaks in political undertones. In an effort to show centrist political opinions, the character of Bill Foster is portrayed as a person favoring both political parties. Scenes establish he doesn't believe in welfare and others establish that he is for anti-immigrations laws. Falling Down doesn't bleed politics, but doesn't hesitate to sneak them in. I believe it furthers the creation of the character as a person. We can learn more about him even in the grittiest circumstances.Falling Down not only gave me a great movie experience, but it showed me the un-sugarcoated life of the world. Rarely do we get such brutal honesty in the world today. The film shows us that the truth must come with less sugar and more facts.

It was a decade of ups and downs both on screen and behind the scenes. The series had gone back and forth between extremes has it changed leading man, lost one of its producers, fought off indifference from both critics and the public alike to stay alive. Though it left the decade in great financial shape thanks to Moonraker, that same film had sent it so deep into science fiction territory that it looked as though it might never come back from it. The first Bond film of the 1980s, For Your Eyes Only, would bring the series back to earth and Bond would hit the ground running.Nothing in the film is more surprising than Roger Moore's Bond. Doing his fifth Bond film, Moore would seem to have settled into the role by becoming a Walther PPK toting comedian but here he changes that perception. Moore definitely has his quips and almost all of them are good this Moore at his most serious as Bond. One need only look at Moore in scenes such as his serious scenes with Carole Bouquet or the scene where he dispatches Locque to see that despite his reputation, Moore could in fact act. There are only a few moments where Moore seems ill at ease but that is the fault of the particular actress in those scenes (who will be discussed later). Overall, it's Moore giving his single best performance as Bond.Making for another change is Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock. Melina hearkens back to the three dimensional Bond girls of the past such as Domino and Anya Amasova, especially in the way the character is written. Carole Bouquet brings the character to life skillfully and realistically, bringing the revenge minded character to life. Bouquet also shares some excellent chemistry with Moore as well, helping to make the relationship between them all the more believable. Though seemingly forgotten behind more famous (and suggestively named) Bond girls, Bouquet as Melina is both a highlight of the film and the series.The supporting cast of the film is for the most part successful as well. Julian Glover and Topol play the film's two other major characters, Kristatos and Columbo, who both make a major plot twist in the film believable by playing two different versions of their respective characters. Michael Gothard makes quite an impression as the silent henchman Emile Locque, always lurking and always being menacing. The film also sees actor James Villiers take on the role of MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner, replacing M as played by the recently deceased Bernard Lee, and in a way it is a shame that Villiers didn't become the new M as he seems to be set up for exactly that here. The only major misfire of the supporting cast is as Lynn-Holly Johnson the ice-skating Bibi Dahl who, through both writing and Johnson's performance, is nothing but the only cringe inducing piece of an otherwise serious Bond film. Despite Johnson, the supporting cast of For Your Eyes Only is for the most part excellent.Much of the credit for the film's success lies in the decision to bring Bond back to earth. From the opening pre-credits sequence which tips its hat to both Bond's dead wife Tracy and the series former arch-villain Blofeld, the film almost seems to harken back to the Bond films of the 1960s rather than the films that immediately preceded it. There are strong echoes of On Her Majesty's Secret Service from the aforementioned pre-credit sequence (which is almost a mini-sequel to that film), the snowbound sequences and the final assault on the mountain hideout of the villain. The film also echoes both From Russia With Love and Thunderball as well, mirroring major sequences from both films. The results are both familiar and yet excitingly fresh at the same time.For Your Eyes Only might come across as being more serious than the average Bond film, but it is no less action packed. The action covers air, land and sea and the results are superb all around. They range from Bond attempting to take control of a remote controlled helicopter in mid-flight to a surprisingly effective car chase, excellently filmed ski sequences, suspenseful underwater sequences and a climbing scene that features one of the most impressive Bond stunts ever. Like the references to the past, these action pieces cover familiar territory but do so in a way you might never know the difference.Nowhere though does the film come down to earth more than in its script. After the out of this world and often cringe worthy hijinks of Moonraker, Bond returns to familiar territory in more ways than one. Bond finds himself in a Cold War thriller, with a vital piece of Western defense up for grabs while also dealing with the revenge minded but beautiful woman whose family was killed in pursuit of it. In bringing that plot to life, the film's writer's returned to Ian Fleming's original short stories and novels, combing pieces from across the literary cannon. As a consequence, this is a storyline and script that is somewhat closer to reality than Bond had been in more than a decade with the result being a film that is much more suspenseful and even exciting than it's over the top predecessor.Where though does For Your Eyes Only rank amongst the Bond films overall? In terms of the Roger Moore era, it is certainly the best thanks to both Moore's best performance as Bond and its down to earth plotting. In the series overall, it is a film that is highly underrated. Because, with its acknowledgments and echoes of the past, it is almost as if the film seeks to remove a decade's worth of questionable Bond films and start afresh. In that regard and others, For Your Eyes Only succeeds. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2011","score":"","review":" The 1970s were a troubled time for James Bond.

After the out of this world and often cringe worthy hijinks of Moonraker, Bond returns to familiar territory in more ways than one. Bond finds himself in a Cold War thriller, with a vital piece of Western defense up for grabs while also dealing with the revenge minded but beautiful woman whose family was killed in pursuit of it. In bringing that plot to life, the film's writer's returned to Ian Fleming's original short stories and novels, combing pieces from across the literary cannon. As a consequence, this is a storyline and script that is somewhat closer to reality than Bond had been in more than a decade with the result being a film that is much more suspenseful and even exciting than it's over the top predecessor.Where though does For Your Eyes Only rank amongst the Bond films overall? In terms of the Roger Moore era, it is certainly the best thanks to both Moore's best performance as Bond and its down to earth plotting. In the series overall, it is a film that is highly underrated. Because, with its acknowledgments and echoes of the past, it is almost as if the film seeks to remove a decade's worth of questionable Bond films and start afresh. In that regard and others, For Your Eyes Only succeeds. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"31 December 2011","score":"","review":" The 1970s were a troubled time for James Bond. It was a decade of ups and downs both on screen and behind the scenes. The series had gone back and forth between extremes has it changed leading man, lost one of its producers, fought off indifference from both critics and the public alike to stay alive. Though it left the decade in great financial shape thanks to Moonraker, that same film had sent it so deep into science fiction territory that it looked as though it might never come back from it. The first Bond film of the 1980s, For Your Eyes Only, would bring the series back to earth and Bond would hit the ground running.Nothing in the film is more surprising than Roger Moore's Bond. Doing his fifth Bond film, Moore would seem to have settled into the role by becoming a Walther PPK toting comedian but here he changes that perception. Moore definitely has his quips and almost all of them are good this Moore at his most serious as Bond. One need only look at Moore in scenes such as his serious scenes with Carole Bouquet or the scene where he dispatches Locque to see that despite his reputation, Moore could in fact act. There are only a few moments where Moore seems ill at ease but that is the fault of the particular actress in those scenes (who will be discussed later). Overall, it's Moore giving his single best performance as Bond.Making for another change is Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock. Melina hearkens back to the three dimensional Bond girls of the past such as Domino and Anya Amasova, especially in the way the character is written. Carole Bouquet brings the character to life skillfully and realistically, bringing the revenge minded character to life. Bouquet also shares some excellent chemistry with Moore as well, helping to make the relationship between them all the more believable. Though seemingly forgotten behind more famous (and suggestively named) Bond girls, Bouquet as Melina is both a highlight of the film and the series.The supporting cast of the film is for the most part successful as well. Julian Glover and Topol play the film's two other major characters, Kristatos and Columbo, who both make a major plot twist in the film believable by playing two different versions of their respective characters. Michael Gothard makes quite an impression as the silent henchman Emile Locque, always lurking and always being menacing. The film also sees actor James Villiers take on the role of MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner, replacing M as played by the recently deceased Bernard Lee, and in a way it is a shame that Villiers didn't become the new M as he seems to be set up for exactly that here. The only major misfire of the supporting cast is as Lynn-Holly Johnson the ice-skating Bibi Dahl who, through both writing and Johnson's performance, is nothing but the only cringe inducing piece of an otherwise serious Bond film. Despite Johnson, the supporting cast of For Your Eyes Only is for the most part excellent.Much of the credit for the film's success lies in the decision to bring Bond back to earth. From the opening pre-credits sequence which tips its hat to both Bond's dead wife Tracy and the series former arch-villain Blofeld, the film almost seems to harken back to the Bond films of the 1960s rather than the films that immediately preceded it. There are strong echoes of On Her Majesty's Secret Service from the aforementioned pre-credit sequence (which is almost a mini-sequel to that film), the snowbound sequences and the final assault on the mountain hideout of the villain. The film also echoes both From Russia With Love and Thunderball as well, mirroring major sequences from both films. The results are both familiar and yet excitingly fresh at the same time.For Your Eyes Only might come across as being more serious than the average Bond film, but it is no less action packed. The action covers air, land and sea and the results are superb all around.

Too bad this god was unable to, like, make these aliens, who can be killed by a glass of water, smart enough to realize that it might not be a good idea to attempt a take-over of a planet (and a people) who are made of predominantly just that water. Clearly, Mel's god is not omniscient. More like a plot-convince deity. Of course, a movie is more than just story (even this one)... the set decoration here was, for me, the best part of the picture.
