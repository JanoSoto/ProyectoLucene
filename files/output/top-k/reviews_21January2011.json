This film was great I loved the characters Sydney trying to figure out who is trying to kill her when the one she is dating is actually the killer who is blackmailing the real one, the true killer. I was afraid for Sydney when she had finally found out that the killer had killed her mom years ago. I was scared that she would suffer the same fate as her mother and her friends and schoolmates. I was surprised when Gale had shot her boyfriend who had nearly killed her with a gun and a knife. I thought of her as the hero and a savior who had saved Sydney and Dwey her soon would be boyfriend. I thought the film overall was great because you would never suspect a boyfriend close to someone who had seen her friends dying would be a killer. I really hope that there is a sequel to this film because if there is I am going to see it and hopefully write a review for it. I do hope that Sydney is going to finally get rid of anyone who killed her mom, because in the film it did say that she did die from stab wounds and blood loss, because I don't think that they had killed her. Maybe copycatting a similar death.

Halloween 4 brings us back to Haddonfield and I'm happy to be back.Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years. Doctors are transferring Michael from a clinic to a different hospital. But Michael wakes up and goes back to Haddonfield. There he's going after his 9 year old niece Jamie Lloyd. But Dr. Loomis knows he's out there. So he tries to stop him (as usual) and save Jamie.First off the acting is great. I love Donald Pleasance and was happy to see him back. Newcomer Danielle Harris who is only 9 years old delivers the second best performance in the whole film. Usually it's hard to cast a kid but the crew struck gold with Harris. The rest of the cast had great chemistry. They are well acted. We actually get to know the character before they get killed. John Carpenter is completely missing, the only thing is the score, but the series is in good hands. The film has an eerie feel to it. Director Dwight H. Little brings a sense of atmosphere to the film and creates a number of suspenseful scenes. He is able to build suspense and not just go for the cheap thrill which the Friday the 13th Series did, which the second movie also did. But this one goes back to the suspense and isn't a gore fest. The deaths are bloody but they're different and not just the usual knife or hospital items. There are many intense scenes in the movie. First off a car chase with Michael on top of the car, and what I think is the best scene in the whole movie, Michael chases the stars on the roof of their house. It's very suspenseful and very intense. Also the ending is shocking and one of the best endings in a horror movie. I won't give it away but I was surprised. While it's flawed and not perfect I really enjoyed it. It was better than Halloween II and better than Halloween III.

John Carpenter is completely missing, the only thing is the score, but the series is in good hands. The film has an eerie feel to it. Director Dwight H. Little brings a sense of atmosphere to the film and creates a number of suspenseful scenes. He is able to build suspense and not just go for the cheap thrill which the Friday the 13th Series did, which the second movie also did. But this one goes back to the suspense and isn't a gore fest. The deaths are bloody but they're different and not just the usual knife or hospital items. There are many intense scenes in the movie. First off a car chase with Michael on top of the car, and what I think is the best scene in the whole movie, Michael chases the stars on the roof of their house. It's very suspenseful and very intense. Also the ending is shocking and one of the best endings in a horror movie. I won't give it away but I was surprised. While it's flawed and not perfect I really enjoyed it. It was better than Halloween II and better than Halloween III.

I never read the novel, but I found the film to be well made, using very well acted performances, as well focusing it's main subject of a plot to a more diverse issue other than the property of Howards end. The setting takes place in Edwardian England, the time of King Edward VII rule, and there are 3 classes shown to viewers each symbolizing some individual form of moral expression in the very nature of their actions. First off , we haves the Wilcox's, the typical aristocratic English family with nothing but wealth and false pride to justify themselves, believing they are above the poor and that anything is in their grasp. The head's of this family are the well mannered but secretively selfish Henry Wilcox (Hopkins) and the more compassionate Ruth Wilcox (Redgrave). The second class is the way above average, but lacking in arrogance Schelgel's. The 2 Schelegel sisters, Margaret (Thompson) and Helen (Carter) are both well educated, seeing very significant aspects in their fascinations with their forms of literature and art, Helen in particular. The 3rd and final family is the Bast's, the poor and struggling middle class that struggle all alone with what they have. The film's plot revolves around the very connection between these 3 classes. After foolishly continuing a doomed love affair with a Wilcox, Helens own faults and regrets serve as Margaret's motivations to bring both apologies and respect to an ailing, and later to be deceased Ruth for her sisters own faults. As times goes on, the two women share many fascinations, particularly their fondness of the homes they live in. Currently the Schelegels are moving out of their cherished Child hood home, and Ruth herself has treasured her own childhood home, Howards End. The nature of the Wilcox's become very clear at their response to Ruth's dying will to leave Howard's End to Margaret. Purged with both jealousy and bitterness, Henry burns what is truly Margaret's, only to later leave it to her in the film's conclusion. In the shared moments Henry and Margaret have, they become closer and closer, thus reaching a proposal that although makes Margaret happy, it will challenge both her moral place in choosing between the Wilcox's or her own family and their more sympathetic views. As I've mentioned, the Basts served as the film's struggling middle class. By a simple accident, and further twists of fate, the Basts became of great importance to Helen. In a simple incident involving an umbrella, and a falsely accused affair, Leonard Bast would become more acquainted with Helen, on both the knowledge of his profession and the views of his wife. Through the misguided advice of Henry, Leonard lost his Job, only to fall further down the road of struggling survival. Helen's good judgment served as her inspiration to help a man she barely knew, up until the moment the two fell for each others heart. Margaret on the other hand felt more of an obligation to her husband, and in doing nothing of the sort to help. In these times, people as snide and falsely elegant as the Wilcox's would look down on the poor, with some form pity, but with no desire to show compassion nor assistance. A lot of things in this film happen, and they simply show further more how this film examines so much more than just the relations of British social classes. Helen's friendship with Leonard and eventual barred child, Margaret's marriage and conflict with her sister, and Leonard's eventual death at the hands of a Wilcox all end in some meaningful conclusion, symbolizing a new form of evolution of British social classes. The Willcoxes represented the industrialists, while the Schelegels themselves were more liberal and sympathetic, and the Basts were the more ill fortunate and faced with more difficulty. I mentioned earlier that despite Henry hiding the will of Margaret's ownership of Howard's end, all came to a close when his heart came to change and feel grief and guilt. Howard's end is more than just the cherished memory of a deceased old woman, but it also represents a change in the way people lived. The film ends with Margaret now being the owner of the property, which houses both her and her sister Helen, and Leonard's son. The home of the Wilcox's ended up sheltering people of presumed lower classes. The film Howards End, in my view also symbolized the individual talents of it's 3 leads. Emma Thompson's performance can be defined as charming and yet confused character when made to choose between Lineage and good common rationality. I was very impressed in particular by Helen Bo ham Carter's portrayal, symbolizing a very unique character who's fascination with multiple forms of art is of charming easiness. Anthony Hopkins was terrific, using a character that represents hypocrisy and just plain arrogance in the status of his family name. Director James Avery has made a film with the message of social equality, showing viewers the very dark nature of judging others, despite whatever class they are, in money, beliefs, or of whatever state in general.

It's been very hard for me to grow up. &#x96; Steven SpielbergSpielberg is a tycoon, like Rockefeller. &#x96; Federico FelliniSigmund Freud was a kinky guy. He believed storytelling to be a child's way of dealing with certain anxieties, most of which had to do with sexual difference and dependence. For Freud, the act of creating fantasies stem from unconscious fears and desires, the earliest ones being as follows the fear of abandonment by, and desire for unity with, the mother or father, the fear of castration, the fear of being devoured by the mother, and the desire for illicit viewing (often of parental coitus).All of Spielberg's films are themselves rooted in infantile desire and the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex. But not only does Spielberg leave the Oedipus complex unresolved, but he actively evades and negates it, the extreme real world result of which are various neuroses (or bizarre stuff like incest). A grotesquely messed up guy like Michael Jackson (who reportedly had severe daddy issues, determined to please an abusive father) embodies all the clichés of this, and indeed Jackson himself was set to star in Spielberg's Hook, until he had an alleged falling out with the director.Hook follows the same basic plot line as all of Spielberg's films. Whether it be Duel, in which a father defeats an evil truck in order to restore his masculinity in the eyes of his wife and kids, Jurassic Park, in which bachelor Sam Neil kicks dinosaur butt and becomes a surrogate daddy, Close Encounters and ET, in which alien toys assuage various abandonment issues, or Spielberg's historical films, in which daddy becomes the nation state, the Big Other, belief in which, like Tom Cruise in War of The Worlds, is naively restored despite past national transgressions, Spielberg's films all rehash the same plot that of a father battling fantasy monsters (pirates, trucks, Nazis\/Germans\/slave-traders, dinosaurs, aliens etc) in order to restore paternal responsibility. The films do not celebrate childhood, so much as they use the image of the child to recuperate a longed-for, wholly mythic, masculine authority. As this is what is known as a reverse Oedipism &#x96; conventional Oedipism involves the son destroying the symbolic father and taking his place in a misguided belief that the father bars the subject from some intangible pleasure, let alone holds any authority at all - the audience is, by necessity, always positioned as a willingly accepting child. Sometimes this plot is approached from the eyes of the parent and sometimes from the child, but in each case the Spielberg story is the same. Because these plots always use fantasies to palliate or avoid rather than confront their traumas, Spielberg's neuroses are never resolved and tend to be repeated from film to film.Whether it be Freud's Oedipal complex, or the modern reinterpretation by thinkers like Lacan, the conventional view is that the complex is something everyone goes through before maturation (though in real life, people rarely escape it). In Spielberg's case, however, you get something else. Anxiety typically springs from our fear of the cultural Super-Ego (the Law) and under the latter's influence is fostered our own masochism and servitude. What Spielberg's films do, though, is deny the erotic attachment between the two poles (and the fact that the repressive super ego is always internalised by us), thereby evading the Oedipal conflict. So whilst all of Spielberg's films unconsciously enjoy tormenting kids, slaughtering blacks, Jews, soldiers, sharks, and salivating over dinosaur bites and mass murdering aliens, Hook is the only one in which the child actually admits this. The only one where the kid\/audience admits that Daddy is bad news. And so we watch as a son promptly takes the position of his father and uses his newfound authority to become a mean pirate who wants nothing other than to kill kids and destroy daddy, thereby claiming authority for himself and wiping out all pretenders to the throne. Of course this is magically resolved by the film's end, daddy and son learning to hug and the status quo restored, but before the film's climax we get all kinds of psycho-sexual freakishness, incest, pseudo-paedophilia and creepy romances. In a way, Hook is Spielberg's Dorian Gray portrait. Like Jackson's face (Jackson wasn't trying to look white, he was trying to look like Disney's Peter Pan), it's the freaky truth behind his art. And so much of Hook's narrative contains men moaning about lost marbles, talk of Peter Pan penis envy and sexy fairies fawning over grown men. Even weirder, the film's paternal hero (Peter Pan, played by Robin Williams) may be the nebbish, bespectacled face of a kinder masculinity, but he's a total sex magnet, lusted over by his symbolic sister, mother, daughter and grandmother. That's right, whatever daddy says, goes. Indeed, whenever he isn't goofing around, Peter is being desired by his mother (Tinkerbell, who raised Peter as a baby then watched him grow up, all the while wanting to get into his sexy diapers) and grandmother (Peter's wife's grandmother), the latter passively allowing Peter to hook up with her thirteen year old grandchild, Moira, who is also a sister figure because granny also happens to be Peter's mommy. Family values? Hell no. This is the work of a smooth criminal. For Spielberg, like Jackson, Neverland isn't where we celebrate childhood, it's where we all line up to suck on daddy's...5\/10 &#x96; Poor set design (nothing seems to exist outside the boundaries of Spielberg's sound-stages) and cringe-inducing comedy ruin what is otherwise an excellent idea. Worth two viewings. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 January 2011","score":"9 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" I have always felt like Peter Pan.

Whether it be Duel, in which a father defeats an evil truck in order to restore his masculinity in the eyes of his wife and kids, Jurassic Park, in which bachelor Sam Neil kicks dinosaur butt and becomes a surrogate daddy, Close Encounters and ET, in which alien toys assuage various abandonment issues, or Spielberg's historical films, in which daddy becomes the nation state, the Big Other, belief in which, like Tom Cruise in War of The Worlds, is naively restored despite past national transgressions, Spielberg's films all rehash the same plot that of a father battling fantasy monsters (pirates, trucks, Nazis\/Germans\/slave-traders, dinosaurs, aliens etc) in order to restore paternal responsibility. The films do not celebrate childhood, so much as they use the image of the child to recuperate a longed-for, wholly mythic, masculine authority. As this is what is known as a reverse Oedipism &#x96; conventional Oedipism involves the son destroying the symbolic father and taking his place in a misguided belief that the father bars the subject from some intangible pleasure, let alone holds any authority at all - the audience is, by necessity, always positioned as a willingly accepting child. Sometimes this plot is approached from the eyes of the parent and sometimes from the child, but in each case the Spielberg story is the same. Because these plots always use fantasies to palliate or avoid rather than confront their traumas, Spielberg's neuroses are never resolved and tend to be repeated from film to film.Whether it be Freud's Oedipal complex, or the modern reinterpretation by thinkers like Lacan, the conventional view is that the complex is something everyone goes through before maturation (though in real life, people rarely escape it). In Spielberg's case, however, you get something else. Anxiety typically springs from our fear of the cultural Super-Ego (the Law) and under the latter's influence is fostered our own masochism and servitude. What Spielberg's films do, though, is deny the erotic attachment between the two poles (and the fact that the repressive super ego is always internalised by us), thereby evading the Oedipal conflict. So whilst all of Spielberg's films unconsciously enjoy tormenting kids, slaughtering blacks, Jews, soldiers, sharks, and salivating over dinosaur bites and mass murdering aliens, Hook is the only one in which the child actually admits this. The only one where the kid\/audience admits that Daddy is bad news. And so we watch as a son promptly takes the position of his father and uses his newfound authority to become a mean pirate who wants nothing other than to kill kids and destroy daddy, thereby claiming authority for himself and wiping out all pretenders to the throne. Of course this is magically resolved by the film's end, daddy and son learning to hug and the status quo restored, but before the film's climax we get all kinds of psycho-sexual freakishness, incest, pseudo-paedophilia and creepy romances. In a way, Hook is Spielberg's Dorian Gray portrait. Like Jackson's face (Jackson wasn't trying to look white, he was trying to look like Disney's Peter Pan), it's the freaky truth behind his art. And so much of Hook's narrative contains men moaning about lost marbles, talk of Peter Pan penis envy and sexy fairies fawning over grown men. Even weirder, the film's paternal hero (Peter Pan, played by Robin Williams) may be the nebbish, bespectacled face of a kinder masculinity, but he's a total sex magnet, lusted over by his symbolic sister, mother, daughter and grandmother. That's right, whatever daddy says, goes. Indeed, whenever he isn't goofing around, Peter is being desired by his mother (Tinkerbell, who raised Peter as a baby then watched him grow up, all the while wanting to get into his sexy diapers) and grandmother (Peter's wife's grandmother), the latter passively allowing Peter to hook up with her thirteen year old grandchild, Moira, who is also a sister figure because granny also happens to be Peter's mommy. Family values? Hell no. This is the work of a smooth criminal. For Spielberg, like Jackson, Neverland isn't where we celebrate childhood, it's where we all line up to suck on daddy's...5\/10 &#x96; Poor set design (nothing seems to exist outside the boundaries of Spielberg's sound-stages) and cringe-inducing comedy ruin what is otherwise an excellent idea.

It's been very hard for me to grow up. &#x96; Steven SpielbergSpielberg is a tycoon, like Rockefeller. &#x96; Federico FelliniSigmund Freud was a kinky guy. He believed storytelling to be a child's way of dealing with certain anxieties, most of which had to do with sexual difference and dependence. For Freud, the act of creating fantasies stem from unconscious fears and desires, the earliest ones being as follows the fear of abandonment by, and desire for unity with, the mother or father, the fear of castration, the fear of being devoured by the mother, and the desire for illicit viewing (often of parental coitus).All of Spielberg's films are themselves rooted in infantile desire and the unsuccessful resolution of the Oedipus complex.
