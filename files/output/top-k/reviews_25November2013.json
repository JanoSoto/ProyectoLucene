I fell in love with them when I was a youngster and they have always been a permanent staple in my yearly movie watching. Home Alone is probably in my top ten films of all time and what sequel could live up to that? Well...this one. It isn't as good and it has its faults but they took everything that made the first a near instant classic and kept the key elements the same. When you look at Home Alone 2 up close you'll see that it really is just the first film rehashed but isn't that the idea of a sequel? The key is that the filmmakers needs to make sure they do it right. I feel like they did it very right. It has the same heart, the same level of fun, and the same carefree fantasy aspect of a young person on their own. I will say that I feel like Home Alone 2 amps up the violence to an almost extreme level. Certainly younger people watching this need to be told just how fantasy this film is because he does some pretty wild pranks to Marv and Harry this time around. There are some terrific supporting roles, plenty of laughs and of course that heart and soul that is Home Alone and will actually bring tears to your eyes.Macaulay Culkin returns two years later and demonstrates again how terrific his chemistry was on screen. I said the same thing about Home Alone and that is Culkin wasn't and isn't a great actor. In fact, much of his performance in both films is very stiff and awkward and yet you rarely notice it. He has an indescribable charm and I remember as a youngster completely relating to him and loving every minute of his adventures. This was the perfect role for him. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return as everyone's favourite bufoonish criminals. They are truly terrific and I think this is one of Pesci's best roles because it is fun. He is still a worthy villain and just embodies the role so well. You actually do fear him even though he's a bumbling idiot who gets pranked right into prison. And Stern is similar only an even bigger idiot and the two of them together are terrific. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard return as Kevin's parents who ridiculously leave him behind yet again. O'Hara and Heard are perfect for this series and they do such a great job with mostly small roles. They are just the perfect all-American parents. The supporting cast is far more diverse and significant than the first film and they are all really great. Tim Curry and Rob Schneider are both amazing in this and it is insanely fun watching them get pranked. I find them both irritating quite often but in this they are just perfect. Brenda Fricker does a great job as the pigeon lady that Kevin befriends and the very small role by Eddie Bracken is also great.You can't expect much less than something truly terrific with a script penned by John Hughes and a film directed by Christopher Columbus. I mean these two guys together are gold when it comes to family films or capturing emotion in a coming of age\/youthful sort of way. I've actually seen nearly every film Columbus has done and they all range from really good to amazing so the guy knows his genre absolutely. They knew what audiences loved about Home Alone and they gave them the exact same thing again with enough of a different story to make it stand on its own merits. I will say that Home Alone 2 feels a little less like a Holiday movie than the first one did. Both are set at Christmas but I felt like this one didn't have quite the same Christmas feel to it perhaps because it was set in the big city instead of a home. Regardless if you like or love Home Alone then you can't help but at least enjoy this decent sequel.

I was born in 1990 but I love going back and watching what my dad calls the classics. This is one movie I just never watched but with the remake out now I decided to watch this before I saw that one. I couldn't be more let down.For those of you who don't know this movie revolves around a teenager named Carrie(duh right?) who doesn't fit in with anyone at school. She gets her period while taking a shower in gym class and because her mother is a religious fanatic and doesn't tell her how her body works, Carrie thinks something is really wrong and when she asks for help they all bully her and pick on her. The catch is she actually has telekinetic powers and she slowly learns how to use them throughout the movie. The movie continues from there all the way in till prom where she is the center of attention thanks to a very cruel joke. I really thought I would enjoy this movie but unfortunately I didn't.Before I say why I didn't like this movie I did feel for her character and what she went through. I thought it was set up very well and just because it was set up in 1976 didn't detract anything for me. Bullying is bullying to me so that has nothing to do with it. Something was just off for me in this movie. Everything seemed to work but by the time the credits rolled I asked myself Why Didn't I like this movie? One reason is actually the prom scene. I know it is 1976 and the effects aren't as good as today but she managed to kill people with a fire hose? That scene was so boring to me and the whole time Carrie is just staring real hard at everyone. I found her portrayal good all the way in till that scene. After that her acting was dumb ed down. Her mother was one of the worse acting jobs I have ever seen. She was a religious freak but she didn't creep me out because most of her time on screen I thought she was trying to be funny. Carrie's gym teacher did do a good job though but not good enough to save it. Overall it wasn't a bad movie and I didn't go in with any expectations. It is just this movie gets so much love and the remake keeps getting bashed more than recent remakes. So I told myself either the remake is that bad or the original is that good.

Kennedy was assassination in Dallas, TX in Nov. 22, 1963. While, the events leading up to the true real life event is still a mystery and the facts gather up on the case wouldn't be disclose until 2017 and 2029. Oliver Stone gives us his take on what happen, why and how the government might be covering it up in the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). From all the assassination conspiracy theories out there ranging from Mafia connections to Cuba exiles, Oliver Stone picked up one that is a bit outlandish to base his movie around. Oliver Stone largely based his movie on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book On the trail of the Assassins. Jim Garrison's story first off, wasn't a real good choice for a movie. The movie does take a big dramatic license in this story. Stone's depictions of Garrison is that of a fearless seeker of truth who seeking revenge out on New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) to assassinate Kennedy. In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted Shaw in conspiracy so vase it's hard to believe. While other critics might see this as all a misrepresentation of the truth, in my opinion, I really have doubts that this conspiracy theory really happen, but it might had. I'm more open to seeing this movie, than a lot of people, but still can't comprehend the uneven 'facts' the movie is projecting. It didn't help that years later, science would prove most of these claims to be unrealistic. The state-of-the-art forensic and computer analysis of the assassination since 1991, clearly shows that Oswald might had acted alone. All the findings have been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both hits- the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. It's hard to think that Oswald was part of a conspiracy as he was known before the event as a loose-cannon. Oswald was originally trying to kill a general that day, not the president. The film says he was poor marksman, but in real life, he was quite good in his markings. About, Jack Ruby's action were a bit driven by his passion for the president. He did it for revenge. It's hard to think a strip club owner Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray) was part of a conspiracy even if he was part of the Mafia. In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the 'magic bullet' on a hospital gurney. The biggest out there claim the film has is the film's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson was part of a coup d'état to kill Kennedy. Ouch. The idea of that is preposterous in 1991 as it is today, as Lyndon pretty much had no reason to kill Kennedy and Stone knew it. The movie explains Kennedy was assassinated because his foreign policy would have meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex, and enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. This is hardly the case, as Kennedy was indeed one of the men that help the build-up of the military during the Cold War and help put the space race into play that made more profit than ever before. I had study the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations to the best of my ability, and I just can't find myself, putting Clay Shaw with John F. Kennedy together. The movie also takes some information accounts from Crossfire The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs as a counter-myth to the Warren Commission's fictional myth. What the movie does so well, is mixing the real life footage with that of the fictionist story as it looks like a veneer of documentary verisimilitude. No wonder, why the film won best editing and cinematography at the Academy Awards. Before the age of the internet, this was the first time, I have ever saw the brutal Zapruder footage. It was really was intense. It's really hard to tell, what is real and what isn't when watching this film. The acting in this cast was really good. The length of the movie is pretty hard to get through if not a history buff. Its 3 hours long, and most of the movie is talking. . It's even worst in the Director's Cut version as there is nearly 54 minutes worth of deleted and expanded scenes. It was a bit too long and excessively detailed. It could be more concise. Overall a lot of people still believe that JFK die in a conspiracy theory matter. So this movie will continue to find an audience wanting to know more about the event.

Oliver Stone gives us his take on what happen, why and how the government might be covering it up in the eyes of former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner). From all the assassination conspiracy theories out there ranging from Mafia connections to Cuba exiles, Oliver Stone picked up one that is a bit outlandish to base his movie around. Oliver Stone largely based his movie on New Orleans DA Jim Garrison's book On the trail of the Assassins. Jim Garrison's story first off, wasn't a real good choice for a movie. The movie does take a big dramatic license in this story. Stone's depictions of Garrison is that of a fearless seeker of truth who seeking revenge out on New Orleans resident Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) who Garrison charged with conspiring with Lee Harvey Oswald (Gary Oldman) to assassinate Kennedy. In reality, Garrison was a paranoid, irrational bully who persecuted Shaw in conspiracy so vase it's hard to believe. While other critics might see this as all a misrepresentation of the truth, in my opinion, I really have doubts that this conspiracy theory really happen, but it might had. I'm more open to seeing this movie, than a lot of people, but still can't comprehend the uneven 'facts' the movie is projecting. It didn't help that years later, science would prove most of these claims to be unrealistic. The state-of-the-art forensic and computer analysis of the assassination since 1991, clearly shows that Oswald might had acted alone. All the findings have been consistent with the autopsy findings and demonstrate that both hits- the Kennedy-Connally first shot, and the fatal head wound third shot were fired from the 6th floor window of the Texas Book Depository, not from the picket fence or grassy knoll. The first shot passed through the president and then the governor in a relatively straight line, not the zigzag claimed by the movie Garrison. It's hard to think that Oswald was part of a conspiracy as he was known before the event as a loose-cannon. Oswald was originally trying to kill a general that day, not the president. The film says he was poor marksman, but in real life, he was quite good in his markings. About, Jack Ruby's action were a bit driven by his passion for the president. He did it for revenge. It's hard to think a strip club owner Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray) was part of a conspiracy even if he was part of the Mafia. In the film he's depicted surreptitiously planting the 'magic bullet' on a hospital gurney. The biggest out there claim the film has is the film's implication that President Lyndon B. Johnson was part of a coup d'état to kill Kennedy. Ouch. The idea of that is preposterous in 1991 as it is today, as Lyndon pretty much had no reason to kill Kennedy and Stone knew it. The movie explains Kennedy was assassinated because his foreign policy would have meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex, and enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. This is hardly the case, as Kennedy was indeed one of the men that help the build-up of the military during the Cold War and help put the space race into play that made more profit than ever before. I had study the Warren Commission, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations to the best of my ability, and I just can't find myself, putting Clay Shaw with John F. Kennedy together. The movie also takes some information accounts from Crossfire The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs as a counter-myth to the Warren Commission's fictional myth. What the movie does so well, is mixing the real life footage with that of the fictionist story as it looks like a veneer of documentary verisimilitude. No wonder, why the film won best editing and cinematography at the Academy Awards. Before the age of the internet, this was the first time, I have ever saw the brutal Zapruder footage. It was really was intense. It's really hard to tell, what is real and what isn't when watching this film. The acting in this cast was really good. The length of the movie is pretty hard to get through if not a history buff. Its 3 hours long, and most of the movie is talking. . It's even worst in the Director's Cut version as there is nearly 54 minutes worth of deleted and expanded scenes. It was a bit too long and excessively detailed. It could be more concise. Overall a lot of people still believe that JFK die in a conspiracy theory matter. So this movie will continue to find an audience wanting to know more about the event.

One of the most underrated characters in the Disney Universe is Mulan, in my opinion. Mulan is a strong woman trying to find her place in China. Mulan is a fantastic movie with Eddie Murphy as a funny sidekick, before he was Donkey, and one of the creepiest Disney villains. Mulan is one of the better Disney movies but why does it not seem that way? Why it is not considered one of the best? Well, let's get into it.The story behind Mulan is rather basic. The Huns, led by Shan-Yu invade China for no real reason. I think that is a real flaw in the movie itself. The villains don't have a rhyme or reason to what they do. They just do it. They are evil for the sake of being evil. Shan-Yu leads the Huns and his haunting theme music is enough to scare any kid but still he is overlooked. This movie took a lot of risks for a kid's movie. There is a war going on, many people die, you do not see it but its implied, and the main protagonist is a woman. Now that is not a sexist remark but most of the memorable Disney movies has the lead woman be a damsel and not a strong leader like Mulan. I really like Mulan's character. She is incredibly relatable. She is a young girl trying to find where she belongs. She says it in one of the most memorable songs in any Disney movie. When will my reflection show who I am inside? She eventually goes to war in her father's place. That right there is courageous and foolish. Women are supposed to stay in the house and make babies in China. They are forbidden to fight in war. She does this anyway, and yet she isn't considered one of the greatest characters ever. Mulan is somebody people can look up to and the movie does an amazing job of portraying her. Eddie Murphy has a special talent for voice acting. Mushu is the lovable dragon that kids enjoy. He brings comedy and many memorable moments. From the first time I saw Mushu as a small kid I fell in love with him. He too is looking to find where he belongs with the ancestors of Mulan's family. The obvious similarities between the two main characters are enjoyable. Thankfully Mushu didn't take too much of the spotlight. Disney is known for its lovable characters and evil villains but also for its music. Mulan captures some Chinese culture in the song in this movie and they are most memorable. The first song is a bit odd if you listen to the words. It is catchy and fun to sing along to but is basically about the worth of women in China. Look beautiful for a guy to want you and make babies to defend the Emperor. It is little things like this that could be why Mulan does not get the recognition it deserves but the rest of the songs make up for it. A Girl Worth Fighting for is a personal favorite along with Make a Man Out of You. I think I know every word. The songs are well placed and when one ends it reaches the saddest part of the movie. It goes from a high point to a low point. It is interesting for a Disney movie to have this much emotion. Mulan has many relationships in the movie. The obvious one with her father and Shang but I particularly like the relationship with the three side characters. I'm talking about the bald guy, the thin guy, and the short angry guy. These three are c0molete opposites from each other and bounce off each other perfectly. They are side characters to fall in love with and quote. They have moments that are classic in the movie too. Overall, Mulan is a great movie that is unfortunately overlooked. People may disagree with me but think about it. You ask somebody what their favorite Disney movie is they probably will not say Mulan. Mulan is extremely underrated and I think it is because it has some controversial parts. The movie itself has everything a Disney movie needs and it also got trashed with a sequel. If you ask me I won't say Mulan is my favorite Disney movie, that is a close one between Hercules, but it stands in my top three with ease. And of course it gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.

Paths of Glory is the best of his overlooked films. Before watching this, I heard so many great things about it but I always try to be objective when I come into a movie to avoid unrealistic expectations and prevent myself to be too excited or disappointed.Paths of Glory is based on the book of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb. The screenplay was written by Kubrick, Jim Thompson and Calder Willingham. Thompson and Kubrick have previously worked together on The Killing and I thought they did a decent job on that one. Paths of Glory is definitely an excellent tale of loyalty, mercy, sacrifice and the politics of war. There are many war films that fail to captivate me but this one has such a great story and such an empathetic and likable protagonist that the film had me engaged the whole way through. The film's dialogue, in my opinion, is much better written here in comparison to Kubrick's previous film as it felt more realistic and doesn't try to stand out. I understand that both films are totally different in genre and style but I am just judging it with what works for me personally. People who expect the film to show more chilling and intense action sequence may be disappointed as there is only one area of the film that contains this, but I didn't mind it because it's great plot made up for it. There are definitely some stand out scenes in this film including the ending, the courtroom and the charge on Ant Hill.Kubrick comes back to the modern war genre, his previous being Fear and Desire. He definitely showed his capabilities as a director in this film by creating a war film that is intimate and personal. Kubrick understands the importance of substance over style and that making this film more character driven, it haves the audience care about the tragic and sadness of it much more. This film definitely competes with the other Kubrick greats but it lacks the brilliance and originality that his subsequent efforts would deliver. Kubrick is not a stranger to controversy, though his most controversial films were released much later, and this film definitely created quite a buzz in certain countries which I think just supports the film's greatness.The film's photography was handled by the German cinematographer, Georg Krause. This is the only film so far I have seen from Krause's long list of films he has worked in. The film's photography may not stand out or stylistically as much as Kubrick's previous film but there are moments in here that are very memorable and excellently shot, an example would be the long shot of the camera moving down the trench seeing the soldiers just standing on the edges of the scene. The black and white photography by Krause will not have anybody turn heads and be in awe but instead it just brings the viewer into the story and have the image be appropriate in enhancing the film's themes and plot. Paths of Glory is the earliest film of Kubrick that I have taken notice of his style that allows a shot to be patient and have the characters do a long take of a scene, this makes the film feel a lot more natural and relying less on cuts in order to drive the film.Gerald Fried comes back to do the score for this film and it certainly is different from his previous film with Kubrick. Fried's score doesn't feel as cheesy or as over the top here in comparison to The Killing. The score feels very patriotic and strong. The use of drums to create that sense of tension really makes certain moments feel right. I can definitely say that his work here is much more appropriate and an improvement over his previous work.The acting aspect of the film is driven by Kirk Douglas. I have always admired his acting and he always seems to play characters that are very likable and can empathise with. Douglas shows a lot of vulnerability and compassion for his character, and this feeling is even more heightened with the supporting cast that primarily interacts with him are cold, heartless and egotistic. The stand out in the supporting cast is George Macready as he played an egotistic and cynical antagonist that polarises with Douglas moral values. It's always nice to see the usual actors that come back in Kubrick's films, as they are always playing very different characters and they always stand out.Paths of Glory is one of Kubrick's well made films and it definitely competes with the other highly acclaimed war films. It has a strong performance by Douglas, excellent direction and writing from Kubrick, and a fascinating story of the politics of war.

The black and white photography by Krause will not have anybody turn heads and be in awe but instead it just brings the viewer into the story and have the image be appropriate in enhancing the film's themes and plot. Paths of Glory is the earliest film of Kubrick that I have taken notice of his style that allows a shot to be patient and have the characters do a long take of a scene, this makes the film feel a lot more natural and relying less on cuts in order to drive the film.Gerald Fried comes back to do the score for this film and it certainly is different from his previous film with Kubrick. Fried's score doesn't feel as cheesy or as over the top here in comparison to The Killing. The score feels very patriotic and strong. The use of drums to create that sense of tension really makes certain moments feel right. I can definitely say that his work here is much more appropriate and an improvement over his previous work.The acting aspect of the film is driven by Kirk Douglas. I have always admired his acting and he always seems to play characters that are very likable and can empathise with. Douglas shows a lot of vulnerability and compassion for his character, and this feeling is even more heightened with the supporting cast that primarily interacts with him are cold, heartless and egotistic. The stand out in the supporting cast is George Macready as he played an egotistic and cynical antagonist that polarises with Douglas moral values. It's always nice to see the usual actors that come back in Kubrick's films, as they are always playing very different characters and they always stand out.Paths of Glory is one of Kubrick's well made films and it definitely competes with the other highly acclaimed war films. It has a strong performance by Douglas, excellent direction and writing from Kubrick, and a fascinating story of the politics of war.

Paths of Glory is the best of his overlooked films. Before watching this, I heard so many great things about it but I always try to be objective when I come into a movie to avoid unrealistic expectations and prevent myself to be too excited or disappointed.Paths of Glory is based on the book of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb. The screenplay was written by Kubrick, Jim Thompson and Calder Willingham. Thompson and Kubrick have previously worked together on The Killing and I thought they did a decent job on that one. Paths of Glory is definitely an excellent tale of loyalty, mercy, sacrifice and the politics of war. There are many war films that fail to captivate me but this one has such a great story and such an empathetic and likable protagonist that the film had me engaged the whole way through. The film's dialogue, in my opinion, is much better written here in comparison to Kubrick's previous film as it felt more realistic and doesn't try to stand out. I understand that both films are totally different in genre and style but I am just judging it with what works for me personally. People who expect the film to show more chilling and intense action sequence may be disappointed as there is only one area of the film that contains this, but I didn't mind it because it's great plot made up for it. There are definitely some stand out scenes in this film including the ending, the courtroom and the charge on Ant Hill.Kubrick comes back to the modern war genre, his previous being Fear and Desire. He definitely showed his capabilities as a director in this film by creating a war film that is intimate and personal. Kubrick understands the importance of substance over style and that making this film more character driven, it haves the audience care about the tragic and sadness of it much more. This film definitely competes with the other Kubrick greats but it lacks the brilliance and originality that his subsequent efforts would deliver. Kubrick is not a stranger to controversy, though his most controversial films were released much later, and this film definitely created quite a buzz in certain countries which I think just supports the film's greatness.The film's photography was handled by the German cinematographer, Georg Krause. This is the only film so far I have seen from Krause's long list of films he has worked in. The film's photography may not stand out or stylistically as much as Kubrick's previous film but there are moments in here that are very memorable and excellently shot, an example would be the long shot of the camera moving down the trench seeing the soldiers just standing on the edges of the scene.

Its true this movie is a fresh take on the slasher genre and Freddy is a wonderfully designed character. The kills are great which is usually all I need to enjoy this type of movie. However a few things bother me when it comes to not only this one but the whole series.(Relax I am only reviewing what I think of this one and not the series).First off the comparisons between this and Friday the 13th is ridiculous. FT13 simplifies the slasher genre and makes it fun and gory and is one of the FEW slashers where you actually root for the bad guy. Here we have a child killer(admit he was a pervert to) who comes to you in your dreams. While most people say he is scarier than other slashers because you can not get away from your dreams, you can't get away from Jason either since he can not die. Also when Freddy does come to the real world he always gets his @$$ kicked. Onto the film.I won't talk of the story because in slashers its always basic. Instead I will talk of the concept. I love Wes Craven's works and think Scream was a great slasher series. The ideas presented in this movie are great concepts. I mean a serial killer all burnt up with a glove on his right hand with knives on each finger is a great design. He invades your dreams and kills you off in sick ways. While it is interesting I just do not find this movie to be all that great. While the later ones get more humor put in, I feel this one has just as much black humor and I think it works against it. Freddy has great one liners but a character needs more than that in slashers. The kills are good like I said earlier but they still don't entertain me as much as FT13's or Halloween's. I will admit the remake that came out in 2010 had a lot of problems with it. The pacing was pretty bad and while I enjoyed the kills, I wish they wouldn't have copied some of the kills from the original. However the one shining character in the remake is Jackie Earl's portrayal of Freddy. Robert England did a good job but Jackie actually makes Freddy menacing. I believe with a more original story put behind it he could become a great Freddy. Also for all you fans saying FT13 turned slashers into cliché's. I agree to a point but NOES does the same. This has original ideas but the series would go on to do what all successful slasher series do and get made for the cash. Maybe I will do a report on these two franchises and show what each did do and didn't compared to the other. IN till then this movie stays at a 6 outta 10. It is a good movie with original ideas but I don't find Freddy all that creepy or interesting. If you haven't seen it don't let my review stop you from seeing it.

And no viewer with half a brain would think any the worse of the Poles based on this movie, because it is FICTION.How do we know it is fiction?

Some of them were based on real people, they say Hester Wallace on Mavis Batey, who died at 92 this month (and the reason I watched this). However, the real Batey seems to have played a far more key role in breaking Enigma than portrayed.

Here's what is true in the movie There were Enigma machines, there was a Bletchley Park, there was a Katyn Massacre, there were convoys crossing the Atlantic, there was a Shark code, there was a World War II.

Did England actually sink a German U-boat off Scotland and get its Enigma machine (actually, they didn't need the machines, they needed the code books)?The movie wallows in flashbacks for the first half, (sometimes to things that happened just minutes earlier (I think -- it is hard to tell when they happened)). Frankly, I don't think I was intelligent enough to follow them. (Heck, I didn't even understand the beginning of the movie, like why Jericho was persona non grata from the project -- the movie never says what was so terrible that he had done. (I decided to take notes as I watched, but I was still lost.)) And the explanations at the end just made it all the more confusing. Yes, I got the basic plot, but the details looked like a fast sleight of hand game of follow the peanut. I never really cared. Sure, Claire was a red herring (any suspect so early on has to be). But why not just let the internal investigator handle the evidence, rather than risk jail? (Because then there wouldn't be much of a movie.) And where did that nice shiny car come from that they were driving all over the place, like Scotland, (not to mention the tightly rationed gas (which they call petrol))? Frankly, there were far too many totally implausible components to the story.Enigma is supposed to be Britain's revenge on Universal Pictures for making a fictional movie about Americans capturing a fictional Enigma machine from a fictional German sub. So they make a movie about the brilliant work done at Bletchley Park. (Except that in Enigma, the British intelligence agents can't find their own missing Enigma machine hidden hurriedly in a motionless car sitting right in front of them. I'm not sure I would brag about this..).But was this actually made by a British movie studio?

Now I'm nearer Lester's age, I look at the film from a different angle (you could say) and it's still marvelous.Plenty of comedy here, but there are also lots of subtle points about normality, meaningless jobs, beauty. Each one of these ideas could take up a film in themselves.

The film moves at a slow pace, but it is still very entertaining to watch from it's beginning to the end, it's plot is also engaging and keeps us interested in finding out what will happen next. While the Green Mile has it's share of amusing scenes, it is a completely serious movie. As a matter of fact emotional might be more accurate. This movie has so many scenes that are just sad and may make you tear up. I try my best not to cry during movies, even during very sad scenes, but I just couldn't control myself while watching the Green Mile, many scenes just touch your heart and the tears will start falling down. The ending was also good but also very sad at the same time, but after this film ended I was simply in awe after watching such a magnificent work of art. The Green Mile is a 3 hours long mesmerizing masterpiece.The acting is almost perfect almost all actors play their role perfectly, Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan are fantastic in their roles, although i wish Michael got more screen time in the first half of the film. Sam Rockwell and Doug Hutchison play their villainous characters perfectly and really make you want to hate them. The actors who portray the prisoners and show innocence make you feel sympathy for them, like the guards in this movie, and you realize they really do regret what they did, and when they are executed you can't help but feel sad, at least from the inside. But the casting is almost perfect, the actors portray the characters next to perfection, specially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, as a matter of fact King himself said he had imagined Hanks in the role of Paul Edgecomb.The music and direction is also brilliant, Frank Darabont did a fantastic job of portraying king's other book into film (ShawShank Redemption) and he continues his success with the Green Mile. He is a magnificent director, I just wish he does more movies based on King's book, because King + Darabont simply results in magic on screen. While almost perfect, the Green Mile's slow pace, long duration and large amount of emotional scenes do it's replay value no favors, also I find it hard to believe that all prisoners on death row are so civil and nice towards the guards and vice versa, it maybe explained in the book but I find it unrealistic, also the twist that was revealed near the end, in the flashback, just seemed random and ironic, they could have gone in another direction and used another method to bring more light to the truth.

I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie based on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and The Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite receiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult following, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely managed to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the best films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and engaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and follows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont also made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also based on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic portrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back in the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed more accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked, and the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie, however I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the movie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have watched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit through again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times, it also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments, the ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red and Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained things in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley for Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal earnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble. Also the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary because it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and got his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal opinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas behind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was unnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least showing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion because even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that which year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it still lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his performance Red Ellis Redding, he also narrates many parts of the film and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well and really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid back prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy Dufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his smirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are just tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have done better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no doubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not saying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as he was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the direction is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very accurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is also mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with an in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at its time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of mistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250 lists it.Overall 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 November 2013","score":"","review":" The Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made my Frank Darabont.

And you ask yourself What...in the world did I just watch? Requiem is one of those rare movies that, really, has no weakness. Usually there's one actor\/actress that just ruins the movie a little bit, or the choice of music is bad, or the style of directing doesn't fit the story. This movie fires on all cylinders. Darren Aronofsky directs his gem with this movie. It's the movie that appears at the top of his directing resume. Jared Leto turns in the performance of a lifetime. Marlon Wayans was fantastic, turning in a performance you don't expect to see out of him. But the best acting was done by the great Ellen Burstyn. By the end of the movie, your heart feels so broken by what she's become. The transformation of her character ties a knot in your throat. There was a scene in the movie (don't worry, no spoilers) where I was sitting in my chair, watching her character progress. And I kept thinking stop it. Just stop it. Please. This movie is the best movie that portrays the downfalls of drug abuse. IF you ever want to scare someone straight, recommend this movie to them.I loved this movie...but I don't think I can stand watching it again. It's too heartbreaking.

Still, I'd change that pair of gray socks for a pair of black socks anytime.The plot is full of surprises and it's quite hard to predict anything until much later in the movie, so be prepared for quite a few twists along the movie.

The latter films are two I'd consider to be some of the strongest dramas of recent years, while A Few Good Men I'd consider to be one of the more overrated. This is a film that proves that if something easily-digestible, spelled out enough for the audience, given a reasonable amount of believability and unbelievability, and have some A-list stars at its core, that it can make American audiences mistake an adequate movie for a great movie.With the high-praise the film has garnered, it would seem that Americans want recognizable faces, long-winded dialogs that come off as rants, unrealistic behavior in a mature setting, and redundancy in their court films rather than a film that relies on plausible characters and wasn't so reliant on trying to get their actors to spew out the next monologue that feels as if it should be concluded by a deafening applause.The story concerns the death of a marine at the Guantanamo Naval Air Station on account of a hazing incident. Two Marines are in custody and Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) is assigned to the case, along with the lazy, back-talking Navy Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), who just happens to have a polished record of settling court cases. Lieutenant Kaffee is certain they could settle this dispute out of court, with the additional help of Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), until they discover that the hazing incident may've been ordered by the strict and self-assured Colonel Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson). The film details the proceedings on the side of the defendant as well as the lengthy trial, where Lieutenant Commander Galloway and Lieutenant Kaffee go up against Kevin Bacon's Jack Ross, a Captain in the Marines.The scenes that concern planning the trial and formulating arguments range from intriguing to monotonous, depending on Sorkin's focus at the time. When the three Marines look to analyze their arguments and hunt for witnesses make up the film's strongest hour, combined with the energy provided by the cast. When Lieutenant Kaffee throws a fit because Galloway and Weinberg are going in a different direction from him is when the film stalls and goes nowhere. Don't get me started on the drunken fit of rage he has towards the end, which is nothing but a tacked-on obligation in storytelling. I can't believe I'll ever say such a thing about Sorkin's writing style, which is usually subtle and very conversational.Unsurprisingly, the most intense work comes during the court scenes, but they themselves have an odd staged feeling to them. Simply put, the characters don't seem to talk like real people in court, but rather people putting on a show for the courts and an audience, as if the trial is being televised. It's also safe to say that Kaffee's behavior is not only something that becomes grating on a particular viewer, as it does the characters in the film, but it is also one of the more unrealistic elements of the movie. I'm not wholly knowledgeable on the military, but I have enough to make the inference that a Lieutenant Commander would likely not tolerate the verbal cockiness and disrespect provided by that of a lower Lieutenant. Especially a female Lieutenant Commander, who likely had to prove herself to be granted such a position.It's that and the utter nonsense the film puts us through, such as the film's conclusion, which makes no mistake at a flag-waving moral that attempts to make us shed a tear. What comes before this, on the contrary, is a very solid speech by Nicholson that has some truth and honesty to it (was I not supposed to side with him in the long run?) By the end of the film, I found myself liking Colonel Jessup a bit more than our protagonist Kaffee. Unlike Kaffee, who talks in the condescending way that he knows everything, Jessup could pass for knowing everything, being older, being more experienced, and more intelligent in the long run. I'm not saying Cruise does a poor job at portraying Kaffee, it's just his character is made a grating, unrealistic Marine stereotype instead of a person we can find appealing outside his shell of arrogance.A Few Good Men does have one subversive quality and that is it's able to refuse adding a relationship subplot between Lieutenant Commander Galloway and Lieutenant Kaffee, unheard of for a film as mainstream-Hollywood as this. At the beginning of the film, based on what I thought was downplayed mutual attraction between Kaffee and Galloway, I was fully expecting a relationship to brew between the two, but one never brews. This is a delightfully mature element for Sorkin, who provides just a taste at what he'd do later in his career. He would later become more skilled at handling numerous characters, events, subplots, and small instances that take place over a long period of time. In A Few Good Men, he feels like he's doing ample work on a project for screen writing. The more I watched the film, the more I wished for a documentary on how military men and women are able to twirl their weapons and perform drills, marches, and stances with incredible precision, which is what the film opens with.Starring Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak, Jack Nicholson, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kevin Bacon. Directed by Rob Reiner.
