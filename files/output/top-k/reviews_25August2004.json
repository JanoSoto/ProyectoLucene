[{"date":"25 August 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Assumed to be the finale in the popular post-modern horror franchise, Scream 3 succeeds as a basic shock-and-thrill ride.  The film is intended to rounded off the plotlines started in the first film, but this has been done awkwardly and would have worked better had the original writer, Kevin Williamson, not decided to pass up scripting duties.Story sees the heroine from the first two films hiding out in the California backwoods to escape the attentions of any more potential killers. Gale (Courteney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette) are now working in L.A., where they hear reports of another killer who has targeted the cast of Stab 3, leaving photos of Sidney's dead mother behind with his victims.  Sidney goes to L.A. to help her friends uncover the killer, receiving some really freaky flashbacks about her past in the process.The shocks and frights of this movie are on par with what has gone before.  This one contains visibly less blood and gore, and is more dependent on short, sharp, shocks and in this it succeeds greatly.  Unfortunately, when the killer is revealed it sorely lacks the impact this moment had in the first two films and the motive is over-elaborate and unconvincing in it's explanation.The Woodsboro setting in the movie-within-a-movie, Stab 3, would have worked better had this been the actual setting for the movie. By making the setting a movie studio and accelerating the self-referential humour (which, for it's presence, was previously just an aside), screenwriter Ehron Kruger has fragmented the emphasis on the characters.  Therefore it is little wonder the ending lacks logic and impact.  To be fair, there were so many Internet rumours about the probable outcome of this series it is no fault of the film-makers for trying to come up with something unpredictable that still, somehow, stayed logical.  Having said that, it would have been better to come up with something predicted and logical, maximising the emotional impact, than a convoluted surprise twist.Acting-wise, there isn't much more the leads can do with their roles.  Cox's Gale Weathers is visibly blander than the hard media woman of the first two films.  Arquette's Dewey is more confident, but that's more or less it.  Neve Campbell is still great as Sidney, especially during her flashback scenes.  Most of the other characters are undeveloped, but there are a couple of exceptions.  Lance Henrikson is good in a relatively unexplored role as a horror movie director.  Model Jenny McCarty (whose character has a part in Stab 3 wonderfully highlight's the pitfalls of playing horror movie victims, and Jamie Kennedy is excellent in a return-cameo as film geek Randy, reminding us how good his character really was.As a horror film, this is pretty good but as a Scream movie it falls dismally short.  Rumours of a fourth film still abound, but if they decide to make one, they should hand writing duties back to Kevin Williamson and do away with the leading characters once and for all.
