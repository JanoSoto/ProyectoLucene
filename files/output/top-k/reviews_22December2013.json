Ray Tango(Sylvester Stallone)and LT Gabriel Cash(Kurt Russell),two L.A.P.D cops who are considered two of the best L.A.P.D cops in L.A making many drug busts and capturing criminals which angers crime lord Yves Perret(Jack Palance)who frames Tango and Cash for the murder of a fellow cop. Now,Tango and Cash have to team up together and clear their names with thrilling and funny results.By the late 1980s and early 1990s,Action-Comedies and Buddy Cop Movies were becoming popular sub genres with Action fans thanks to the Box Office successes of Action classics such as 48 Hrs(1982,The film that started it all),Beverly Hills Cop(1984)and Lethal Weapon 1(1987)and 2(1989)and then after the releases of those films came Tango & Cash in 1989,an entertaining,Action packed and hilarious Action-Comedy that was the only film where Sylvester Stallone(Rambo series)and Kurt Russell(Escape From New York)teamed up and while Tango & Cash doesn't match the greatness of the other films I mentioned above it's a solid and underrated Buddy Cop\/Action-Comedy and one of the better Action films of the late 80s and early 90s. For 104 minutes,Tango & Cash is a wonderful movie that while not very groundbreaking or revolutionary gives viewers an Action film that keeps you glued to the screen with solid entertainment and a good time with Action,thrills and laughter and is one of those films when you're watching television and they're is nothing on you watch Tango & Cash,a movie that is not a bad way to kill time. One of the things that I like about Tango & Cash is that it's an Action film that defines an era of Action films in 1980s and early 90s with elements like a the buddy cop duo,an over the top villain,big Action gunfights and explosions embellishing every Action trademark in the book and never taking itself seriously. The Action scenes in T&C are amazing and explosive with each Action scene being loud and fast never slowing down or taking a break with non-stop intensity and wild energy that Action movies of the 1980s and 90s were known for and you can tell that every cent went into making every Action sequence work. The Comedy and laughs in the film are fantastic whether it's the back and forth banter between Tango and Cash or the interactions they have with other characters and some of the dialog and situations that happen in the movie are so over the top and silly that will make you laugh until you have tears rolling down your eyes. Tango & Cash combines Action and Comedy with great perfection and The characters Tango and Cash are a great duo that you will love and are very much in the wonderful tradition of Lethal Weapon's Riggs and Murtaugh and 48 Hrs' Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond the two don't have much in common in terms of personalities and styles(Tango dresses in suits like a banker where as Cash is more rugged dressing in t-shirt and jeans)but as the film goes on the two begin to like each other and start to work together. The scenes Tango and Cash have together are hilarious and fun with both characters spouting off great one-liners and dialog that is sarcastic and memorable. Tango and Cash are one of the reasons if not the main reason the movie works. The ending of Tango & Cash is amazing and filled with great Action and explosive thrills and will make you smile and cheer at the screen. A brilliant conclusion.The whole cast is great. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell are excellent,hilarious ans at their best as Tango and Cash,with Stallone and Russell having great chemistry and wonderful scenes together. Teri Hatcher is wonderful and sexy as Katherine 'Kiki' Tango,a dancer and Tango's sister. Jack Palance is terrific and memorable as Yves Perret,a crime lord that doesn't like Tango and Cash. Brion James is outstanding as Reguin,Perret's right hand man. James Hong and Marc Alaimo are great as Quan and Lopez,associates of Perret. Geoffrey Lewis is fantastic as Captain Schroeder,Tango's commanding officer. Michael J. Pollard is funny and memorable as Owen,a friend of Tango's. Robert D'Zar is menacing as Face,a criminal Tango busted. Lewis Arquette(Wyler),Eddie Bunker(Captain Holmes),Clint Howard(Slinky),Roy Brocksmith(Fed. Agent Davis)and Phillip Tan(Chinese Gunman)give good performances as well.The direction by Andrey Konchalovskiy and Albert Magnoli is fantastic and stylish,with Konchalovskiy and Magnoli keeping the film going at a great pace while doing wonderful jobs with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Konchalovskiy and Magnoli.The score by Harold Faltermeyer is great,intense and memorable matching the energy and pace of the movie. Fine score,Faltermeyer There is also a song during the end credits by Bad English(Best Of What I got)Great song. In final word,if you love Action-Comedies,Buddy Cop Movies,Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell,I highly suggest you see Tango & Cash,a terrific,entertaining,Action-packed and hilarious Buddy Cop\/Action-Comedy that is Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell at their best.

But Amityville 3 doesn't even stack up to Friday the 13th part 3 or Jaws 3. It may however be better than Treasure of the Four Crows, but that is hardly a ringing endorsement. Despite what appears to be a strong cast, and an intriguing premise, Amityville 3 quickly dissolves into a tame special effects dominated rip-off of Poltergeist.Having never seen part 2 of this series, I will have to assume this story somewhat picks up where the prior film left off. We begin with a reporter investigating the house of record which is currently occupied by scam artists living off the place's reputation. Once they are gone, the reporter is offered the chance to buy the house dirt cheap. He being recently divorced, and needing a quiet space to write a novel, decides to take the chance. Take it from this writer; solitude can be helpful, provided your house is neither haunted like this one, nor a dump like my old place in Lincoln. Anyway, even BEFORE this guy moves in, people start turning up dead around the place. Still, like all horror movie morons, he moves in. He even sets up a room in the notorious attic for his teen-aged daughter when she is able to visit. By the end of the film, we might as well be calling her Carol Ann.I won't say much more about this plot, since it moves ahead predictably, and without too many scares. Probably the most entertainment one can garner from these early 80s 3D movies is laughing at the obvious prop setups they need to remind you why you shelled out an extra buck or two for the glasses. There are several instances of objects (like the customary flies of this series) buzzing right in front of the camera. Also stationary objects such as arms and technical gear thrust out into a close-up. Oooh! Scary!! This film really does have a decent cast, though. Tony Roberts as the reporter is a talented actor, but maybe just lacks the physical screen presence to be a true star. Ben Stiller has smaller ears! Lori Laughlin and a young Meg Ryan are both competent and pretty. Candy Clark is like a poor woman's JoBeth Williams. Tess Harper has done better work than this. The conclusion will leave you dis-satisfied to say the least. Its one of those endings where it just looks like they ran out of both time and money. Overall, the whole thing certainly should have been the final nail in the coffin of this franchise. Alas, too many people must have shelled out some cash to see this instead of Stroker Ace. 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.

I just watched it for the first time and did not like it...And I wanted, really. I like old movies, I get a nice feeling watching old classics and I enjoy some over sentimental holiday movie at the right season, but this one just didn't do it for me.I do like the main idea. That no matter how disappointed you are about your life and yourself, just take a step back and see how you may have affected other people's lives. How many good things would not have happened if you weren't there. This is all nice, but I didn't like how it was made and presented.It is sooooo loooong and boring until the last 20 minutes or so when the angel finally shows him the world without him. And you know what, it seems it would have been better if he wasn't born. Seriously, what is so bad about Potterville? It has entertainment and people having fun? Oh how evil, so immoral! Apparently life is only good if you don't have fun and never pursue your dreams!.Don't like George's character either. He is the one who never went for what he wanted.

I found the movie to be a little bit dull with all the office and court room scenes. Most of the film is debating if Santa Claus is real or not. I don't think a lot of modern day children can sit down and watch a film like this. This movie seems more targeted for adults than young children. Even for adults, the way the movie flows is a bit slow pace. It might be great at the time, but clearly it's a harder Christmas film to watch, now then then. I don't understand why it's titled Miracle on 34th Street in the first place when there is hardly a miracle, in the film. A miracle is a surprising and welcome event that is not explicable by natural or scientific laws and is therefore considered to be the work of a divine agency. We don't see any supernatural actions from Macy department store employee Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwynn) here in this film; No, North Pole factory show, no elves making toys, and no flying with his reindeer. It was all grounded in semi realistic terms. Because of that reason, I can't say this movie is truly has a miracle or not. The movie doesn't really made it clear, that Kringle is or isn't Claus. Even if he did, he didn't really prove anything that he is. I like the United Kingdom title better, the Big Heart. Directed by George Seaton and based on the story by Valentine Davies, this movie is market for a Christmas holiday crowd, yet the movie was released in May 1947 for some odd reason. At less, they could had release it near Thanksgiving as the film starts off on that holiday. Gwenn does a great job as the role of Santa Claus, both acting charming and childlike, but he didn't look the part in my opinion. He was bit slimmer than what normally people think of Santa. I'm glad he won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Academy Award. Maureen O'Hara does a great job as Macy Director Doris Walker who Kris is trying to convince he is the real Santa. The movie took a big risk by making Doris, a young divorcée in this. Divorce show on film was so unheard of, at the time. A lot of families didn't like image of seeing this, and complained when this movie came out. Thank God, time has change to the point, that divorcees aren't picture as scarlet letter black mark adulteries anymore. It was a bit a negative stereotype at the time, that if you were divorce, you were a bad parent. I think the producers made her, a divorcée so that they can represent her lack of faith in things and Maureen O'Hara does a great way showing it. Her lack of faith is shaken when she sees Kris conversing in Dutch with an adopted girl who does not know English. This is one of the best scenes in the film. Natalie Wood, child actress at the time, stars as Doris Walker's young daughter, Susan whom Doris has raised not to believe in Santa Claus. When she finds out that he might be the real deal, she had such expression on her face that makes you wonder Gwinn is indeed truly is Santa Claus. She didn't seem like she was acting, at all. According to Natalie Wood's biographer, during the shoot, the young actress was convinced that Gwenn was actually Santa. It wasn't until Wood later, she realized he wasn't Santa. Last actor worth noting is Fred Gailey (John Payne) he fight the courts by showing that Kris Kringle is indeed Santa Claus. He's pretty good, but under looked by critics for his performance. I think Macy have mixed feelings when this movie came out as the movie paint the retail giant as bit greedy. Yet, the movie was giving them so much good ad-product placement for people to come to their stores. A lot of people don't like this movie because of those reasons and the fact that Krigle is telling people to share the wealth in the film. Some people see it, as an example of promoting the virtues of socialism against capitalism, while others think the movie is a bit hypocrite as it promoting capitalism, more than helping Christmas regain its originally intent. Some people think the film is about a metaphor about faith with Santa representing God, asking people to return to pre- modern skeptic society without free thinking. While others, believe that the film is against religion, forcing people to believe in a commercials market symbol such as Santa over Jesus or God. Other sees it as paean to homosexuality because Kringle and Gailey sharing beds. Then there are those who see the bubble scene, and yanking of the bed, as child molestation, because Kringle is trying to prove he is Santa to Susan. I can see where they are mistaken, but I don't think it's like that at all. I do see some faults in the film, besides being dull. I didn't like how the movie cut one of the best scenes in the film. Some DVD versions don't have the scene that ties the loose end in the courtroom scene with the football helmet gift. I think it should be added back to most of the DVDs, if not, as an extra feature. Another fault is the color version. It really doesn't match well so watch the Black & White version. There are four remakes of the movie, as well as a Broadway musical. Don't watch the 1974 version. 1994 version is a little better, but doesn't match up with this original film. Overall Watch this version, a good movie to watch with the family on a nice Christmas day or any other day. It's just not the most entertaining film ever.

The Nightmare before Christmas is often mistaken as a Tim Burton's film. While Tim Burton did indeed produce and helped write the story when it was first thought out as a poem. It was director Henry Selick that made the movie that most people all love. I will give mad props to Selick and the hundreds of animators that work on this 74 minutes film as the stop motion in this film is amazing. There were little to minor mistakes, that aren't very noticeable. The movie tells the story of Jack Skellington (Voice by Chris Sarandon), a skeleton from Halloween Town whom is having a identify crisis, he is tired of celebrating Halloween. In a state of depression, he wanders off into the forest, only to finds himself in Christmas Town. He found the holiday very fascinating and decides to steal that holiday instead; that leaded to deadly consequences. I think there is a lot of symbolism in the film that mirrors how modern society Christmas is so different than the original holiday in which it was based on. There are several trees with special doors on them by their symbols it is clear they are portals to other holiday worlds. However, Jack finds it difficult to come up with definitions for these symbols. His followers are also unfamiliar with these themes can only relate them with what they see in their normal Halloween culture. Jack has an abstract definition that he has learnt through books, but he never gets a chance to live and experience the meaning of Christmas. This leaves him with an unclear vision, and therefore an unclear understanding how it works. Like Jack Skellington, modern society know little of what Christmas is really about; only knowing it as the capitalism materialism ritual form. Thus, Christmas have become less about spreading love, and more on what society deed is what it an expression of love. Modern Christmas due to appealing nature, has began to become too big and popular to the point that it over-lapped the other holidays. While this might seem like a good thing, it does disinterest or lost of others cultural traditions. The film took inspirations from older stop motion television specials classics like 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with its style. I like how Halloween Town, looks like something out of a German Expressionism film. The score in the movie is amazing by Danny Elfman. I love all the songs in this film from 'Kidnapping the Santa Claws', 'Sally's Song' to What's this?. All of them are beautiful to the ears. The songs have often been cover over the years by bands like Fall Out Boy, Korn, All-American Rejects, Flyleaf, Panic at the Disco, Marilyn Manson, and others. I think the Fall Out Boys is the best cover. The movie might seem a bit too scary for little children. Hints why Disney decided to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner. Due to the popularity of the film, Walt Disney Pictures has reissued the film annually under their Disney Digital 3-D format from 2006 until 2009, making it the first stop-motion animated feature to be entirely converted to 3-D. I saw the 2D and 3D versions, and I don't see much of a different, really. The supporting cast was very interesting. Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), a gambling-addict bogeyman who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake is one of the best Disney villains ever. I don't find the character as racist as of some members of NAACP due to its jiving and dancing nature. Oogie Boogie is a bogeyman type creature, not Black-face. That's total nonsense, NAACP. It's weird in a way, that Catherine O'Hara voice Sally A rag doll-like creature that is Jack's love interest as Sally doesn't sound like O'Hara at all. Glenn Shadix as Mayor of Halloween Town An enthusiastic leader who conducts town meetings was hilarious with his wild mood swings. I just didn't like the Santa Claus's character.

The end, particularly, has drawn oceans of tears from hundreds of millions of eyes (the play book is a best-seller).But before giving my own appreciation on the film, one has to know the following facts  - There was actually a Cyrano de Bergerac, in the middle of the 17th century, and, except for the love story, he was EXACTLY what he is portrayed in the film, and perhaps even more interestingly so, in that he is considered a precursor of the enlightment and perhaps agnosticism ; he composed also incredibly touching poems about nature, yet one just needs to know that the most historically accurate fact in the film is his famous fight, and victory, against one hundred henchmen at the Porte de Buci, which was related by many written accounts of the time, to understand that he was a larger than life, extraordinary character.- The french play writer Edmond Rostand, by the end of the XIX century became engrossed with this almost forgotten historical figure, and decided to revive him in a play, adding a love plot, using the historically attested, enormous but not particularly ugly, nose of Cyrano, as the catalyst for the story. The play was instantly a triumph and never ceased so, despite a curious use of the metric and some arguably convoluted verses, but the emotion is so there that no one in his mind can resist it ; this play is almost entirely respected in the film, verse for verse.- Now the film in itself  first, hats off to Jean-Paul Rappeneau for his recreation of XVII th century Paris  it isn't a film played in this era, it is a film LIVED in this era ; one must watch it to believe it! it's an absolute shock, never have I felt such an immersion in time! the costumes, the streets, the houses, the light, the settings, the people, everything feels (and probably is) authentic.- But especially hats off to Gérard Depardieu, who has understood the character so well, turning his frustration into bursts of pure fury, yet showing the widest palette of emotions, the deepest gallantry, the deepest sorrow, with such delicacy...If it were just for his act, one should watch the film. it's not for nothing that this is considered his career's pinnacle.I have only two negative remarks to make  First, Anne Brochet as Roxanne isn't convincing enough in my opinion, and she isn't as radiantly beautiful as I would have liked, but her role is difficult (who wouldn't be turned off eventually by such a pretentious lady nowadays?), and she acts magnificently during the end scene.Second, the fight scenes with Gérard Depardieu are more reminiscent of his role to come as Obelix, rather as to the finest fencer of his day ; now, one has to understand that the real Cyrano was only twenty when he did all his exploits, before being gravely injured on battle at twenty-two, and that good old Gégé was probably well in his thirties in the film...For the rest  a must watch, absolutely.

A lonely, insomniac, mentally unstable cab driver does his job. All while plotting to cleanse the city of human trash. Welcome to a real-life nightmare Taxi Driver.With an omniscient feeling of loneliness (symbolized by a taxi) present in Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), our anti-hero protagonist has his one element that anybody who has ever experienced loneliness in their life can relate to. However, anyone who shoots up a brothel and attempts to assassinate a senator is by no means a role model. Travis Bickle (despite his one trait that an audience can relate to) is such an emotionally disturbed person that he sees very irrational actions as perfectly sane, making him a danger to himself and to other people. The phenomenal score by Bernard Herrmann (known for composing scores for Alfred Hitchcock from 1956-1964) reflects everything about Travis. His insanity, loneliness, bigotry, and instability are all represented in a way that hypnotizes the listener in a cocktail of sound.Travis is a man that has nothing to live for in life. His infatuation with Betsy is doomed to go nowhere. He feels the need to lie to his parents (in the form of a letter) to make his life look better than the boring reality. Travis cannot discern rationally what deeds are right or wrong and, quite frankly, I doubt that he cares.The climactic final shootout (which threatened to give this movie a X rating) is an intense scene that has not lost an ounce of power today. As a kid born in the mid-90's, I can only imagine what effect images like a man having his hand blown apart by Travis's Magnum .45 had on 1976 audiences. The scene also drives home the extent of Travis's fragile mental state.Overall, this is a masterwork from Martin Scorsese. Possibly even THE masterwork (GoodFellas and Raging Bull create tough company) of his entire career. A disturbing wonder (more so for me as I am a high- functioning autistic) of the cinema that is telling of our society and of the human psyche. There are few classics in cinema that have withstood the test of time (in terms of multiple decades) in a way in which they have only become more relevant than when they were initially released. Taxi Driver is certainly one such movie.

The violence blindly perpetrated by the cowboys (one in particular) in the opening scene sets into motion a tale of retribution as deadly as it is (alas) natural and believable. A tragedy unfolds in which the innocent - Innocent of what?? - are as likely to meet their end as much as the guilty. Why each character wants what they want, why they believe what they believe, and where they are coming from in their life experiences is revealed by singularly brilliant plotting and dialogue.

The ending - sometimes criticised - strikes the perfect balance of credibility and 'miracle' legends can be truth or lie, or a mixture of the two.The flawless plot-structure is imbued with an elegiac style, deriving from Eastwood's directorial genius, and no small musical talent (he wrote the simple but memorable guitar theme, which frames the movie along with the beautiful cinematic prologue and epilogue). The measure of Unforgiven's greatness can be seen in the many quotations which resonate in the mind ever-after - I've killed just about everything that walks or crawls at one time or another - likewise the visual images, such as the dark, dismal downpours in Big Whiskey or the beauty of the landscape it is situated in, both of which are important supports to the psychology of the movie.

I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better. At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 December 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This might be the greatest performance I've ever seen from an actress. Gloria Swanson is simply magnificent here and I kept getting mixed feelings from her character throughout the film as she can be vulnerable, manipulative, caring and obsessive, always imposing a strong screen presence. Sunset Boulevard is a masterful work on all fronts. From the technical standpoint, there are some very creative and stylish shots like the underwater pool sequence and the majestic closing scene. There's also strong character development as you notice how one's preconceptions towards the other can easily change as the story progresses and the dynamics between them also evolves. Even the secondary characters are memorable and lead to interesting turn of events. Another aspect I really enjoyed was the meticulous narration by Joe Gillis. He gives a detailed description of his thinking process and the presence of witty humor constantly made the film a very entertaining as well as absorbing watch. Sunset Boulevard works brilliantly as a metaphor to the end of an era in Hollywood and is certainly deserving of its cult status.
