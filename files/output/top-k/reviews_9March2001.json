If I met that executive, I would grab that person by the back of their pants and shirt and throw that person out of a ten story building window.  And with my guess that person gave David Arquette a film deal because of his wife, Courtney Cox.  Maybe it was to cut down her asking price to do another season of FRIENDS?  Anyways, SEE SPOT RUN is another film that you wonder why was this film made, and why didn't the money for the cost of this film go to help the hungry in Africa, or cut down the homless factor in America.  I think the studios would get better publicity and press by doing humanity work than releasing pieces of garbage like this.          There are so many things wrong with this movie.  The plot?  Simple, a dog who is the K-9 unit of the FBI caputres mob boss Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), causing Sonny to lose one of his testies.  Sonny misses his testie, so he has a hit man, Gino (Joe Viterelli) go out and kill the dog, animal rights activists where are you when we need you!!! K-9 goes and hides with a dog hating mailman Gordon (David Arquette) and a little boy (Angus T. Jones) that is the son of a girl that Gordon is trying to impress (Leslie Bibb).  And federal agent Murdoch (Michael Clarke Duncan) thinks that the K-9 is in federal protection and doesn't know that the dog's life is in danger.  There is your multi-million dollar plot!  And it cost a lot less money to buy the scripts of such movies as RESERVOIR DOGS, DESPERADO, CROUCHING TIGER, and even TITANIC!!!!         Why oh why do studio executives greenlight these films?!?!?  Simple, they see a dollar product.  Good, bad, who cares?  Let's just see how much money it will make.  Says the nasty executive, and when it's out on video, let's make a copy of it be $14.99 so every house hold in America will own a copy.  Hey, every house hold in America already has a piece of garbage in their houses, and the garbage man comes by weekly to pick it up.  Why would anyone want to take home garbage?        What ittitaes me first is seeing good actors like Michael Clarke Duncan, Anthony Andersen, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Viterelli in this film.  I don't know why the talented Andersen is doing bad movies, he's  very talented, he should be staring in films of his own.  Michael Clarke Duncan, well, he'll be forgiven since he's going to be in PLANET OF THE APES later this summer.  But Paul Sorvino and Joe Viterelli aren't so lucky.  They are casted, again, as mafia men, which is another example of Hollywood cast-typing.  How could Paul Sorvino eleven years later go from doing GOODFELLAS to this?  And how could Joe Viterelli go from doing ANALYZE THIS to...well, this? As for Mr. 1-800-CALL-ATT?

They are kept  apart by circumstances of the plot. And finally, by the time we reach the bottom of our popcorn boxes, they get back together again. Whether it's Gable and Colbert in 1934, or Lopez and McConaughey in 2001, we love romantic comedies. But let's face it, some are better than others (and few are better than Frank Capra's Oscar-winning classic, It Happened One Night).Mary Fiore (Lopez) is a whiz of a wedding planner who seems to be leading the glamorous good life, until you learn that she spends her off hours watching Antiques Road Show or playing scrabble with her father (Alex Rocco), a first generation Italian. While hurrying across a San Francisco street one day, her Gucci pump gets caught in a grate just as a runaway dumpster hurtles towards her. The white-coated white knight who comes to her rescue is pediatrician Steve Edison (McConaughey), and thus the familiar cycle of the romantic comedy is set in motion. This cute meet is followed by a cute date, her first in four years (if you can believe that of a Lopez character!). Then, of course, come the complications He is about to be married and she is the one who has been hired to plan it; and her own marriage is being arranged by her determined dad.In the best romantic comedies, the filmmakers set up interesting and believable barriers for the characters to overcome on their way to the Big Kiss. In this film, the question is Why they don't just get together right away? The answer contrived plotting won't let them. One doubts, for example, that a character as smart as Mary would even consider consenting to her father's meddlesome matchmaking.But rather than tell a compelling story, the filmmakers seem satisfied to simply provide an attractive vehicle for the two stars, and to furnish a few good laughs along the way. The attraction of the leads is unquestionable, and that alone has filled theaters with admiring fans. Supporting characters, though not fully developed, provide a full measure of amusement Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough, rescued from canceled TV shows, are hilarious as the newly rich, tipsy parents of McConaughey 's would-be bride (Wilson-Sampras). The direction of the film is snappy, with accomplished camera work, brisk editing and lively choreography during the forties-style dance scenes. The look of the film is also greatly enhanced by its San Francisco setting.So, if you want to see two of today's good looking stars looking good, see this film. If you want to see an excellent romantic comedy, rent It Happened One Night.Rating 2 stars out of 4###  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 March 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Wedding Planner (2001) Directed by Adam Shankman.

It's good, sometimes very, very good, the fightscenes are fenomenal and the photography is stunning, but it's not a fantastic movie. Maybe if you haven't seen to many movies, or to many movies of this kind, then you could think it's the best movie in the world. I have seen to many films in my life to be shrugged at when i cast my opinion about this movie, but that is what happens.

Unfortunately for Warner Brother, the movie turns out to be even worse than you might anticipate. This predictable, disposable production is complete with  tons of desperate jokes dealing with dog poop, bad luck, inflated bubble wrap, fish tanks, clumsiness, an electrified dog collar, passing gas, and, or course, a canine sinking his incisors into a respectable man's private parts. See Spot Run proves to be painful for most adult audiences, and perhaps even a bit too amateurish for its target age group. This is just an all-around bad movie.The story contains a few funny scenes and a hysterical performance by Leslie Bibb, but everything else is a complete waste of time and money.The story opens with a powerful gangster named Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino) becoming a victim of the wrath of a canine cop's painful bite. He is caught during an FBI drug bust and holds a grudge against the authority's dog for biting off one of his family jewels. Talia orders an assassination on the dog, who is loved by the FBI's dog handler (Michael Clarke Duncan, the gentle giant from The Green Mile). When the police find out about the animal's life is in danger, they immediately rush him into a version of the witness protection program.The dog ends up in the hands of two bumbling nitwits, school-aged James (Angus T. Jones), and the much dumber Gordon (David Arquette). Gordon is baby-sitting James for a favor for his mother, Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), who finds herself out of town on business, but ends up in one amusing situation after another. Because Gordon has a conventional crush on Stephanie, he feels pressured into be a responsible individual for once. When the dog comes into contact with the targeted dog, his plan backfires and pandemonium ensue into one madhouse situation after another.See Spot Run is a classic example of how low American cinema thinks of children. The filmmakers must really think their audience is moronic for them to push a movie like this our way. Look at the recent trend of horrible family comedies. From The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,  to Snow Day to The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, Hollywood consistently demonstrates it sees little intelligence in today's young people.There was a time when kids would realize See Spot Run for the trash it truly is; the time when Beethoven felt inspiring and funny, or when Lassie felt fresh and inspiring. Now, the modern withdraw in pet movies come as dimwittedness, vulgarity, and at the expense of the movie's characters. Is it really all that entertaining going to the theater to watch a character step in doggie poo, getting his head stuck in a glass fishbowl, and become entangled in inflating plastic wrap? Come on. Those things belong in the Saturday morning cartoons. People only except them here because the production as a whole is so childish. The film tries to be a live action cartoon, and David Arquette does a good job as the animation.See Spot Run provides a few laughs, but at the same time we can feel our IQ dropping to the level of its imbecile characters.

The actors are very consistent in their acting so is the director in his camera moves etc.  He very successfully and clearly combines action and drama together.  There are real differences in his style (action vs. drama) but he, in my opinion, intricately put his drama style into the action sequences so there is a very nice structured consistensy throughout the movie but the audience can clearly differenciate between action and drama.. I sat through the movie in the theater without being taken away from the plot even once.  I want to say this again  This movie smells of experience and perfection. Also, I didn't really like Russel Crowe until I saw this movie. However, after watching this movie, I saw that the three people in The Insider, The Gladiator and Proof of Life are completely different from each other proving Crowe is an excellent actor. Nothing much to say about Meg Ryan, she's her usual self but I was very excited to see David Morse (in the role of Peter Bowman) in this movie. If I'm not mistaken it's the first time we see him in an above the avarage part.  He was always the sympathetic backup character in his movies. (The loving father in The Contact, the good friend of Tom Hanks in the green mile, or the honorable soldier in The Rock) However, this time he's given a chance to show that he can really inject character into his role and he proves he can do it. I will have one tidybidy bad comment about the movie.  The visuals also were great but I couldn't help noticing the grainyness in some images, (especially the dark tones).  This probably comes from the anamorphic process they used.  However, it doesn't really make this movie bad, it's just one unlucky detail. So, if you want to enjoy a night with your friends\/family or yourself alone, go to the movie theater and for 2.5 hours forget about the outside world and let yourself be concerned about the life of David Morse and the relationship between Terry Thorne and Alice Bowman.

Jolie's performance was powerful. Most of the supporting cast (who generally play the parts of other residents) is solid, but tend to fade into the background for the most part behind Ryder and Jolie. I thought Whoopi Goldberg was strangely cast in a rather limited role as the head nurse of the institution, who consistently challenges Kaysen to get better and get out of the place.In spite of the generally good performances, though, the story was a bit slow-moving. There were some very powerful scenes, but we seem to have to endure long stretches of relative boredom to get to them. The plodding storyline does move, however, to a strong climax. We just have to wait far too long to get there! Overall, I can't say this is any better than a very average movie, and I would rate it as a 5\/10.

It succeeds on many levels, but it also fails on many levels. While the film is totally unoriginal (HEAVY emphasis on 'unoriginal'), it is very well acted and directed, even if nearly every aspect of the story itself has very recently been seen in almost exactly the same way. Brokedown Palace is literally a remake of the stunningly powerful film Return To Paradise, which starred Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Pheonix, and which presented almost exactly the same story, except that the main characters were male and there were three of them instead of two.Alice and Darlene (Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, respectively) take a trip to Thailand together just after high school, to celebrate their lifelong friendship that is about to be separated by college. Once there, they almost immediately encounter a charming Australian guy who wines and dines both of them, sparking intense jealousy, and coerces them to accompany him to Hong Kong. While it's not hard to believe that, in their rush to get to the airport on time, Alice did not notice the extra weight of the narcotics that Nick (the charming Australian guy) planted in her pack, it was kind of a big risk that he took, assuming that they would be too rushed to notice that much extra weight in their luggage.One of the main problems with the film is that Alice and Darlene were so reckless when they first got to Thailand. Sure, this establishes the fact that they just didn't know better, hence increasing the emotion caused by their later misfortune, but some of it was just too much. Like when they were at the royal hotel and ordered all kinds of drinks on some random room's tab, and Alice says, `Oh, they don't care.' Naiveté is one thing, but that is absolute stupidity. Never mind the fact that they are in a foreign and significantly more dangerous country - pulling some moronic stunt like that will get you in big trouble ANYwhere. Another unnecessary element was the ordeal with Darlene's father later in the film. He shows up at the prison in Thailand and soothingly convinces Darlene that everything is going to be okay, that he'll make sure everything is fixed and she gets home safely and out of that damn prison. Then when Alice comes out, he basically tells her that he never trusted her and she can rot in that prison thousands of miles away from anything she knows, for all he cares. Why is it that this guy goes immediately from being a loving and caring father to an absolute worthless bastard? I don't care how many times she got paint on his couch or got his daughter in trouble or whatever, that is no reason to leave her in a strange prison on the other side of the planet. That guy was a total dick, and nothing ever really even came of that scene.The legal ordeal that the girls went through involving the seedy lawyer played by Bill Pullman was also very interesting, but also grossly unoriginal. Alice and Darlene suffer the exact same troubles that faced the characters in Return To Paradise, with exactly the same result. While this was an entertaining and admittedly an intensely emotional film, without the quality performances Brokedown Palace would be little more than an instructional video about what not to do when on vacation in Thailand. The ending leaves you wondering if she ever really does get out of that prison, but we'll never know, because who the hell would want to watch a sequel to a film like this? The film left so many loose ends that it almost cancelled out all of the things that it achieved. We know that Darlene goes home, and obviously she'll try to get Alice out, but they sure didn't have much luck up to that point. We only get a vague idea of what happens to Nick, and the film ends with Alice still in the prison, saying that she knows she did the right thing and that she remains hopeful that Darlene will fight for her until she gets released, too. Optimists are sure to get a good thrill out of this, but every single event in the entire film after they get thrown into prison suggests that Alice is never going to get out of there, at least not until she's an old woman. This weak ending (although still very emotional, due to the quality acting from Claire) takes a lot away from a film that was not that good to begin with.

I was wrong.Here you have two of the greatest actors in modern American cinema finally sharing a screen together. Boy do we get chemistry. Add to that the presence of an able supporting cast and a great script and you got the recipe for one heck of a film, and it doesn't disappoint.It's very impressive that Mike Newell had previously directed Four Weddings... and then made this. Both are accomplished films but this definitely beats the earlier effort. The films are obviously very different but both are quality pictures and that's the mark of a good director. If you hated FW&AF then perhaps this little film will convince you that Newell can direct...(SPOILERS)Pacino has done this schtick countless times before and it seemingly never gets old, he's superb as usual. Depp matches him every step of the way and even overshadows him at some points, showing laudable restraint in difficult sequences that show him trying and failing to balance his home life with the requirements of his job. One outstanding scene has him forced into violence to keep up the charade of being a mobster. The expressions we see on his face perfectly capture the inner person who is disgusted at his actions and also the outward appearance of a man indulging his violent streak. Superb.The pacing is perfect, the movie never feels rushed and plays out as you expect it would. This is not to say that the move is particularly predictable. I look at this more as a character study than a plot driven affair, and it is refreshing in a gangster movie not to be a mite confused about who's doing what to whom, a la Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.I wonder about the film stock that Newell used. The movie has a peculiarly grimy but not dark feel that aids the idea of Pistone going undercover perfectly. We are also treated to several interesting shots, as if the camera is a 'spy' itself, taking us right into the heart of Mob dealings. Depp and Pacino were made to be on the same screen. More of them together please! The movie they and the director deliver is probably my favourite gangster flick, and it's up against some pretty stiff competition with the likes of The Godfather Trilogy and Casino. Simply put Brilliant film making.

I was wrong.Here you have two of the greatest actors in modern American cinema finally sharing a screen together. Boy do we get chemistry. Add to that the presence of an able supporting cast and a great script and you got the recipe for one heck of a film, and it doesn't disappoint.It's very impressive that Mike Newell had previously directed Four Weddings... and then made this. Both are accomplished films but this definitely beats the earlier effort. The films are obviously very different but both are quality pictures and that's the mark of a good director. If you hated FW&AF then perhaps this little film will convince you that Newell can direct...(SPOILERS)Pacino has done this schtick countless times before and it seemingly never gets old, he's superb as usual. Depp matches him every step of the way and even overshadows him at some points, showing laudable restraint in difficult sequences that show him trying and failing to balance his home life with the requirements of his job. One outstanding scene has him forced into violence to keep up the charade of being a mobster. The expressions we see on his face perfectly capture the inner person who is disgusted at his actions and also the outward appearance of a man indulging his violent streak.

The story is the well tread child befriends outsider plot, mixing E.T. with Short Circuit in roughly equal amounts.  But the presentation here is top notch.  None of the characters, not even the bad guy, are distorted caricatures. They're all human, believable and very well voiced.  Even the robot, despite his fantastic nature is believable as a character too.  And a very likable one at that.  Despite his size and mechanical form, he is very emotive.  His gentle nature even helps drive home the point of the movie that those which we are told are dangerous are not necessarily so.  Violence, fear of the unknown, tolerance, friendship, sacrifice and more are all presented for your consideration with a grace and subtlety Disney would do well to study.  I can't even recall a Disney film in years being brave enough to take on some of the subjects explored in this film.  And it's still fun enough to entertain young children.  A couple of scenes made me laugh harder than I've laughed in a theater in a long time, only to be followed by a thought provoking moment that didnt' feel at all disjoint from the rest of the film.   I saw this film when it first came out, and saw its brilliance immediately.  I was terribly disappointed when Warner Bros. gave it such short shrift when it looked like it might not draw the kind of crowds Disney features get.  Some supposedly savvy people there should be ashamed that they could not see this for what it was.  But I suppose it is not the people who know films that make those sorts of decisions, unfortunately.A visually appealing, well acted, stunning film.

The fact that 100% of the reviews I saw all rated this movie as somewhere beyond excellent says it all.  I like all sorts of films, from serious to goofy comedies, but my list of the best films of the last 15 or so years includes the heavy hitters like Rain Man, Unforgiven, Jerry Maguire, Good Will Hunting, Murder In The First (because of Kevin Bacon's awe-inspiring performance) and Saving Private Ryan, which are all fabulous movies.  But Shawshank tops them all by a good margin.  It is, without a doubt, that good.I'm also an avid reader, one of those who thinks that the book almost always far outshines the movie, no matter how good the movie.  And Shawshank is one of my favorite stories by my favorite author, but this movie takes the story to a completely new level.  I've never encountered another written or filmed work that better shows the 'triumph of the spirit' theme.There are a number of deeply moving scenes in the movie, but for me, the climax of the movie, the point where everything comes together, is when Morgan Freeman's character is released from prison and contemplating killing himself.  He finally comes to understand (or maybe just to accept) something that Tim Robbins' character told him earlier, and he says, Get busy living... or get busy dying. That's goddamn right.  This line starts a sequence that leads up to what, in my opinion, is the most perfect ending ever filmed.Every aspect of this movie is of the highest caliber.  The script is excellent, the acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is incredible, the musical score is flawless, and the direction is obviously superb.  What's even more incredible is that this was Frank Darabont's first feature film - and he surely rose above to make this one.  Forrest Gump won the Oscars it did because of its sentimentality and the nostalgic look at American history.  It did NOT win because it was the best picture of that year.  I had no problem with Tom Hanks winning the best actor award, but Shawshank should have won every other award it was nominated for.  I though Forrest Gump was excellent, but Shawshank was so much better that its getting beat out for best picture is on a par with Shakespeare In Love beating Saving Private Ryan.Well, I'll get off my soap box now.  I would have no problem going on with how moving and beautifully-done this movie is, but I think you probably get the point by now.
