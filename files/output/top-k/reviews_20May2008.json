Like in the last acts of the play,is for its characters,the viewers would not know what or how to do with this Film,like with the man,Jesus. The director,and the professionals involved seem to have been trying to play at their best,outplayed also as to how to portray something so exceptional that had so many repercussions through the ages and frankly,still mesmerizes. All around played to their advantage,the grandiosity of the locations,the photography,the music score,the quality of acting,the script of short but intense dialogue,even the time given to such heroic epic. But again,there is that something to this movie that it leaves the critic to dissatisfaction,a sense of left down,and many to despair and disbelief.And Im not sure if it was indeed this effect what was intended,as with the Delibes' famous quote An story,must not only bring to entertainment but when done well through,its ultimate purpose should be to unease,disquiet,to unsettle(what any Society misses). Max Von Sydow,(and Im one huge fan of his)did take the character with the ease of someone used since way earlier,to play these roles looming around Death with a smile and fear altogether.Serene and rich,frail and aware of the peculiar physicality of his added to the role.Only some People from those not used to these triptychs pieces of Art would still be receptive to their beauty and mystery.No wonder is that the human aspect of the Christ he is playing to,is abated to the monochrome Lordful one that the public and critic is expecting to see.As the supermenschabove and godly,grandiose cinema.That is why,the miracles are not played to the special effects of cinematic Red seas splitting to amaze the eye,but to bring the intimate effects and convolutions falling inside the surrounding characters,included Jesus' own interacting among with them. To this I have to commend the unforgettable interpretation done by David MacCallum as the critical Judas,but to a higher turn and human rich detail that of Van Heflin,with all his capabilities at the top of the Craft.In his,one can see the older man already over the hill who with his slanting eyes may have seen it all,until then.Jews and Herodians political jockeying around the roman invaders,as well. The climatic scene of Lazarus' resurrection is artfully painted by Stevens,and it comes to point this very well,that aside all that spectacle possible going on,decided to show precisely these two characters side by side,the older average well trodden human somewhat of a skeptical rejuvenating in new facts to belief,and the younger businessman collapsing in rejecting facts for stern assumptions never to overwhelm. If one can not see these scenes and their framing of humanity,acting,stampeding from the screen,petal after petal,one fails to see it because they maybe bring other self rejections of introspection in ourselves as worthy of the divine (or cinematic)Drama.Painted actors and cinema can be more glorious to watch as full Roses,unopened,and in a bunch bound. This Film,indeed may bring the Drama out of this Tragedy,but its focus all along may be in the -less spectacle because its commonality-silent unwrapping of the lives,Life.
