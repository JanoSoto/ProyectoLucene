How appropriate that Steen Spielberg's darkest and most depressing film since Schindler's List would have its biggest weekend on a national holiday.A.I. works on a number of levels, and fails a number of others. At its core is a reworking of Pinocchio's fairy tale quest to become a real boy, around which are layered a lover robot's adventures on the lam when he is framed for a murder, a passionate scientist (William Hurt) who creates the robot David (Haley Joel Osment), the unsuspecting family that is chosen for David's first home, and finally the world at large.It is first and foremost a dark and depressing world. In much the same premise as Waterworld, the oceans have risen and drowned most the Earth's coastline, including New York City. The surviving humans have strict rules against reproducing too excessively and depend on intelligent robots, or Mechas (a term borrowed from Anime), to do most of their work for them. Naturally, the human capacities for both creative genius and monstrous destruction are spotlighted here, in the Flesh Fair sequence halfway through and in Hobby's Laboratory later on in the film.In addition to this, a dark and depressing pall is cast over the entire fate of the human race. It is quite clear from the opening sequences, which are very choppy, that humans are rapidly progressing to their own destruction. This dark foreboding is one of the levels on which the film works. As David travels through a world not unlike that of Blade Runner, he encounters humans at their most monstrous tendencies and befriends the wonderfully ironic Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a role for which Law is perfectly suited. Joe is a lover Mecha who is programmed to be the superior gigolo, thus making human version of such obsolete. His jaunty ways and tendency to dance around at a moment's notice are both artificial, and yet better than real.This summary manages to encompass only the first half or so of the film. To go further would be to ruin the final (long) sequences that take place first in the partially submerged ruins of Manhattan Island and later some 2,000 years in the future. I will only say that the final sequences are very long and excessively drawn out and could have benefited from a faster pacing. The ending is a complete letdown, leaving virtually every question posed by the final 2,000 years in the future sequence unanswered.The core of the film is a dark, depressing certainty that humans are on the way to their destruction. They have no chance to survive, make their time. This core is exemplified in David's ironic and quixotic quest to find the Blue Fairy so he can become real. (Read, or watch, Pinocchio again to remember what's going on.) This sort of thing is almost a director's trademark of the late Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick is virtually incapable of making a happy film, and A.I. is no exception to that rule. Director Steven Spielberg wrote A.I.'s screenplay and filmed it based mostly on notes and storyboard Kubrick left behind when he passed on, and the result is unmistakably Kubrickian in both the irony and the depression.What is more dark and depressing is how impossible it is to care about any of the characters in the film. Whether they be human, like David's uncomfortable parents or his cruel human brother Martin, or robot, like the perpetually happy yet cynical Joe, no character in the film reaches out for the audience to actually give a crap whether they live or die. When Joe nearly escapes death not one, not twice, but three times the audience feels nary a twinge. When David, who is masterfully played by Osment, is crying out for his mom, we feel no sympathy for his dilemma. And why not? After all, as the preview tagline notes, His love is real, but he is not.In the end, the film is both visionary and unsatisfying. It evokes much the same emotion as 2001 A Space Odyssey combined with A Clockwork Orange; it is both grindingly boring yet superbly staged, it is both horrible and wonderful in the same instant, it is ironic and cynical, and sometimes it is funny. A.I. has been characterized as a dark fable, when in fact it is nothing of the sort. Rather, it is a real Grimm's fairy tale. Grimm's original fairy tales were both brutal and depressing, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to the sanitized Disney versions most people are used to. In that vein, A.I. is a genuine fairy tale, sad and dark, portending of doom, and frankly, about as fun as a root canal to watch.Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of evoking his friend Stanley Kubrick. The film bear's Kubrick's unmistakable stamp, and the cinematography is first rate, using all kinds of reflected images in mirrors, light effects of motion and images repeated infinitely in glass doors, and the eerie lights of flashlights. The film itself is visually arresting. It's too bad that what's being filmed is so depressing and exhausting to watch. A.I. is the kind of film where after you leave the theater and are driving home you just want to ram your car into a tree and end it. That's how dark and depressing it really is. And in the end, though the end sequence attempts to catapult the film from fairy tale to cautionary tale, it does little more than drag the film out and try to set up and ending that makes us cry. Too bad we are not at all emotionally invested in David, even at the end.Rating * * 1\/2 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"5 July 2001","score":"","review":"  I saw A.I. on the Fourth of July.

If a mecha boy is destroyed by eating spinach (take THAT, Popeye), how does he remain untouched by being submerged in water?  If all of Manhattan (with its underground power cables) is under 50 storeys of water, how does William Hurt's character maintain a home and laboratory at the top of a skyscraper? What on earth caused the creeped-out mother first to activate the love-imprint and then agree to abandon the loving son?  Nothing in Monica Swinton's behavior as shown caused either act to make sense.  And let's not forget who the heck is providing the voice-over?The question about Monica nods to the odd undertone of misogyny in the entire film.

The notion of the artificial boy appears meant only for mothers.  When David's imprinting is activated, he calls Monica Mommy but Henry is still Henry.

Indeed it is, but Spielberg isn't going to waste his time on  anything profound and moral.  Too busy with his modernized fairy-tale, he won't even address what the nature of love is.  Because what David evinces is not love, it is programmed obsession.  The film, already mistitled (nothing in the film has ANYTHING to do with artificial intelligence -- except perhaps the making of it), isn't even dealing with artificial emotion.But nothing -- NOTHING -- in the film prepares you for the barrage of saccharine implicit in the last 15-20 minutes.  Instead of ending this disaster where it made the best cinematic sense to, with David endlessly imploring the Blue Fairy to make him a real boy, Spielberg tacks on a nauseating and profoundly pointless coda in which David gets...well, what?

But after about 100 messages, my eyes got tired and I got sick of reading comments I think are false. So if I repeat something that's already been said I apologize ahead of time. Also, I'll try to make this short and sweet to save your eyes, but sometimes if I get passionate about what I write about, I get carried away - so bear with me.Also, you probly shouldn't read this if you haven't seen the movie and would like to.For those of you who think that A.I. didn't have a message - I think you must have been in the theater next to me seeing Scary Movie II.Yes, as human beings we have made wonderful advances in technology and science - BUT the stupid part of us is that we do these things without taking the time to consider the moral implications to our society. Take cloning for example - the technology is already here but now we're arguing over how it should be used and even whether or not it should be used. This movie takes artificial intelligence - something that is still in its infancy today - and allows us to take a glimpse into the future and see what could happen if we don't think about our actions before we take them. Our society today is so enamored with the quick fix. We have so little patience.In the movie, Professor Hobby wants to create a child mecha who can love its parents because, he believes there's a market for it. Once again the quick fix. He mentions the market of childless couples waiting for a lisence - so why not make them a robot, capable of love, that can fill the void in their lives. Only he doesn't consider the implications - so many people in this future world hate mechas and the child could be teased mercilously, as David is. And by making him a robot with emotions, these things hurt him. The professor considers the feelings of the parents who want a child to love but he doesn't consider the feelings of the child robot. Parents may in time decide that because the child robot is only that, a robot, they can discard it, forgetting that it too can feel. I'm reminded of the plethera of teen mothers today who have children because they don't feel loved and want the unconditional love of a baby. They don't consider the work that goes into taking care of that baby and the child suffers because the teen wanted a quick fix.The movie deals with other quick fixes in much more subtle ways. Rouge City and creating robots to perform sexual tasks. Here we have the quick fix of sex but without the worries of the usual consequances such as STDs or pregnancy!Back to the issue of having no patiance - many humans are afraid of what they don't understand and have little patience in trying to learn to understand it. So, the quick fix is to destroy what is not understood. We humans are famous for doing this all throughout history in our many instances of prejudice against people unlike ourselves. I see the Flesh Fairs in the movie as a paralell to Roman times when Christians were thrown in with the lions to be eaten. It is in this way that the movie makes us think about how history does repeat itself and that we need to educate people before moving onward so that this doesn't happen. I get the feeling that in this future time when robots were starting to be made, they were again created as quick fixes in the form of factory workers, butlers, maids and nannies as many of the robots to be destryed at the Flesh Fair illustrate. I imagine that these robots were created and immediately sold for a profit without taking the time to educate people about them.Yes there are blatant, in-your-face issues brought out in this movie such as what is love? and how far should we take ai? BUT I think the movie has some other very subtle messages and questions that are quite important that many people miss. In some reviews I've read on here, people breifly mention that in this movie the ice caps have melted as a result of global warming and, as a result, NYC and others have been submerged under water. Whoa there! This is a HUGE issue - and one I see of equal importance if not more so, to the topic of AI. Seeing Manhatten under water had a very eery effect on me as I hope it did others. Just as we get a glimpse into the future of technology, we get a glimpse into the future of our planet if we continue to treat it as we do. Again, back to the topic of quick fixes and no patience - people want things that will improve their quality of life now and don't think about how we're screwing things up in the process. People won't recycle or car pool to work, under the guise of how can one person make a difference when they really are saying i'm too lazy to do that. And, although its just speculation of course, look where it gets us! We end up with good portions of land underwater, which cause a greater population of people to be confined to a smaller earth, which in turn makes people have to wait to get a license before having a child!Although it takes place in a future that was imagined and created by a film crew, this movie should make people re evaluate today and ask themselves if that's where they want to be someday. Maybe a far off someday, but I definately think everything in the movie, if not worse, is possible to happen. This takes us to the issue of the movie being depressing and dark and a movie not for children. Bingo! Life isn't always happiness and flowers - if the movie had ended with David being reunited with a very apologetic and loving family, it could be discarded as another Hollywood movie that allowed us to escape reality for awhile. Instead AI encourages you to say hey, you know, I didn't like the outcome of that movie - maybe i should think about what i'm doing now, and what the human race is doing now, and consider the long term consequences. Even if the negative events in the movie don't happen in a not so far off or a far off future - we still are making drastic mistakes as a human race and we need to stop ourselves and think about what we're doing.The acting in the movie was excellent - overall I really enjoyed it.

Satine, who is dying of tuberculosis but doesn't know it, dives into an ill-fated relationship with Christian, despite the only rule of the Moulin Rouge never to fall in love. The storyline is cliche, but it is told in such a unique way that you feel as if you're being told a love story for the very first time.Everything about this film is beautiful. The visuals are even more outlandish and artistic than those of Baz Luhrmann's last film, William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, but they seem to work even better for this film. The scenes cut so often and are so mixed up that the movie could have easily been a mess, but Luhrmann somehow managed to put them all together perfectly.The music is also wonderful. I have always had a soft spot for film musicals, and it's refreshing to know that they haven't gone completely extinct. The music is also fun because it's mostly made up of contemporary pop songs, featuring such artists as Sting and Elton John, as well as a few classics like Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend and The Sound of Music. It's amazing how well the songs fit; it almost seems as if they were written for the movie.The acting is astounding. Nicole Kidman is wonderful, and has a surprisingly good voice (yes, it is her singing). And Ewan McGregor is indescribably amazing! He is immensely talented as an actor and has a beautiful voice. He really has a talent for making the audience feel the intense emotions that pour out of his character. Richard Roxburgh, Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo, who play the Duke, Zidler, and Toulouse Lautrec respectively are all very entertaining, providing the comic relief. All of the actors portray their characters in a very exaggerated, melodramatic and operatic way, which confirms the fact that this film is a modern opera.This movie swept me off my feet. Everything about it is perfect; I wouldn't change a thing. When it came to the end of the movie, it felt to me like waking up from a wonderful dream, wishing it could have lasted forever. But it is obviously the type of movie where you either love it or you hate it, because it's so unique. If you tend to go for simple movies, or movies with a diverse, constantly twisting plot (not that I don't love that genre), you probably won't see much in this movie.

And boy, was it entertaining!As usual, I won't tell the plot, what little of it there was, 'cause you most likely already know it, but the characters weren't that bad. Wilcox, who looks awfully familiar from somewhere, is very good as Alice, a girl trying to understand the monstrous demon she's fighting, & what's happening to her & her friends; Andras Jones is quite enjoyable as Rick, Alice's brother who has his favorite hobby, Martial Arts, lethally used against him; Knight isn't as good as Arquette in Part 3, but she's just as delectable, & it is quite sad to see that vile fiend toss her into the flames; Kincaid & Joey don't do much other than die & leave very cheap funerals (Joey, remember your last encounter with a naked lady?); the other characters are adequate; & once again, Englund steals every scene he was in as the ferocious Freddy.Now I know the deaths have been called gross & stupid, but let's face it As cool as Freddy's glove is, it would get kinda repetitive watching him merely stab people with it over & over again. These new, goofy deaths began in the 3rd one as most likely a way to expand Freddy's murderous horizons, & they actually were pretty inventive. And as far as Freddy's wisecracks go...well, he's no Chris Tucker, but some of those jokes were pretty funny (You can check in, but you can't check out!), & Freddy's a Helluva lot funnier than crap comics like Carrot Top.Now I think I understand why Freddy came back to life (try & stay with me here) Freddy has been properly buried, so his soul is at peace; but when Jason, the dog, urinates on the grave, he desecrates it, thus disturbing Freddy's spirit & making him rise again. As to why the urine was flaming, I have no clue; maybe the filmmakers just thought it looked cool. But that makes no sense because fire is what killed Freddy as a human & in Part 2. Also, one might think that once Freddy killed all the Elm Street children, his death would be avenged, & his spirit could rest at last; however, he somehow remained alive to kill again & again, probably from making a deal with his master, Satan, down in Hell.Also, Freddy's godliness is alluded to again. In the original, when Tina said, Please, God!, Freddy held up his glove & snarled the immortal line, THIS..is God! In this film, while dueling Alice in the church, he says the equally great line, I...am...eternal! If he is eternal, it means he has no beginning & no end He always has been, & he always will be. The only other being described in such a way is God Himself; the difference is that God is Pure Good, whereas Freddy is Pure Evil. Thus, the final battle between Alice & Freddy could symbolize the final battle between God & Satan, where God will triumph. However, this can't be the final battle, as there are 3 movies left.Now all this symbolism stuff may or may not be true, but I'm just saying that parallels do exist if you examine something closely enough.

Coincidentally, Kevin's latest heist happens to be at one of Max's several homes. While the crook is bagging up some valuables, Max finds him and calls the police. Kevin is forced to turn over all the stolen property, including the sacred ring, to Max. No matter how hard he tries, Kevin cannot convince the police that the ring is really his own. Max gets the ring and quickly cherishes it as his much-needed sign of good luck. Comical warfare ensues as each man battles for ownership of the ring.This movie is about two guys fighting over a small piece of jewelry. Every supporting character, at one point or another, says that the men are behaving like children, and that this competition is stupid. I agree. So, if the cast of the film even admits that the story is pointless, why have I been forced to sit down and watch the movie? That's the question I found myself asking at numerous points during What's the Worst That Could Happen?. There is nothing of value in this picture. There is no lesson. There is not humor. There is not even an original narrative. To make matters worse, this movie was based on a novel. Not only was this horrible story released into theaters, but someone decided to publish this garbage as well. So, even though many might think that this movie is the worst that could happen, I'll bet the book is even more excruciating. What's the Worst That Could Happen? fails because the material does not work. Lawrence is a large part of the problem. He does not know how to deliver a scripted joke without making a fool of himself. Sadly, he relies on silly dancing and spastic jerks to make the audience laugh. Unfortunately, he's the only one who looks like a spastic jerk. It's that kind of comedy that makes you hang your head in shame. I was embarrassed by the stuff he was doing on screen. Danny DeVito loses credibility simply for starring in this movie. He might have been able to pull a decent joke out the movie, but after watching Lawrence pretend to back his ass up, the entire movie was just a ridiculous waste of time. The remainder of the cast consists of several larger names who add nothing to the movie. John Leguizamo (Moulin Rouge!) plays one of Lawrence's cohorts, but never gets a chance to shine. There is not a single decent line given to brilliant comedians like Bernie Mac (The Original Kings of Comedy) or Ana Gasteyer (from television's Saturday Night Live). One of the worst characters in this movie is William Fichtner (The Perfect Storm), who plays a gender ambiguous detective. It's a disgrace. There is so much talent in this movie that gets wasted. That's a shame too, because these supporting characters, if written correctly, could have kept the entire film from being so rotten. The film's title is What's the Worst That Could Happen?, but the real question is Why? Why did anyone ever decide to make this movie? Why couldn't they try to adapt an original idea for the screen? Why does Martin Lawrence think that dimwitted dancing is funny? Why did nobody pay attention to the strong supporting cast? Why am I watching this movie? Why?

Li Mu Bai is determined to give up his fighting days and settle down with Shu Lien.

Age and culture hold no barriers to the film's purpose. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an adaptation of the fourth book (out of five) from a popular Chinese literature series by author Wang Dulu. Despite it's revered presence amongst the young crowd in China, film watchers around the world will be able to identify with this film, making the story an international epic. Although the events take place several generations ago, the story is one that all of humanity can identify with, for the film addresses issues that are innate to everyone loyalty, revenge, love, and honor.Director Ang Lee accomplishes a tremendous amount of merit in this picture. The backdrop setting for the movie is nothing but breathless. Ang Lee brings this classic story to life by choosing locations that are, in essence, picture perfect. Also contributing to the ambience of the movie experience is a beautiful, and well-written score by Yo-Yo Ma, which mimics every emotion of each character through each somber note. While English-speaking audiences might feel the frustration of reading the subtitles and watching the action at the same time, the acting by the performers is almost enough to figure out the storyline without the use of translation. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh deliver their best performances in this picture, with little doubt as to whether or not they will receive accolades for their work. Also coming forward as a future rising star in Asia is Zhang Zi-Yi (who plays Jen). Only 19 years old, Zi-Yi did not have any knowledge of martial arts at the beginning of the shooting, and was trained completely on the spot. Rrrrright.....action and acting combined? Believe it or not, Ang Lee succeeds in doing this. Rather than random shoot'em ups, bloody fistfights, and kung fu that simply looks cool, the action is as pertinent to the movie as the dialogue. The fighting scenes are obviously enhanced through the use of special effects, yet they are every bit breathtaking as a lightsaber dual. With all of this combined into Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the movie should not be compared to that of The Matrix or any other kung fu movies. Rather, it stands on its own as a distinct and true masterpiece that serves as epic storytelling that can still exist in a cynical modern society.

The fighting scenes are obviously enhanced through the use of special effects, yet they are every bit breathtaking as a lightsaber dual. With all of this combined into Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the movie should not be compared to that of The Matrix or any other kung fu movies.

Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is considered one of the greatest martial art warriors of all time in China. Li asks his girlfriend, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), to give his sword, The Green Destiny, to a friend of his father's. Li Mu Bai is determined to give up his fighting days and settle down with Shu Lien. Once Sir Te stores the sword away, it disappears and a greater mystery is unveiled, involving a long-time foe named Jade Fox, the beautiful daughter of the Governor named Jen (Zhang Zi-Yi), and her past lover from the desert. Age and culture hold no barriers to the film's purpose. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an adaptation of the fourth book (out of five) from a popular Chinese literature series by author Wang Dulu. Despite it's revered presence amongst the young crowd in China, film watchers around the world will be able to identify with this film, making the story an international epic.

The best movies use the visual medium to create new worlds and bring them to life, and that's what this movie is all about. In the case of The Matrix, you start out with a female hacker being confronted by a squad of cops. She makes a spectacular escape, making moves that are simply superhuman, and which sets up the tone for the rest of the film. You know within the first five minutes that you are in for a wild ride. Next, we are introduced to Neo, a hacker by night, a working stiff in a huge software company by day. He's a regular schmuck, his boss chews him out for showing up late because he's been out partying all night with his cyberpunk friends. Things seem normal enough, but something just isn't quite right. When Neo digs deeper, and makes contact with a mysterious fellow known only as Morpheus, he finds out just how wrong things really are. The most bracing scenes in this whole movie are when Morpheus shows Neo exactly the true nature of the world he lives in. Even though you know this is a sci-fi thriller with bizarre plot twists, you are simply not prepared for what he finds out. Without revealing the actual plot, let's just say it borrows ideas put forth in The Terminator, Total Recall, Tron, Blade Runner, and even Alice in Wonderland and 1984 (think of the interrogation scene) yet creates a completely original story to which are added stunning visual effects. And yet, unlike some other films, the effects just add to the basic plot as opposed to becoming the dominant feature (a la Terminator 2). For example, the virtual reality fight scenes are in themselves amazing, but merely serve to point out that, in such an environment, a well trained warrior could use his\/her mind to overcome the limits of body and physics and accomplish the impossible. Well, lest I ramble on too long, the basic point is this is one of those rare movies that just grabs you from the opening minutes and never lets go.

Things start to get interesting when a gangster-esque raccoon approaches Dolittle and takes him to the woods to meet a beaver, the Godfather of this secret animal mafia. They need help. A powerful corporation is cutting down the trees in the forest. Without these trees, the animals have no homes. The creatures of the woods are calling upon Dolittle to stop this harmful deforestation. There is only one way to accomplish this. It seems an endangered species of bear roams free in the forest, however, there is only one left, a female named Ava. Saving the one bear is no longer probable, so the court cannot legally stop the corporation from tearing down the trees. The good doctor convinces the court to give him a month. In that time, he will find another bear of this species who is currently in captivity. Then, he will introduce him to the wild and successfully mate him with the female who currently lives in the woods. This would force the courts to prevent the greedy corporation from taking away the home of an endangered species. The plan sounds perfect, until Dolittle meets Archie, the pampered circus bear he must train to live in the wild.As with the first film, Dr. Dolittle 2 works because of a fresh and creative sense of humor.

They are the ones who bring the material to life. They are the ones who require expert timing and delivery. They are the ones who really get the audience laughing. Still, at the beginning of this movie, I still wondered if the premise would get tiresome. The talking animals are great, but I was not sure if their novelty would wear off by the film's conclusion.

To appreciate this movie, you have to be very open-minded. Some may appreciate this even more if they can identify JUST one of their pre-adolescent life experiences to Dawn's, the main character of this movie.Everything about this movie, from Dawn's mom screaming at her to go to her room after she calls her sister a 'lesbo', to the sound-effects of the knife scraping the chocolate cake off Dawn's plate onto her brother's really hits the bullseye. Obviously, this movie was filmed on a small budget. The saviour of the film is Dawn, played brilliantly by Heather Matarazzo. She lives with her dysfunctional family - a loser brother who is more concerned about getting into a decent college with his good grades rather than appreciate life growing up. A mother and father who look down on Dawn as more of a nuisance than anything, but adore her younger sister, an aspiring ballerina and so saccherine sweet, that you as the viewer, get a kick whenever Dawn does something to upset her.The trials and tribulations of Junior High are really all about being picked on by the school bully, not having any friends, and for the first time, discovering your sexuality. Not everyone leads a cheerleader life. Not everyone leads a jock life. And most certainly, not everyone has a place where they can fit in, adjust and get by without being noticed. Dawn is your A-Grade loser. She dresses in clothes that have way outdated her peers. She wears thick-framed glasses. And she is not attractive. She is the ultimate geek target for all those who feel they need to boost their social status by either ridiculing her or making fun of her.Many of the characters she associates herself with are stereotypes that reflect their true selves. One female bully accuses her of being a lesbian, but bullies her by making her go to the toilet in front of her so she can watch. The school bully, Brandon (played by Brendan Sexton) tries to make her life a living hell, but finds that he has more in common with her than anyone else because believe it or not, they both lead similar lives. Their parents ignore them, they are social outcasts and they share a mutual attraction for each other.Many of the situations Dawn gets herself into are quite hilarious. Such as the time when she invites the guy she is head over heels in love with to join her 'Special People Club'. Another prime example would be when the family is gathered around the television set watching a home video of a anniversary party and Dawn is pushed into a wading pool by her younger sister and everyone laughs. The viewer finds gratification watching Dawn get herself into these situations because we all secretly know deep inside how she feels and that someone has finally had the guts to make a movie about it.There is no fairytale ending to this movie. This movie serves it up and whips it out to you plain and simple. Life isn't about fairytales and love hearts. It's about adolescence and growing up. Every one over the age of 25 should watch this movie, male AND female.

Some may appreciate this even more if they can identify JUST one of their pre-adolescent life experiences to Dawn's, the main character of this movie.Everything about this movie, from Dawn's mom screaming at her to go to her room after she calls her sister a 'lesbo', to the sound-effects of the knife scraping the chocolate cake off Dawn's plate onto her brother's really hits the bullseye. Obviously, this movie was filmed on a small budget. The saviour of the film is Dawn, played brilliantly by Heather Matarazzo. She lives with her dysfunctional family - a loser brother who is more concerned about getting into a decent college with his good grades rather than appreciate life growing up. A mother and father who look down on Dawn as more of a nuisance than anything, but adore her younger sister, an aspiring ballerina and so saccherine sweet, that you as the viewer, get a kick whenever Dawn does something to upset her.The trials and tribulations of Junior High are really all about being picked on by the school bully, not having any friends, and for the first time, discovering your sexuality. Not everyone leads a cheerleader life. Not everyone leads a jock life. And most certainly, not everyone has a place where they can fit in, adjust and get by without being noticed. Dawn is your A-Grade loser. She dresses in clothes that have way outdated her peers. She wears thick-framed glasses. And she is not attractive. She is the ultimate geek target for all those who feel they need to boost their social status by either ridiculing her or making fun of her.Many of the characters she associates herself with are stereotypes that reflect their true selves. One female bully accuses her of being a lesbian, but bullies her by making her go to the toilet in front of her so she can watch. The school bully, Brandon (played by Brendan Sexton) tries to make her life a living hell, but finds that he has more in common with her than anyone else because believe it or not, they both lead similar lives. Their parents ignore them, they are social outcasts and they share a mutual attraction for each other.Many of the situations Dawn gets herself into are quite hilarious. Such as the time when she invites the guy she is head over heels in love with to join her 'Special People Club'. Another prime example would be when the family is gathered around the television set watching a home video of a anniversary party and Dawn is pushed into a wading pool by her younger sister and everyone laughs. The viewer finds gratification watching Dawn get herself into these situations because we all secretly know deep inside how she feels and that someone has finally had the guts to make a movie about it.There is no fairytale ending to this movie. This movie serves it up and whips it out to you plain and simple. Life isn't about fairytales and love hearts. It's about adolescence and growing up. Every one over the age of 25 should watch this movie, male AND female. You will laugh, but you will also admire Todd Solonz's (the director) guts for telling the tale of how life really is.10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"5 July 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is and always will be one of my favourite movies.
