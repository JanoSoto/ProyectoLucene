If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as just a toy. Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come.

And, boyo, does it work! Thirty-eight years after seeing this one in a cinema, there's no doubt that this story and production deserve the Oscars and kudos that were lavished upon it. At the time I saw it, I was so taken with the story, I read the book also. Truth, after all, is always better than fiction.From the narrative perspective, it's a humdrum story about two of NY's finest making a drug bust of heroin imported from France. What sets it apart from other run-of-the-mill cop thrillers is, first, the acting from Best Actor Award Gene Hackman (as Popeye Doyle) and Roy Scheider (as Buddy Russo); second, the photography and editing (also an Academy Award for the latter); third, the script by Ernest Tidyman (another Academy Award); and finally, the direction from William Friedkin (yet another Academy Award). The icing on this cake was the Oscar for Best Picture, and well deserved, in my opinion.Much has been written about the chase sequence where Doyle grabs a citizen's auto to chase after a train on the el in which a French killer is trying to escape capture &#x96; a sequence that took five days to complete, so I read here in the trivia section. For thrills, and for today's audience, the only comparable chase sequence is the one Paul Greengrass staged in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). That from Bullitt (1968), while ground breaking and very good, doesn't quite match up as thrilling or as frenetic.The visual story-telling is at its best, however, with the sequences shot to show Doyle, Russo and other agents crisscrossing New York streets on foot and in cars, trying to stay with the two main villains from France as they lead the coppers on a merry-go-round very sparse dialog, much inter-cutting, reverse shots and so on made it a production and editing nightmare &#x96; but also a terrific sequence that keeps the viewer on the edge.The most amazing aspect, for me, is that the real operation occurred because the two real cops in the middle of it all stumbled upon the whole deal. Without that stroke of luck, there would never have been a French Connection. And, a lot of people would never have won the awards they did. Ain't life strange? And, now you also can be rewarded when you see this film, still at #154 of the 250 all-time great movies. And if you want to see a young Gene Hackman, it's a better role than as Buck Barrow in Bonnie & Clyde (1967), I can assure you. And a better movie.Highly recommended.

Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works at a major New York financial firm doing whatever it is well-dressed men do as such places. Bateman is utterly self-absorbed and obsessed with his appearance and is jealous of anyone more socially successful than he is. He's cheating on his fiancée and knows she's cheating on him. He hangs around with three businessman friends who only talk about getting high, getting lucky and getting into the trendiest New York hot spots. Oh, and Patrick Bateman is also an insane serial killer. Now, given that, you might expect American Psycho to be some sort of thriller where Patrick Bateman is the villain and we watch him systematically slaughter people in ironically appropriate ways until one of his intended victims or some cop finally put an end to him. This movie, however, is about as far from that as you can get. It's not a thriller. The killings are random and without any greater significance. There is no heroic victim, and Patrick Bateman isn't really a villain. This film is actually a social commentary, punctuated with moments of crazed violence and an ending that wants to leave you with more questions than answers. As social commentary it doesn't have a very dynamic plot and how much you enjoy it depends a great deal on whether you get the point it's trying to make and agree with it. But if you do both of those things, this is an almost hypnotically disturbing film that keeps you on edge until the very last moment. Christian Bale does a very fine job with an unusually difficult character to play. Patrick Bateman is all surface. There's no internal life or self-awareness to him. He also happens to be very evil. But he's the main character in this story and we see and hear and experience the world mostly through his point of view. It's hard to spend that much time with that intrinsically limited a character and not get sick and tired of them. Bale manages to hold your attention and emotional involvement all the way through, and not just through his inherent charisma. He lets you feel sorry for Bateman as a man who is desperate for satisfaction in his life but cannot achieve it and doesn't even really know what it would be. Bateman has no conscience but Bale makes you feel that he as an actor might have one, giving the audience something to connect with. The social commentary in American Psycho comes from our observing Bateman in his natural environment and noticing that the rich New York City crowd he runs with isn't that different from him. Indeed, the film forces you to wonder why they all aren't out butchering people left and right and suggests that Bateman is just more honest about what he is while the others never stop to think about it. I n a world of yuppie scum, the serial killer is the only one with any real spiritual integrity. This is a very well directed film. Haron crafts scenes of berserk violence with an almost dreamlike serenity. She not only makes us understand the social hierarchy and status competition that these financial sharks pour into their business cards, but she also makes us see how completely arbitrary and nonsensical it is at the same time. American Psycho does have one of those twist endings. You know, where the stuff you just spend and hour and 40 minutes watching turns out not to be what it appeared. But while many of those kind of endings ruin a film by making everything you see meaningless, American Psycho gets it right. Instead of just rendering everything before it invalid, this twist ending gives it all a different interpretation. What happened may not have happened but it still meant something. American Psycho is a movie with a sedate, intellectual veneer about a world where veneer is all that really exists. It wants you to think about that&#x85;but it's not interested in telling you what to think. It asks you to substitute your judgment into the story and make of it what you will. So, if you're interested less is something that will entertain you and more in something will make you ponder, try this film.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 September 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" American Psycho is a movie that casts the 1980s as a vacuous, amoral, materialistic, nihilistic, degrading and degraded era of American life&#x85;but it tries not to be too judgmental about it. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works at a major New York financial firm doing whatever it is well-dressed men do as such places. Bateman is utterly self-absorbed and obsessed with his appearance and is jealous of anyone more socially successful than he is. He's cheating on his fiancée and knows she's cheating on him. He hangs around with three businessman friends who only talk about getting high, getting lucky and getting into the trendiest New York hot spots. Oh, and Patrick Bateman is also an insane serial killer. Now, given that, you might expect American Psycho to be some sort of thriller where Patrick Bateman is the villain and we watch him systematically slaughter people in ironically appropriate ways until one of his intended victims or some cop finally put an end to him. This movie, however, is about as far from that as you can get. It's not a thriller. The killings are random and without any greater significance. There is no heroic victim, and Patrick Bateman isn't really a villain. This film is actually a social commentary, punctuated with moments of crazed violence and an ending that wants to leave you with more questions than answers. As social commentary it doesn't have a very dynamic plot and how much you enjoy it depends a great deal on whether you get the point it's trying to make and agree with it. But if you do both of those things, this is an almost hypnotically disturbing film that keeps you on edge until the very last moment. Christian Bale does a very fine job with an unusually difficult character to play. Patrick Bateman is all surface. There's no internal life or self-awareness to him. He also happens to be very evil. But he's the main character in this story and we see and hear and experience the world mostly through his point of view. It's hard to spend that much time with that intrinsically limited a character and not get sick and tired of them. Bale manages to hold your attention and emotional involvement all the way through, and not just through his inherent charisma. He lets you feel sorry for Bateman as a man who is desperate for satisfaction in his life but cannot achieve it and doesn't even really know what it would be. Bateman has no conscience but Bale makes you feel that he as an actor might have one, giving the audience something to connect with. The social commentary in American Psycho comes from our observing Bateman in his natural environment and noticing that the rich New York City crowd he runs with isn't that different from him. Indeed, the film forces you to wonder why they all aren't out butchering people left and right and suggests that Bateman is just more honest about what he is while the others never stop to think about it. I n a world of yuppie scum, the serial killer is the only one with any real spiritual integrity. This is a very well directed film. Haron crafts scenes of berserk violence with an almost dreamlike serenity. She not only makes us understand the social hierarchy and status competition that these financial sharks pour into their business cards, but she also makes us see how completely arbitrary and nonsensical it is at the same time. American Psycho does have one of those twist endings. You know, where the stuff you just spend and hour and 40 minutes watching turns out not to be what it appeared. But while many of those kind of endings ruin a film by making everything you see meaningless, American Psycho gets it right. Instead of just rendering everything before it invalid, this twist ending gives it all a different interpretation. What happened may not have happened but it still meant something. American Psycho is a movie with a sedate, intellectual veneer about a world where veneer is all that really exists. It wants you to think about that&#x85;but it's not interested in telling you what to think. It asks you to substitute your judgment into the story and make of it what you will. So, if you're interested less is something that will entertain you and more in something will make you ponder, try this film.

The beginning was awesome when Batman battled the bad guys in his Batmobile. When I watched the beginning, I thought that this would be an awesome movie. I was wrong. The ending was stupid. Batman ripped off his mask and exposed his true identity to Max Shrek. Batman would never do that. The reason why he wears his cowl is to keep his identity a secret. When I saw him rip it off, it ruined the whole movie for me. If he had only ripped it off in front of Catwoman, that wouldn't have been bad because she had already learned his true identity. When I bought this movie on VHS at Wal-mart, I had a feeling that Batman would lose his mask in it. But I had no idea that they'd be so stupid as to make him take it off himself.

There was a time when this really would have been exciting to me...i.e. when I was a fan of his action series Remington Steele. However, by the time Brosnan did become available for the role, I think a lot of the excitement had ebbed away. It was his role in Remington Steele which did in fact prevent him from taking on the role as Bond for so long. As a much younger person at the time, it's also possible that Timothy Dalton's time in the role may have lessened my enjoyment of the franchise too. Having recently re-seen - or perhaps seen, in one instance - Dalton's movies again, I have to say that I appreciate him much better now, even though those comic book elements appeal to me less now.In the opening sequence Pierce comes across as a coiled spring action hero...veritably panther-like. However, with Pierce, he is like an ice-berg...the character is mostly beneath the surface. Whereas Roger Moore in the role was one for eye-brow raising, with Pierce he maintains a poker face...giving nothing away. Maybe that's not such a good thing. This movie does have moments where it plays things for laughs and we see Bond in a new light...as someone who revels in his extraordinary masculine abilities. Anyway...Exotic locations The 'new' Russia (after the break up of the Soviet Union and the Cold War that came with it); The Caribbean...Puerto Rico.Plot Takes place 9 years after the pre-title sequence. In the Space Weapons Control Centre in Russia, a rogue military group seizes control of GoldenEye, an armed Russian satellite in space which can send cities and countries back into the Stone Age.Franchise clichés Pre-title sequence - Gun barrel sequence with techno type music playing. Pierce's Bond has a no nonsense approach and a narrow stance. Some of these sequences in the earliest Bond movies were quite fruity...e.g. Sean Connery's Bond did have some wobbly gaits and back legs in these movies.The PTS proper has Bond in Russia working to disarm a chemical weapons lab. He has the assistance of 006 - Alec Trevelyan - on the mission. Things don't go quite according to plan. The end of the sequence has one of the great action sequences in any Bond movie...it's right up there with the one for Moonraker...it's fantastic - in the literal sense. If you found the PTS in Moonraker unbelievable, well, this is Unbelievable...on stilts.Theme song - Tina Turner sings. Surprised that it was written by Bono and The Edge of rock band U2. It's a slow, Broadway show type tune. Nothing special...apart from the names involved. End credits seem to be getting more theme songs now too...here it's The experience of love, sung by Eric Serra and written by Eric Serra and Rupert Hine. I think that this may be Hine's 2nd end theme song in the franchise. Interestingly, the end credits reveal Minnie Driver to be the singer of Stand by your man in the movie proper. The name rang a bell which is why I'm noting it here.Q - Played by the same actor - Desmond Llewelyn - unlike numerous other regulars who have been 'rebooted', so to speak. It's casting like this which makes taking the franchise as chronological and consistent impossible.M - The new guy is...a woman. Played by Judi Dench. This is the first Bond movie to recognise\/acknowledge the dated attitudes of the franchise...at one point she says to Bond You're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the Cold War. Not exactly sure what she's getting at here! Moneypenny - Another reboot here. This is only the second time in a Bond movie where she is not a vacuous character. The first time was in the greatest Bond movie of them all, On her majesty's secret service. On this level, it's the perfect follow up to that movie, as far as Moneypenny's minimal character 'arc' goes. Like M, she has some good meta-comments about their relationship.Silly female character names -They're back! Xenia Zirgauna Onatopp!Wine buffery - One of the few if not the first time Bond has uttered the phrase Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred. Trivia Bond tells the new M that the old M had cognac in his top drawer. New M prefers bourbon...she offers one to him and asks if he wants ice with it. Yes.Sexism\/misogyny - Made no notes on this...like I said, there's a consciousness in this movie about this element of the franchise in the past. In other words, this element is being left behind in the 1960s.End teaser - James Bond will return. No specific title given.Watch for * Bond also speaks French. Is there nothing this man cannot do? * Bond plays baccarat...not sure how many card games Bond is proficient in to this point...or whether we've seen him play this game in earlier movies.* Jack Wade of the C.I.A is introduced.

Jack mentions Guantanamo Bay to Bond...this was filmed before that place had nasty connotations, due to US practices there.* a history lesson on the Lensk Cossacks and their relationship with Britain during World War 2.

One thing I did like was that Carl Weathers as Creed (who plays his part well) has a bigger role in this one. You see him and Rocky start to bond as they become friends and that was nice to see. The end fight was well done and entertaining but it wasn't as exciting or inspirational as the first two. However Rocky III is an impressive instalment for a third movie and hopefully the fourth in the series can do just as well or better.

The camera is very loose for most of the picture, with a lot of wide shots, most of them up high, some of them featuring a sweeping mobile frame.

He has had no exposure to the world his entire life, save for the four walls of his master's estate, the garden he tends to, and the things he sees on TV. When his master, the old man, passes away, Chance is let loose upon the world where his gentle, slow, and simple demeanour are mistaken for the thoughtful musings of an eccentric genius. With a sharp script that never preaches, this is satire at its best, and the performances are thoroughly moving as the film's reputation leads one to believe. What might surprise you, as it did me, is the film's poetic, and beautiful cinematography. However, I find this a difficult film to judge, as given its confounding status as a comedy, I found myself sooner driven to tears and anxiety than to joy and laughter. I don't mind that the film explores the full spectrum of emotions, I just wish that the experience hadn't been so one-sided.The premise of the film - a simple man accomplishing extraordinary things - will be familiar to those who have seen the higher profile film, Forrest Gump, a film whose similarities and dissimilarities to Being There I will explore later. The protagonist, Chance (Sellers), no doubt lives up to his name, as he is a victim of circumstance and coincidence. The only clothes he owns are antiques that happen to be back in fashion, and the body he occupies of a middle-aged man provides him with the unintentional guise of a distinguished, well-educated, and wealthy economic savant. He happens upon a rich woman and her husband, who also happens to be a well-regarded presidential adviser. When he introduces himself for the first time through a bout of coughing, the couple mistakes his name for Chauncey Gardner, and he accomplishes more in a matter of days under that alias than anyone could have dreamt for Chance the gardener. His influence becomes contagious, and even has a stake in the political arena. The script is satirical, ironic, cautionary, critical, and sharp. Rarely does it falter.Sellers, as Chance, is the soul of the film. It's a brilliant performance, and one of the best ever captured. He is joined by a plethora of great supporting actors, including Shirley MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas, who are all aided by Hal Ashby's poetic direction, and the startlingly haunting cinematography of Caleb Deschanel. Ashby's world is one of pastiche, ass-kissing, and shallow surfaces. Unfortunately, each supporting character is made to be one of these types in some form or another, save for one character whom I will not reveal. Douglas and MacLaine exude boatloads of emotion, but as they are equally fooled by Chance's unwitting con as anyone else in the film, there's a certain shallowness that leaves them disappointingly empty. Given the context of the film (especially the last shot), this may be deliberate, but it is never the less dissatisfying, and also leads me to the film's one major flaw.Unlike the aforementioned Forrest Gump, no one in the film is aware of the fact that Chance is far from a genius; in fact, that in itself is a rather generous euphemism. Chance doesn't know that he's different, and neither does anyone else around him. It's the risk that at any moment the charade might implode that makes this film such an anxious and painstaking experience. How will they react, you ask yourself, when they find out they've all been fooled? We learn early on that Chance is completely dependent on those around him; his very survival depends on the kindness of others, and how charitable could they possibly be when they realize the truth? It's this anxiety, and the spectator's omniscient perspective (we're in on the joke) that often dulls the humour. As such, watching Chance is like watching a lost puppy navigate traffic he is a creature obliviously in control of everyone's life but his own. This is not to say, however, that Gump is the superior film. On the contrary, Being There trumps that film on every artistic level, but Gump benefited from coming second so that the master could not learn from his student.In the end, Being There is an extraordinary feat on the levels of artistry, performance, writing, and satire.

On the contrary, Being There trumps that film on every artistic level, but Gump benefited from coming second so that the master could not learn from his student.In the end, Being There is an extraordinary feat on the levels of artistry, performance, writing, and satire. Though its comedic ambitions fall a little short, it is a film that you absolutely must see. To paraphrase the film's protagonist, you'll like to watch.

What are people thinking about? Of course it is better than 1 star - but 10???? It is a nice movie, with a fine happy ending. But to make it number one in the world, is a bit too much. There can be only one number one - and that is without a doubt The Godfather.Please everyone, try to consider your votes again - I hate to see that things are not in the right perspective. If IMDb should be accepted as the world real Bibel for film lovers, The Shawshank Redemption can't be our top movie. A lot of other movies are far better.

Amores Perros is that exception, for me. It felt more like a 2 1\/2 hour soap opera, than a riveting drama. The only story of the three presented here that somewhat interested me was that of Daniel and Valeria. The rest of my time with Amores Perros was spent wondering why none of these people have caller ID, wondering whether this movie set some kind of record for most fake dead dogs in a film, wondering who El Chivo reminded me of (Il Duce from Boondock Saints), wondering why they just didn't cover the darn hole (who leaves gaping holes in the middle of their apartment floor?), and trying to think up a name for the dog (never came up with anything I liked more than Lost Dog). Mostly, I was just bored. I've read other people describe this as a powerful movie. Unfortunately, it just didn't do much for me. I give it credit for breaking my heart over those gorgeous legs (a true tragedy, my friends), but that's about it.  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 September 2010","score":"9 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" To make God laugh, tell him your plans.I usually love these kinds of sprawling dramas about interconnected people, but I suppose there's an exception to every rule.

If this movie wasn't directed by Ridley Scott there would be tons of reviews here destroying it and for good reason. Nothing about the movie stands out. The story is weak, predictable and other than the socialite\\cop angle, its been done before and much better. I fail to see how anyone cannot guess the whole movie 10 minutes in. The murder plot makes little sense, its filled with holes and the actions the killer takes at the end of the movie are so unrealistic they're a joke. There's very little action, everything is slow from start to finish. Scott's direction is OK but the whole movie is far too dark. The acting is very solid, it really is a shame that Tom Berenger wasn't a bigger star because the man could act! The women deliver very good performances too. Its a pleasure to watch Lorraine Bracco and Mimi Rogers is hot as always. Jerry Orbach is not given much to work with but he really steals every scene he's in. The music is also fantastic, great soundtrack. Its hard to imagine that a movie with such talented people both in front and behind the camera could be so bland, predictable and devoid of any interest but its true. Its all too uninspired, safe, by the numbers with a nice happy ending wrapped in a bow. What a waste.
