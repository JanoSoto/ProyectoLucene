[{"date":"27 November 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous has a title that hits a black comedy chord, since no ordinary feeling of being really hungry is at all involved here. The movie is not solely in the black comedy column. In the last act, we have a mixture. The main cannibal-in-chief delivers line after line after line of above-it-all humor as he seeks to enlarge his entourage, poking fun at the whole enterprise of eating other people to gain strength. But as he does this, the Guy Pearce character, borderline and wavering at times throughout the movie in terms of his resolve, is dead serious in putting an end to the cannibal situation. And further comedy occurs when the general arrives and happens to taste the human stew, which does seem to be habit-forming because it imparts strength.The beginning of the film, however, is much more serious in eliciting some horror moments and suspense. Even the middle has its moments. So we have horror becoming black comedy, not an easily integrated mixture. One can read themes into this picture, but at best there is some superficial tossing around of classical philosophic quests versus the appetites of men.The picture is quite off-putting for the great majority of viewers, I would imagine, who will wonder what this is possibly about. I could only wonder why anyone would want to write such a story or film it. It's not something the average person is going to want to watch once a year.Granted there are horror fans who revel in new and grotesque sights on film, this has that novelty and shock value.As a film, I see this as overall average or below. It does what it does well enough, and certainly the acting is fine and photography fine. It creates plenty of atmosphere. But the story is a letdown. Horrid behavior cannot sustain a movie and make it good. Where's this movie's heart and soul? It seems to have disappeared into the stew.
