There is one word that everyone fears, fate.  Fate controls our destiny and we always worry what the outcome may be.  For Tom Tykwer, a famous German Director, he shows us that if there were just one slight difference in timeline, the outcome could be very different. In 1998, he released an amazing film called Lola Rennt or, for all those people who can't speak German, Run Lola Run.  Set in the German capital of Berlin, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a small time courier for big gangsters, mistakenly loses 100,000DM on a train.  Calling his girl friend, Lola (Franka Potente), from a phone booth in a square, Manni lays down the story of what happened and how much trouble he will be in if he does not find and return the money by noon that day.  Lola apologizes for not picking up Manni at the collection point but is willing to help.  She has exactly twenty minutes find the 100,000DM by Noon.  Having no mode of transport to get her there she runs, fast.  Sounds simple enough! Well, not exactly. This film is unusual because there are three stories, each depicting the twenty minutes up to noon.  Same people and same mission but a different outcome.  The first timeline is 'on time'; the second Lola is behind time and the third she is ahead of time.  Going into too much detail will spoil the ending, or endings if you wish, and in any case, there is just too much detail to describe. The characters are very cleverly created and orchestrated.  Franka Potente, who is now internationally known for her part as the leading lady in the Bourne Identity, plays Lola, a young woman caught in a world of love, hate and stress.  Moritz Bleibtreu plays Manni, the love stricken and anxious boyfriend. Tom Tykwer is not only a director but he is a music composer, (who recently wrote the score for Any Given Sunday).  He has a broad, artistic, talent and experience, which show through in his direction of this film.  The treatment is both exquisite and unique.  The montage sequences worked well and speedy cartoons were basic and short but added to the overall excitement.  Tykwer uses his musical ability to help create a soundtrack that suits the film brilliantly.  The score matches the fast pace of the action.  Clearly Tykwer's musical experience is evident throughout. This is the first film I have seen of Tykwer's and it had me hooked from the start right through to the very end.  The opening scene was of all these blurred people standing around but about four people are in sharp focus and they turn out to have a key part to play in this film.  'What part,' do they play you ask? . Well, you'll just have to see the film for yourself to find out.  If you ignore that the film is in German with English subtitles and you liked Sliding Doors, you will love Run, Lola, Run.

This film explored the question of 'what if'.  From time to time we all have strange dreams like jumping from rooftop to rooftop chasing someone or being chased.  Some times you seemed to get involved in some of the most amazing martial arts.  Sometimes dreams can be reflected in films.  One such film is the Chinese movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  When I was invited to see this I had no idea what it was about because I had heard nothing, read nothing nor even seen a poster.  I was shocked and amazed at how strangely familiar this film was because it seemed to reflect dreams I had experienced.  Ignoring whether I was suffering deja vu this film really had my attention and I was determined to find out more about this type of film. This film could be considered the pinnacle of the genre `Wuxia Pian'. 'Wuxia Pian' is deeply rooted in mythical China when the country was largely lawless and the only hope was the wandering 'knights in shining armour' or 'knights errant'.  Since the beginning of movies filmmakers, especially in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have depicted 'wuxia' in dazzling displays of swordsmanship and mystical power.  Kung fu tended to replace swordplay films during the 1970s and 80s.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon resurrects the more traditional 'wuxia' plot and which often presents the struggle between social, responsibility and loyalty and personal desires. Set in the ancient world of China the story revolves around a sword called 'The Green Destiny'.  The sword belongs to Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) but he has given it to Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  When the sword is stolen by a thief in the dark Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien travel through the ancient cities to track the thief.  Unknown to these two warriors the thief is none other than the Governor's daughter, Jen Ju (Ziyi Zang).  Fallowing Jen Ju leads a trail of magical martial arts and flying.  Yes, you heard correctly, flying - well jumping as though there is almost no gravity.  I can't give to much detail because much of the action that goes on in this wonderful film is simply stunning. Starring international action star Chow Yun Fat as Master Li Mu Bai, who's latest release is Bulletproof Monk, is suited to this role incredibly well. Another international star, made famous in James Bond's Tomorrow Never Dies, is Michelle Yeoh, who plays Yu Shu lien, the women in love with the master Li Mu Bai.  Another young and new actress is Ziyi Zang, making her first international appearance in Rush Hour 2 as the bad girl.  She stars as Jen Ju, the thief in love with Xiou Hu 'Dark Cloud', Chen Chang, an outlaw living in the desert plains China. Ang Lee, who is directing his latest blockbuster The Hulk with Eric Banner, shows his methods of directing a martial arts movie very well.  The fight choreography that Woo Ping, (The Matrix Trilogy), delivers is highly professional and simply astonishing.  Ang Lee uses his directing methods to show the ancient Chinese scenery in a beautiful array of lively colours. The special effects in this film are highly professional because they looked really natural.  The change between a normal and real life action and a special effect was seamless. What I didn't like about the movie was that it was a bit slow getting started and seemed to take along time to set the scene.  However, once the action began the music and fight choreography lifted my spirits considerably.  The acting was a bit on the dull side but when it came to the fighting, the acting seemed to improve.  The script was interesting because it must have taken in depth research into the world of 'wuxia pian' and ancient China.  Whether they could fight as well or fly as well is a mystery but it does give that sense of freedom to it. If you ignore the fact that the film is in Chinese with English Subtitles or the fact that it has been dubbed in English you should enjoy this mystical film.  From the amazing fight scenes to the wonderful scenery, it is a film of imagination and excitement. I really enjoyed watching this sensation.

When he realizes that he has the power to cry. Only then is he comfortable enough with himself that he can be one with his emotions and allow them to develop on a whole new level. Teena Brandon was a real person, Teena Brandon was a real individual and Teena Brandon was a real girl. This is her story. But what makes this film so great is that it is not about who did what or what came from who, rather it is a haunting story of a girl who was facing a sexual identity crisis and a boy who just wanted to belong.  That girl was Teena Brandon. She lived in a Nebraska trailer park with a friend who was forced to run to a small town by the name if Falls City. She has to leave because of the before mentioned `boy.' His name was Brandon Teena. He was an exact replica of Teena except with short cut hair and a stock stuffed down the front of his jeans. If you haven't figured it out yet, Teena was a transsexual. But it wasn't that Teena wanted to be male, more over, Teena believed that she could be male. In Falls City she is instantly befriended by a group of friends who welcome her into their string of drugs and alcohol. They are not like this because they feel that it is the cool thing to do, they are like this because they know no other way. This is where Brandon's eyes catch a glace of Lana. Lana is a dark and depressed girl who is always in a haze of reality and never knows exactly who she is. She may look rough on the exterior but she is not a bad person. She is a ray of light that the sun has never set upon. She knows no happiness therefore she feels none and has no sympathy for herself or her situation. Then one day Brandon brings her a flower. He is by no means a perfect human specimen, yet he is a caring and compassionate individual whose intentions include no harm. The two fall in love and plane big things together based on the big dreams Brandon has told her about. But just like Brandon's life, most of them are base don lies. Not lies that were indented to hurt, but lies that were indented to disguise morality. They go through many stages of their love, one being denial after the entire town finds out of Brandon's true form. This is what makes a film like this work. It loves it characters and would prefer more to base its surroundings on human nature instead of emotions. There is a scene in which Brandon and Lana are beginning to engage in their love when Lana sees down Brandon's shirt. She is confused by her sightings but drawn by her passion. We suspect that she must know by now that Brandon was a girl but the question is at what point does she become in tune with it that it matters less what she loves more than who she loves. There are numerous ways that this film could have gone in a totally wrong direction. But the film does everything right. It doesn't mar us with true-life facts or define anyone into typical labels. There is no right or wrong answer to the question that this film represents so director Kimberly Peirce has no intentions on ever answering it. This is not a film out to exploit the lives of teens; it is a study on how teens exploit each other. It is not a tale of boy meets girl. It is a tale of mind meets body and it is not a look into social injustices. It is a look into human injustices. Peirce obviously knew her material before going into this film. Even though these are real life characters deep down inside I can't help but feel that there is a little Brandon Teena in all of us. Everyone has that one desire that they long for but can't achieve it because they don't believe in it. Brandon is not a gifted with a huge amount of intelligence. He doesn't seem to be able to decipher between a good choice and a band one, but he is smart enough to know that when he has a choice there is no taking the easy way out. Some of those choices led him to happiness, some led him to despair, some even led him to the brink of his own decency, but one led him straight to tragedy. This is a very disturbing film, hard to watch at times, but it is not disturbing because of its often graphic content of subject matter. It is disturbing because of the wide array of emotions it has tucked firmly in its grasp. Emotions can be terrifying things if you don't know how to use them, but ever more disturbing are they if you know how to use them just to well. Brandon is not a likeable character or one that anyone should feel sorry for. He brought everything that happened to him on himself, right? But because we are able to see a small piece of us in his big universe that we come to feel for him, love him even. This isn't a film about a bunch of stupid teens going through hard times. This is about a bunch of stupid teens going through our times. We just don't see out lives like that of these characters because we know otherwise. We know that we can come home at night and eat a nice meal and spend time with a loving family. What we don't know is that we are living an image that has been taught to us. Weird isn't it? We live an ideal life that we gather from the media, now when the media is showing us what our life is really like it is a little hard to stomach because it is not what we have come to terms with Emotions, scary things aren't they? This is why Peirce can base a film something that is looked down upon in society and make it into something that has to speak about love, compassion and a desire to be one with yourself and have other be able to understand that self that is you. Hilary Swank won her first Oscar for her role as Brandon, and it was a well-disserved victory. Swank declines any invitation to over act her character and also refuses to under exaggerate her. She is not an actor yet she is not an amateur, she is a human being in a film about a human being and because of that we know what she is going through even though we may not fully understand her situation. Chloe Sevigny is also not far behind Swank as Lana, matching the star scene for scene. Sevigny creates an invisible wall around here character that reads like a keep out sign but only draws you closer to wanted to understand how this character functions. This is a film that wants you to ask questions about its characters but not get answers from their actions; this is not a film of stereotyping. All of the actors understand that and work towards it. It is a factor that makes for three for the most intense and beautiful love scenes since Blue Velvet and one of the most brutal rape sequences since Heaven and Earth. These are actors in possession of roles that require a lot of mental strain from them and they are all content on giving it. If you don't know how the story ends I would be glad to inform you. Like any slice of true love, it must end in tragedy. After being raped, Brandon is mercilessly shot and killed due to a lack of participation from the local police. You may want to ask yourself, how could such a sweet and caring individual who wanted nothing more than to be who he wanted to be killed with such little sympathy? Because, boys don't cry.

It loves it characters and would prefer more to base its surroundings on human nature instead of emotions. There is a scene in which Brandon and Lana are beginning to engage in their love when Lana sees down Brandon's shirt. She is confused by her sightings but drawn by her passion. We suspect that she must know by now that Brandon was a girl but the question is at what point does she become in tune with it that it matters less what she loves more than who she loves. There are numerous ways that this film could have gone in a totally wrong direction. But the film does everything right. It doesn't mar us with true-life facts or define anyone into typical labels. There is no right or wrong answer to the question that this film represents so director Kimberly Peirce has no intentions on ever answering it. This is not a film out to exploit the lives of teens; it is a study on how teens exploit each other. It is not a tale of boy meets girl. It is a tale of mind meets body and it is not a look into social injustices. It is a look into human injustices. Peirce obviously knew her material before going into this film. Even though these are real life characters deep down inside I can't help but feel that there is a little Brandon Teena in all of us. Everyone has that one desire that they long for but can't achieve it because they don't believe in it. Brandon is not a gifted with a huge amount of intelligence. He doesn't seem to be able to decipher between a good choice and a band one, but he is smart enough to know that when he has a choice there is no taking the easy way out. Some of those choices led him to happiness, some led him to despair, some even led him to the brink of his own decency, but one led him straight to tragedy. This is a very disturbing film, hard to watch at times, but it is not disturbing because of its often graphic content of subject matter. It is disturbing because of the wide array of emotions it has tucked firmly in its grasp. Emotions can be terrifying things if you don't know how to use them, but ever more disturbing are they if you know how to use them just to well. Brandon is not a likeable character or one that anyone should feel sorry for. He brought everything that happened to him on himself, right? But because we are able to see a small piece of us in his big universe that we come to feel for him, love him even. This isn't a film about a bunch of stupid teens going through hard times. This is about a bunch of stupid teens going through our times. We just don't see out lives like that of these characters because we know otherwise. We know that we can come home at night and eat a nice meal and spend time with a loving family. What we don't know is that we are living an image that has been taught to us. Weird isn't it? We live an ideal life that we gather from the media, now when the media is showing us what our life is really like it is a little hard to stomach because it is not what we have come to terms with Emotions, scary things aren't they? This is why Peirce can base a film something that is looked down upon in society and make it into something that has to speak about love, compassion and a desire to be one with yourself and have other be able to understand that self that is you. Hilary Swank won her first Oscar for her role as Brandon, and it was a well-disserved victory. Swank declines any invitation to over act her character and also refuses to under exaggerate her. She is not an actor yet she is not an amateur, she is a human being in a film about a human being and because of that we know what she is going through even though we may not fully understand her situation. Chloe Sevigny is also not far behind Swank as Lana, matching the star scene for scene. Sevigny creates an invisible wall around here character that reads like a keep out sign but only draws you closer to wanted to understand how this character functions. This is a film that wants you to ask questions about its characters but not get answers from their actions; this is not a film of stereotyping. All of the actors understand that and work towards it. It is a factor that makes for three for the most intense and beautiful love scenes since Blue Velvet and one of the most brutal rape sequences since Heaven and Earth. These are actors in possession of roles that require a lot of mental strain from them and they are all content on giving it. If you don't know how the story ends I would be glad to inform you. Like any slice of true love, it must end in tragedy. After being raped, Brandon is mercilessly shot and killed due to a lack of participation from the local police. You may want to ask yourself, how could such a sweet and caring individual who wanted nothing more than to be who he wanted to be killed with such little sympathy? Because, boys don't cry.     ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 March 2003","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"    ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** At what point in a boy's life does he become a man? When he realizes that he has the power to cry. Only then is he comfortable enough with himself that he can be one with his emotions and allow them to develop on a whole new level. Teena Brandon was a real person, Teena Brandon was a real individual and Teena Brandon was a real girl. This is her story. But what makes this film so great is that it is not about who did what or what came from who, rather it is a haunting story of a girl who was facing a sexual identity crisis and a boy who just wanted to belong.  That girl was Teena Brandon. She lived in a Nebraska trailer park with a friend who was forced to run to a small town by the name if Falls City. She has to leave because of the before mentioned `boy.' His name was Brandon Teena. He was an exact replica of Teena except with short cut hair and a stock stuffed down the front of his jeans. If you haven't figured it out yet, Teena was a transsexual. But it wasn't that Teena wanted to be male, more over, Teena believed that she could be male. In Falls City she is instantly befriended by a group of friends who welcome her into their string of drugs and alcohol. They are not like this because they feel that it is the cool thing to do, they are like this because they know no other way. This is where Brandon's eyes catch a glace of Lana. Lana is a dark and depressed girl who is always in a haze of reality and never knows exactly who she is. She may look rough on the exterior but she is not a bad person. She is a ray of light that the sun has never set upon. She knows no happiness therefore she feels none and has no sympathy for herself or her situation. Then one day Brandon brings her a flower. He is by no means a perfect human specimen, yet he is a caring and compassionate individual whose intentions include no harm. The two fall in love and plane big things together based on the big dreams Brandon has told her about. But just like Brandon's life, most of them are base don lies. Not lies that were indented to hurt, but lies that were indented to disguise morality. They go through many stages of their love, one being denial after the entire town finds out of Brandon's true form. This is what makes a film like this work.

There aren't any really engaging characters, the plot is a collection of gross-out moments from Roman drama, the verse is completely forgettable and basically everything about the play indicates that it's an early, uninspired piece.  It's okay compared to The Comedy or Errors, but interesting mostly as a curiosity for students of Shakespeare.  I've always been baffled by it.  Is it a grisly comedy (like the humor of the Evil Dead films) loaded with scholarly references?  Or is someone supposed to take this stuff seriously as high (grosser-than-gross-but-nonetheless-high) drama?  I've read some compelling arguments for either side.Julie Taymor's movie suggests to me that it probably was written to laughed at.  I don't think you could ask for a better Titus and Tamora.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  The all brought a lot of gravity and seriousness to their roles, properly pumped and glowering.  It's all very professional work, but it kinda bored me after a while.  There is a lot of Titus that is just hard core gore and chest beating silliness, and yet the whole cast is in Masterpiece Theater mode. The art direction and cinematography was a pleasant diversion.  On the up side, the film has a unique look about it.  It is one of the most successful attempts at staging Shakespeare I've ever seen on film.  The hodge-podge of the mid-century and Roman aesthetic did a lot of move the scenery back in time while keeping the set anchored by things anyone could recognize like military uniforms, expensive suits, and limos.  After all, authentic Roman sets and costumes in a play written by a 16th Englishman (who wasn't bothered by anachronisms himself) wouldn't be any truer to the spirit of the piece.  (However, some outfits were so Brit-pop 80's that I felt depressingly old for thinking they looked cool.)On the down side, sometimes the art direction completely swamped everything else and I've seen this stuff before.  Also, there weren't any sets that looked like people actually used them to live in or debate in or eat in.  Everything, from the costumes to the biggest set pieces, looked like something built just to look good and for people to strut around in.  Maybe it's deliberate.  Taymor is nodding at the pure theatricality of Titus - working with the fact that these are not even remotely believable characters in a drama that has almost no naturalistic details.  Maybe the film Titus is like those fashion shows where impossibly odd looking women strut down runways wearing outfits that have no practical function.On the whole, I kinda enjoyed the film.  I'm happy to watch smart people take on Shakespeare's least interesting play.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't already curious about the idea of seeing a flashy version of Titus Andronicus or someone whose taste tended towards noisy, stylistized films like Run Lola Run or Jean Jeunet's stuff.&#133;what was up with Alan Cummings playing Saturnius like a satanic Pee Wee Herman (big chair and all)?

It is a story about how a man named Guy Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) confronts his fears, faces his past, and recovers to find happiness in a new land.  The film traces Quoyle's journey toward self-discovery when he returns to his family home in Newfoundland.The story begins with a narration by Quoyle as a boy when his father throws him into the water off of a boat dock.  That childhood episode is a sink-or-swim education provided by his father that left Quoyle breathless, and afraid.  Through the narration we learn that Quoyle is a man who has never succeeded at anything, and his father is always reminding him of his failures.  He struggles through every task he is given and is lost in day-to-day life.As a man with low self-esteem Quoyle is lonely and desperate for attention. One day he meets Petal Bear (Cate Blanchett) and he thinks he is love. Quoyle believes he has found a wife, someone he can love and spend the rest of his life with.  Petal on the other hand just wants to be a kept woman, and sees Quoyle as one of the many men in her chain.  Together they have a daughter Bunny (Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer), who makes Quoyle happy and Petal miserable.  Petal eventually starts cheating on Quoyle, even to the point where she brings her one-night stands back to the house.  In a short time frame Quoyle looses his parents who commit suicide and Petal is killed in a car accident while attempting to run off with her boyfriend.Quoyle's Aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) comes to pay her respects and collect her brother's ashes, because she wants to take them back to Newfoundland, the family's home.  Aunt Agnis convinces Quoyle to take Bunny and move to Newfoundland with her.   In Newfoundland Quoyle gets a new job at the local newspaper where he finds success writing a Shipping News Column that builds his self-esteem.  He then pursues a romance with a widow Wavey (Julianne Moore), which brings him happiness.The background selected by director Lasse Hallstrom is appropriate for the setting, cold, dreary and unfeeling.
