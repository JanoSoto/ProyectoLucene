There were jokes about every day life. Jokes about the simple fact that the Dude is a dinosaur. Every other radical or hippie grew up, got jobs, and stopped with the drugs. The Dude on the other hand, is still living in the 60s. And if you look at his friends they all have their own little stories, and show how deeply their pasts affect them. However, they show this great characterization through jokes. Something very hard to do. For example Walter(Goodman)obviously hit his peak and the height of his life, back in Vietnam and when he was married.

From the outset the story tears at the inside of your mind and seeks a comfortable place to hide, a warm understanding place to call home. This movie slowly creates its premise from the veil that shrouds the spirit world and pulls you into a place that is both familiar and uneasy. This is the small noise in the night not the loud shrieking of banshees. With out a doubt  M. Night Shyamalan has written and directed a brilliant look at the spirit world, his command of character and plot and the compelling use of camera and editing reminds one of Hitchcock or a more mature contemporary director like Altman in the Gingerbread Man. Though much of the focus has rightly been on the child actor Haley Joel Osment and tough guy Bruce Willis' re-birth as a charming and complex vehicle, the cohesion and mounting tension of the film owe much to the well thought out work of Shyamalan. Starting with the development of a wonderful chemistry between the actors and their slow developed interaction with each other the writer-director M. Night Shyamalan weaves a work that somehow keeps you both pressed back into and at the same time on the edge of your seat. He is the face that we see in the firelight for he tells stories in much the same way that other master storytellers do &#150; slowly building up each piece of his fantasy world. It clearly is Shyamalan that continually surprises us with small feints and intricate maneuvers, for me it was his work that was a pleasure to watch.

The only problem is, William Friedkin is not Paul Verhoeven, Linda Fiorentino is not Sharon Stone, David Caruso is not Michael Douglas and Jade is a very bad clone of Basic Instinct.  But there are so many familiar similarities in these two films that it makes you cringe watching them.  Fiorantino is a psychiatrist, so was Stone.  Caruso is a cop, so was Douglas.  Caruso drove a Mustang, so did Douglas.  They both take place in San Francisco so that they can have a car chase over lots of hills and almost destroy both cars in the process.  There are lots of underground sexual practises in both films.  And they both try to be sexy.  And both open with a violent murder of a very improtant figure.  I honestly can't believe that the producers would buy this and then spend 50 million on it with a B cast.  I'm not one of those people that thinks that Caruso is a bad actor, but I certainly don't think that he is big enough from a TV show to open a film, and if I, as a casual film fan can figure that out for myself, then why can't powerful movie executives?  It just makes no sense to me.  Caruso has charisma and he is quite good in this role, but he should be happy sticking to supporting roles.  He just doesn't have a name to kickstart a film.  As for the director, when was was the last time that he made anything that was good?  I honestly believe that he got lucky when he made The Exorcist although I do think that The French Connection was pretty good.  But that was 20 years ago.  Maybe he has lost his touch. Jade is boring, uninteresting, slow and laughable.  You want to figure out who the killer is?  You should really have two guesses.  Find out who has the biggest names in the film and consider how much screen time they have.  One has two scenes and the other is in it quite a bit but just hangs around in the background.  Of course there is the surprise ending that will just shock you as much as Sixth Sense ( yeah right!!!!!!!!)  Jade is a really bad film and it is not worth your time.  It is laughable and silly and the only thing that I kinda of enjoyed was when I realized that Caruso and Crenna were once in a film together 13 years before this one.  That was First Blood.  It was probably funny when they first met on the set after all that time.  Back then Crenna had more of a name, after all he was Trautman.  Caruso was just Mitch.  Now Caruso is trying to make a name for himself with this film again.  I don't think it will work.  Other than that small piece of trivia, there is nothing to like abou this film.

It follows the mythos of the original He-Man mini comics (the ones that came with the toys) more than the plot of the animated series, as such He-Man is not secretly Prince Adam. (My fellow post teenage virgins as well as losers in general will probably understand what I'm talking about.) Anyway Langela proves the perfect Skeletor.  Unlike the cartoon character he proves to be convincingly pure evil.  I must say that he honestly did succeed in being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. Hat's off to director Gary Goddard and the cast for taking the story entirely seriously and not just dismissing it as a campy hour and a half long toy add.  It's that kind of conviction that distinguishes between art and commercial shlock. This movie also taught me some valuable life lessons.  For instance, if a guy with a skull head gets massive god-like power the only real change he will make to his life is giving himself golden armour.  (Both Skeletor and the Red Skull have done this.)  I also learned that when some one gets god-like power, to defeat them all you need to do is push them into a muddy ditch. Having the characters travel to late 1980's earth made this movie all the better specially since they got to meet Courteney Cox (what a babe. Grrrowwlll).  Why doesn't anybody ever ask her about this movie when she's on talk shows? Oh wait it's cause there's no reason they should care. Anyway if you don't have anything better to do give it a rent... and wait till the end of the credits for the secret surprise.  You can probably find it at your local Blockbuster Video!

It was an excellent, perfectly acted (in most cases), well directed film with beautiful camera work. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays a single mother of two whose husband supposedly died in Korea (it takes place in the fifties). She invites a mysterious stranger who she hit with her car (causing a broken leg) to stay with them until his cast is taken off, with no idea on how he will change their lives forever.In his movies, Patrick Swayze is either good or horrendous. In this one he is both. At some points it looks like he'll get an Oscar, at others, a Golden Raspberry. The underrated Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Abyss, Limbo) is very good in her role, but the best performance belongs to Joseph Mazzello, who plays her oldest son, Tom. Despite being third billed, Mazzello probably has the most screen time, and should've got some kind of award for his performance (though he wasn't as good her as he was in The Cure). The other two leads were good. In his first film Seth Mumy plays Mastrantonio's youngest son, and is given very few scenes with the rest of the family, spending most of his time with Swayze's dog, who I'll go to now. The dog is completely adorable and happens to be a very good actor, even though he\/she is a dog.Without revealing anything, I'll say that the ending was completely unexpected, in a bad way.

Pi is not for every moviegoer, but those who love the look and feel of film noir, and those who enjoy films that exercise the mind as well as the imagination, will not be disappointed.The story is based on a mathematician's pursuit of the number pattern that holds the key to the stock market. His theory holds that all nature operates under immutable laws. These laws may be expressed numerically. The stock market is a natural, numerical entity. Therefore, the stock market operates under mathematically expressed laws of nature. By finding the key sequence within the stock market, he will prove his theory that all nature may be expressed numerically.In his own words 1. Mathematics is the language of nature. 2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. 3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge. Therefore There are patterns everywhere in nature.The tension of his pursuit is palpable. This is a portrait of the Mad Genius character that transcends the cliche, redefining madness and genius as portrayed on screen. As he gets closer to his goal, his paranoia increases, as do his headaches (convulsive attacks resulting from childhood trauma) and hallucinations.Adding to the madness are two groups interested in the hero's results. One group wants the key to the worldwide markets, while the other seeks the true name of God. Both need the hero's genius, but he needs them in fundamental ways as well one for their technology, the other for their perspicacity.Shot in black and white, the filmmakers succeed in their attempts to create visual tension in a frequently static world. At times the camera bobs and weaves along with the motion and sanity of the hero, enhancing the film. It is neither disorienting, nor distracting--unlike the mind-numbing camera motion in The Blair Witch Project.The music is best described as industrial-driven rhythm. The main titles feature a track by Massive Attack that musically expresses the anxiety, frustration, energy, and madness of the hero's pursuit. Just as the camera-motion sequences add to the film's impact, the music provides a perfect paranoiac aural soundtrack.Mathematical references abound in the film, all of which are explained in their most basic form without being condescending. Greek theorists and the Japanese game Go are made relevant to the story. And the hero names his computer Enigma, after the legendary Nazi code broken at Bletchley Park during World War II.The most glaring problem with the film was its predictable storyline. Within the context of the film the story is perfectly logical--what you would expect from a film based on a mathematician. It is, therefore, predictable.

It HAS to be good! But thats how they suck you in!Don't get me wrong. Bowfinger is not a bad film, its just not that good either. Mainly, I felt cheated since everybody on TV was singing the high praises of this film.In particular is Jay Leno of NBC's The Tonight Show. Whenever he'd have a cast member from Bowfinger on his show, he would bring up what he called the funniest scene in any summer movie this year. Said scene is Eddie Murphy running frantically on a freeway. While I did find this scene amusing, I would hardly call it the funniest in any summer movie this year. Take basically any scene in South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut or American Pie, and they're still about ten times more funnier than that scene.At least the basic plot of the film is simple to grasp. Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is a pathetic excuse for a film maker who opperates out of a run down shack. He's about to give up, until a fantastic screenplay comes across his desk. Unfortunatly, he doesn't have much money, so he hires some friends to star in it, and in order to get it distributed, he has to somehow get the hottest film star in the world, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to star in it. Naturally unable to do so, he and his crew simply follow Ramsey around with the camera and have their stars approch him with their lines, basically freaking him out. To patch up the gaps in the film, Bowfinger hires a small town actress named Daisy (Heather Graham), and a nerdy Kit Ramsy look-alike named Jiff (Murphy, in a duel role), who have some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, (Bowfinger, not the one in the movie, don't get confused). However, that's not saying much.All in all, Bowfinger is a decent movie, but if you can see anything better this summer, like Mystery Men or American Pie, you should see those instead.Overall 2 1\/2 Stars ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 1999","score":"","review":"  I saw this movie with high hopes, but I finished watching it with disappointment.I figured, Hey this movie stars Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, two comic geniuses.

Said scene is Eddie Murphy running frantically on a freeway. While I did find this scene amusing, I would hardly call it the funniest in any summer movie this year. Take basically any scene in South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut or American Pie, and they're still about ten times more funnier than that scene.At least the basic plot of the film is simple to grasp. Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) is a pathetic excuse for a film maker who opperates out of a run down shack. He's about to give up, until a fantastic screenplay comes across his desk. Unfortunatly, he doesn't have much money, so he hires some friends to star in it, and in order to get it distributed, he has to somehow get the hottest film star in the world, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to star in it. Naturally unable to do so, he and his crew simply follow Ramsey around with the camera and have their stars approch him with their lines, basically freaking him out. To patch up the gaps in the film, Bowfinger hires a small town actress named Daisy (Heather Graham), and a nerdy Kit Ramsy look-alike named Jiff (Murphy, in a duel role), who have some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, (Bowfinger, not the one in the movie, don't get confused). However, that's not saying much.All in all, Bowfinger is a decent movie, but if you can see anything better this summer, like Mystery Men or American Pie, you should see those instead.Overall 2 1\/2 Stars ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"31 August 1999","score":"","review":"  I saw this movie with high hopes, but I finished watching it with disappointment.I figured, Hey this movie stars Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, two comic geniuses. It HAS to be good! But thats how they suck you in!Don't get me wrong. Bowfinger is not a bad film, its just not that good either.

I laughed at almost every single gag, they were all very original, unlike the ones in Leslie's previous movie Spy Hard (which was awful). The only thing i didn't like about this film was that you could see the actors were laughing, like they knew that they weren't making a serious film.                             Anyway, I liked this movie more than The Naked Gun 33 1\/3 and any of the Hot Shots! movies. A definite must-see for Nielsen- and spoof film fans.I give it an 8!                              Oh, i almost forgot Richard Crenna is great spoofing Tommy Lee Jones! ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 1999","score":"","review":"  this is definitely one of the best films starring Leslie Nielsen!
