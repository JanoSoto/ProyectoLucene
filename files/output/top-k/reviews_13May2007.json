I didn't even know about this film till I did Film Studies in college and this was introduced to me.This film is clearly based in some way to the murderers Leopold and Loeb. John Dall (Brandon Shaw) and Farley Granger (Phillip Morgan) think they are one of the select view who are superior in intellect and they are more value to society than their victim David. Right from the start, Brandon shows a very malicious and warped character who doesn't seem affected by the fact he has helped to take a life. With Phillip, he seems to be more shocked and can't get over what he has done, maybe realising that his feelings about the murder and the murder itself are different now that he has killed David. Clearly Phillip is a sheep who is bossed around by Brandon. I must admit I wasn't aware there was gay undertones, it shows how clueless I was in that aspect.Brandon is very cruel. He is entertaining himself and seems to get a delight out of pushing the boundaries of the situation more He puts his dead friend in a chest and then serves food from his grave, he invites his friends and family to the party and then uses the rope he used to kill his friend to tie up books to give to his dead friend's father.I don't think Cary Grant would have been as good as James Stewart in the role of Rupert Cadell. He plays a type of cat and mouse game with the killers. He seems to be suspicious from the very start and keeps trying to get one of them to admit their sins and yet he is shocked when he sees the dead body and the nastiness of what they have done with David's body and the way they have treated David's family and friends. You can see Stewart taking in every bit of information and see him genuinely scared of what Brandon will do.The film feels very claustrophobic and doesn't seem to have any breaks but I read somewhere that there was breaks and to keep the film going without the cuts, they came up with a technique where they would zoom in and out of objects and people. The camera is the eyes for the audience particularly when Stewart is telling the guys how he would get rid of David and the camera follows around, giving the audience an idea of the events leading up to the audience seeing David dead at the beginning of the film. It is very spooky and has me on edge when I see that scene as you are waiting for someone to react to what Stewart is saying.Alfred Hitchcock makes good use of his actors, the space he has and the camera angles. He builds and builds the tension up throughout the film and when all the guests are leaving, you think that Brandon and Phillip have got away with murder till Stewart turns up again and you know the guys are desperate and that Brandon has a gun in his pocket so for the rest of the film you have a sense of foreboding and hope that they don't get away with murder and that Stewart doesn't get killed.

But after doing that I found myself puzzled. For what reason is Bad Boys so highly regarded as a great action movie? In my desperate attempts at trying to grasp any form of entertainment from this feature I finally came to the realization that it's impossible for me to like it. Much to some people's surprise I found the film's style to be a shallow, incompetent imitation of John Woo's ultra kinetic Hong Kong films. Everything that Bad Boys does has been already made, only much much better.So what is Bad Boys all about ? Well, uh, it's about Will Smith running around in slow-motion while talking a lot, and yeah there's this other guy Martin Lawrence who also talks a lot. They're cops, they are the Bad Boys who talk their mouths off, run their legs off, shoot their guns off. Naturally Michael Bay does all that in slow-motion, because that's what action movies are all about you know, slow motion. Oh and did I forget to mention that there is a generic bad guy, not bad as the two titular anti-heroes mind you. This character, he's your basic action movie villain who is obviously evil for the sake of being evil. And of course is the person who our two brave Bad Boys must defeat in an epic slow-motion battle to the death filled with over-the-top explosions, one-liners and car chases all directly taken from the generic action movie clichés handbook.Bad Boys's overly simple plot exists for the sole purpose of providing us with enough reasons to watch the series of action sequences the movie's made of. That wouldn't have hurt all too much had these scenes been directed capably, yet Bay demonstrates an inept ability to create an entertaining action piece. All such sequences are bleak and devoid of originality, stuffed with slow-motion, randomly used, making less sense as to why it was added. The usual reason would be to enhance certain dramatic moments in a movie, or for stylistic approach during complex action scenes. Seeing as the first one is impossible to integrate here and the second is just not directed with any understanding of detail what we are left is an approximately 40 minutes of slow-motion that does it's job in extending Bad Boys into a near two hours length. Making this already boring film into an test of will. More than once I was tempted to turn off my TV and stop wasting time with the predictability on screen, fighting of the urge to laugh it all off in denial.I'm not actually sure there's anything more to say about Bad Boys. It's such a sub-par movie that it's action becomes forgettable soon after viewing, leaving only the flaws to remind me why I should never watch anything stamped with the sign Hollywood Action Movie. Then again it's not such a big surprise why so many people liked it. It's crude visuals could prove to be impressive enough for people not as familiar with the genre as the more hardcore fans. Then again I don't count myself amongst genre fans so it's anybody's guess why it appeals so much to audiences ","genre":null},{"date":"13 May 2007","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After catching glimpses of Bad Boys for several times on TV I finally decided to watch the whole thing intact.

In my desperate attempts at trying to grasp any form of entertainment from this feature I finally came to the realization that it's impossible for me to like it. Much to some people's surprise I found the film's style to be a shallow, incompetent imitation of John Woo's ultra kinetic Hong Kong films. Everything that Bad Boys does has been already made, only much much better.So what is Bad Boys all about ? Well, uh, it's about Will Smith running around in slow-motion while talking a lot, and yeah there's this other guy Martin Lawrence who also talks a lot. They're cops, they are the Bad Boys who talk their mouths off, run their legs off, shoot their guns off. Naturally Michael Bay does all that in slow-motion, because that's what action movies are all about you know, slow motion. Oh and did I forget to mention that there is a generic bad guy, not bad as the two titular anti-heroes mind you. This character, he's your basic action movie villain who is obviously evil for the sake of being evil. And of course is the person who our two brave Bad Boys must defeat in an epic slow-motion battle to the death filled with over-the-top explosions, one-liners and car chases all directly taken from the generic action movie clichés handbook.Bad Boys's overly simple plot exists for the sole purpose of providing us with enough reasons to watch the series of action sequences the movie's made of. That wouldn't have hurt all too much had these scenes been directed capably, yet Bay demonstrates an inept ability to create an entertaining action piece. All such sequences are bleak and devoid of originality, stuffed with slow-motion, randomly used, making less sense as to why it was added. The usual reason would be to enhance certain dramatic moments in a movie, or for stylistic approach during complex action scenes. Seeing as the first one is impossible to integrate here and the second is just not directed with any understanding of detail what we are left is an approximately 40 minutes of slow-motion that does it's job in extending Bad Boys into a near two hours length. Making this already boring film into an test of will. More than once I was tempted to turn off my TV and stop wasting time with the predictability on screen, fighting of the urge to laugh it all off in denial.I'm not actually sure there's anything more to say about Bad Boys. It's such a sub-par movie that it's action becomes forgettable soon after viewing, leaving only the flaws to remind me why I should never watch anything stamped with the sign Hollywood Action Movie. Then again it's not such a big surprise why so many people liked it. It's crude visuals could prove to be impressive enough for people not as familiar with the genre as the more hardcore fans. Then again I don't count myself amongst genre fans so it's anybody's guess why it appeals so much to audiences ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"13 May 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Dragonfly starts as red cross volunteer paediatric doctor Emily Darrow (Susanna Thompson) is killed while helping out in Venezeula when the bus she is traveling in takes a nosedive off a cliff into the river below, back in Chicago & her husband Dr. Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner) is devastated & is finding it hard to get over the death of his wife. While on duty checking some of Emily's old patients he meets a young boy named Jeffery (Robert Bailey Jr.) who after claiming to have had a near death experience says he was contacted by Emily & wanted to tell him something important, more strange occurrences happen & Joe becomes convinced that Emily is trying to convey a message to him from beyond the grave...This American German co-production was produced & directed Tom Shadyac & is a pretty unremarkable Hollywood feel good ghost story that's nothing special. The script by David Seltzer, Brandon Camp & Mike Thompson probably was conceived as a supernatural ghost story with a twist that were all the rage after the phenomenal success of The Sixth Sense (1999) along with the likes of Bless the Child (2000), The Others (2001) & Gothika (2003) although none really matched it's success either commercially or critically & Dragonfly is no exception. The makers of Dragonfly have seemed to try & make this as tame as possible & go for a feel good almost uplifting film as opposed to a dark horror by down playing the supernatural angle, personally I think it's all rather silly & far too sentimental. I didn't think the twist ending worked especially well & there's not much entertainment value here. I'd have preferred the ghostly elements to have been played up a bit more & when you consider some of the deleted scenes listed in the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section it's obvious that more horror type footage was filmed & I'm at a loss as to why it was sanitised into a squeaky clean 'happiness come from travesty' moral message that I suppose is meant to depress you during the opening half of the film & then raise your spirits by the time it finishes. It's watchable for what it is I suppose but I'd have completely forgotten about it by the end of the week.Director Shadyac does OK but nothing more, there's no suspense, there's maybe two scenes are meant to scare you & there's a distinct lack of any sort of eerie atmosphere. The special effects are alright but nothing that memorable.I was amazed to see that this had a supposed budget of about $60,000,000 which is one hell of a lot of money considering what actually ended up on screen, there's no way this looks like a 60 million dollar film. It's well made & has that big budget Hollywood polish about it but there's nothing spectacular to it. The acting isn't the best, Costner does alright although I'm not a fan & hadn't seen any of his films since Waterworld (1995), an old looking Kathy Bates also turns up & is totally wasted.Dragonfly is an average Hollywood feel good type tear jerker that didn't do much for me although I will concede that it's watchable if nothing else, try to catch it on TV for free as it's not really worth parting with hard earned money for.

Although in all fairness, I would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.)As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and though Isabel Bingley's voice outshines that of Jean Simmons, it is not more pleasant. I find it to have a rather shrill quality. Jean Simmons' voice is much more realistic, though admittedly, that is not always a huge concern in musicals. Also the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of Luck Be A Lady and only there because I was previously familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find Vivian Blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on Broadway. And Sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others, if they indeed were in need of redemption. (They weren't) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene's, particularly in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. Also, the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs, I beg to differ. 'A Bushel and a Peck' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa and its accompanying performance is more Hot Box material. I personally do not care for 'Marry the Man Today' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie. I adore 'I've Never Been In Love Before', and though it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song 'A Woman In Love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach. And the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included on Broadway. In fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, I'd recommend purchasing it instead of the Broadway. Though I have not seen the original production, I cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors.

I mean, there is almost nothing wrong in this film.Starting out as a romantic comedy, we meet the characters in Life Is Beautiful. Much depth is given to the main character, Guido Orefice. The man is just awesome and never once does he regret the life he has, even when shut behind the evil of the concentration camps. Dora is the girl he's in love with. Although I found her performance the weakest in the film, she still did a good job at portraying a woman dying to escape the lonely and miserable rich life. She decides finally to run off with Guido, and this is when the movies transitions from romantic comedy to a beautiful drama.The movie puts us ahead by five or so years. We meet the adorable son of Guido, Joshua (I may have forgotten his name so I'm not sure if I'm right). Although given only about ten minutes to develop before the Holocaust, you can't help falling in love with the little boy who just unconditionally loves his father. Some Nazi stuff is foreshadowed before the next part of the film, preparing the audience for what is to come.Finally, our characters shipped off to a concentration camp. The movie drastically changes but in a comfortable manner. Guido convinces his son they are in a game in which they are competing to win a tank. Joshua eventually believes this, and their lives begin to spiral downhill farther than ever. They see some ugly things and everything they do has death knocking on their door. But they stay alive, and you really feel for the characters when some hope is lost in them. You know they don't deserve such a life.But things only get worse when the war ends. Back in the Holocaust, Nazis would start a massacre within the camp when they would hear that their enemy was coming. One of the characters (I will not say which) is killed rather suddenly, but still is effective in a good way. It is so sad because of what has happened. Two characters are finally reunited as the prisoners escape from the Nazi camp, and the story ends at that.After this I found myself appreciating just the making of this film because it was so well-handled. The Holocaust is a touchy subject but not once is the situation abused in the comedy and wealth of the story. The movie was well-penned and directed, and Bengini really knew what he was doing. The movie had the perfect balance of light and dark, and flaws are invisible unless you try really hard to find out what they are. This movie deserves a perfect score a 10\/10.

But they stay alive, and you really feel for the characters when some hope is lost in them. You know they don't deserve such a life.But things only get worse when the war ends. Back in the Holocaust, Nazis would start a massacre within the camp when they would hear that their enemy was coming. One of the characters (I will not say which) is killed rather suddenly, but still is effective in a good way. It is so sad because of what has happened. Two characters are finally reunited as the prisoners escape from the Nazi camp, and the story ends at that.After this I found myself appreciating just the making of this film because it was so well-handled. The Holocaust is a touchy subject but not once is the situation abused in the comedy and wealth of the story. The movie was well-penned and directed, and Bengini really knew what he was doing. The movie had the perfect balance of light and dark, and flaws are invisible unless you try really hard to find out what they are. This movie deserves a perfect score a 10\/10.

I mean, there is almost nothing wrong in this film.Starting out as a romantic comedy, we meet the characters in Life Is Beautiful. Much depth is given to the main character, Guido Orefice. The man is just awesome and never once does he regret the life he has, even when shut behind the evil of the concentration camps. Dora is the girl he's in love with. Although I found her performance the weakest in the film, she still did a good job at portraying a woman dying to escape the lonely and miserable rich life. She decides finally to run off with Guido, and this is when the movies transitions from romantic comedy to a beautiful drama.The movie puts us ahead by five or so years. We meet the adorable son of Guido, Joshua (I may have forgotten his name so I'm not sure if I'm right). Although given only about ten minutes to develop before the Holocaust, you can't help falling in love with the little boy who just unconditionally loves his father. Some Nazi stuff is foreshadowed before the next part of the film, preparing the audience for what is to come.Finally, our characters shipped off to a concentration camp.

He was THE perfect choice for the phantom he had the looks, voice and one-liners. I don't see whats all the fuss about Bruce Campbell not getting the role.The action scenes could have been a lot better. But they weren't common and predictable fight scenes. Plus Billy Zane isn't coordinated like Van Damme so give the man his props.The setting takes place in a 1930's jungle as well as New York and thats pretty rare. I'm a fan of the Substitute sequels so I hated seeing Treat Williams as the bad guy but he did a good job, definitely not his best work though. What also sucks is how Catherine Zeta Jones turned good around the end for no good reason. I wanted so bad for her to get laid out. A subplot that hardly gets noticed is how the previous Phantom was killed by one of the henchmen. You'll hear that throughout the movie (by James Remar) and it adds to the tension.Naturally this film seems reality based but there are a couple supernatural elements thrown in the mix like the power of the skulls. That doesn't ruin it or anything, after all this is based on a comic book. If you want to see a bunch of characterization and emotional stuff, this is the WRONNNGG film. I'm glad this movie went light on the drama, thats the problem with all these new comic films coming out.The Phantom is a rare crime fighter; he has no superpowers. What he does is his legacy passed from father to son. He has a horse and a wolf as sidekicks. Rather than fight crime in the big city like most he does his thing in the jungle. So this is a film anyone can enjoy, and although it maintains interest without taking itself too serious. Its a shame this movie is so under-appreciated.

But also a film which involuntarily became an accursed one since it prompted many fragile teenagers to kill their families or friends dressed in the killer's outfit.Wes Craven exploits the indispensable ingredients pertaining to the serial killer story like a female teenager all alone in her house who is about to watch a horror flick and receives ominous phone calls or teenagers all gathered in a house watching horror flicks and they're all killed one after the other and the filmmaker follows the rules of the game while poring over them. During 110 minutes, Craven mixes the slasher movie and a studied reflection about the genre and its premises. Hence its indisputable strength. Flicks like the Freddy or Friday the 13th endless saga contributed to the fame of the genre and were based on rules that the viewer knows very well. Craven takes them again for himself to reveal the tricks of the trade and to dynamite the clichés. Thus it gives both a highly terrific and terrifying piece of work in which Craven involves the viewer at all levels. One should note down all the witty lines the film shelters and the black humor of a formidable efficiency which lacked in so called gore masterworks like John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). I dig the test in the first sequence the killer asks to Drew Barrymore about horror flicks. Painstakingly built, full of ideas, nods or allusions to gore films which secured the popularity and the trademark of the slasher genre. Craven's film has also the ability to make us shiver and to be jubilant thanks to what has been said before and also thanks to a taut scenario in which the murders aren't only the worthwhile moments as it's often the case in many mediocre horror films. Craven also doesn't fear to delay sequences as much as he can to stretch terror and treat, notably the first one and all that happens in the big isolated house where the students party while very bad things occur near them.This is a film to cherish and to ponder about provided you have nerves of steel and if you keep in mind that it's just pure cinema. And one of the characters says there has to be one or several sequels to a film of this kind. It was judicious from Craven to have included this cue for there will be two sequels. But the pernicious charm that wraps Scream will be absent in its two heirs.
