It was also the first film to move me to tears for anything other than an animal dying. Joey's pain and confusion over Shane leaving made me cry unexpectedly. I didn't know a movie could do that to me. I went on to see it 3 more times that year, twice at Grauman's Chinese in Hollywood. After reading the nearly 200 reviews of this classic film (over 150 rated 9 or 10), I feel vindicated that I recognized its greatness at a tender age. The elements that stood out were the emphasis on a family, rather than just a series of fistfights, crimes, and gun battles; the story seen largely through the young boy, in part hero worship, and in part the excitement of viewing the conflicts between the cattlemen and Shane; the fantastic cinematography of the Tetons of Wyoming; the beautiful score by Victor Young, where each principal character had their own theme; the menacing performance of Jack Palance as the hired gun- slinger; and finally, the bittersweet classic ending with Brandon DeWilde calling for Shane to stay, innocently confused somewhat as to why he must leave. All the undercurrents of attraction and jealousies are beautifully understated but evident to adult viewers. The idea that one man would be sufficiently selfless to not succumb to his desires is a rare commodity today, and might explain why some reviewers think this is corny. I suppose if Shane were to be remade today, there would be plenty of F bombs, gunfights, and Shane and Marian would be in bed in short order. This would probably appeal to those who think Shane is a slow boring film, and would prefer a bloodbath or the praised Unforgiven where a character early on says Say What? in the 1890's. Viewers seeing the film for the first time today must keep in mind that until 1967, no films could show sex scenes, bathroom scenes, or contain obscene language. That's why many younger viewers find movies like this corny. In conclusion, Shane is a timeless masterpiece of filmmaking, a true work of cinematic art. I have seen it about 40 times over the last 57 years, and it still moves me deeply. Those who find little Joey annoying must not like kids, because he is and was typical of many boys his age, and his performance was a large part of the success of the film. It was unusual to include children in westerns, and had he not been in the movie, I doubt it would have become a classic, and one of the most memorable and iconic scenes of any film (Shane, come back) would not have become part of our film heritage.

Not if you are judging it on technical merit. The acting, screen writing, cinematography and direction are at near perfection. I've probably seen this film 10 times since it came out and I continue to catch things for the first time. Each scene flows into the next with such fluidity its almost hypnotic. This is one of my all time favorites which deserves this 10 rating...a rating I seldom give.The setting is prohibition-era, big city America and that's all we know, and all we need to know...this movie isn't about history. This is a film that explores themes like power, loyalty and trust. The plot is rather intricate for a gangster movie and the first time you view it you aren't exactly sure just what happened. This is not a complaint about the film, but really more of a compliment. Many film classics through the years can leave you confused if you really dissect them afterwords.The story revolves around the central character Tommy (Gabriel Byrne), who is the right hand man to mob boss Leo (Albert Finney). It seems a rival named Johnny Casper (Jon Polito) is about to start a war over a two-bit bookie named Bernie (John Turturro) and Leo has decided to protect Bernie as Leo is currently seeing Bernie's sister Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Casper is not at all happy about this and neither is Tommy and he tries to warn Leo but Leo is smitten and vows to protect his lover's brother.This is where things start to get murky, who is really loyal to who, and why? Leo controls everything in the city but when he narrowly survives assassination, he suddenly starts to lose grip of his power. At one point a cautious Tommy tries talking sense into over-confident Leo with the memorable line you run this town because people think you run it, if they stop thinking it, you stop running it. This is the type of dialog you'd expect from a movie made in the 1940s. Much of Millers Crossing seems like its paying homage to a bygone era of film, the jargon (take your flunky and dangle) the snappy byplay between characters and the emotional flatness of everyone involved...no one in this film seems to be having much fun. But they are fun to watch!I would have to agree that the best scenes of the film are Leo and the Danny boy scene and the title scene...Bernie's little ride out to Millers crossing. John Turturro is astounding in this scene, but I hate to single out any one actor in Millers Crossing because the whole cast is absolutely perfect.This brings me to my favorite part which is the climactic scene at Casper's house. To me, this is the most intense scene in the movie and actually makes the hairs on my neck stand up! Casper of course leaves us with the immortal words....something he tells all his boys....always put one in the brain.Gotta love it, and yes it was overshadowed by Goodfellas and other films when it was released, but like fine wine the classics always age well....and if you've never seen Millers Crossing I ENVY YOU, because you get the sheer joy of seeing a perfect film for the first time!

Why wasn't this movie better promoted? Over the years it's slowly been developing a well deserved cult following, as more and more people discover this underrated gem. I just picked up the 2-DVD Collector's Edition of the film and after viewing it I am pleased to report that Event Horizon is still holding up well.EH tends to get comparisons like The Shining in space or A combination of Alien and The Exorcist, none of which are entirely accurate, yet the influence of all of those films (plus many more) are definitely part of Event Horizon's DNA. The film I immediately think of is 1979's The Black Hole, which also revolved around a group of space explorers discovering the derelict hulk of a long-lost space ship, but once our intrepid crew is on board the title craft the film turns into something akin to Hellraiser more than anything else.Our story it's 2047 and the mammoth space ship Event Horizon, which disappeared without a trace seven years earlier on a mission to the outer reaches of the Universe, has suddenly reappeared in an orbit around Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched headed by Laurence Fishburne (whose Shakespearean voice can make even the most empty headed science-fiction techno-jargon dialogue sound deep and meaningful) and Sam Neill, the scientist who designed and built the Event Horizon. He's especially proud of its more-or-less-theoretical gravity drive, which supposedly can travel through dimensions via a gateway that had never been attempted before. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that traveling through this supposed gateway is going to be the core of the movie. Once on board the Event Horizon, they find no survivors, just a lot of blood splattered on the walls and an occasional frozen, mutilated corpse drifting past in zero-gravity. It quickly becomes obvious that something horrible happened to the Event Horizon when it left our universe, and as the crew explores the ship it also seems that the craft brought something back WITH them from that trip, which wants all of their souls. One by one the crewmen are plagued with visions of hellish torture, or of traumatic events from their own pasts, and several of them meet gory deaths until the survivors realize that they must get off this ship as quickly as possible, before the evil possessing it claims them all as victims.The real star of the movie is the set designer (whoever he or she was; fantastic job!), the Event Horizon resembles a hellish cathedral of some sort (even before the evil sets in) that will make the viewer uncomfortable from the get-go. Of the human cast, Sam Neill gets to have the most fun, as he is eventually taken over by the horror of his creation and goes all Interstellar Jack Torrance on the innocent salvage crew.Judging from the reviews on this site, Event Horizon is either a love it or hate it kind of film. You can count me as one who loved it, and I will definitely be watching it again in the future. Too bad director Paul Anderson has yet to live up to the promise he showed in this movie.

I just picked up the 2-DVD Collector's Edition of the film and after viewing it I am pleased to report that Event Horizon is still holding up well.EH tends to get comparisons like The Shining in space or A combination of Alien and The Exorcist, none of which are entirely accurate, yet the influence of all of those films (plus many more) are definitely part of Event Horizon's DNA. The film I immediately think of is 1979's The Black Hole, which also revolved around a group of space explorers discovering the derelict hulk of a long-lost space ship, but once our intrepid crew is on board the title craft the film turns into something akin to Hellraiser more than anything else.Our story it's 2047 and the mammoth space ship Event Horizon, which disappeared without a trace seven years earlier on a mission to the outer reaches of the Universe, has suddenly reappeared in an orbit around Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched headed by Laurence Fishburne (whose Shakespearean voice can make even the most empty headed science-fiction techno-jargon dialogue sound deep and meaningful) and Sam Neill, the scientist who designed and built the Event Horizon. He's especially proud of its more-or-less-theoretical gravity drive, which supposedly can travel through dimensions via a gateway that had never been attempted before. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that traveling through this supposed gateway is going to be the core of the movie. Once on board the Event Horizon, they find no survivors, just a lot of blood splattered on the walls and an occasional frozen, mutilated corpse drifting past in zero-gravity. It quickly becomes obvious that something horrible happened to the Event Horizon when it left our universe, and as the crew explores the ship it also seems that the craft brought something back WITH them from that trip, which wants all of their souls. One by one the crewmen are plagued with visions of hellish torture, or of traumatic events from their own pasts, and several of them meet gory deaths until the survivors realize that they must get off this ship as quickly as possible, before the evil possessing it claims them all as victims.The real star of the movie is the set designer (whoever he or she was; fantastic job!), the Event Horizon resembles a hellish cathedral of some sort (even before the evil sets in) that will make the viewer uncomfortable from the get-go. Of the human cast, Sam Neill gets to have the most fun, as he is eventually taken over by the horror of his creation and goes all Interstellar Jack Torrance on the innocent salvage crew.Judging from the reviews on this site, Event Horizon is either a love it or hate it kind of film. You can count me as one who loved it, and I will definitely be watching it again in the future. Too bad director Paul Anderson has yet to live up to the promise he showed in this movie.

Wall Street was the perfect story for Michael Douglas shows some very interesting acting skills in a role of a lifetime. In 1985 Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) a young and obstinate down on luck stockbroker works very hard to fulfill his dreams and make good deals in Wall Street. When he has the gold opportunity of his life making a huge deal with the powerful corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Douglas) things are about to get bigger, better and Buddy wants all and more. Gordon teaches many valuable lessons to the so far honest Bud and this young man is becoming more and more interested in everything surrounding Gordon. What Bud doesn't realize is that with all the money, the power, the women and many other things comes also the corrupt side of his job, the use of illegal methods; the dishonesty of betraying other people while doing business and that might include his own father (Martin Sheen). This Magnus opus about the excessive and ruthless effects of the Capitalism on people in a dog-eat-dog world marked a whole generation that seemed to have enjoyed many of the mannerisms and the attitudes of the main characters of this film. Although many viewers will complain about the 1980's style and technology this film is not so dated both in behavior and some ethical and unethical principles that can be learned from here.The screenplay works brilliantly, the characters are well written and well presented and it is accurate about the stockbrokers language (this part was very rare at that time and it is a interesting part of the film, though it might bore some people who wants to understand the technical aspects of the sales). The quotes presented here are memorable and it really makes this movie better and better. The 'Greedy' speech made by Gekko is the most remarkable in the film; the one delivered by the veteran and honest stockbroker Lou Manheim (Hal Holbrook) is one of the most enigmatic quotes ever and it says a lot about Sheen's character Man looks in the abyss. There's nothing staring back at him. At that moment man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss. Makes you wonder!One of the greatest moments of Oliver Stone on filmmaking, one of his best pictures ever, he did a terrific job. The biggest triumph here is Michael Douglas performance playing this tough, cruel, gigantic corporate raider, who hates to lose money and has a interesting and frightening personal philosophy If you want a friend buy a dog, Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. or Lunch is for wimps. Gordon is an iconic character that modeled many others in film history and perhaps even in real life.

Of the games that I played in the series, most were rather repetitive; sparked into life only by the odd driving of a vehicle for whatever reason or the fighting off of a 'boss' during which nouse and tactics were unusually inserted into the game. For the most part, venturing from A to B; hopping; jumping; swimming; shooting and the working out of puzzles usually involving keys and levers were the norm, it's just that doing so in a jungle; a temple; a mountain range and a submarine station amongst many others masked the effective repetition of the game. Simon West's 2001 'adaptation' of the Tomb Raider series is intrinsically linked to the game series of then-1996 to 2001 in name and lead character only, and in a video gaming franchise that saw so much of the same content played out, it's funny how routine consistency and simplistic clarity in what's happening are the two things we bay for most when watching his film.Lara Croft Tomb Raider covers the exploits of a young bored-by-day heroine isolated in a large mansion, as she grieves for her father Richard whom went missing in the field some years ago and keeps company within the vicinity in the form of butler Hillary (Barrie) along with hermited technological whizz Bryce (Taylor), whom curiously lives out back in his own version of Q's workshop based in a caravan. The lead is the titular Lara Croft, played by Angelina Jolie. Croft seems to spend her days reenacting what we can only presume to be a denouement to an archaeological mission, before being attacked by a purpose built robot whom will stop at nothing to kill her; archaeology and the notion of ancient artifact discovery in films such as these are given a sexy and rejuvenating makeover, essentially turned from long and painstaking digs in the third world to causality driven globe hopping adventures, the sorts of which almost always culminates in a would-be snatching of the item you've been searching for from a booby trapped temple. On occasion, her butler will maddeningly walk into her office and place folders down on her desk that we presume to be archaeological 'jobs' or 'missions' which she will then pick and choose at her discretion.Eventually, her role in the film will be more expansively linked to the goings on of the Illuminati; a shady group of mysterious busybodies whose base of operations is in Venice and sees them charge fellow employee, the shady Manfred Powell (Glen) who comes complete with a wiry haircut and a wardrobe of black and whose assistant is the laughably named Mr. Pimms, with finding parts of a magical triangular artifact which will have a great affect on a fore-coming planetary alignment &#x96; something that happens once every 5,000 years. Along for the ride is American Alex West (Craig), a character whom shares a seemingly mutual appreciation for Lara and I guess must sit alone in his large house waiting for the folders to land on his desk. The exposition is shameless; the tone basic when it isn't manipulative in its presenting us with a room full of bad guys whom dish out threats to their higher-ups told to do dirty work for them and its all round execution just drab. All the usual frustrations with these sorts of films rear their ugly heads, ranging from a special ops. team charged with executing Lara by nightfall whilst in her mansion but unable hit anything with their gunfire to the filmmakers own transgressional punishment of their lead in Croft; who's a female allowed to drive a film, adopt some kind of role model archetype but has to wear skimpy outfits in the process as her actual action sequences carry an eroticised surge to them. Croft takes everything disturbingly in her stride, inadvertently calling to mind a better film of this ilk in 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark when she informally shoots down a stone gargoyle whom has come to life and poses a great threat to her. I liked it more when Indy's face off with a swordsman in said film played out in a market square.The film is grossly uneven in tone, it appears to play everything for laughs; nudges and winks for the early part before branching off into a more serious, more 'grown up' realm later on when personal stakes are suddenly raised and some pretty would-be affecting content to do with a dead parental figure crawls its way into the text. West thinks he can take the film from being a high-flying brainless actioner before bringing everything down a few levels for more heartfelt, more personal sequences when a dream-come-fantasy sequence with her father is supposed to act as a heart tugging catalyst. It's unfortunate on Jolie's behalf that, when the time comes to go face to face with Jon Voight's Lord Richard who is her father-for-the-film just as he is in reality, she forgets to actually react to it all. Bryce's own persistent put-downs and self reflective jabs at the situations the characters find themselves in is one of a few nails in the film's ultimate coffin, a film whose wheels totally come off towards the end but by which time all interest has dissipated and all narrative clarity has imploded. Lara Croft Tomb Raider is rather a tame effort, a film that tries to hit too many marks all too often as sub plots and set pieces are sporadically picked up on and included along the way; but director West can only render the experience grossly underwhelming.

Unfortunately, when the film was released that joy apparently didn't translate into big box office money, and the film sank pretty quickly. Despite that, I thought Escape From L.A. was a fun ride when I finally saw it on video sometime later. Like most B-Movie fans, I had loved 1981's Escape From New York, but I had honestly seen it so many times over the years that I had made myself sick of it; therefore I was simply happy to see Snake Plissken in a new adventure.The main problem is that Escape From L.A. isn't exactly a new adventure - it's basically a re-tread of the first movie, just with a new location (the West Coast) and with a whole lot of cheap CGI thrown in. Kurt Russell's still bad-ass as Plissken of course, and it's fun to see him in action again, I just wish they'd done more with the story.This time it's 2013, and Los Angeles has been separated from the mainland U.S. after a massive earthquake. The uber-religious U.S. President for life (a hilariously over the top Cliff Robertson) has declared L.A. to be a sinful place and it is now used as a dumping ground for anyone unlucky enough to get deported from the new America for smoking, for eating red meat, for practicing the wrong religion, or thinking for themselves. L.A. is controlled by a gangster\/revolutionary named Cuervo Jones, who is amassing an army in preparation for taking back the American mainland. His assistant is the President's turncoat daughter Utopia, who has stolen an important black box from Air Force One containing some sort of ultimate weapon and is now part of Cuervo's gang. The President and his men know there's only one man bad-ass enough to recover the girl and the package before the invasion - Snake Plissken, who's now in federal custody after an unexplained adventure in Cleveland. Once more, Plissken is impressed into service (via an injection of a virus that will kill him if he doesn't return in 12 hours) and dropped into the ruins of L.A., where he runs afoul of just about everybody in the city on the way to complete his mission. His trek through L.A. leads to mucho ass kicking and some funny bits featuring dependable character actors like Steve Buscemi (Map to the Stars Eddie), Bruce Campbell (as the insane Surgeon General), Pam Grier (Her-She) and Peter Fonda (as a survivalist\/surfer dude). It's all very light hearted and un-pretentious, which is fine by me.Much criticism has been thrown at the film's use of (cheap) C.G.I. I'll say that it works well in creating the ruined landscape of Los Angeles, giving the backgrounds the feel of a comic book, but when Snake and Fonda the Surfer dude ride a wave caused by a tsunami into the middle of the city, the effect is so obviously fake that you can't help but roll your eyes. Still, Russell and the rest of the cast are clearly having a ball and as with most Carpenter films, there's a sly sense of social satire throughout the proceedings.Escape From L.A. is not a classic by any means and Escape from New York is still the superior movie, but it's still worth a watch if you catch it on late-night TV or find it in the Wal-Mart $5 DVD bin (which is where I got mine).

Despite that, I thought Escape From L.A. was a fun ride when I finally saw it on video sometime later. Like most B-Movie fans, I had loved 1981's Escape From New York, but I had honestly seen it so many times over the years that I had made myself sick of it; therefore I was simply happy to see Snake Plissken in a new adventure.The main problem is that Escape From L.A. isn't exactly a new adventure - it's basically a re-tread of the first movie, just with a new location (the West Coast) and with a whole lot of cheap CGI thrown in. Kurt Russell's still bad-ass as Plissken of course, and it's fun to see him in action again, I just wish they'd done more with the story.This time it's 2013, and Los Angeles has been separated from the mainland U.S. after a massive earthquake. The uber-religious U.S. President for life (a hilariously over the top Cliff Robertson) has declared L.A. to be a sinful place and it is now used as a dumping ground for anyone unlucky enough to get deported from the new America for smoking, for eating red meat, for practicing the wrong religion, or thinking for themselves. L.A. is controlled by a gangster\/revolutionary named Cuervo Jones, who is amassing an army in preparation for taking back the American mainland. His assistant is the President's turncoat daughter Utopia, who has stolen an important black box from Air Force One containing some sort of ultimate weapon and is now part of Cuervo's gang. The President and his men know there's only one man bad-ass enough to recover the girl and the package before the invasion - Snake Plissken, who's now in federal custody after an unexplained adventure in Cleveland. Once more, Plissken is impressed into service (via an injection of a virus that will kill him if he doesn't return in 12 hours) and dropped into the ruins of L.A., where he runs afoul of just about everybody in the city on the way to complete his mission. His trek through L.A. leads to mucho ass kicking and some funny bits featuring dependable character actors like Steve Buscemi (Map to the Stars Eddie), Bruce Campbell (as the insane Surgeon General), Pam Grier (Her-She) and Peter Fonda (as a survivalist\/surfer dude). It's all very light hearted and un-pretentious, which is fine by me.Much criticism has been thrown at the film's use of (cheap) C.G.I. I'll say that it works well in creating the ruined landscape of Los Angeles, giving the backgrounds the feel of a comic book, but when Snake and Fonda the Surfer dude ride a wave caused by a tsunami into the middle of the city, the effect is so obviously fake that you can't help but roll your eyes. Still, Russell and the rest of the cast are clearly having a ball and as with most Carpenter films, there's a sly sense of social satire throughout the proceedings.Escape From L.A. is not a classic by any means and Escape from New York is still the superior movie, but it's still worth a watch if you catch it on late-night TV or find it in the Wal-Mart $5 DVD bin (which is where I got mine).

It's a war movie, yes, but with a very specific focus--the mission to destroy the big guns in Navarone.The film is necessarily impressive. It has physicality, it is willing to go dark at night, and broad in wide horizon landscapes, and yet the interiors have foreground and background and aren't just pretty. In color, it manages to keep a menacing tone, and yet is beautiful, a really nicely photographed job (by Oswald Morris, a British pro). Officially an American production, The Guns of Navarone is by and about a British war intervention. Director J. Lee Thompson (also British) is famous above all for one film, the original Cape Fear, but in terms of directorial management (and difficulty), this one is even more impressive. Gregory Peck (an American) plays a man who was, in real life, from New Zealand. He's a model of command and strength, in one of his best manly roles (easier said than done, being in charge of a bunch of tough guys and seeming legit, and not just theatrical.) David Niven is also in good form, playing a slightly prissy soldier, and he gives a smart, pointed speech near the end that's quotable stuff. Famously, Niven almost died from illness during the shooting (caused by some of the water scenes). Anthony Quinn as always is uncompromising.This is high stakes, high adventure stuff, masculine and hardened, but necessary in a brutal early part of the war. There are times when you think the Germans should have got them, as the good guys were too exposed, and the Germans too close, for escape. But most of the time it's gritty and realistic, and pretty amazing for how it creates the interlayering of civilian reality and war time heroics. It's set on a beautiful Greek island, luckily for the filmmakers, and for the film. And there are scenes of terrific storms, bucolic weddings, snowfall in the mountains, some serious night rock climbing (in the rain), on and on, in graphic widescreen photography, first rate stuff all around. The sets (in particular the gun installation) are big and impressive, just in themselves. I didn't expect to especially like the movie mostly because it sounded like another adventure war film, but it sucked me in by its sheer competence, by its earthy acting, and by the complex and involving plot. All of this is odd because I had read the book as a kid and was utterly enthralled at the time. It's good boy daydream stuff, and still is, for older boys in their fifties.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"13 September 2010","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" While most films celebrated as genre classics generally function to fulfill the set of expectations associated with them in the cultural lexicon, James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein marks one of the most pointed examples where one's enjoyment of the film could prove largely contingent on watching without being bogged down by expectations. After vocally disdaining the idea of a sequel to his initial horror classic, Whale instead runs with the opportunity to play with an expanded budget and deliver even more surreal, somber yet gruesomely funny metaphoric musings on life, death, conventional relationships and sexuality and more, all under the guise of straightforward Gothic horror. And Bride of Frankenstein could still easily be appraised as a classic 'traditional' horror movie strictly, but remaining unaware of Whale's fiendish playfulness would doubtlessly leave many a viewer scratching their heads as to many creative choices. The trick is to regard Whale's approach as half self-parody, half serious and all willfully weird, extrapolating (and in many ways 'remaking') his initial classic in a subtly experimental, conflicting yet successful tonal fusion. Alternating between moments of high camp (the bizarrely flamboyant character of manipulative scientist Dr. Pretorius feels a cheeky prodding of the regulations of the Hays code) and heartbreaking poignancy (the Creature's infamous encounter with a blind hermit and the unforgettable reaction of the Bride laying eyes upon her 'friend' for the first time), Whale's film is a perpetually unsettling watch, darting between tone and approach for the sake of an unexpectedly arresting product.This is not to say the film is without fault the reigniting of elements of the first film feels largely contrived (turns out the Creature isn't dead! Nor is Frankenstein! Let's toy with morals and build another monster!), though whether this is a self-effacing joke on Whale's part or not is unclear. Equally, when viewed without the context of its predecessor, the primary characters do feel noticeably underdeveloped, and there lies an uneasy use of cinematic metaphor, whether religious (one scene, in which the Creature is bound and carried on a log, blatantly evokes Christian iconography) or a bizarre underlying theme of the dangers of substance abuse (the Creature's gruesome reputation is partially equated with its gorging itself on cigars, alcohol, food and lusting after women). Nonetheless, Whale retains his flair for filling films with delightfully gruesome, cartoonish supporting players (Una O'Connor's screeching maid toes the line between hilarious and infuriating) and phenomenal set design, torn between solemn Gothic and discordant expressionist terror, giving the film a uniquely disturbing aesthetic. No matter how much the film creeps into oddity, Whale always capably anchors it throughout from descending into surreal chaos, delivering a remarkable balancing act whose clashing elements serve to only make their points more effectively. Reprising his iconic horror creation, Boris Karloff proves most adept at bleeding aching pathos from his misunderstood Creature's whimpered attempts at human contact, as scenes of him ferociously snarling and stumbling around risk being (un?)intentionally funny. Colin Clive, the 'straight man' anchor to the variable strangeness surrounding him, hits a sturdy balance between charm and nervy perfectionism as Dr. Henry Frankenstein, and Valerie Hobson instills a considerable earnest glow into her limited scenes as Frankenstein's fiancé. Elsa Lanchester delivers a dual triumph of performances as both a savvy Mary Shelly in the film's prologue and matching her astounding hair and makeup job with an equally nervy and fascinating performance as the Creature's 'Bride'. That said, it is truly Ernest Thesiger who walks away with the show as the delightfully strange Pretorius. Though verging on feeling downright out of place, Thesiger's grimly knurled face and mad giggle somehow manage to epitomize the spirit of the picture though almost too strange to fit, somehow ambitious and deadly twisted enough to transition from comical spectacle to deadly serious moral manipulation. Though it seems the cultural lexicon has largely forgotten how strange and self-effacing the film truly is, Whale's Bride of Frankenstein boasts a fearless flair for experimentation, thematic exploration and tonal fluctuation to match its iconic visuals. As telling as any of the potential for mad visions unleashed on mainstream entertainment, Whale's work, though more tempered by age than many of its kin, still stands out as essential viewing for fans of horror, cinematic fun and psychoanalysis alike. -8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 September 2010","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" While most films celebrated as genre classics generally function to fulfill the set of expectations associated with them in the cultural lexicon, James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein marks one of the most pointed examples where one's enjoyment of the film could prove largely contingent on watching without being bogged down by expectations.
