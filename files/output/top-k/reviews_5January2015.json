All of those elements make Demolition Man one of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Shipes at their best.Set in the future in 2032 in San Angeles,California(what used to be Los Angeles)Demolition Man tells the story about 20th century criminal Simon Phoenix(Wesley Snipes)who after being frozen in suspended animation has escaped a Cyro prison and starts to go on a rampage. With nowhere to turn the San Angeles police department brings out 20th century LAPD cop John Spartan(Sylvester Stallone)who was also in the Cyro Prison and was the only person to capture Simon now Spartan has to bring down Phoenix again with explosive results.Demolition Man is a terrific and memorable SCI-FI-Action film and was along with Cliffhanger(also released in 1993)that was a Box Office hit for Sylvester Stallone that saw Stallone square off against Wesley Snipes and is one of the most entertaining Action films of the 1990s and is one of those movies that whenever it's on television you will always sit down and watch it. From beginning to end Demolition Man is a slam bang SCI-FI\/Action movie that gives viewers entertainment in the highest order and is a Popcorn movie in the truest sense of the word giving viewers a great and memorable story with nonstop Action and thrills with Satirical laughs and Humor with an energy that just never slows down and when you watch the movie you are having fun. The Action in Demolition Man is amazing and intense and is done in a style that is wild with guns blazing and tons of explosions that grab your attention. The SCI-FI and Action genres while very different in style and tone go together well and Demolition Man is one of the best of it's kind and I think one of the reasons it's one of the best SCI-FI-Action films of it's kind is because of the different setting because where most futuristic Action movies are set in a Post Apocalyptic or dark Dystopian setting,Demolition Man takes place in the Utopian world of San Angeles(a combination of Los Angeles,San Diego and Santa Barbara)where people and things are clean and nice and everything is safe and the only restaurant around is a Taco Bell. It's also a world where cursing,sports,eating meat and drinking is illegal and the cops are soft and never use physical violence or force(they're not trained to handle violence)to catch criminals it's those things that give the movie a humorous and satirical tone giving viewers one of the funniest futuristic movies ever made and When watch DM you will probably ask yourself would you rather live in a Dystopian Post Apocalyptic wasteland or a beautiful futuristic Utopia with lots of laws? The humor and satire is funny and done with an ironic style because DM shows viewers a future where the people are somewhat naive and never had to see the chaos and may ham of the 20th century but when John Spartan and Simon Phoenix arrive the world of San Angeles is turned upside down and the way Spartan and Phoenix deal with the future is funny as well. When John Spartan sees the new world he doesn't really know or truly understand the new laws,technology or the way that people act or react to certain things almost to the point of becoming annoyed and wanting to being frozen. Simon Phoenix is the polar opposite using San Angeles as a playground to create violence and chaos while doing fine with computers and new technology and having fun with the cops. When Spartan and Phoenix get together and face off again the two create a fireball of violence that the citizens of San Angeles will never forget. The ending of Demolition Man is outstanding and Action-packed with excitement that keeps going and going and will have you cheering and smiling. An incredible conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Sylvester Stallone is excellent and at his best as John Spartan,with Stallone being charismatic and tough. Wesley Snipes is brilliant and memorable as Simon Phoenix,with Snipes stealing every scene he's in and having great scenes with Stallone. Sandra Bullock is terrific as LT Lenina Huxley,Spartan's new partner. Nigel Hawthorne is wonderful as Dr. Raymond Cocteau,the man in charge of San Angeles. Denis Leary is delightful and funny as Edgar Friendly,an underground going against Cocteau. Bob Gunton is fantastic as Chief George Earle,a stuck up police chief. Benjamin Bratt is fun and memorable as Alfredo Garcia,Lenina's fellow officer. Glenn Shadix(Associate Bob),Bill Cobbs(Zachary Lamb)and Rob Schneider(Erwin)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for a blink and you'll miss cameo by Jack Black as a Wasteland Scrap.The direction by Marco Brambilla is outstanding,with Brambilla always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace,style and look while doing an incredible job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Brambilla.The score by Elliot Goldenthal is terrific,stylish and epic matching the tone of the movie perfectly. Fine score,Goldenthal. There is also the great song Demolition Man by Sting that plays at the end.In final word,if you love SCI-FI-Action films,Sylvester Stallone or Wesley Snipes,I highly suggest you see Demolition Man,an excellent SCI-FI-Action film that you can watch again and again.

I would consider Pulp Fiction to be the best film of the 1990s, beating out other classic in that decade such as Schindler's List and Terminator 2. Like most Tarantino films, he does not put everything in chronological order. That is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end. Even those very, very, very few that don't like Pulp Fiction were obligated to stay till the end. That is also what made Tarantino's first movie, Reservoir Dogs, so thrilling. Also, Tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver. Pulp Fiction has three parallel story linesThe first deals with a couple called Ringo and Pumpkin (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer) that are also thieves. They open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant. The scene is brief, but the characters and dialogue is memorable.Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), containing a golden object that is not shown nor told. Another genius movie on Tarantino's behalf. A few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs. This is probably the funniest story. Pulp Fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy. This is the story with most of its elements. This also has the one with the best and grittiest look.Soon after the incident, Vincent is asked to entertain Wallace's wife, Mia (Uma Thurman), while he is out of town. They have a good time, until she overdoses on heroin that Vincent got from his drug dealer, Lance (Eric Stoltz). Although a small story, the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep. Although this is the only bit with Mia, she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films.The last is about club fighter, Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis). Wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight, but after having a crazy dream, bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent. He goes on the run with his girlfriend (Maria De Medeiros) from Wallace. This is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy. Some bits are shocking, but all fit together. Bruce Willis as Butch is just as badass and heroic as John McClane. As I mentioned earlier, the all stories are done out of order, but are all tied in in a very intelligent way. Writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard, creating awesome characters is even harder, while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part.

And the following year, in one of the greatest one-two punches in horror history, Castle came up with a film that is certainly every bit as good, and perhaps, arguably, even better. In The Tingler, Castle brought back much of his team from the previous picture--leading man Vincent Price, screenwriter Robb White, composer Von Dexter--and again shot his production in ubercreepy B&W (with the notable exception of one scene, in which the color red features prominently). The result was another horror masterpiece, another compact chiller for the ages, and another film in which Castle's gift for gimmickry was memorably on display. But whereas House works well on both the big screen and at home on television (I have seen it many times, at this stage, in both settings), The Tingler is very much a big-screen experience. I will explain why in a moment.In the film, the viewer meets a pathologist researcher named Dr. Warren Chapin, endearingly portrayed, as always, by Uncle Vinny. Chapin has discovered the presence of a centipedelike creature that arises on the spinal cords of people who are in the throes of fright. Screaming causes the creature, which he dubs the Tingler, to dissolve and vanish, but those who are unable to scream will inevitably be killed as the creature crushes their spinal cord to bits. After a deaf mute woman, Martha Higgins (supremely well played by Judith Evelyn, who had starred with Price on Broadway in 1941 in a show called Angel Street, and who had previously performed another memorable nonspeaking role, Miss Lonelyheart, in Hitchcock's Rear Window five years earlier), the wife of Chapin's acquaintance Oliver (Philip Coolidge), is frightened to death, Chapin performs an autopsy on her and manages to prove his theory by removing a Tingler from her lifeless body. But problems arise when the doctor's scheming wife, Isabel (Patricia Cutts, sinking her teeth into the part as Carol Ohmart had done in her similar role in House), attempts to kill him with the creature, and later, when the Tingler is accidentally released into the audience of the Higgins' silent-picture theater....Just as a film such as Lawrence of Arabia must be seen in a movie house for full appreciation, so, too, must The Tingler. But whereas Lawrence cost $15 million to produce and must be seen on as large a screen as possible to capture its epic scope and pictorial grandeur, The Tingler, budgeted at $250,000, must be seen in a theater for different reasons. This viewer happens to be a member of NYC's Film Forum, a repertory house that has shown The Tingler often over the years, so I know whereof I speak. First, an enterprising theater such as Film Forum will rig selected seats with vibratory devices, as Castle had done back in 1958--the gimmick known as Percepto--to give lucky audience members a jolt at a certain point in the film; the home viewer, of course, will never experience this. But there are even better reasons why The Tingler must be seen with an audience. When the creature is loose in the Higgins' movie house, it attacks the projectionist and causes a breakdown of the film in progress (1921's Tol'able David); when The Tingler is watched in a theater, it looks and feels as if the creature has attacked the projectionist of the theater THAT YOU'RE IN! And when the voice of Vincent Price exhorts the audience to Scream, scream for your lives...well, I can think of nothing more fun to do in a movie house than screaming at the top of your lungs with 150 others! This shared, simultaneous, participatory, primal scream catharsis is one of the great experiences of cinema; you have to trust me on this one. Home viewing, sadly, just cannot duplicate it.Of course, The Tingler, besides its gimmicks, is known principally today as the first film in history to depict an LSD trip. One hundred mikes of acid--which was legal in 1959 and used experimentally in psychoanalysis--are taken intravenously by Chapin midway through the film as a means of engendering fear in himself. (Chapin had earlier been shown reading a book entitled Fright Effects Induced by Injection of Lysergic Acid LSD25--A Preliminary Report.) His assistant, played by Darryl Hickman, had mentioned that it can produce pretty weird effects and cause nightmares, and indeed, Chapin's trip is certainly a bad one; the viewer can only wonder how his trip would have proceeded if he'd had access to the Grateful Dead's Aoxomoxoa album, which was released 10 years later! Price hams it up deliciously in this classic sequence, and his performance overall is another one to cherish amongst many in his remarkable career. Interestingly, Castle twice misdirects his audience into thinking that Chapin has perpetrated a heinous act, while Vinny plays it marvelously ambiguous. All told, The Tingler is just about as entertaining an experience as can be had in a movie theater. Castle would go on to direct many other solid horror films--such as 13 Ghosts, Homicidal, Mr. Sardonicus, Strait-Jacket and The Night Walker--but House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler, for my money, are his two best. The first will make you scream in fear; the second, as its promotional poster put it, will make you scream if you value your life!

Almost 20 years ago,it somehow killed his career as a director as he was very prolific before that, but only directed one film afterward. He worked mostly as a producer since then. The writer team is the same as on the famous film Top Gun and they also did a sequel to this one here. Anaconda scored quite a few Razzie nominations (the Razzies got it wrong again, as they usually do), but I have to say I was occasionally entertained watching this and I would not even call it a guilty pleasure.It starts a bit randomly with Danny Trejo (Machete) in the first scene committing suicide after the snake attacks him. Who he is or why he is shown we never find out. I am not sure if they just wanted him in there because he was famous (if he was?) or what was the whole purpose of that intro. Other than that, the film has a couple more well-known actors included Anademy Award winner Jon Voight, Academy Award nominee Owen Wilson, Golden Globe nominees Eric Stoltz and (incredibly hot) Jennifer Lopez, rapper Ice Cube, Jonathan Hyde and Kari Wuhrer, who has been in quite a few (animal) horror films. The standout is Voight though, sporting a ponytail in this film and portraying a character at least as scary as the snake monster he is after. He saves one guy's life early in the film, but takes another later on. A true monster he plays here. So it was basically a fight of human beast vs. animal beast. And would you have guessed that swallowing a dangerous tropic bee can save your life from the Anaconda. It did for one character as he was in the cabin pretty much for the rest of the film afterward.Basically, the film is all about people being in the water and the dangerous situation with the audience wondering if the giant snake will appear or not. I thought this invisible danger was actually bigger than the real danger when the beast occurred. But that's usually the case for me that invisible danger works better to scare me. That is also why The Blair Witch Project had such an impact on me. One thing that surprised me is how Wilson's character becomes the aide to Voight so quickly in the film. Far too quickly for my taste. Anyway, maybe he saw a strong leader or father figure in him I guess and he was just easy to manipulate. Oh yeah and then there is also the bee scene I mentioned earlier. Man that was scary and gross when they get the insect out of the guy's mouth, probably tougher on my than the most snake scenes.What I liked was how they managed to show how everybody felt out of place in the jungle except Voight's character who was all home and natural in there. I am not sure if I liked the scene where the team try to trick Voight's character (and succeed), but the A*shole in 1-comment was kinda cool. What I did wonder was how Voight's character (after he seemed to be dead early) managed to get out of the water with the tranquilizer in his blood. That was not particularly realistic. And I was a bit surprised about how the snake always showed up where the team was.I liked about the film that, at 90 minutes including ending credits, it was not longer than it should have been and they kept it pretty much very essential. It was also not too difficult to create a connection with all the characters and quickly understand who is who, which is usually one of the most important things about a film. But that also could have been as I was quite familiar with most of the cast. However, I wished that maybe they would have gone for a slightly different ending in which the animal prevails and just kills everybody. Could have made for a nice change.

An old school acquaintance exploits Stewart's weakness to make his wife's murder look like a suicide. These are perfect ingredients for a mystery-thriller. The film seems to reach an ending of sorts when the crime is committed. Stewart is sent to a sanatorium because of his double guilt falling in love with the beautiful Madeleine (Kim Novak), another man's wife; and not being able to rescue her when she climbs a high tower to jump to her death. He just can't get (it) up to follow her to the apex - classic Hitchcock sexual imagery. Adultery coupled with inability to consummate is a miserable combination.Just when you think it's all over, the film really gets going. As is often the case in Hitchcock's thrillers, the real fun is not in the crime, but in unraveling the mastermind's evil plot. Think about Dial M for Murder, or Rear Window, another Stewart vehicle.While detective Scottie Ferguson strolls along the streets of San Francisco, having recovered from the sanatorium, he sees - Madeleine!She turns out just to be a sales girl who resembles his dead flame. Or is that all? As Ferguson slowly remakes the sales girl in the image of Madeleine, the resemblance is just too uncanny. Finally a small mistake gives her away. It becomes clear that this girl IS Ferguson's Madeleine whom he loved, and that his school friend's real wife was the one dropped from the tower on that fateful day. When Ferguson insists on revisiting the crime scene, he inadvertently drives the impersonator who has come to love him to her real death atop the very same tower.Hitchcock leaves it open whether the impostor's death finally frees Ferguson not just from his guilt complex, but also from his inability to have an intimate relationship. He certainly was no longer in love with the impostor when he realized the truth. And his patient girlfriend Midge, who nursed him through the sanatorium for months (played by Barbara Bel Geddes to great effect) is still there, waiting...Midge is really the only good person in this morality play, really better than what Ferguson deserves. This is the reason Hitchcock cast the more ambiguous, sometimes whiny Stewart in the role, as opposed to a Cooper, Peck, or Grant. Hitchock plays all the drama to the max, assisted by the usual excellent Hermann score. The Edith Head costumes play a pivotal role in distinguishing the Madeleine-sales girl identities. Even the rear projection is fun to watch, as one can divine when Hitchcock thought a scene important enough to leave the safety of the studio. A 9\/10 from the era when people still took Freud seriously, and suspenseful fun to watch even in the era when Freud is exposed as, well, let's just say someone who selectively analyzed his data.

A very silly pot-boiler plot and it shows because the two writers behind this, Kevin Wade and Chris Conrad did not really have enough experience to produce a screenplay with decent quality.As a comedy, it's not strong. DeVito, the funnyman, only has a few quips that are noteworthy. The best is when he's discovered of lying. Arnold only had one funny moment and that's when he yells like a man instead of acting like a woman and its only funny because of the doofy face he has at the time.

The practical effects are OK but are immediately ruined when the special effects kick in and it is very noticeable. As clear as day, and looking back on it, it looks underdeveloped. As for music, arranged by James Newton Howard, the tracks do work with the softer more emotional moments but for the comedic moments it doesn't.

Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'. A mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.Keeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot.

Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays.

Living in the suburbs of Chicago my entire life, I vividly remember hearing reports of heavy snowfall that could potentially close schools, and going to bed those nights hoping to whatever God would listen to my ridiculous plea that I wouldn't have to go to school the following day. More often than not, it was wishful thinking on my part, due to the around-the-clock, persistent work of the snowplows, but on occasion, the snow and ice would be so bad that the school buses couldn't get through (the ultimate factor in a district's decision whether or not to close school) and I'd be blessed with great news when I woke up in the morning.These thoughts and memories flourished as I watched Chris Koch's Snow Day, but not because the film was extracting those paradoxically warm and fuzzy feelings, but because I was so disinterested in the characters and the events occurring in the film that the only outlet I had was my overactive, nostalgic mind. This is a film that has the ability to operate like an episode of the underrated Television show Recess, which concerned a group of six schoolage children who tried to do everything they could to live up the thirty minutes of liberation they got every school day. The kids in the show were bright, developed, adamant about sticking together, and clever in their abilities to stay one step ahead of their school administration. The children in Snow Day are a gaggle of underdeveloped and ill-behaved brats that mistake loud, ribald behavior and baffling choices as likability and logical motivations.The film concerns a group of young schoolkids in Syracuse, New York, who do everything they can to keep their school closed after heavy snowfall, which involves stopping the fearless snowplow driver (Chris Elliot) from getting through to plow the streets. One of the kids is Hal (Mark Webber), who spends the day trying to win the heart of his sweetheart Claire Bonner (Emmanuelle Chriqui), with the help of his best friend, Lane Leonard (Schuyler Fisk), who is secretly repressing feelings for him after a lifelong friendship. Then we have Natalie (Zana Grey), Hal's younger sister, and her two friends Wayne (Josh Peck), and Chet (Jade Yorker), who work to stop the aforementioned snowplow driver from plowing the sidestreets leading to the school. Finally, there's Hal and Natalie's father Tom (Chevy Chase), who works as a Television meteorologist, spends the day attempting to cover the record snowfall in a quicker manner than his competitor Chad Symmonz (John Schneider), both of whom fighting for their own job security.The biggest problem with Snow Day is it doesn't have a central focus, despite one pragmatically assuming that the effort to take out the snowplow driver would be the film's primary focus. The issue here is that the film doesn't invest enough time in the efforts to stop said driver, nor does it concoct many setups or provide much development to the idea that would allow one to believe what is actually happening in efforts to stop this man. Snow Day is simply a collection of subplots that make less a movie and more of an anthology film, strung together from comedic odds and ends, never materializing to something of a collective whole.Some of Snow Day's greatest sins could be forgiven if the film was the least bit humorous. Alas, however, Snow Day focuses on the kinds of things people with no knowledge of kids think kids say but never actually do; with that comes a barrage of stale, foreseeable humor and monotonous slapstick that never amounts to anything that is memorable in a long term sense. Even veteran actors like Chase and Elliot cannot save the project with their presence, for their characters have been hamfisted into pure stupidity and childishness beyond what should be acceptable for them as actors.Snow Day is a film bearing very little wit or craft in its writing and its characters. It's more or a less an assembly of parts, characters, situations, and subplots searching for a bigger picture to function in. It's the equivalent of someone dumping a toolbox all over the floor, with wrenches and hammers representing the actors, and the screws, nuts, bolts, and other connective devices representing things like writing, transitions, and characters, and hoping they'll all work together before their eyes and churn out something of untold greatness.Starring Mark Webber, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Zena Grey, Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, Schuyler Fisk, Jean Smart, Josh Peck, Jade Yorker, and John Schneider.

Pretty soon he stows aboard a cruise ship of teenagers on their way to New York and you can more or less guess what happens next.The principal differentiating factor with this entry in the series is the move from Camp Crystal to a cruise ship and then Manhattan itself. This change of scenery does the film some favours, ensuring that the usual Voorhees slasher violence has a new setting at least.

It makes use of the basic shot- reverse shot sequence, but every frame is partially obscured by an object, or person placed close to the camera; we seldom see the characters' faces in full profile. This strategy helps to create an atmosphere of menace, where nothing is quite as it seems, and every mission suggested to Harry by his two bosses Dalby (Nigel Green) and Ross (Guy Doleman) appears to have ulterior motives behind it that Palmer remains blissfully unaware of. Palmer himself retains his integrity throughout, even if he perceives himself as something of a rebel within the Secret Service.THE IPCRESS FILE is a direct antithesis of the Bond canon of films, also popular at the time of release. It is set in a grimy, rain- sodden London full of gray buildings and dark interior; no exotic locations for this spy. The most colorful aspect of the mise-en- scene are the big old-fashioned Routemaster buses that drive up and down familiar streets - Piccadilly, Whitehall, Oxford Street. Palmer himself lives in a shabby apartment; his one concession to the so-called 'Swinging Sixties' spirit is an ability to cook, but no one, not least his colleague Jean (Sue Lloyd) seems especially interested.

The film is a very masculinist piece, with legions of actors dressed in long coats, trilby hats and dark suits.

Palmer himself retains his integrity throughout, even if he perceives himself as something of a rebel within the Secret Service.THE IPCRESS FILE is a direct antithesis of the Bond canon of films, also popular at the time of release. It is set in a grimy, rain- sodden London full of gray buildings and dark interior; no exotic locations for this spy. The most colorful aspect of the mise-en- scene are the big old-fashioned Routemaster buses that drive up and down familiar streets - Piccadilly, Whitehall, Oxford Street. Palmer himself lives in a shabby apartment; his one concession to the so-called 'Swinging Sixties' spirit is an ability to cook, but no one, not least his colleague Jean (Sue Lloyd) seems especially interested. The film inevitably incorporates some of the sexist attitudes of the time - for Palmer all women are birds, and they do not become actively involved in any espionage activity. The film is a very masculinist piece, with legions of actors dressed in long coats, trilby hats and dark suits. Palmer himself has a good sartorial sense, but even he adopts the same uniform, especially when in pursuit of the enemy.Michael Caine, in a pre-ALFIE role, shows all the cockiness characteristic of his youthful period, when he really believed he could challenge the status quo. Whether he succeeds or not is very much open to debate.

They may be right. It is at least as good.The added villain of the toy collector (Wayne Knight) was a great idea, and gives Woody a back story that was missing. Was it necessary? Maybe not. But it brings these characters to life, and shows us that life exists beyond Andy's bedroom. Such a grand adventure for such small heroes.

In Britain of 1932, NO ONE said things like No worries! or End of story!. There are other linguistic anachronisms, but these two are the worst ones. Both expressions are examples of modern estuary English and no educated person would ever utter either. The wealthy, the landed gentry, and the aristocracy in England would never even have heard this type of expression; in fact, they had not yet been invented. The ghastly, interminable soap EastEnders has a lot to answer for regarding the debasement of British English, as has the never-ending Australian soap Neighbours.The plot is very derivative and there are glaring flaws and holes in the narrative. In some ways, Gosford Park reminds me of an Agatha Christie mystery but the plot simply doesn't hang together. HOW did the housekeeper KNOW that the son she gave up shortly after giving birth to him 31 years previously would kill his natural father? For that matter, HOW did she even know WHO he was? She had not seen her son since he was ca two weeks old! He was brought up in an orphanage, and at the age of 31 he is now the valet of Lord Stockbridge, who just happens to have been invited to stay at the country house belonging to Sir William, the man who fathered an illegitimate son on one of his female factory workers 32 years earlier. This woman is now the housekeeper at his, Sir William's, country house. That in itself is rather odd, to say the least. HOW did the valet KNOW that Sir William was his natural father? He states to a fellow servant that on his birth certificate it said Father unknown. There are far too many incidents of the two terrible twins contrivance and coincidence.
