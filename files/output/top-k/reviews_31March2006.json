[{"date":"31 March 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Rushmore' is a comedy\/drama film about an annoying, intelligent, but outgoing student who gets himself into trouble by being outspoken and through having a crush on his teacher; he is willing to do anything to get her. The limits to which this young man will go are funny and shocking. This film tells a good story, and the characters and the conflict and situations are enough to keep you glued to the screen. However, the film is a little long, and it does tend to drag on in some places. This is a pretty good character drama with an interesting story behind it, and I would recommend this film if you are looking for something serious but funny, all at the same time.
