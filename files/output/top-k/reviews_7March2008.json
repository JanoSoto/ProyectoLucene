It wasn't totally commercial (product placement, etc.) and upon it's release, without public knowledge that it was a totally fictional movie, actually scared the hell out of lots of people. I don't care if some say it's based on a true story. The movie is 100% fictional. I made films in college more than 30 years ago and always did well. The potential this movie had to be a knock out success was there. Soon after the trio gets lost, the movie loses it way. Then it gets irritating. Then if falls flat on it's face, or should I say, the camera falls and we are left to speculate. Was it the witch? Was it that psycho killer?... Who cares? I lost any sympathy for the characters when their only main response to the confusion was bitching and moaning and blaming each other and using the F... word with every breath. Here's some suggestions on what could have helped this movie immensely. 1.) A little more evidence of something out of the norm could be found in the mornings after they hear spooky sounds in the night. 2.) Heather doesn't sound so ridiculously sure of herself when the map just ain't cutting it. 3.) The trio spends some logical time discussing what they are experiencing, then turn on the camera and focus on one or more of them giving a speech in regards to it, referring to notes. I really can see this as a way to build the tension. 4.) A gradual unveiling of the trios growing insanity, that even though they are walking in generally the same direction, they are coming upon nothing; impossible. How could that be? And they would video each other commenting on it. Even in the midst of death, filmmakers in war zones are dedicated to their art! These college kids, the future leaders of society, are making a documentary. At least that's what they're supposed to be doing. Their emotional outbursts in this movie is going overboard. 5.) Why doesn't just one of them try to start a fire? That would get some rangers and more. 6.) A little nudity would have helped. Come on Heather, what else is there to do? 7.) A little more controlled handling of the video recorder would have been nice. The camera work was no better than a bunch of stoned high school kids screwing around. The movie had great potential, but it was as if the scriptwriter and\/or filmmakers just ran out of ideas. Well, I know this is a good cheap formula for film-making, so I'll use it in the next film I make with my nephew. He'll be in college soon. I think the quality of this film suffered when most of the money for it's production was used in the avant-garde television advertising.
