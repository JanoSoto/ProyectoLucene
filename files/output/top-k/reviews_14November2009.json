At least, in this very film, they don't hide their origin. Well. and in MY CIVILISATION, this is not what we call comedy or fun. It is just revolting, and boring at that!. Go ahead and rent the Grinch. Go ahead and please watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas.Around 20 minutes into the movie you will be sorry you did. I love dark comedies, I am a fan of violent over the-top movies, and I have seen some of the most perverse horrible flicks ever released (i.e Cannibal Holocaust). I liked Cannibal Holocaust to a degree, but no other movie has ever disgusted me as much as this, with the exception of Carpenters Vampires.Why did I hate this movie? It is physically upsetting to watch, all the characters scream and rant and are so blatantly stupid and idiotic that this movie probably gave me an ulcer! No other movie has ever upset me as much as this movie did, Some fans of the Grinch portray it has a satirical depiction of suburban life, or human nature in general. It is nothing but an excuse to show some of the saddest excuses for comedy the writer had dog faced freaks, some of the most annoying children ever cast on film, and characters so hateful and one dimensional you cannot manage one ounce of sympathy for them.I know that is the point of the movie, to showcase these male headcases and make a statement about suburbia. But much like vampires, the characters are so dark, misogynistic and downright stupid that it takes away all the enjoyment of the movie. The point of movies is to entertain, or at least get something out of the movie.I walked away from Cannibal Holocaust, Tetsuo, Pink Flamingos, The Killer and many other violent, bizarre movies entertained and fascinated. I walked away from the Grinch physically and mentally upset with myself, my girlfriend and the world in general...a real gem of a movie Anyway I'm really tired of this politically correct brainwashing in almost every flick, all those democratic Oscars winners.

First off it is clear that there is some religious over tones in the story from the supposed perfect person Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) who is brought on the scene through a cloning machine which are apparently common at this future date. So Leeloo is supposed to be (or become) some form of perfected deity in the story. OK, to me that right there doesn't make any since whatsoever, the future people of earth who revere Leeloo as a deity (or God for the more illiterate people who actually liked this movie) just made this chick that is supposedly a deity with the machine that they (mortals) can make. That maybe just a little short sighted that the people think she is a deity... Let's not forget she is also supposed to have some errand from ancient robots to get these special stones and save the world from an unexplained evil. The unexplained evil happens to be angry aliens and a errant comet of evil that came from outer space to destroy earth for an unknown reason. There is no real explanation of these alien monsters\/floating comets of death purpose of destroying the earth other than the fact that they want to.Korban is an ex-major of the army of Earth. They must be paying very badly in the future military because I have an uncle that is a retired major of only the United States army and he gets a pretty fat check from his pension every month. Did I mention my uncle is retired and doesn't even need to think about working? Korban on the other hand is not doing very well, I guess from the looks of his character he blew it all on booze or gambling. Korban has now become a taxi driver to pay for his 5' x 12' sweet arse apartment on 98th floor of the crap shoot palace. While on the job one day Korban happens to get the luck of Leeloo falling into his cab while he's on the job. Korban decides to risk his job by taking the time to tote Leeloo around instead of dropping her off at the next stop or a hospital. From the looks of his place and how much money he was making before the taxi driving job I don't think it's in the nature of his character to just throw cation to the wind and risk his job. Even after he realized she was not hurt by falling through the roof of his cab you would think at least he'd start the tab and charge her for the ride.Later on in the movie we discover that these elemental stone things that Leeloo needs to save the planet were somehow eaten or magically ingested by this other random alien opera singer. We must suppose that the alien who ate the stones happened to be a good one (not one of the bad ones.) Because if she was a bad alien then she might have hidden the stones somewhere else than her stomach. The lucky thing is that all the good people on the side of Leeloo happened to go to the same opera where this alien who ingested the stones was singing that night. Unfortunately, all the bad guys decided to go to the same performance and ended up killing everything in the place. Fortunately they missed Korben who saves the day, again upstaging the supposed to be protagonist (Leeloo). Then through the mêlée the alien opera singer along with the other half of the cast were unfortunately mortally wounded. Luckily, she happens to whisper with her dying breath to Korben (I'd like to add she has no clue who he is) her secret of ingesting these elemental stones one night when she had a few too many. So Korben being the extra (or only) Protagonist for the day ends up taking the stones from the random opera alien's innards.Phew!! Thank goodness for that completely useless story line twist that added nothing and only helped make the story to be even more retarded, I was about to break a sweat!I'd like to add that Leeloo was supposed to be the protagonist which actually is Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) in the movie which also destroys much of the purpose story line. If you haven't figured out why I said that Korban is actually the protagonist in the movie then let me help you. The protagonist is the hero the person who goes out and defeats the boogie man, bad guys, the evil dragon, the evil aliens that destroy everything without having a reason etc. and saves the day. Korban is the person who does all of that stuff in the movie not Leeloo, she is just an extra body that speaks some stupid language that nobody understands, plus she just gets in the way the whole time while Korban is busy saving her ass the whole movie. Again, as I mentioned earlier and probably the main catastrophic flaw in the story is that Leeloo is supposed to be a deity\/God. Anything worth being called a deity should definitely comprehend the emotion of love. If Leeloo didn't even understand the emotion or that the emotion of love existed among the races of the Earth then why was she ever considered a deity? Why was she the person who was supposed to provide the fifth element (which is love) that was required to destroy all the evil things that were trying to destroy the Earth???In the end my opinion is that this movie sucks! Need I even mention the soundtrack!? It's horrible! That's all that needs to be said.

Eyes glued to the T.V.I love how the families even though there were bad times, they were always there for the their children. These days if a young person announced that she was pregnant, she would be thrown out the house.There was even a part that linked to having sex for the first time. I feel that is how it should be taking it slow and not just rushing into something because he says your cute or if you love me have sex with me.The soundtrack of the movie was dominating and kept up with the story plot. Also the film includes a kind of unique visual style.The settings in this film make it to be a real life story.The dialogue spoken from the film is skilled and very well put together.

Then I watched part 2, to even love it more. Then I watched part 3 to not love it.. as the first 2! After a while, I re-watched the first one again to discover that it's the best at all with logic sense, explosive entertaining action, romantic core and a pioneer role with such a real affect after. Then I re-watched the second one to discover that it's a repetitive and illogical but still fun. Less fun. And at last I re-watched the third again to discover that it's better than its antecedent, but with problems don't make it as good as the first.Here the direction was gold. (John McTiernan) made the crazy action so crazy and believable in the same time (what could be cuter ?!). Thank god that at the moment Hollywood hadn't been cursed with the CGI yet. (Bruce Willis) as the reckless resourceful and sarcastic (John MacLean) was super. And with (Samuel L. Jackson)'s character and performance both were super. I know that (Jeremy Irons) maybe did it for fun, for money, but for me (Simon Gruber) is one of the best roles he ever did, let alone being the best villain in a die hard movie, being charismatic, scarily stiff and so unpredictable. (Michael Kamen)'s music embodied the feel of a cliffhanger after another with unpeakable boiling point (here's a new word for you). And the image didn't look less boiled itself which's something you'll really appreciate after watching part 4!. So what's the matter with it? Actually there are 2  the script. And the editing.Maybe it was (McTiernan)'s desire. He surely wanted to outclass himself, revenge for handing the second part over director else him (so that's another meaning for the word revenge in the title), and to deliver one unforgettably big action show. Since the first one took place all in skyscraper, the second took place all in airport, then (McTiernan) aimed towards clear target  this one will take place in EVERYWHERE! I remember in one of the action movies' godfathers (That Man from Rio &#x96; 1964) the lead, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo, drove maybe all the known vehicles. Here, I think the intention was that (MacLean) would ride a car, big truck, a metro train, a ship, a helicopter and yes...a bicycle all in one day! Great intentions. And some of them the movie just delivered greatly. But to achieve that wholly without losing control, some things must be done rightly, which the script is on their top.While the script was smart in dealing with action, thrill, suspense and twists.. the plot was nearly unseen. The nuts terrorist with indistinct purposes who needs just one cop to run all over the city solving his Simon-says riddles was all perfect stuff. But there are some events that I didn't comprehend well unless after a third viewing! There is hot collection of action sequences that run fascinatingly on screen yet while many things are running dry especially at the last third. Furthermore, the climax was too laconic compared to the rest; a bullet to an electric wire, say hello to your brother, then BOOM is not an appropriate ending for all what we were watching till this moment! It seemed like they ran out of money to make a real ending!The editing managed to make a hot funny character for the movie, but it was a little bit hyped. The editor must have had hard mission to gather that collection, with the fun scenes, the dialog, and the story, any story. However since the last third surely I lost something; like understanding this plot! The concoction is perceptible at places, the action is just too much at others, and it didn't make me forget, in spite of the noisy case and the changing of places, that the plot's twist (about the villain's true goal) was nearly the same of the first 2 movies! At times it's like uproarious breathless football match more than a movie. I hated it while being just pure exhausting action that doesn't care what the story is (so, sadly, the audience would not care too !!). I think that's where the problem of this movie exists. Sometimes too much fun (without any much of seriousness) is just a problem.Anyway, I still love it. It's so hot. Maybe more hot than the first. But that just outwardly. Because in the final analysis it's too crowded, too fabricated, and too empty to be the best.P.S among many moments I love from this movie, there is one where (John MacLean) comes out of catastrophic train accident so healthy and laughing. It's such a rare moment for the cinematic hero while mocking at himself as cinematic (namely  invincible !). ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2009","score":"","review":" I'll tell you a story.

A real portrayal of violence in ghetto societies. Lee Tamahori opens up the film excellently An image of Pacific desert paradise, which turns out only to be a billboard on the side of the motorway in Auckland New Zealand, which is also the slum where all the poor Maoris live their troubled lives. The film focuses on one family of seven in particular. The mother, Beth Heke, has a sole interest of living her life with her kids and keeping it together, but that life becomes more and more dysfunctional because of the father, Jake Heke, an abusive, out of control, alcoholic fist-happy husband, nick-named Jake The Muss. He doesn't really care for his family and prefers to spend his days drinking with his friends, either at the house or in the pub. Jake beats Beth ferociously while drunk and causes her not to appear to support her son while he is sent away to a borstal for stealing cars with his mates. Nig, the eldest is in a street gang and Grace, the eldest daughter, is the only one who is innocent and not vindictive, but her innocence is shattered anyway after one of her father's friend rapes her while in bed. Violence and death consumes the whole family later on and Beth makes a decision to leave Jake once and for all.I honestly don't know why none of the main actors weren't nominated for an Oscar. Their reactions are so real and the whole film looks so genuine to how people live their lives in the slum. It's not a pretty picture, but its beautifully truthful. And I think that it really shows a good amount of optimism for the audience to see how these people live their lives and what can be done about it today.

So I thought I'd take out the DVD and watch the movie. Here where I knew that my book would have to be rewritten. I can definitely see why this sank the Carolco ship. 1) Everyone is miscast. I have never seen a movie with worse casting than this - Davis doesn't look\/sound\/act like a pirate. The scene where she climbs over the rock after the jump is fantastic for obvious reasons, but she still doesn't cut it as a pirate. The question of believability is not that of can a woman be a pirate captain but rather how can this woman be a pirate captain? And there could have been many answers she is like a mother to them or they are all in love with her or she is a b-tch from hell and they are scared of her, or a combination of the above. Unfortunately, the movie gives us no credible answer, and neither does Davis' performance. Modine is trying to be what Matthew McConaughey would have become a few years later. Problem is - he is no McConaughey, although he is trying really hard. Langella doesn't look or act like a pirate - he seems to be more of an army major at a boot camp. At some stage I almost expected him to check his wrist for a watch and shout You have 40 seconds, now move it soldiers! Stan Shaw's role is probably supposed to be comic relief. Otherwise, I can't understand the idea with the ridiculous Jamaican accent. Unfortunately, there is nothing funny about his role or his delivery, so the joke becomes on him. Even the extras are miscast! During a flyover scene of the ship you can clearly see the actors struggling to climb down the Jacob's ladders - was it really that hard to find actors who could manage it a bit better?2) The dialogue and realism. This is a PIRATE movie. They are supposed to use naval terms. Their speech is supposed to be peppered with swearing. It doesn't have to be R-rated, because there are ways to stylise speech without degrading it with F-words, but the dialogue in CTI was not stylised at all - it just sounded like a bunch of people talking on a morning train on the way to work. This, however, is a minor problem, compared to the overall level of dialogue, interactions and humour in this film. From the balls jokes to wash your mouth to the final I want to see you in my quarters, it was just cringe-worthy. 3) Action sequences. Could someone in this crew do a bit of research? What canon balls were used for battles, how enemy ships were boarded, what a sailing ship looks like in battle, for heaven's sake? Why is a ship intact after a broadside-to=broadside battle? Why are the masts still standing? Honestly, I am not a navy historian, but for anyone who read C.S.Forrester as a child these scenes are mind boggling. And don't get me started with the Why's? on the final duel - that scene is just below criticism. Then there is the lack of blood. For some reason the director decided that it's OK to have blood and injuries that the protagonists suffer, but there should be no blood in battles. That's fine, but then the battles should be choreographed in a way that doesn't require blood. Instead, we see close-ups of people getting stabbed through with sabers, only to see a perfect clean blade when it is pulled out. In some instances the movie doesn't even try to make the impression - you see people getting killed by getting slapped on their backs with sabers. Production values, anyone?Finally, I feel sorry for John Debney. He composed a wonderful score for a movie bad beyond salvation. If only this score would have been used for Pirates of the Caribbean instead of that awful stuff by Trevor Rabin it would have been so much more fitting a good score and a good movie. And I wouldn't have had to rewrite the rules in my book.Bottom line - 3\/10. 1 for the score, 1 for the Geena Davis scene after the jump and 1 for the monkey.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"14 November 2009","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched it tonight for the first time - I've listened to Debeny's score before, and in my book a good score usually meant a good movie. So I thought I'd take out the DVD and watch the movie. Here where I knew that my book would have to be rewritten. I can definitely see why this sank the Carolco ship. 1) Everyone is miscast. I have never seen a movie with worse casting than this - Davis doesn't look\/sound\/act like a pirate. The scene where she climbs over the rock after the jump is fantastic for obvious reasons, but she still doesn't cut it as a pirate. The question of believability is not that of can a woman be a pirate captain but rather how can this woman be a pirate captain? And there could have been many answers she is like a mother to them or they are all in love with her or she is a b-tch from hell and they are scared of her, or a combination of the above. Unfortunately, the movie gives us no credible answer, and neither does Davis' performance. Modine is trying to be what Matthew McConaughey would have become a few years later. Problem is - he is no McConaughey, although he is trying really hard. Langella doesn't look or act like a pirate - he seems to be more of an army major at a boot camp. At some stage I almost expected him to check his wrist for a watch and shout You have 40 seconds, now move it soldiers! Stan Shaw's role is probably supposed to be comic relief. Otherwise, I can't understand the idea with the ridiculous Jamaican accent. Unfortunately, there is nothing funny about his role or his delivery, so the joke becomes on him. Even the extras are miscast! During a flyover scene of the ship you can clearly see the actors struggling to climb down the Jacob's ladders - was it really that hard to find actors who could manage it a bit better?2) The dialogue and realism. This is a PIRATE movie. They are supposed to use naval terms. Their speech is supposed to be peppered with swearing. It doesn't have to be R-rated, because there are ways to stylise speech without degrading it with F-words, but the dialogue in CTI was not stylised at all - it just sounded like a bunch of people talking on a morning train on the way to work. This, however, is a minor problem, compared to the overall level of dialogue, interactions and humour in this film. From the balls jokes to wash your mouth to the final I want to see you in my quarters, it was just cringe-worthy. 3) Action sequences. Could someone in this crew do a bit of research? What canon balls were used for battles, how enemy ships were boarded, what a sailing ship looks like in battle, for heaven's sake? Why is a ship intact after a broadside-to=broadside battle? Why are the masts still standing? Honestly, I am not a navy historian, but for anyone who read C.S.Forrester as a child these scenes are mind boggling. And don't get me started with the Why's? on the final duel - that scene is just below criticism. Then there is the lack of blood. For some reason the director decided that it's OK to have blood and injuries that the protagonists suffer, but there should be no blood in battles. That's fine, but then the battles should be choreographed in a way that doesn't require blood. Instead, we see close-ups of people getting stabbed through with sabers, only to see a perfect clean blade when it is pulled out. In some instances the movie doesn't even try to make the impression - you see people getting killed by getting slapped on their backs with sabers. Production values, anyone?Finally, I feel sorry for John Debney. He composed a wonderful score for a movie bad beyond salvation. If only this score would have been used for Pirates of the Caribbean instead of that awful stuff by Trevor Rabin it would have been so much more fitting a good score and a good movie. And I wouldn't have had to rewrite the rules in my book.Bottom line - 3\/10. 1 for the score, 1 for the Geena Davis scene after the jump and 1 for the monkey.

What makes it stand out amongst the rest ? Well to be honest, it gives nothing new to the genre and it doesn't stand out amongst the best , like Halloween and TCM. It easy to say that Halloween opened the door for many Horror directors. After the huge success of Halloween, directors were given the opportunity to get there foot in the door. Sean Cunningham saw the opening and tried to make the most of it. I think why Friday the 13th stands out from the rest is because of it ending and surprising twist. These features are the reason why Friday the 13th is highly praised and remembered . Personally I thought the film was poor. I also believe that younger viewers will be left disappointed due to the fact the Iconic figure with the hockey mask doesn't feature in the film. That what I believe, I believe that the reason why everyone watches the first one is because the sequels gave the audience an iconic killer. Imagine the twist when watching it on release date, you would be surprised by it but then imagine it watching it for the first time today, expecting Jason to show up. The twist is far more surprising today than it was 29 years ago.But still, the film is pretty bad , maybe it because to me it a mindless slasher. Friday the 13th in a nutshell friends camp at lake, friends get murdered at lake, the end. You could say the same for Halloween or TCM or in fact any slasher film but the problem is, is that Friday the 13th doesn't contain a soul of itself . There no imagination or creativity it just mindless killing, filled with gore and the gore itself isn't very impressive in today standards ( but in 1980, it was probably good ) . Halloween had the voyeurism, The shining had the physiological effect, TCM had the shocking element. These three had there own unique style while Friday the 13th seems to rip off many of other horrors .Just imagine this film as one of many other horrors, the ones that you can tell are going to be awful. When you see it on the self , just think of it as one of those awful, corny horror B movies because in fairness, Friday the 13th is pretty bad. Some of the acting is awful and corny while some is okay. Full marks for Kevin Bacon's over dramatic dive into the lake. The twist is nice but then let down because of the awful acting.

Basically at Mercer Advertising, single Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to build up to a better career at the company, and even when suggesting a great and chosen idea for a campaign, isn't promoted. Then she finds a way to get the promotion she wants, when people see her in a photo with some guy at a wedding party, she never corrects anyone about being engaged to him. Kate's new and better career seems to be going great, and she is spending her money on lots of luxury and convenience, she even manages to bed her crush, Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon). But then her boss Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) wants to meet the guy, Nick (Jay Mohr), and he manages to track him down, and pays him to go along with her plan to have dinner and meet everyone, and quickly break up. He is willing to go along with the plan at first, but it is obvious the few days before it happens, he develops real affection for her, and she is forced into making the break-up happen. Obviously they get back together again before he has to go away, but as is predictable, in the end she goes to a wedding he is filming, expresses her (real) feelings for him, and they have their happy ending hug and kiss. Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

Basically scientist and inventor Prof. Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) is determined to prove the theory of time travel is possible, and after the death of his to-be fiancée Emma (Sienna Guillory) this becomes a desperation. Four years past, and without the knowledge of friend David Filby (Mark Addy), Alexander has succeeded in creating a time machine, and the first place he goes is of course the day Emma was killed. Even after stopping the potential event to come she is still killed, and he knows it will happen every time he tries to stop it. So he decides to travel to the future to see whether time travel has been proved, and of course have the question of whether the past can be changed answered. He first tries the year 2030, where he stops off at the New York Library asking questions to holographic librarian Vox (Orlando Jones), and he is shocked to see the Moon breaking up just seven year later. Escaping from the devastation he get knocked unconscious, and unintentionally travels to the year 802,701 A.D., where the human race, or Eloi, has developed a new language (though English is still used occasionally) and a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. It is obvious though that the humans live in fear, when creatures known as the Morlocks, and Alexander is determined to help them before he thinks about going back to the past. He eventually meets the Über-Morlock (Jeremy Irons), who gives him an answer to the question to his past-changing question, before being destroyed outside the machine's time shield, travelling through time. In the end, Alexander decides to use the machine's time alternating power to vaporise the Morlocks, and he obviously stays where he feels happy, with Mara (singer Samantha Mumba) and her people. Also starring Phyllida Law as Mrs. Watchett and tom thumb's Alan Young (also starring in the original) as Flower Store Worker. This might have some pretty good special effects, Pearce might be alright, and Jones adds some light humour, but with some lazy sound effects, an underused Irons, and not enough excitement, the 1960 Rod Taylor classic is much more interesting than this lame and too quick-paced remake, but I suppose you can see it once. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup. Okay!

After the rise to megastar status of Arnold Schwarzenegger and creator James Cameron becoming the most popular action director of the day a sequel was inevitable. T2 is essentially a retread of the original, this time with a stronger, smarter and faster machine, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) being sent back to kill 10 year old John Connor (Edward Furlong) and another, a T-800 (Arnie) which has been captured by the future resistance and reprogrammed, being sent back to protect him. Sarah Connor is now in an institute due to trying to blow up the Cyberdyne (the company who will unwittingly cause the end of mankind) factory and in general acting crazy and spouting off about robots from the future.T2 really shines in the action department. The effects of the liquid metal T-1000 were revolutionary and they look better than similar effects used in Terminator 3 over a decade later. Most scenes are permanently engraved in the public consciousness, iconic in every sense of the word. The bike\/truck chase, Cyberdyne break in, they all showcase the perfect blend of CGI and practical effects.Linda Hamilton gives a brilliant performance as Sarah, tortured by the knowledge of an unavoidable future. Cameron has a knack for writing female characters haunted by the memories of the past, as seen in Aliens, and I think Hamilton was deserving of an Oscar nomination, just as Signorney Weaver had gotten 5 years before.The music is again composed by Brad Fiedel and, like with the original film, it rises above being a generic action film score and also manages to create new themes and motifs not heard in T1. It's a great score in its' own right and the main theme is one of cinema's greatest. So, the action is mind blowing, the lead performance is touching and the atmosphere and music are top notch. What's not to like? I'll tell you what my problem with T2 is...In the first film Skynet inadvertently causes John Connor to be conceived, as the man sent back to protect Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, becomes John's Father. When asked why the machines have bothered with this plan rather than kill John in their time, Kyle answers Their defence grid was smashed. We'd won, taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence. Essentially, in a last ditch attempt to secure their survival Skynet sent back a machine to kill the man who had destroyed them, Connor, before he was ever born. They did not attempt this earlier because Connor was not a messiah, he was just a soldier, albeit a great soldier. Kyle goes on to say, reference the Time displacement equipment that The Terminator had already gone through. Connor sent me intercept and they blew the whole place. How are you supposed to get back? he is asked. I can't, nobody goes home, nobody else comes through. It's just him and me. Reese is saying is that there is no way anything else can be sent through time as the time machine has been destroyed. Skynet were desperately grasping at thin air when they sent The Terminator back in the vain hope that it would salvage them. If they had time to plan they would have sent back 100 terminators and made sure the job was done right. Reese leapt in the machine just in time to be transported too.Reese states that only living human tissue can pass through the machine, The Terminator is a metal endoskeleton but the flesh around it allows it through. This explains why Skynet sent Arnie and not one of those Hunter Killers we see in the 'future flashbacks'. This is conveniently forgotten in T2 as the T-1000 has no living tissue but still makes it through. However, why would it ever be getting sent through in the first place? THE WAR WAS OVER! The humans had won. After Skynet sent back Arnie in T1 the time machine was destroyed. They would not be sending back another machine to kill John Connor because they had been defeated. If Skynet was gonna send something back again, why not send 1000 Hunter Killers to make sure the job is done properly? Once you start asking questions you realise that T2 falls apart quickly and is really nothing more than an unnecessary, nonsensical sequel.Another problem I have is with is Arnie himself. Since T1 he had become a huge star, hence the T-800 being reprogrammed by the resistance to give Arnie more screen time by partnering him up with the good guys. On many occasions during the film he is used for grating comedic effect (I need a vacation). The relationship between him and Connor as he becomes a father figure to the boy is well played out but for every great moment there is a groan moment. T3 and its' director Johnathan Mostow get trashed for turning the character into a joke but the groundwork was laid out here by Cameron. In the first film The Terminator dons sunglasses to cover a damaged eye socket. In T2, he puts them on for no reason other than to look cool, poses and then rides off on a motorcycle while Bad To The Bone blares on the soundtrack. It is silly, unnecessary and sets the tone for a machine that isn't to be taken seriously.T2 is a highly entertaining action film but as a sequel to a sci-fi classic it is a letdown due to its' complete lack of respect for the rules laid down in the original. I recommend it and I do enjoy it but it is not the untouchable classic it is touted as and certainly doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor.
