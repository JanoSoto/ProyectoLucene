And action movies, as we all know, are not the providers of the most developed plots or characters. XXX lacks in both its plot is simple and unoriginal (evil menace tries to destroy the world, tough hero is sent to stop him), and its characters are shallow and stereotypical.HoweverThe plot is decent enough and the characters aren't so annoying that we cannot afford to not praise XXX for the incredible unending amounts of appealing action scenes that are packed into this film's duration.  Scene after scene, minute after minute, we watch Vin Diesel in the most extreme events to hit the screen in a while, and I enjoyed every minute of it.I am not one who usually likes a movie just because of its big action sequences or its special effects.  I hated the Matrix.  That should say enough.  But XXX was somehow different.  It was enjoyable.  It never lost my attention.  I never became bored.I was scared before I saw this film.  Vin Diesel was great in the role that made him famous, Private Caparzo in Saving Private Ryan.  He proved that he knows how to and is willing to act for an audience.  But recently the Fast and the Furious was released, and it seemed to focus more on his build than his acting capabilities.  The advertisements for XXX made me think that the same thing was going to happen.  It did to an extent, but to a very small extent.  Diesel is not the best actor in the world by far, but he is good. XXX did not let me down, even though I thought it would.  There is something real about his performances, something natural.  As if he's just being himself but playing another character at the same time.  He manages to do that in XXX, and it is wonderful.I went into the theater expecting something decent, but I did not think I would like it as much as I did.  Is this movie cliched?  Of course.  Is it the product of the greed of Hollywood?  Yes, there are few movies now that aren't.  But I was impressed with it.  I liked it.  I had fun.  And that's what counts.9\/10Lost a point for Samuel L. Jackson, who is one of my favorite actors but just seemed awkward in this film. I guess it's just that I'm used to seeing him in more serious roles, and he seemed too happy and different in this movie.  Still a superb actor... he just seemed a little weird.

This isn't an attempt to enhance animation by basing it on the real world, it's an attempt to enhance film while acting as a plot device using animation. The effect is incredible. Some of it is silly, some of it is blatant, but in a movie as geared towards variety and exploration as this one is, these things should be expected, even applauded.As for the story line, well, there almost isn't one. This is definitely a case of 90% plot trying to support 10% actual story, a story you don't even really get a hint of (at least the first time through the movie) until you're already half way through. This, however, doesn't make it a bad story, just a different way of telling it. Unlike most films these days, which spoon feed you every possible relevant detail, Waking Life expects you to think and think hard.On a final note, I have heard a small minority, both in real life and on this message board, talk about how it's all cheap, pretentious philosophy. I assure you, this whining comes from people who took an entry level philosophy course, learned of the existence of all the basics like post-modernism and futurism and came to the conclusion that they understood them and that was that.

The whole movie is being told from the perspective of someone who, to serve his own interests, lies throughout his retelling.

Kobayashi is a real person, and the guys are all real, and I believe the basic details of the movie are true. But part of the beauty of this film is that you don't know for sure what is true and what's not. Here's how Kevin Spacey described this movie- He said it's like a play. When you go to see a play, you are in one seat and you can only see the play from that one seat. But if you go to see it again, your perspective changes and you might see things in the play you never saw before, and have a different view on the play than you did the first time. And everytime you see it from a different seat, you get another piece of what the whole picture looks like. This is the most perfect analogy for this movie that I have heard yet. It's one of the few films I have seen that really gets better each time I see it. Because each time, I see something in a different way and I notice something I hadn't noticed before. The film is an intricate web, which I find fascinating.

Not only that, but before the particular scene you mentioned, the perspective changes. Kujan actually says, Let me tell you what I know... and at that moment (as Singer points out on the commentary) the storytelling view switches to his own. What we see now on the boat is what Kujan believes has been going on. He doesn't think that Verbal killed Keaton, and certainly doesn't think Verbal is Soze. This is because Verbal has done such a brilliant job of convincing Kujan that Kujan's suspicions about Keaton are right. Verbal has done it! He's planned out the whole thing carefully, and now he's convinced Kujan that he's just an innocent victim. Not only that, but he's also convinced Kujan that Keyser Soze isn't even real at all.Remember, the whole theme of the film is, The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. This is just one example of how Keyser Soze (the Devil himself) has done this, and an insight into how he's certainly done it before and will keep on doing it.On a little different note, would someone PLEASE explain to me how in the world Kevin Spacey was Best Supporting Actor??? Verbal is the storyteller, and Keyser is who the movie is all about. It's not about the other criminals! It's totally about Keyser and Verbal, both of which are portrayed (sometimes simultaneously) by Spacey. If there's ever been a movie that's totally about one person, it's this one!

I appreciate that everyone has their own opinion otherwise it would be a very dull place to live, but there are a few points brought up by other users that I would like to add my own opinion to.Warning - There ARE spoilers.1) Not as good as the book! This is an issue that will always come up with book adaptations.  The key word here, however is adaptation.  In the film medium artistic licence is a compulsory factor in order to appeal to a mainstream audience and also soften the Executives who are doling out all the finance for the film. The fact is that LOTR is an adaptation.  It was never gonna be exactly like the book, no film could be.  The alterations made by a director tells us alot about his\/her courage,imagination and enthusiasm about a project.  With that in mind, Peter Jackson is a very courageous, imaginative and enthusiastic person.  He has shown such genuine love for a project (highlighted more on the DVD extras) that his adaptation has maintained the integrity of the original plot.  The ommitance of Tom Bombadil was, in my opinion a very wise move, as was the ommitence of the character Glorfindel.  Both these characters, while an interesting aside in the book bear no relevance to the plot  and if where kept in the movie would probably draw out more critisism cos of the nature of driving a plot along in a film medium.

It is very rare for a fantasy movie to have any real  good acting because most of the dialogue is going to be hammy anyway.  LOTR to me was the exception to the rule.  The acting was surperb - One example where this can be seen is at the council of Elrond where as the debate was raging, Frodo stood up and said that he will take the ring to Mordor.  The camera then switched to Gandalf.  He slowly closed his eyes and you could see the pain he was feeling.  The one thing Gandalf wanted was not to let the Hobbits find out about the horrors of the world and in that one facial expression he had realised he had lost that dream, A moment subtle and beautiful with all credit to Ian Mackellen.  It is moments like that that shows real talent, and it was very much abundant in the film. I don't understand what some people expect with regards to acting when I hear comments like they thought the acting was poor.  Do you want people on film to be screaming at each other all the time, breaking down in tears, confessing to their long lost fathers that they really love them....hmmmm No. Each genre has a tone and LOTR got it perfectly.4) Doesn't deserve to be in the top 250?

The original trilogy did not rely too heavily on special effects and it didn't need to because it had such a great story. The script for Episode II is a joke. George Lucas needs to start letting other people write the Star Wars scripts. The love story is so cheesy and completely lacking in the romance. The romance between Han Solo and Leia in the original trilogy was well acted and well written. But the dialogue between Padme and Anakin in this movie sounds like something out of a crappy Hallmark card. But I guess Lucas tries to make up for the crappy script by overloading the movie with special effects which just makes it seem superficial. The last 45 minutes of the movie that were supposed to be so dazzling and exciting were about as fun as watching paint try. And that Yoda fight that everyone was talking about it? It's ridiculous.

I don't think so.First of all I am pretty angry about several things. First, I am particularly distressed that the individuals posting here who liked the movie insist on accusing those of us who didn't of needing some kind of over the top special effects to enjoy a film. WRONG! I can think of many great films that did not need exploitative or gratuitous effects and were fantastic films. I can also think of films that had great effects and were still pretty bad movies, Independence Day comes to mind. My taste runs from Woody Allen to John Carpenter and I try hard to judge each film on its own merits. Speaking of John Carpenter he did a bang up job with Starman with minimal effects and the Jenny Hayden character was able to regain her faith after the death of her husband without me feeling totally manipulated and ripped off. Secondly, I am a bit confused by the overall rating of 8+ when so many people seem to share my sentiments. Mostly I am mad that I paid good money and wasted the time to see this film.!!CONTAINS SPOILERS!!I do not understand the comparisons to Hitchcock. I am a big Hitchcock fan and the only thing I can think of that is similar is the theme of an average guy caught up in unusual circumstances. I guess you could also say that Shyamalan is trying to build suspense through psychological terror instead of doing it overtly. Unfortunately he uses every obvious psychological gimmick in the book to yank the audience's chain. Hitchcock was much more subtle with a long buildup and lots of character exploration prior to things getting heavy. The main problem with this film is that the story fails to perform the most important function to make the premise work. There is very little information given to help us understand or like these characters. The most glaring example of this is the characters' reaction to the two dogs dying. The main characters are totally insensitive to the deaths of the beloved family pets. When the boy kills the first dog the family is barely upset about it and the second one is carelessly left outside for the evil aliens to massacre. If I ever wanted to try to like these characters or care about them it eventually becomes impossible. Then there is the matter of a total lack of background and believability. As many others have stated, why is he a farmer as well as a preacher? If he is a farmer, does he do any farming type stuff, ever? Where was Merrill before all this happened? What compelled him to come help Graham out? Neither Mel Gibson's nor Joaquin Phoenix's character reacts or behaves as one would expect people in this rural setting, or anywhere else for that matter, to act. They also do not seem to behave consistently within the parameters of who they are supposed to be. Actually, so little background is given, it is hard to figure out who they are supposed to be. I find it hard to believe that anybody who was just told that their neighbor has an alien locked in the pantry would not even try to pry some additional information from them. I don't care what the history between the two people is, basic survival instinct would dictate that you would want to know as much as possible. Same thing when they are locked in the house and then the basement. I am appalled that these guys supposedly care about these kids and don't even pick up one of the many gardening tools lying about to prepare to even try to defend themselves. Especially since Merrill was the baseball player who would swing at anything. It was almost painful to see two really good actors like Mel and Joaquin made to play such two-dimensional characters with such rigid, stilted dialogue. Mel's monologue about there being two kinds of people was good but seemed out of place when the rest of the time his character was basically despondent. Why was the stuff about the redneck neighbors even mentioned? The little boy was precocious to the point of being annoying. The little girl was cute and quirky. The lady sheriff was an engaging character and very well portrayed by Cherry Jones. She was actually the one saving grace of the film.I could go on and on about the ridiculousness of the whole aliens with an aversion to water who are going to invade our planet to harvest humans using ground tactics nonsense but I think we need to go ahead and bury that horse. There are so many holes in the plot and script that my head is ready to explode trying to comprehend how M. Night could have made this film. I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I thought his slow, deliberate style of storytelling was totally appropriate in the context of those two films. However, Mr. Shyamalan needs to recognize that different stories require different treatments. Just because this formula worked a couple of times before does not mean he can make every movie using the same kind of devices and stylistic elements. I think he is a very talented writer and director who just needs to grow up and get over himself.I also share the sentiment of many who feel cheated by virtue of the trailers for this film. I do believe that when we, as the paying, movie going public are marketed to, that the filmmaker or distributor should have a responsibility to make the marketing reflect at least some of the flavor of the film. I basically feel like I was tricked into watching what was essentially an exercise in how much the viewer could be manipulated with the fewest possible resources in terms of sets, effects and dialogue. A kind of minimalism carried to the point of absurdity.I will see M. Night's next exploit, only because I now feel like he owes me something and I would like to give him the chance to make up for this fiasco.One last comment One of the other reviewers on this board suggested that this was all a nightmare the little girl was having. That would actually make the most sense out of everything. Unfortunately, I do not believe that was the intended twist. I think M. Night would have made it more obvious at the end if that was the case. I really wish that he had.

I thought his slow, deliberate style of storytelling was totally appropriate in the context of those two films. However, Mr. Shyamalan needs to recognize that different stories require different treatments. Just because this formula worked a couple of times before does not mean he can make every movie using the same kind of devices and stylistic elements. I think he is a very talented writer and director who just needs to grow up and get over himself.I also share the sentiment of many who feel cheated by virtue of the trailers for this film. I do believe that when we, as the paying, movie going public are marketed to, that the filmmaker or distributor should have a responsibility to make the marketing reflect at least some of the flavor of the film. I basically feel like I was tricked into watching what was essentially an exercise in how much the viewer could be manipulated with the fewest possible resources in terms of sets, effects and dialogue.

I don't think so.First of all I am pretty angry about several things. First, I am particularly distressed that the individuals posting here who liked the movie insist on accusing those of us who didn't of needing some kind of over the top special effects to enjoy a film. WRONG! I can think of many great films that did not need exploitative or gratuitous effects and were fantastic films. I can also think of films that had great effects and were still pretty bad movies, Independence Day comes to mind. My taste runs from Woody Allen to John Carpenter and I try hard to judge each film on its own merits. Speaking of John Carpenter he did a bang up job with Starman with minimal effects and the Jenny Hayden character was able to regain her faith after the death of her husband without me feeling totally manipulated and ripped off. Secondly, I am a bit confused by the overall rating of 8+ when so many people seem to share my sentiments. Mostly I am mad that I paid good money and wasted the time to see this film.!!CONTAINS SPOILERS!!I do not understand the comparisons to Hitchcock. I am a big Hitchcock fan and the only thing I can think of that is similar is the theme of an average guy caught up in unusual circumstances. I guess you could also say that Shyamalan is trying to build suspense through psychological terror instead of doing it overtly. Unfortunately he uses every obvious psychological gimmick in the book to yank the audience's chain. Hitchcock was much more subtle with a long buildup and lots of character exploration prior to things getting heavy. The main problem with this film is that the story fails to perform the most important function to make the premise work. There is very little information given to help us understand or like these characters. The most glaring example of this is the characters' reaction to the two dogs dying. The main characters are totally insensitive to the deaths of the beloved family pets. When the boy kills the first dog the family is barely upset about it and the second one is carelessly left outside for the evil aliens to massacre. If I ever wanted to try to like these characters or care about them it eventually becomes impossible. Then there is the matter of a total lack of background and believability. As many others have stated, why is he a farmer as well as a preacher? If he is a farmer, does he do any farming type stuff, ever? Where was Merrill before all this happened? What compelled him to come help Graham out? Neither Mel Gibson's nor Joaquin Phoenix's character reacts or behaves as one would expect people in this rural setting, or anywhere else for that matter, to act. They also do not seem to behave consistently within the parameters of who they are supposed to be. Actually, so little background is given, it is hard to figure out who they are supposed to be. I find it hard to believe that anybody who was just told that their neighbor has an alien locked in the pantry would not even try to pry some additional information from them. I don't care what the history between the two people is, basic survival instinct would dictate that you would want to know as much as possible. Same thing when they are locked in the house and then the basement. I am appalled that these guys supposedly care about these kids and don't even pick up one of the many gardening tools lying about to prepare to even try to defend themselves. Especially since Merrill was the baseball player who would swing at anything.

Night Shyamalan.This is one of the most unwatchable films I have ever seen. Not unwatchable, as in bad, but unwatchable, as in painful. Every moment of this film you keep wishing the despicable characters would not do what they're about to do, driving themselves farther into addiction. Why does the viewer wish the characters a better fate? Despite them being despicable, we see ourselves in the characters, and fall in love with this. This is a rare feat accomplished by Darren Aronofsky and the actors, especially Marlon Wayans. I remember saying Oh NO! when I caught this film at the underground theater (the Ritz 5, for the locals) in Philadelphia.

Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn are excellent as Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo and are both vital to the movie and plot.  Though some of the picture is historically correct, most of it is not.

Eleven years later, I still do. It's an absolutely perfect film and I would not change a thing about it. The story is compelling, but a mere description of the plot does not do the film justice because one cannot simply recount the friendship that is at the heart of the film. It must be seen to be believed. It is an utterly  touching, moving and heartfelt friendship that marks this film and takes it to heights few films can ever reach. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon embody their characters with such conviction that they become Thelma and Louise. Both earned well-deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actress. By the time they are clasping hands at the end of the film, their T-bird speeding toward a freer and more uninhibited existence, I am sure everyone will be moved because of how well these women and their friendship have been depicted. The screenplay, which won an Oscar, is absolutely brilliant and makes it seem as though the road movie is an altogether new film genre. The film suffered much criticism in 1991 (despite strong reviews) because of what many saw as its sexists message, and it even made the cover of Time, with Davis and Sarandon on the cover and a caption that read Thelma and Louise why it strikes a nerve. I think it's good that it got the attention, since it probably helped it at the box-office, but I do not think this is an anti-male, feminist film. Keitel's cop character as well as Madsen's boyfriend character are both quite nice and helpful to the girls. Everyone should give this film a try as it is not just a girls-gone-bad chick flick. There is no such thing as a chick flick or a guy flick. Only good and bad flicks. And this one is good indeed.

One day Brian calls her and needs help getting his dog out of the rollerskates on his paws.  How the skates got on is never addressed.  Abby successfully gets the skates off Hank (the dogs eventual name) over the phone and Brian is quite impressed and asks Abby out.  She says she is 5'10 and blonde because she's painfully insecure about her looks.  Luckily, a 5'10 blonde lives down the hall from Abby.  Her name is Noelle and she is in a bad relationship.  One night when Abby confronts this bad relationship in the hall, he is rude to her so Noelle is nice enough to apologize and shows up at the radio station Abby works at, even though these women don't even know each other, much less where the other works.  More improbabilities are forthcoming, as Brian shows up at the radio station at that exact moment and Noelle has to pose as Abby, or we would have less of a movie than we already do. The three of them hang out together one night.  Brian is more and more attracted to Noelle (who is now Abby) and the real Abby (who is now Donna) is disappointed, of course.  But Brian and (ha, ha) 'Donna' have a lengthy phone conversation one night (the movies way of excusing the glaring difference in the characters voices is ridiculous) and really connect, which makes Brian's inevitable love for (ha, ha) 'Abby' all the more hurtful for Donna.  To the movie's credit, 'Abby' is a good friend to 'Donna' and tries to repair the rift between them constantly, but her phone calls are all ignored.  The women are at least sensible enough not to fight over the guy, at least in a Jerry Springer kind of way.  Naturally it all ends well for the lovers, but the character of Noelle is not treated with tons of respect.  Its almost as though she exists so that the lovers will have something to overcome, an obstacle more than an actual person.  You never find out what happens to Noelle, who was nice enough to respect her friend by not sleeping with the man she knew she was in love with.  I understand the movie was not about her in the first place, but she still deserves better than the movie is willing to give her.I don't like movies where a silly, immature misunderstanding is the only thing holding the plot (such as it is) together.  Its nice to see Janeane play a character, but she's treated like an ogre, and that's not just when its in comparison to Uma Thurman.  Ben Chaplin is charming, but not overwhelmingly so.
