However, Event Horizon is not hobbled by either of those things. The mostly British cast realised that they were mostly props for bad things to happen to, and it shows in the way they act out their roles. It makes a nice contrast with American acting, where they seem to expect at least a thousand lines of clever dialogue.My only serious complaints about this film are that it isn't long enough to have a story which makes you care about anyone besides Fishburne and Neill, and that it isn't out on DVD here. Oh, and don't try to watch this film on VHS. The low-level noise in the dark areas of the picture and the loss of about 33% of the picture severely cuts down the film's impact.

American Beauty won the vote by a pretty good margin because this is the film that disgraces society yet is embraced by society. It's stereotypical. Back in the 50's it was Beaver, now everyone wants to be a Burnham. Where's the reality?  Where's the innovative touch on the character\/character relations\/character actions? It's got great directing, acting, and cinematography but so did Titanic. The substance of the film is cheesy, underestimating, overused, overdone, cliche, and ignorant. It's directing is better, and it's acting is at least equal to that of American Beauty.American Beauty is a stereotypical film on the melancholy suburban life that some of us lead, but all of us love to associate with. It's a technical masterpiece but as an overall film, it's mediocre. The bad writing and lack of originality\/creativity in the screenplay is what kills it. No film on the darkness of society should EVER be popular because it would examine what society would like to ignore. American Beauty is indeed VERY popular, but will teach it's viewers nothing(and good movies do teach people things) because it's viewers don't realize that this IS them, the majority of American Beauty's fans, the VAST majority, are Burnham incarnate. Everyone likes to imagine that they are aware of their current status, that they are deep(to use an overused expression) or intelligent, so they won't see American Beauty as a learning opportunity, but rather a mere exercise of what they already know. Unfortunately, that is untrue; but anybody who is an American beauty fan obviously doesn't realize that this is untrue and the biggest slip-up of the movie.It's the sadness that we must all embrace. American Beauty is nothing more than an overblown story about the stereotypical chain of relations the Knowingly depressed father, the self-ignoring businesswoman who prefers her career over her family, the rebellious daughter who takes it to a gothic extreme because her family is rich suburbia, the weird kid next door who appears crazy but is in-fact very sensitive and romantic, the cheerleader who sacrifices her dignity to make everyone think she is a slut for attention and when she is put to the test she reveals her weakness, the kick-ass conservative general next door whose wife and house seem to suffer from the kick-ass veteran's bleak personality(he's living in a world that embraces sensitivity and doesn't want to realize the fact that he's sensitive, oh wait...he's gay, but stereotypically that would make him sensitive anyway), the gay guys neighboring the Burnhams. Remember that scene when she is staring at her dining table and apologizes for the mess...but wait, there is no mess!  Ohh yeah, it must be because she's so depressed from having to live with the kick-ass general.  Man, don't you just FEEL for her.  Tear.It's even got the political element Military veteran on the Right, homosexual couple on the Left, and the family in between who suffers dramatically.If you want what American Beauty attempts to offer then try some of my favorite films on the subject Fight Club, Edward Scissorhands, The Shawshank Redemption, A Clockwork Orange, High Fidelity, The Beach, Awakenings, The Green Mile, and Bulworth.American Beauty.

We have a computer called Hal -oops- Jerry. We have a plot device seemingly borrowed from an even worse flick called Event Horizon. We even have the 'underwater research facility destroyed by monster\/bad weather\/bomb\/take your pick' cliche.The reactions displayed by everyone in this film was confusing to say the least. The story line, although not as bad as EH was so muddled you soon couldn't care whether the crew lived or died. Just about nothing made sense - and boy was Hoffman bad in this!CONCLUSION? Yawn.

However, by the end of the film my main feelings were of confusion and disappointment. While each actor does have flashes of greatness, they all seem to be coasting, doing the bare minimum they need to get through their parts - Rickman does little else but his patented moody scowl, Steiger and Aiello shout and rant, Keitel frowns with inner tension and anger. Kline and Mastrantonio are reasonable but never electric as the central couple in what I saw billed as a romantic serial killer thriller comedy - and perhaps this is the film's major problem - it doesn't really know what it's trying to be. The scattering of wacky characters - Kline leading as the hilariously oddball sleuth with a penchant for odd food and weirder decor, with his slow-talking computer-whizz artist buddy (?) Rickman in tow - sets up a comedy agenda reminiscent of real crime comedies such as Foul Play (except without the laughs), and some scenes fit this genre, the climactic fight scene in particular. However, the other characters seem to think they are in an entirely different film, Steiger, Keitel and Aiello all playing straight as if they were in a Copland-style hard-talking psychological actioner and Sarandon flailing about in her bit-of-nothing part not really knowing what she's there for. The first half of the film is taken up establishing the relationships between these central characters - the scary strangler featured in the opening scene is forgotten for about forty minutes while an emotional drama is played out displaying the complex web of past and present ties linking them all. Then we slip quickly into a little light rom-com stuff between Kline and Mastrantonio, before moving on to the solving the crime section, with lots of wrinkled brows, weird ideas, running up and down corridors, false endings and improbable computer simulations. Kline's ingenious solution of the pattern used by the killer is spoiled by one thing - it's completely unbelievable, and no point or reason is given for the criminal following such an absurd and unlikely course through his killing spree. At this point the film is still firmly on serious ground - had it been played a little more for laughs the set-up might have been more acceptable. Bizarrely, up to the moment of this solution, the laughs are more on the gentle side as the mood is firmly placed on the tension between the protagonists, and their efforts to track down the killer. No sense of fear, of a city under the sway of a vicious killer is achieved, and indeed no sense that the killer is in fact a serious issue. It's all about our lead characters, the killer just a backdrop for their arguments. Then, when the serial killer returns to this serial killer thriller, the second he's in the room with his last potential victim, everything goes out the window and we're back in Foul Play slapstick territory with people bouncing down staircases and tripping over things like there's no tomorrow. Then it's over and everybody's happy. What?There are some good ideas and some nice moments here but what it lacks is any sense of unity. There are too many twists of plot and changes of mood to keep you gripped either emotionally or mentally, and the gang of stars involved just don't sparkle enough to make it worth while.

It is a fierce, hypnotic take on Hubert Selby's Jr's novel. Just as he did in his directorial debut, Pi, Aronofsky has used his distinct, fascinating visual style as a form of narrative voice, conveying intense emotion with fabulous repetition and dizzying, effective camera work. Much will be made of the editing style, but in the director's capable hands, the technique isn't pretentious or excessive-it is merely unforgettable.
