Or against his better judgement, at first, because he does sign off on playing The Game, which is an experience with a bow. That is, without any good clues about who the players are or why it's quite happening, except that his birthday has come and gone, events begin to happen around him that are inexplicable. And that he can't ignore.Intensity rules. Douglas, playing the obscenely wealthy Nicholas Van Orton, gets led further and further into the madness and crime and murder of this huge huge charade. Or so it seems.In a manner the director, David Fincher, is cozy with, reality bends but psychology seems to be solid. That is, you are secure, somehow, in the main actor's head as the world distorts. The main example is of course The Fight Club, the distortions are almost literal in the more ordinary Panic Room, and the world is somewhat friendlier in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Yes, these are all Fincher films (as is the brand new American version Dragon Tattoo flick and the riveting Se7en).The production and the shooting and editing in particular are all first rate, classic Fincher. Douglas plays his part with conviction and you end up not quite sympathizing with him (he's a spoiled jerk even as his world evaporates) but you certainly are in his shoes, wondering what is going on. It's crazy and exciting and certainly baffling for a viewer--which is part of the game, actually. The viewer is another layer in the layers of perceivable reality.And then it just goes too far. In a way, the film is preposterous from the start, but yet you go along with the idea because very rich people have very unusual lives, and maybe this kind of mind-trip birthday present with lots of people participating could happen. Money moves mountains. But when things get almost comically absurd, when the twists of identity and loyalty keep happening, you want to just say, walk away. Get a grip. Refuse to play, or maybe (at least) refuse to believe things like this are possible.This is where Michael Douglas is perfect, and maybe does what few actors could pull off. Because as it gets insane, his character toughs it out. He's the type to take a challenge, to get extreme, to be risky, to protect his self-interests without surrender.In some ways it's a great movie, so watch it as if it'll never let you go. And when it's just too much, be glad you went along for as long as you did. And enjoy the rest of the show for its theatrics. It remains really well made all through.

It's hard to remember now, but back in the year 2000 most of the world thought Tolkien's magnum opus was unfilmable. It took a hobbit-like, New Zealand native horror comedy director to prove them all wrong. Some fans were quick to point out the flaws, the deviations made from the source material, but for anyone who actually loved the spirit and the atmosphere of the novels, Peter Jackson's films were more than anyone could hope for.A decade later, with the initial excitement, hype and backlash died down, it's easier to see these films for what they are, both the good and the bad. And while they're definitely flawed, and they definitely deviate from the novels quite often (a necessity), they're also - and I say this without second thoughts - the best mainstream films of the previous decade. When considered as a standalone creation and not an adaptation, they're excellent works of cinema, perfectly balancing a fast, energetic pace, impressive special effects that have aged shockingly well, exciting action scenes, great dramatic acting, immense amounts of pathos and drama and just the right amount of comic relief. Jackson also managed the singular achievement of using the trilogy format to the films' benefit; not since the original Star Wars trilogy has there been a trilogy of films in which not one disappoints, each one expending over the previous installments (in stark contrast with the Matrix - which was released around the same time, and in which, it grew gradually clearer, the creators had no idea what to do with the sequels).The problems the films had are mostly derived from the difficulty of filming at such a large scope. Deviations from the original are mostly excused; No Tom Bombadil seems as ridiculous a complaint, in hindsight, as Organic web shooters. The writers did a spectacular job of removing just enough and changing just enough to make Lord of the Rings work (spectacuarly well) as a work of cinema. My biggest complaint is about lack of characterization and background for some of the supporting character, mostly Boromir, Gimli and Legolas. Boromir was reduced to little more than a villain, though Sean Bean was good enough to give him the kind of depth and humanity the character should have; Gimli and Legolas were practically comic relief. The acting was so good all around, though, that it's hard to notice. In fact, no fantasy casting website could have put together a better cast, and nobody stands out as a weak link.Lord of the Rings is probably the only case in history of a series of films where all entries do nothing but compliment each other - no complete shift in genre (Aliens), no gradual declination (Matrix), no anticlimactic third installment (The Godfather, Back to the Future). For that reason it's hard for me to compare the three, though Fellowship of the Ring has a special place in my heart, because it was the real shocker - it was the crucial point in time when we found out Tolkien could be filmed after all. Every film in the series has its weaknesses and strengths - The Two Towers has timeless scenes with Gollum but some much slower ones focusing on Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas; Return of the King has lots of pathos, but relies too heavily on huge battle scenes and has one of the most disappointing endings in film history. But taken all together, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most solid, most entertaining, most wonderfully impressive and memorable, most epic films ever made, and that will never change.

That's not to say that I'm a hard-nosed bastard with no feelings, because of course I well up in many films including the opening of Up and the final third of Requiem for a Dream. However, no film had actually made me release tears until I saw Dancer in the Dark for the second time. Even on my first viewing I did not cry, I just felt very overwhelmed. I suppose once you know the tragic conclusion, it makes it all the more unbearable to watch. Last night I watched Dancer in the Dark for a third time and I cried again.I didn't cry quite as much, but tears were still there and it still had that awful emotional wallop to the gut. Dancer in the Dark is one of those rare films which possess such a raw and intense emotional power. It could possibly be the most powerful film I have ever seen. I don't know anyone who could just zap through the credits, pull the disc out of their DVD player and get on with their lives. Every time I see it, I stare into the credits and I'm haunted by the final shot for hours and hours. In fact, when I went to bed last night, I cried again just thinking about it.Lars Von Trier is the definition of a love-it or hate-it director. The only film I haven't liked of his is The Idiots, which is coincidentally part of his Golden Hearts Trilogy which includes this and Breaking the Waves, his other masterpiece. I've also loved Dogville and immensely admired his latest Depression Trilogy which features Antichrist, Melancholia and Nymphomaniac. He's been accused of creating films to shock for the sake of it, and whilst I do agree with that to some extent (did we really need that brief porn in Antichrist?) you can't deny that his films are unlike any other.Dancer in the Dark is Lars' masterpiece. Yes, Breaking the Waves come close, but you just have to give the prize to Dancer for pure innovation. It opens with a sensational overture (written by Bjork) which is enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. The story behind this overture is that Lars wanted the music to play whilst the curtains were shut over the screen, however he later realised that most movie theaters don't have curtains anymore and so put images of paintings over the music instead.We then open to a brilliant piece of comedy where our hero Selma and her friend Cathy are in some rather dull rehearsals for an amateur production of The Sound of Music. This hilarious opening completely juxtaposes the devastating finale. In fact, most viewers forget just how funny the first twenty minutes are, as the ending just completely eclipses that. Lars uses the same Dogme style as he did for The Idiots and Breaking the Waves. It almost feels like a documentary, with the images looking far too natural and the performances feeling far too real. It allows us to truly immerse ourselves into Selma's world, which of course makes the film all the more hard-hitting.Talking of performances, Bjork's is truly sensational. Who would've thought that a little Icelandic pop-goddess would be able to give Meryl Streep a run for her money! In fact, Bjork's performance is more comparable to Emily Watson's legendary debut in Breaking the Waves. It's so raw, emotional and intense to watch. Bjork even said that she didn't feel as if she was acting, she would go onto the set and become Selma. Surely that's the mark of an incredibly talented actress? It's a shame that Lars gave her such an awful experience that she never acted again. Bjork didn't even want to do Dancer in the Dark, she agreed to write the music, but Lars blackmailed her into acting by saying that he wouldn't use her music unless she played Selma.Of course, you mustn't forget that Dancer in the Dark is in fact a musical! Selma is a musical enthusiast because 'nothing dreadful ever happens.' Obviously she isn't a fan of Sweeney Todd, Les Mis or indeed the very musical she is starring in. The songs in the film are all fantastic; I even began liking Scatterheart on my third viewing, understanding that the lack of melody and structure perfectly mirrors the situation which Selma finds herself in. The musical numbers offer a fantastical escape from the dreary reality. The washed-out colours are now bright and vibrant. Extras awkwardly dance around and have unnaturally wide smiles. The musical numbers don't fit with the tone of the film, and that is exactly the point!It's the ending which catapults Dancer in the Dark into masterpiece status though. It has images which will sear into your brain and will touch you in parts which you didn't know could be touched! I've seen many depressing films, but this one takes the prize for the most depressing ending of all time. However, it's also a genius way to end the film. I especially love the quote which superimposes the screen. It mirrors Selma's early monologue where she describes cheating films by leaving after the second-to-last song so that the film will play on forever.It's easy to see why most people wouldn't want to watch Dancer in the Dark a second time, let alone a third time like I did! However, I love films which take you on a journey. Films which have the power to physically move you are so rare, and experiencing emotion like this is really quite extraordinary. Dancer in the Dark is a magical masterpiece which must be experienced by everyone at least once.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 2011","score":"","review":" I should let you know that I'm not one to cry in movies.

The innate truth and honesty of this sad, strange tale cannot fade, and that is why I call this film a timeless classic. The film is quirky and full of highly individual, not to say eccentric, characters. The director Lasse Hallstrom, who is of Swedish origin and is perhaps best known in America for his marvellous HACHI A DOG'S TALE (2009, see my review), specialises in exploring deep feelings and emotions, and seems to prefer those of unusual people, including even dogs who are people. As a dog-lover, I am pleased that Hallstrom realizes that dogs are people. In fact, Hallstrom seems to have a sympathy for outcasts. One might consider dogs outcasts, in that they are denied human status except by those in the know. In this film, the central character is an outcast, a woman named Bonnie Grape, who is enormously fat, about 500 pounds in fact, so that she can barely stand. She not only stays in her house and refuses to go outdoors, but she declines even to go upstairs to her own bedroom, and has spent seven years living and sleeping on the sofa in her living room. She is played by Darlene Cates, a genuine Texan with an authentic accent, which helps make the film convincing, as it is set in a small Texas town in the 1950s. In terms of the action, Bonnie is a peripheral character, but in terms of the story, she is its heart. She became fat through uncontrolled and compulsive comfort-eating caused by depression after her husband hung himself in the basement of their large, rambling farmhouse on the outskirts of town. In one central pathetic scene, she says apologetically to a visitor 'I wasn't always like this.' Her elder son, beautifully and sensitively played by Johnny Depp, tells a girl friend that Bonnie was once so pretty. This unusual story is from a novel by Peter Hedges, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. One wonders what inspired him. Whatever it was, it was deeply felt. He was born in Iowa, and one wonders if this story's mythical town of Endora, though filmed in Texas, may represent some place in Iowa best known to himself. This film contains so many exquisitely sensitive performances that from the acting point of view it is nothing short of a miracle. The most astounding of all is that of 19 year-old Leonardo Di Caprio, then little known, as Arnie, the younger brother of Johnny Depp. Arnie is mentally handicapped, of the kind which often occurs through oxygen deprivation at birth. He is about to reach his 18th birthday but is mentally like an unruly and unpredictable child. I don't know how Di Caprio did it, but he must have studied such people very closely, since his every gesture and movement, and every aspect of his speech, is one hundred percent accurate. There is not a single scene where he lets us glimpse the real Leonardo. It is a tour de force of epic dimensions. For those who think OF MICE AND MEN (1939, see my review) was deeply moving, try this, which is far more so. The intense devotion to Arnie shown by Depp reminds us of RAIN MAN (1988), where Tom Cruise was similarly devoted to Dustin Hoffman. The ever-watchable Juliette Lewis, that weird-looking gal you can't take your eyes off for a minute, passes through town in a trailer with her mother, and becomes a sort-of girlfriend for Depp. She instinctively understands and accepts Arnie, who becomes attached to her. Depp has had a disturbing affair with a frustrated married woman of the town, brilliantly played by Mary Steenburgen. Everyone in the small town is frustrated, which one might say is sometimes the standard condition of a small town, especially one as small as 'Endora', the name suggesting the end of the road, since no one ever leaves, and they either die by drowning in a child's paddle pool (the fate of Steenburgen's husband) or just moulder away. The film is full of marvellously quirky humour, and has scenes which are riotously funny. So the pathos is constantly lightened by eruptions of the ludicrous. Hallstrom has accomplished a marvellous balancing act, as he never sacrifices the sadness to laughs, but he never allows life's tragedies to get in the way of a good guffaw at human follies. It all works. It might have been better if the surname had been changed from Grape, and if the title had not been a pun on eating a grape. That lessens the impact of this classic film, for unless one knows how wonderful it is, and if one just comes upon the DVD by browsing, one might be inclined to dismiss it as some trivial inferior comedy. The film is also distinguished by the anguished performances of Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt as Depp's two long-suffering sisters. Every aspect of this film is a triumph. If only there were many more like it. It is a magnificent example of a film which uplifts the human spirit.

I don't know how Di Caprio did it, but he must have studied such people very closely, since his every gesture and movement, and every aspect of his speech, is one hundred percent accurate. There is not a single scene where he lets us glimpse the real Leonardo. It is a tour de force of epic dimensions. For those who think OF MICE AND MEN (1939, see my review) was deeply moving, try this, which is far more so. The intense devotion to Arnie shown by Depp reminds us of RAIN MAN (1988), where Tom Cruise was similarly devoted to Dustin Hoffman. The ever-watchable Juliette Lewis, that weird-looking gal you can't take your eyes off for a minute, passes through town in a trailer with her mother, and becomes a sort-of girlfriend for Depp. She instinctively understands and accepts Arnie, who becomes attached to her. Depp has had a disturbing affair with a frustrated married woman of the town, brilliantly played by Mary Steenburgen. Everyone in the small town is frustrated, which one might say is sometimes the standard condition of a small town, especially one as small as 'Endora', the name suggesting the end of the road, since no one ever leaves, and they either die by drowning in a child's paddle pool (the fate of Steenburgen's husband) or just moulder away. The film is full of marvellously quirky humour, and has scenes which are riotously funny. So the pathos is constantly lightened by eruptions of the ludicrous. Hallstrom has accomplished a marvellous balancing act, as he never sacrifices the sadness to laughs, but he never allows life's tragedies to get in the way of a good guffaw at human follies. It all works. It might have been better if the surname had been changed from Grape, and if the title had not been a pun on eating a grape. That lessens the impact of this classic film, for unless one knows how wonderful it is, and if one just comes upon the DVD by browsing, one might be inclined to dismiss it as some trivial inferior comedy. The film is also distinguished by the anguished performances of Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt as Depp's two long-suffering sisters. Every aspect of this film is a triumph. If only there were many more like it. It is a magnificent example of a film which uplifts the human spirit.

I can't find any fault at all with the film itself and I'm so glad to have it in my collection.The plot is simple as I said focusing on 4 survivors of a failed diamond heist as they attempt to unravel who was the rat who set them up. This film isn't about the plot, however, it is about the characters and this is where the film shines as possibly the best ever. Each character is unique but not clichéd and this is very clever. They manage to make the watcher both like and dislike them at different times. This is true even to the extent that a conversation about Madonna and tipping can be interesting to listen to. The most interesting parts of the film are where it takes you into the back-stories of the main characters including the planning of the heist.The acting is carried off superbly particularly by Michael Madson as the quiet psychopathic Mr Blonde and Steve Buscemi as the prickly nervous but logically thinking Mr Pink. When it gets to the end of the film you will have got to know all of these characters and the tense climax holds up against the best modern films. This film proves that you don't need a huge budget and CGI to make a good movie.Reservoir Dogs is somewhat similar in style of directing and filming to Tarantino's later film Pulp Fiction. But I prefer Reservoir Dogs as it is the classic that started it all off. I would recommend it to people who appreciate a movie that makes you think and isn't about action heroes or explosions but is much more subtle. It would be easy to mistake this for a plain movie with too much bad language and violence for the sake of violence. It is much more than that trust me and you'll soon find that Reservoir Dogs goes much deeper than so many titles out there.

The movie Alaska, is a family adventure film that involves two children, Jesse and Sean Barnes on the hunt to find their lost father. How did he get lost? As a pilot, the kids' father, Jake Barnes (Dirk Benedict) flies straight into a storm and crash lands into a mountain where he struggles to survive as his children look to find him. It's amazing because even when the story is not revolving around the adventurous children, the scenery everywhere is so beautiful. This is one of the strong points of this film. Another key part to this movie is a polar bear cub that runs into the Barnes kids and ends up trying to help locate their dad. This bear cub always reminds me of the polar bears from those coke commercials. Besides of what I think it could belong to, he is very cuddly looking. I'm also curious to how director Fraser Heston was able to get this animal to cooperate. I'm sure it's not easy to tame a wild animal. This cub must have been pre-trained some how.To make things even more interesting, poachers are on the move as well. Yes, there are other things on the hunt than the Barnes kids.

His life changes when he becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). He changes his life for the better, embracing the music of his youth and working out in his garage, smoking pot. He blackmails his now former employers, gets a low-responsibility job at a fast food joint and buys his dream car. A life free from responsibility and worries comes at cost though, and Lester ultimately pays the ultimate price.That is just one interpretation of this film, but to be honest, American Beauty is a film about so much more than sexual desire. It is a social commentary on the 'American Dream', the perfect lives that suburban families supposedly live, and the physical and psychologically effects on those who strive for it. The character of Carolyn best represents this, as a Realtor who is so ambitious to be the best, that she often breaks down and builds herself up again with motivational books and tapes, and also seeking comfort from successful Realtor Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).American Beauty, as the name suggests, is also concerned with love and different perceptions of beauty. Jane (Thora Birch), the Burnhams' daughter, strives for breast augmentation and is constantly embarrassed by her parents, almost leaving her a social outcast. Conversely, her friend Angela is a confident and attractive blonde who brags of her sexual experiences while dreaming of becoming a model, she loves the possibility that Lester is attracted to her. In these two characters you have stereotypical characters it could be said but what changes this is Wes Bentley's character Ricky Fits. Fits' and his parents, a bigoted US marine (Chris Cooper) and his introverted wife (Alison Janney), move next door to Burnhams and Ricky quickly starts to observe them with his video camera, especially Jane. The two later begin a relationship, to Alison's dismay, and Ricky confides in Jane is acute sense of beauty he finds in the simple things, such as a paper bag blowing in the wind. The film definitely supports the 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' view, Lester desires Angela's superficial beauty but Ricky finds inner beauty, in Jane and in the world around him.The film also raises the conflict between the material world and the more spiritual world. Lester is the only character able to escape from the dull, materialistic society he sees around him by doing what he wants to do like buying his dream car and working out in a bid to impress Angela. Carolyn, on the other hand, has become disillusioned by the world as her ambitions to become better and better eat away at her. By the end of the film, however, it is Lester who is 'punished'. After a moment of clarity in which he comes to realise the importance of his family, he is killed by Ricky's father. However, Lester has actually been redeemed because he watches his life flash before him, and he sees all the beauty in his life, which does not include Angela.

Attack of the Clones shows what life in the pre-Empire Republic really was like, the charming and near-utopian like place it was, unlike the distant Episode 1.Furthermore, the big plot is really put into motion here, with the rising of the star systems separating from the Republic, setting the pieces for the upcoming war. It is a far more ominous and vital set-up than the ridiculous trade dispute from the Phantom Menace. The only real plot development of Episode 1 was showing how Palpatine became Chancellor. Wasn't it enough just to see him as Chancellor here? His cool, calculating character makes the audience understand how he got there (largely thanks to Ian McDiarmid's talent).The introduction of other characters would've been similarly satisfying had the prequels started with this movie. We believe that the troubled, egotistic Anakin Skywalker would be partial to the Dark Side of the Force if swayed enough. Obi-Wan Kenobi's wisdom and dedication as a Jedi is clear from the onset as well, as is Padmé Amidala's tenacious, wholesome character. Besides, if Episode 1 happened ten years previously, wouldn't we have heard about Syfa Dias's death? The plot unveils all of this very satisfyingly. As Obi-Wan Kenobi tracks the person behind assassination attempts on Padmé, the world of the Republic (including life in Coruscant as well as the Jedi temple) is one he travels through for answers. This is the opposite of Episode 1, where the heart of each place was so distant.Sure, the dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is not the best, especially in the fireplace scene. Hayden Christensen, what's more, hammed up the role of Anakin a bit at times and as such felt unbelievable. However, in spite of that, there is a tangible chemistry between Christensen and Natalie Portman (who here gets much more to work with the role of Padmé).Sure, the Trade Federation plays a vital part in this film as well, but suppose Episode 1 had never been made? We still would understand the history between Naboo and the Federation (whose absurd ability to command an army and have representatives in the Galactic Senate was a hugely missed plot point in the Phantom Menace). In fact, only one thing about Episode 2 really escapes me, and that is how Jango Fett came to be the host of such a massive operation when he's a bounty hunter. Maybe some light could've been shed on that.Fact of the matter, the story of Episode 2 is very big, and the amount of happenings is gargantuan. A lot more ground is covered than in Episode 1. But it is an entertaining and (unlike Episode 1) fulfilling experience.In conclusion, Attack of the Clones was a significant improvement upon the inadequate Phantom Menace, and is a solid, satisfying film in its own right. It has its dud elements but the ominous story is given good justice. The only pointless scene is possibly the conveyor belt one (which does nothing for the plot other than set up an embarrassing situation for C3PO).
