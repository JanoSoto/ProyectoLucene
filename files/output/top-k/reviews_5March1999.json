Technically, this may not strictly be a sequel (since half of this, the flashback half, was in the original novel), but what the hell; this is the rare sequel which is not only great, but improves on the original.  If you held a gun to my head and asked me what my favorite movie was of all time, this would be the one. Though I disagree with Coppola, who felt he romanticized the Corleones in Part I, without that feeling, there would have been no Part II, and we must thank him for that.The way time passes from present to pass effortlessly, the way we see how past affects present, the way the story of Michael Corleone achieves the level of Greek tragedy, the direction, the performances, the score, everything comes together even deeper than in the first one.  But the primary reason to see this is Al Pacino.  It is my humble opinion that not only is this the best of his five great performances from 1972-75 (the others being THE GODFATHER, SCARECROW, SERPICO, and DOG DAY AFTERNOON), it is the greatest performance by an actor I have ever seen, period (Liv Ullman's performance in PERSONA is the best performance by an actress I have seen). Michael Corleone becomes more closed off as he achieves power.  He alienates friends, family, even the people who work for him, because he completely closes himself off from humanity.  Yet we feel for him, partly because Pacino NEVER plays for our sympathy, but gives a closed performance.  It's easy to overact, it's hard to play still and close to the vest, and Pacino chooses the more difficult path.  We also feel for him because we can sense Michael acts this way because it's the only way he feels he can run things. If he ever came out of his detachment, he'd have to admit he was a failure and was being immoral(which he does in Part III).  A masterpiece.

The family even put forth a lawsuit without viewing the film. What you must know is that Stone is not trying to bring Nixon down any further than he did himself. He is trying to tell his story, not only in historical terms, but in cinematic terms. Anyone who does not understand this will not give the picture a chance and will miss its greatness and power. There is even a warning regarding events depicted before it starts. Some scenes are composites, some created for dramatic purposes. Remember, this is a MOVIE. An important one to see, nonetheless.We do see all facets of Nixon in incredible fashion. Quick cuts, tons of stock-like footage, changes in time and narrative very similar to CITIZEN KANE, just a mind-boggling lot of great acting and powerful moments. This is Stone's strength, as he showed in JFK. We even get to see Nixon as a child on the farm in Whittier, CA. We see that this man WAS a self-made man, coming from a dirt-poor family and strict upbringing. He had a painful childhood, losing brothers to sickness, and he took full advantage as anyone would. His evolution from bright young idealist to grumpy (and he was grumpy) flawed politician is amazing, especially because of Anthony Hopkins portrayal. At first, you may seem uncomfortable, for this is not an impersonation. It is a characterization that grows on you as the film progresses.Stone gives the man a chance, contradictory to what many people have said about the film. He even appeared before Congress, where he was confronted by current politicians who do feel the film is accurate enough to be considered an historical document. There are a lot of painful moments, but they are there because this man was an unbelievably difficult person. There are also great triumphs such as China. Stone allows us to decide the makeup of Nixon. It is based on so many different personal accounts and documents, as well as possible folklore. Its a great film, exhausting. He could have been one of the great men in history, but it did end in disgrace.Be sure to watch all the way through the credits, while Stone gives a narration of events after Nixon's presidency, during actual footage of his funeral.

He takes it to Bryan Singer, a director whom he collaborated with in Singer's first film PUBLIC ACCESS.  Singer says that police lineups never have five super-criminals, they have the criminal and four people who share a resemblance.  Then he thinks about it and says, wait a minute, under what circumstance would they be put in a line-up?The result, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is an enjoyable, twisty, thriller which is fun even as it entangles you in a complex plot, and then pulls the rug out with one more twist.  Curiously, I guessed that twist, then dismissed it out of hand, and then was proven right!  It did not stop me from enjoying it. It wasn't the best movie of that year (it was tied for #8 on my top ten with THE UNDERNEATH; ahead of it were LEAVING LAS VEGAS, NIXON, DEAD MAN WALKING, SMOKE, LE CONFESSIONAL, TWELVE MONKEYS, and THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY; behind it were ONCE WERE WARRIORS and SAFE), but it was the most fun.  This had a lot of comparisons to RESERVOIR DOGS, but whereas that excellent film was an ironic take on old heist films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS plays it straight.Everything comes together perfectly here; direction, writing (which assumes the audience is smart), music (which avoids most cliches when it comes to thrillers), colors, and yes, acting.  All of it is top-notch, with of course special kudos going out to Kevin Spacey.  Without ever indicating, he creates a thoroughly believable cripple, plus he is a master storyteller, plus he's convincing both when he's defiant and when he's scared, or both, and when he's...but I should stop there.

But when Transformers The Movie was released in 1986, when I was 11, the movie scared the hell out of me. But so did Superman and Star Wars, which was exactly its intention.As when Batman came to the big screen in 1989, the filmmakers took something old and made it new again.  In the case of the Transformers, the movie was dark, loud, and very adult considering the fact that it springs from what was another silly fad the children of the 80's latched onto.I don't know how people older and younger than I will perceive it, but the film is Shakespearean in its beauty. The 1980's soundtrack works surprisingly well, even now, unlike other 80's attempts, like, say Heavy Metal.The movie picks up in 2005, or about 20 years after the cartoon supposedly took place. Young Spike is now older and has a child of his own, and all the Autobots and Decepticons are back, with some new faces. In the opening moments, Unicron (Orson Welles), destroyer of worlds, eats a planet of peace-loving people (supposdely robots, but still eerily reminiscent of our Earth populi), killing millions. Decepticons don't just plot against the Autobots-- they murder them in cold blood (er, oil?)This is the equivalent of the X-Files movie getting made, and Cigarette Smoking Man getting to use dirty words. It is a true expansion to the big screen, an intelligent version of the TV show, made not to pander to their audience, but to elevate it.This movie is impossible to find in the States, but if you ever watched the TV show, it will bring you to a new level.

Rose is breaking out of her supposedly constricted life. It's propaganda. It makes it appear that the freedoms we have now are exactly what we need in order to escape from the restriction of prejudices and ignorance. Rose tied herself into the ever-growing strait-jacket of modern political myths. But in order to glorify those myths Cameron had to denigrate our past and all that it stood for, making its adherents look like chauvinistic fools. The person I know who liked Titanic the most liked it for that reason - she wanted to escape from her own life and envied Rose. But such people always stop there. They live in their fantasies and never stop to investigate why they feel their lives must be escaped from.)Another note about the samurai he fights is that it continued to suddenly disappear. Lowry initially didn't know what he was fighting, for one. There really is no definitive enemy to fight. We are boxing shadows. It is a system which has no heart or kill point. That's part of the frustration, particularly for those who can't think abstractly. Most of them lash out at the media. They can't locate who they're fighting, and so they accept the lies.Listen to the opening interview on the television. The terrorists are refusing to play the game. The assumption is that they are simply jealous because someone else is winning the game. Why play at all? Any hope of that is over though. The 60s was the last gasp of opposition and it got swallowed up. Now the nostalgia for protest is a marketing tool. Consumption is a replacement for thought. When you feel angst you go shopping. We've been convinced that our anxiety is caused by something other than what it really is. Commercials are not about self-gratification, but self-doubt.I read an interview with Gilliam in which he said the reason he could no longer live in America is that there was an unwillingness to think about anything. In the end, you are fighting the conditioning you have received from your entire culture, in essence, fighting yourself and struggling to regain control of your own mind. Parallels between Lowry seeing his own face and Skywalker seeing the same in Return of the Jedi are illuminating.The point that Gilliam makes in the end is that the enemy is ubiquitous yet intangible. Lowry wanted to run from it, go far away, never realizing that you can't escape. We still think in terms of a locus of power. But Gilliam, throughout the last part of the film, continually crushed our naive hopes that somehow we can act out the fantasy that many of us may have, to get away, find the girl of our dreams and live in a trailer in a beautiful setting.Because we have no fear of physical control, we assume that we are free. Some Americans still believe in the myth of rugged individualism. The system is built on lies and that's what Gilliam was showing. It's a State of mind. You can't escape. The only place that you can be free is in your head. He got away from us, as they say at the end. That's really the only hope we have left.On a lighter note, I derive so much glee from watching Lowry's mother walk around with a boot on her head.

They rarely have any.  It does not focus on any of the latter, but instead, tries to wrap it it all into a cohesive whole.  No go.  This is a very ambitious undertaking by the filmmakers, but it seems like they could not or would not let loose.  How can you really recreate Studio 54 unless you shoot inside the actual club ? (it still stands in New York)  I also feel that Miramax was afraid of backlash and box-office so they set strict productional values.  No real big stars, and, most importantly, no representatives of the world famous celebrities who attended 54 on a steady basis.We do see some of the obvious in and outs of the club, like the drug-swapping at the bars, and the guidelines for getting in at the infamous velvet ropes that kept so many people out.  We never get a real sense that we are back in that period.  I would recommend seeing the current documentaries on the club being shown on cable TV.  The film is so short, the documentaries are longer and much more entertaining.Mike Myers gives a half-decent performance, but never-mind the fact that Steve Rubell's partner in the club is nowhere to be found.  And the director makes a half-hearted stab at taking us into the highly private basement where all the stars hung out.  Myers' lines seem forced and I'm sure people who were close to the real Rubell were gnawing their teeth.  What could've been an important statement about the me-decade and its excesses is wasted.
