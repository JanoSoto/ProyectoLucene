TIME Magazine even included it on their list of the 100 Best English-Language Novels written between 1923 and 2005. The novel itself can be enjoyed on many fronts. If nothing else, it's a fascinating premise What WOULD a bunch of young boys do if stranded somewhere with no adults around, no rules, no laws, no structure or discipline and left to their own devices? The fact it also happens to rich as an allegory on human nature and societal structure is just the icing on top. Golding himself summed up his intent rather simply by stating it's ... about the problem of evil and the problem of how people are to live together in society. That basic concept is put front and center in director Peter Brook's film adaptation and relayed with power despite some obvious technical issues that arise.An airplane full of young British schoolboys - ranging from about 6 years old to early teens - crashes somewhere on an uninhabited island. Ralph (James Aubrey), the son of a Navy commander who thinks the paternal figure he idolizes will soon come find them, stumbles upon the chubby, insecure, bespectacled, talkative Piggy (Hugh Edwards) first and the two make their way down the beach, discovering more of their schoolmates as they go. Along the beach come a second and smaller group of slightly older boys, led by Jack (Tom Chapin). Things begin harmlessly enough, with the kids essentially viewing the experience as some extended camping trip. They play games, laugh, play pranks, gather fruit, start a fire and build a shelter from branches as they await rescue. Using a majority rules vote to establish a new leader in Ralph, the group set down a few basic ground rules at the outset to maintain order, like using a conch shell as a platform to speak without interruption and keeping a fire going at the island's highest peak so a passing aircraft may see it, but things quickly go to hell.Once one of the boys claims to see a snake-like shape-shifting beast stirring among the bushes at night (which later turns into a mythical sea beast), a seed of superstition and paranoia encroaches on the new society and things escalate from there. Jack and his group deem themselves the hunters, sharpen spears, paint their faces, dress in animal rags, leave pig heads on stakes as an offering to their perceived new God and quickly descend into a life of violent tribal savagery, while Ralph loses his power and his numbers once his rival proves he can provide better and has no issue using deadly force as a means to silence those who oppose the new way. After having swayed the majority of others over to his side, Jack and his few remaining allies realize their own lives are in grave danger.Filmed in 1961 in Puerto Rico, this low budget production had numerous technical issues that needed tended to before it could finally be released in 1963. The major problem was the audio, most of which was not actually recorded on location due to various natural noises the filmmakers really couldn't do anything about. As a result, most of the dialogue was dubbed in later and, sadly, they didn't do a very good job of it. Audio levels really seem off throughout. Many seem to have issues with the casting of inexperienced boys instead of trained child actors in all of the roles, which results in some wooden, amateurish and \/ or stilted dialogue readings. Personally it didn't bother me all that much, but it will some viewers. If you can ignore the above issues, this is a visually splendid film that's atmospherically photographed on beautiful locations and it manages to generate a great desolate feel apart from the 'civilized' world.Most importantly of all, Brook actually does the source novel justice. Very little of importance was left out and the director conveys exactly what the book is trying to say. That's especially impressive considering he had to narrow down around 60 hours (!) of total filmed footage to just 90 minutes for the theatrical release. Supposedly a 100-minute version was initially released to Cannes, but I don't believe that cut has ever been made commercially available.

It also maintains it's comical humor while you cry and cradle your pet pug. I can't explain how beautiful it is while you still say haha and wow omg.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 November 2014","score":"","review":" In this second instalment in the dollars trilogy, we follow bounty killers Monco (Clint Eastwood)and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Initially, both men work separately picking up reasonable bounties for reasonably notorious criminals. However, when both men discover that there is a $10,000 reward for capturing notorious outlaw El Indio, they both set to work in tracking him down.I think the Dollars Trilogy is probably the only Trilogy I've ever watched where the films have gradually improved as they've progressed. The first film was reasonably good, this second film was very good and the third film was outstanding. I suspect that Leone must have studied each film and looked at ways that he can further improve each of the sequels. I'm clearly not alone in this thought process as the IMDb ratings (at the time of writing this review) for each of the films are 8.1, 8.3 and 9.0 respectively. There isn't a weak film in this trilogy, but as mentioned it's noticeable that there was a steady improvement in quality.For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark qualities that we've come to expect; tension, humour, a good story, interesting characters. I've always felt Leone has his tongue firmly in his cheek when he makes these films and it's clear that he had a lot of fun making this trilogy. Leone also seemed to have a gift for creating tension from the most simple of situations; take the scene where a gang member blows Mortimer's match out and Mortimer just stands there staring at this man. I was sat there thinking what was he going to do? What's going to happen? This scene probably only lasted for a minute and was created out of nothing, but it's effectiveness was remarkable. Likewise, the same could be said for the early scene with Eastwood with the playing cards - a remarkably tense and well executed scene.The part of the film that I was most looking forward to was the inevitable showdown between Eastwood and Van Cleef. I honestly believe that these two guys were amongst the coolest leading men of that era. What made this showdown so brilliant is that it was tense when it needed to be tense and was hysterical when it needed to be funny.

Initially, both men work separately picking up reasonable bounties for reasonably notorious criminals. However, when both men discover that there is a $10,000 reward for capturing notorious outlaw El Indio, they both set to work in tracking him down.I think the Dollars Trilogy is probably the only Trilogy I've ever watched where the films have gradually improved as they've progressed. The first film was reasonably good, this second film was very good and the third film was outstanding. I suspect that Leone must have studied each film and looked at ways that he can further improve each of the sequels. I'm clearly not alone in this thought process as the IMDb ratings (at the time of writing this review) for each of the films are 8.1, 8.3 and 9.0 respectively. There isn't a weak film in this trilogy, but as mentioned it's noticeable that there was a steady improvement in quality.For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark qualities that we've come to expect; tension, humour, a good story, interesting characters. I've always felt Leone has his tongue firmly in his cheek when he makes these films and it's clear that he had a lot of fun making this trilogy. Leone also seemed to have a gift for creating tension from the most simple of situations; take the scene where a gang member blows Mortimer's match out and Mortimer just stands there staring at this man. I was sat there thinking what was he going to do? What's going to happen? This scene probably only lasted for a minute and was created out of nothing, but it's effectiveness was remarkable. Likewise, the same could be said for the early scene with Eastwood with the playing cards - a remarkably tense and well executed scene.The part of the film that I was most looking forward to was the inevitable showdown between Eastwood and Van Cleef. I honestly believe that these two guys were amongst the coolest leading men of that era. What made this showdown so brilliant is that it was tense when it needed to be tense and was hysterical when it needed to be funny.

It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1995 and was like the first fully computer animated movie, while nowadays almost all the animated movies we see are computer animated rather than the old days when they were digitally animated drawings. I miss those old cartoon movies. Anyway, Toy Story is definitely a classic movie. Kids today can watch the movie, and it probably won't seem like an old movie to them. They have made other Toy Story movies which seemed to earn more money than the first one. But, I will talk about why the first one is the best. The first one introduced us to the Toys in Toy Story, yeah they add some new toys in the later films, but this one is the first real introduction. It's always nice to remember the introduction of the characters we are familiar with in later films. Also, the later films seem to be more about adventures from the toys we know together in a group, in this movie it was mostly just the adventure of our favorite toys, Woody and Buzz. We see Woody's reaction to having Buzz as the new popular toy. Also, this one seems more about survival for Woody and Buzz, while in the other Toy Story movies it seems like it's less about survival and more about getting back to where they belong. Another reason to like this movie, from what I know while Pizza Planet is mentioned in other Pixar movies, this is the only one which shows them inside a Pizza Planet. I've always thought, that restaurant would be really cool to be at if it were a real restaurant. About Pizza Planet, I remember way back in 6th Grade in the scene when we see the Pizza Planet pick-up truck at the gas station and we hear the guys in it ask for directions to Pizza Planet, somebody in the classroom asked the teacher why would somebody who worked at Pizza Planet be asking for directions on how to get there? My teacher didn't know how to answer. In this movie we get to know Andy's original house and his neighborhood. We get to know the villain in this movie, Sid. The villains in the other movies are like the Chicken Man, Stinky Pete, and Lotso and some of his gang. I'm sure most of us could agree that our favorite bad guy in these Toy Story movies is Sid and let me give a few reasons to why we might like him the best. For one, Sid is Andy's next door neighbor. What's weird is the movie doesn't give any indication of whether Andy and Sid knew each other, so it can leave us with that question. Sid isn't like a bad guy, I mean he plays in the movie as a bad guy, but he seems to play a character we could imagine his age. I mean about a 13 year old boy who wears a T Shirt with a skeleton. He's aggressive and he likes torturing toys as a hobby of his, obviously not aware that the toys are alive. He likes explosives and stuff, and has a dark atmosphere in his room, along with mostly keeping his room locked. So, he's a G rated version of an early adolescent character who is supposed to be like the bad guy and he doesn't swear, talk about alcohol, drugs, or sex. He isn't like a criminal, just a scary kid with a dark atmosphere who likes to be the bad guy to toys he doesn't realize are alive. The climax in this movie also seems more exciting than the climax in the other movies. One thing we can find hard to believe, is how the toys have all these wacky adventures, doing things that somebody could easily notice, and nobody seems to be aware that the Toys are alive. Toy Story doesn't seem like The Velveteen Rabbit, but more like Toys who are having their own adventures, a little like The Lego Movie, where the Toys seem more alive than they seem like Toys. This is a great movie, I'd give a 9\/10.

Meanwhile, Kline is saved from a night time ghetto incident by a tow truck driver (Danny Glover). Glover is no longer married, and Kline introduced him to a single Black woman (Alfrie Woodard). And, Kline helps move Glover's sister and two children into a better neighborhood than their previous gang-infested one. While Kline's son (Jeremy Sisto) is adjusting well to life, Glover's nephew (Patrick Malone) isn't, and is torn to go back to the gangbangers he once knew.All of the stories work , except on -- movie director Steve Martin.

He doesn't make a good first impression with secretary Kirsten Arnesen (Lee Remick). He eventually breaks her down and gets her to drinking. They marry and have a daughter named Debbie. Their jobs and their lives suffer under the addiction. After several attempts, he finally get better with Alcoholics Anonymous and Jim Hungerford (Jack Klugman) as his sponsor.My biggest problem with this movie is that I can't imagine why Kirsten relents and goes with Joe. It kind of sticks out and makes no sense. I'm not necessarily saying Lee Remick is too pretty for Jack Lemmon.
