[{"date":"23 December 2009","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Men In Black ended with Agent Jay mind wiping Agent Kay so that he can live a happy life or so we think. Men In Black II opens up with Jay chasing down an alien that lives in the NYC subway system and is a threat to the city. Jay has in time become one of their best agents but he has a habit of mind wiping his partners because they don't want to be MIB agents anymore so he's kind of tainted in that respect. During all of this an alien named Serleena arrives on Earth Serleena is played to the hilt by Laura Flynn Boyle and she hams it up nicely her sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville could use a little bit of work but he does OK. Serleena arrives and takes over MIB HQ it seems she's looking for a object of great power that KAy hid long ago under the protection of a guardian. Jay Escapes and he realizes MIB's only chance is to bring Kay back to the fold restore his memories and defeat Serleena. When Tommy Lee Jones makes his appearance the movie picks up considerably and it's very nicely understood that while Smith is the maniacal energy and the comedic relief Tommy Lee Jone simply is the heart of Men In Black while Rip Torn as Zed is the Soul. Without these three actors Men In BLack would not be as good there is something about the dynamic here that the three bring to the table. My only complaint as with the first was that it was too short Sonnifeld is a gifted directer and Knows how to make great movies with the MIB series he really should think about lengthen the running time so the movie does not feel as rushed and we can enjoy it as it unfolds.

When the Sandman was sent into the firey furnace near the end, you just KNEW he was going to climb back out, in this case, flaming on fire, but his hair wasn't burned, and it would be the first thing to flame away. Come on, Hollywood or canadawood, quit with all the malarkey of this sort, make the fighting scenes realistic and believable, and don't make us have to adjust our brains with this kind of un-killable warriors. It was a great film, but the intense fighting scenes just push beyond the limit.
