Whether it's a thriller like North by North west where the viewer is taken half-way across America, or an espionage movie that treks across Europe in Foreign correspondent or just simply a plain case of mistaken identity in the The wrong man, Hitchcock was always able to find the right tempo, atmosphere and chemistry for his films. It's hard to imagine a simple stage play being transformed into a Hollywood box office hit, because with the exception of one or two short scenes, the entire movie takes place in a confined environment of a ground floor flat in Maida Vale London. Not surprisingly Hitchcock does not disappoint and is able to pull it off by producing a highly entertaining film!It is a well written story with great dialog between the characters, but it is the tension, the incidental music and the camera angles that make this movie compelling viewing. Needless to say the movie was blessed with some big box office draws of the day in Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and Ray Milland, with fine support from Hollywood based Brits character actors Anthony Dawson and John Williams. I'm not suggesting that Dial M for murder is Hitchcocks best movie, the best of course is a subjective viewpoint, but the lead character here Tony Wendice who plays the villain, a washed up former tennis pro is probably Hitchcocks most diabolical killer. I say that because he is not deranged or violent but cold and calculating, he is able to personify evil in an easy-going and matter of fact way. For example not only does he really enjoy blackmailing Swan but takes great pleasure in detailing the way he plans to kill his wife and get away with it. In addition you can see that he is proud of the meticulous planning and ruthless dedication that has gone into this. What's fascinating about the character is that when he gets home and finds Swan dead rather than panic he does some quick thinking, takes advantage of that and is able to stitch up his wife Margot for Swans killing. With his marital woes now behind him (his wife going to the gallows) and the only person who knows other wise unable to talk you can see that he is pretty pleased with himself. Things couldn't have worked out any better for him and he even starts spend the cash he did not have to pay Swan. Even at the very end, a very nonchalant Wendice just casually pores himself a drink as if he had just come in from work. Watching him is like watching water of a ducks back, you'll simply never see Ray Milland in a better role!Robert Cummings plays crime writer Mark Halladay who is Margots lover, and Grace Kelly plays Margot who comes across as mostly bewildered the whole time, even before the attempt on here life. John Williams plays police inspector Hubbard who at first one just dismisses as an eccentric dunce. Initially you underestimate him and wonder if he is in over his head, but as his role becomes more prominent you realize that he is smarter than he looks and is way ahead of Wendice as things unravel. Lot's of twists and turns as you would expect from a Hitchcock movie and despite some obvious legal problems with the crowns case against Margot, it's well worth a watch! (Note even if the initial crime had been successful and Swan had been able to extricate himself from the flat the police might have been puzzled why there was no wet footprints, grass or mud on the carpet bearing in mind that the garden was wet and that was the way he had meant to have gained access?)

A cinematic icon today, Wong Kar-wai didn't get international recognition till 1997 at Cannes (for 'Happy Together'), and the majority of US art-house viewers didn't notice him till 'In the Mood for Love' (2000). Now ironically since the huge blowout and exhaustion of Wong's epic '2046' (2004), a summing-up of his 60's nostalgia themes and characters, he seems to have reached a point of exhaustion, and his English-language romance 'Blueberry Nights' (2007) was a critical failure. Re-editing 'Ashes of Time' looks like another example of treading water, but it's still great to have it; many have still not seen it, and any films as visually magnificent as Wong's are best seen in theaters. It's also fortunate that all his films can be seen on decent DVD's now with readable subtitles for English speakers, instead of the weird earlier Hong Kong prints with flickering titles in Chinese and peculiar English that disappeared before you could read them. 'Ashes of Time Redux' has the best English subtitles yet both visually and linguistically.According to Wong, 'Ashes of Time' negatives weren't in very good shape, and a search of various versions led him to a huge warehouse somewhere near San Francisco's Chinatown that contained the entire history of Hong Kong movies. He and his team put together various versions, adding a bit to what we already know, digitally cleaning up the images and enhancing some of the color and doing things with the sound, adding a new score and re-arrangement by Wu Tong including cello solos by Yo Yo Ma.Experts will have to comb over all this to explain the differences. The cinematographer Christopher Doyle, who was present at the press screening of the film at the NYFF, doesn't like the enhancing of the color and neither do I. A lot of yellows and oranges are heightened, greenish-turquoise touches are set in, and many of the desert sand landscapes seem to have lost their surface detail. This seems unnecessary and even obtrusive, but it's not enough to spoil the experience. Other images simply look more pristine and clear. Wong wouldn't say what specific changes were made in the editing. He preferred to talk about how he adapted Louis Cha's novel and how this film relates to his oeuvre. Both for him and for Doyle it was an essential milestone. The cast features the late Leslie Cheung, both Tony Leungs (Chiu Wai and Ka Fai) and Jacky Cheung, and has Maggie Cheung as The Woman and martial arts film great Brigitte Lin as Murong Yin and Murong Yang, the sister and brother. Lin, now retired, was responsible for the revival of the genre and is central to this film, though Maggie Cheung is its diva, its dream lover.Cha's novel is a complicated 4-volume wuxia genre epic, very popular but little known or appreciated in the West. Wong studied it carefully (and made a parody of it called 'Eagle-Shooting Heroes') but then though he says this film unlike all his others had a fixed plan (and thus made for a story full of fatalism), he threw away the story and just took a couple of the main characters and made up another simpler story imagining what the characters' lives were like when they were young. A simpler story. Well. The story has always seemed completely incomprehensible to me but after re-watching 'Redux' it obviously is nonetheless a coherent narrative; it's just intricate and, above all, cyclical. It ends as it begins, with the narrator looking into the camera and repeating the opening lines.'Ashes of Time' was shot in the desert. Doyle had never done that. The film was long delayed and the shoot was difficult. Doyle knew nothing about martial arts or 'Jianghu,' the parallel universe of martial arts fiction. He was under extreme constraints, having very little artificial light. Nonetheless he produced some of the most beautiful sequences in modern film, because he's a great cinematographer, perhaps the greatest of recent decades, as Wong Kar-Wai is one of the defining contemporary cinematic geniuses.Wong is notable for his meditative and arresting voice-overs. Here is a sample People say that if a sword cuts fast enough, the blood spurting out will emit a sound like a sigh. Who would have guessed that the first time I heard that sound it would be my own blood? You gained an egg, but lost a finger. Was it worth it? There are aphorisms or bits of advice Fooling a woman is never as easy as you think. The film is anchored and structured by the Chinese calendar the Chinese almanac is divided into 24 solar terms and the narrative moves forward selectively through these terms, which contain weather descriptions (naturally) and advice as to what is propitious or unlucky and in what regions and directions. There is also a great deal about oblivion and forgetfulness (which are linked with wine, including a magic wine that eliminates memory). The desert and drinking are visual touchstones throughout as are pairs, opposites, and contrasts; and there is cross-dressing and perhaps bisexual love. The images are full of flickering light. The sword fights, which do not begin until more than half way into the film, are without the acrobatic feats actually performed or digitally faked as in current martial arts films, though they are elaborately staged by the action choreographer Sammo Hung. They are a symphony of fast cutting, closeups, blurs, and slow motion (which Wong intended particularly to express the fatigue of the Blind Swordsman in the film).

Rodan, Godzilla King of the Monsters, Ghidorah The Three Headed Monster, and Frankenstein Conquers The World to name a few. However, in my opinion, King Kong vs Godzilla is both the greatest Godzilla film and Toho Film ever made.A submarine is doing an expedition in the arctic. It is destroyed by Godzilla who emerges from a Glacier. Godzilla then heads towards Japan, according to a television reporter acting like a fish that is heading back to its old waters. A man in charge of a television channel, sends a group to Farrow Island hoping to bring back a supposed monster that lives on the Island. He does this to gain better publicity. On the island a giant octopus attacks the group and a native tribe but a giant monster, King Kong, comes and dispatches the octopus. Kong is then taken on a raft back to Japan. Kong fights Godzilla and is forced to retreat mainly due to the fact that Godzilla's radioactive fire is to much for him. Japan then uses Electrical cords to surround Japan, it works on Godzilla but not with Kong. Kong is put to sleep and taken to Mount Fuji to fight Godzilla with the hope that they will both die.Godzilla and King Kong fighting against each other. A perfect idea. At the time this film was made though, both monsters were not legendary film monsters. King Kong was a bigger star and had been around since 1933. This was the first Godzilla film to be in color and it started Godzilla on a stretch where he would become the most popular movie monster. This film helped develop Godzilla, it was his first film in a while and it helped start him off on the stretch that I just mentioned.This is not the same King Kong from the original classic King Kong. If it was then Godzilla could merely step on him. This is Toho's version of King Kong. Not a bad version I must say. Kong gets in a lot of good action, fighting a giant Octopus, smashing through electrical cords, and of course going against Godzilla. In this film electricity makes Kong stronger, an interesting ability to make him stand a better chance against Godzilla. I always liked Godzilla better than King Kong but Kong is a great monster also.Godzilla is great in this film. Not only is he in color for the first time but he also once again is a villain. Awesome! The Godzilla in this film looks really good, probably third behind the Godzilla from Godzilla King of the Monsters and Godzilla vs Mothra. Godzilla is bulky has an evil looking head and just looks like nothing can stop him. Except electricity apparently. That is one thing that always confused me, Electricity did not stop him at all in Godzilla King of the Monsters so why did it work this time? Probably because in this film they state that Godzilla has the brain the size of a cherry. I think this is the only film where Godzilla's brain size is talked about, but I do not think that Godzilla's intelligence is the same in every film.The story is pretty easy to follow. Mr Sato needs a giant monster to give him better ratings since he is sick of Godzilla. So an expedition to Farrow Island Island takes place to find another monster. I guess you can always find Kong on Islands in the middle of nowhere. Once Kong is taken back to Japan the film gets really interesting as there are two giant monsters around. Also the whole tension leading up to the battle between the two is great.Acting is awesome. Not much more to add. I would just like to say that I love how on the boat one of Sato's men calls Sato a 'dumb bell and states how King Kong could kill us all and you wouldn't care. Publicity is all you want! It is funny because it is true.The monster fight at the end is awesome. Really is the best monster fight I have seen. Both get their moments, but I really can see that clearly Godzilla has the upper hand. So I guess Kong is portrayed more as the hero than Godzilla is. BUt that is OK, I love when Godzilla is a villain.One thing I would like to add. THere has been a long running rumor that the ending is different in the Japanese Version than in the American Version. All I can say without giving too much away is that you should check where bits of information you heard comes from and not believe everything you hear.Also, I really hope they do not re make this film. I know that sounds bad, but I have seen so many re makes as failures and this is the type of film that could be re made. Just let this film stand by itself.A great film. Godzilla against King Kong.

October 1993 went in to the capital of Somalia to catch two of his Lieutenants. Aidid was to some extent guilty in making the civilian population starve and an estimation of around 300.000 people died from this.The Achilleus' heel of the American forces was, that they would leave none of their fellow soldiers behind. The turning point in the mission is then when a Black Hawk goes down. This makes it necessary to secure the crash site and bring all dead and wounded back and in this process the American forces looses the initiative and speed and makes it possible for Aidid to counter-attack. The fighting escalates further and about 18 hours later 18 American soldiers are dead. This incident apparently made Defence Minister Les Aspin resign and also made USA more cautious about getting into conflicts abroad - at least until the Bush Doctrine.Journalist Mark Bowden decided to write a book about the incident and later Ridley Scott decided to make a movie based on the book. When you have read the book you will notice that a lot of odd and sometimes funny anecdotes from it are present in the movie. Although the book as well as the movie tells the story from the American soldiers viewpoint the book tries to show how the fighting affects the civilians in Mogadishu. I think that this is an important aspect when you are trying to show what war is about. War is not just about the (American) soldier &#150; war is also about the enemy. Who is he? Does he care for those who are killed? Does he feel that he protects something of importance? Does he act aggressively because he has been manipulated or maybe even because he feels that he has something to revenge? Without his perspective any description of a war will be superficial and this is in fact one of my critical claims. Both from an ethical point of view but I also think that the story itself suffers from this one-sided perspective. I think that the movie feels quite lengthy and that it wouldn't necessary be so if we had gotten some of stories from the other side. I think that there are always moral dilemmas involved when the decision is to go to war (as well as when you don't) but that this movie doesn't deal with them. Why not? Moral dilemmas are interesting and showing them isn't the same as not being loyal towards those soldiers who went in and put their life in danger. Why not show some of the more controversial stories from the book? If you spot an enemy trying to advance towards you, who at the same time holds a woman in front of him as a shield - what do you do? A Delta Force Ranger knows what he will do - and can you accept that? And of course this example isn't just a product of my imagination. A large part of the movie consists of American soldiers trying to secure the Black Hawks who has crashed. We also follow the American convoy around in Mogadishu, for a long period, who has a difficult time finding the crash sites. These parts of the movie could, in my opinion, have been minimized to create more progression in the story.There are several highlights though, like Mike Durant, Shughart and Gordon defending themselves against a big crowd.Still this movie doesn't get a top rating from me as it didn't contain enough contrasts; too much repetitious fighting.Regards Simon ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"3 October 2008","score":"","review":" In an attempt to deliver a serious blow to the warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid, American special forces on the 3.

October 1993 went in to the capital of Somalia to catch two of his Lieutenants. Aidid was to some extent guilty in making the civilian population starve and an estimation of around 300.000 people died from this.The Achilleus' heel of the American forces was, that they would leave none of their fellow soldiers behind. The turning point in the mission is then when a Black Hawk goes down. This makes it necessary to secure the crash site and bring all dead and wounded back and in this process the American forces looses the initiative and speed and makes it possible for Aidid to counter-attack. The fighting escalates further and about 18 hours later 18 American soldiers are dead. This incident apparently made Defence Minister Les Aspin resign and also made USA more cautious about getting into conflicts abroad - at least until the Bush Doctrine.Journalist Mark Bowden decided to write a book about the incident and later Ridley Scott decided to make a movie based on the book. When you have read the book you will notice that a lot of odd and sometimes funny anecdotes from it are present in the movie. Although the book as well as the movie tells the story from the American soldiers viewpoint the book tries to show how the fighting affects the civilians in Mogadishu. I think that this is an important aspect when you are trying to show what war is about. War is not just about the (American) soldier &#150; war is also about the enemy. Who is he? Does he care for those who are killed? Does he feel that he protects something of importance? Does he act aggressively because he has been manipulated or maybe even because he feels that he has something to revenge?

The procrastination was partly due to the mixed response to Argento and this film from people I trust on film- half of them said this was brilliant and unforgettable, the other half said it was comically dated and completely ludicrous.To be completely honest... Both sides are 100% right. Suspiria features some brilliantly stylized horror set-pieces, but the special effects are never convincing. One could argue that making the 'blood' such a bright shade of red was a legitimate aesthetic choice which contributed to the color scheme of the film itself, which is dominated by bright red, but the rest of the effects just aren't all that great. As far as I'm concerned though, as a lifelong Doctor Who fan... Suspiria looks like it was made yesterday to me. I can completely understand how so many people think this is dated, and even a quick glance at the preposterous excuse for a plot here- girl goes to dance school which turns out to be populated by witches and lots of very, very bad things happen, supports the claims of ridiculousness aimed at the film. In addition, Suspiria features bad voice acting from certain characters (none of the physical performances are really bad, but the dubbing definitely is in some cases), some absolutely ludicrous dialogue, and probably a good number of plot holes I couldn't bother with spotting.This brings us to the question of what defines a 'flaw'? Is Suspiria significantly flawed because it features a preposterous plot and dated special effects which don't really match many films of its time? Is it inherently flawed because some of the dialogue is absolute cack? Or is a film only significantly flawed when it doesn't achieve its goals? Does Clerks really suffer from Kevin Smith's unimaginative, plain, ultra low-budget and completely standard approach to filming it? Similarly, is Suspiria really in any way dependent on any of the things it's criticized for? No, it really isn't. The plot in Suspiria is nothing more than glue holding together several lengthy, stylized, and frankly bloody brilliant horror set-pieces, and does it really matter if it's preposterous? Do I care if it makes any sense for this bizarre gathering of witches to suddenly become a dance school? Do I care why these murders are happening? Hell no. Absolutely not. Why should anyone care? It's absurd to even bother! Suspiria is all about the mood, the atmosphere, the music, the stunningly-filmed and set up murders, the simply awesome use of color, the nightmarish quality of the whole thing, Argento's wonderful compositions and use of space, let alone the eerie feel of the whole thing which results from the printing of the film using the old three-strip Technicolor process. You can't even call it a triumph of style over substance because there's no substance for the style to triumph over. Sure, you can bang on about conceptual metaphors and what not but really it's just a bunch of nonsense isn't it? Surely Argento knew this?That doesn't really change much when discussing this film, though, because it's really quite frankly brilliant. It's an outstandingly successful, stunning bit of film-making, with great care taken in composing shots, in lighting scenes, in the use of color, in the construction and setting up of the big kills. If you define a flaw as a hindrance in reaching the goals a film has then Suspiria simply has none. It's a nightmare on film for just over 90 minutes. Sure, it's a bit too fun to really reflect a nightmare, but it's just as involving, as creepy, as spooky, as bizarre as one.

I don't know if it's just my expecting something a bit on the overpraised, crappy side or what, but Suspiria simply owned my soul for 90 minutes. It's the most gloriously entertaining, involving, and fun movie I've seen in a while. I didn't take my eyes off the screen for one second and sat, mouth agape, staring at this preposterously amazing film. Suspiria hits all the right spots, avoids all the pitfalls one normally expects from something like this, and boasts some of the best goddamn horror scenes I've ever seen. The scene with the man in the square manages to create such tension, such abnormal tension out of basically nothing and the payoff is greater than one could ever imagine.

'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)' was among Newman's earliest big-name roles, and one that catapulted this humble, affable performer into Hollywood's A-list. The film, the latest in a series of Tennessee Williams play adaptations, was directed by Richard Brooks, even though Elia Kazan who had also helmed the screen versions of 'A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)' and 'Baby Doll (1956)' had directed the stage version. It was theatre adaptations like this that proved Hollywood's greatest opportunity to produce artistic pictures, and, accordingly, such films were usually shot in black-and-white. However, with the casting of Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the wise decision was made to film in colour, to capitalise on those vibrant violet and blue eyes, respectively. Though I hear that considerable changes were made to Williams' original play (much to the author's chagrin), Richard Brooks' film has the intimate, claustrophobic feel of a stage production.Former footballer Brick Pollitt (Newman), in the year since the death of his close friend and teammate, has quit his job and descended into bouts of vicious drinking. He and wife Maggie (Taylor), to whom he has become cold, have arrived at the vast estate of his father Big Daddy (Burt Ives), who is suspected to have contracted terminal cancer. While Big Daddy tries to come to terms with his situation, Maggie tries to restore her failing and childless marriage, lest she lose the old man's considerable fortune to Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his gruesome family of no-neck monsters. Throughout a hot, humid evening that culminates in a cleansing torrent of rain, the family of characters attempt to reconcile their differences, convinced that they can no longer simply run from their problems. The story ends on an ambiguous note &#150; not quite tragic, but hardly optimistic either &#150; as Brick decides to simply accept the lies and mendacity in his life, even if it means making nightly love to a woman for whom he feels nothing but an obligation.Fortunately, given the film's intimate focus on characters and relationships, the cast is very well-chosen. Elizabeth Taylor, then a Hollywood star for well over a decade, brings a conflicted beauty to the screen, the persona of a woman trying desperately to retain an image of grace and happiness, and yet not quite pulling it off. She also sports one of those annoying Southern accents that, had she been anybody other than Elizabeth Taylor, would have driven me up the wall. Paul Newman spends the first half of the film reserved and isolated, but, through his interactions with Big Daddy, finally begins to open up about what he's really feeling. A subplot concerning Brick's sexuality was among the themes excised from Williams' original play to appease the Production Code, but the subtext nonetheless simmers slightly beneath the surface, all the better for not deliberately drawing attention to itself. All in all, 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)' is a film that's impossible not to admire, even if I can't honestly confess to having loved it.

It was theatre adaptations like this that proved Hollywood's greatest opportunity to produce artistic pictures, and, accordingly, such films were usually shot in black-and-white. However, with the casting of Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the wise decision was made to film in colour, to capitalise on those vibrant violet and blue eyes, respectively. Though I hear that considerable changes were made to Williams' original play (much to the author's chagrin), Richard Brooks' film has the intimate, claustrophobic feel of a stage production.Former footballer Brick Pollitt (Newman), in the year since the death of his close friend and teammate, has quit his job and descended into bouts of vicious drinking. He and wife Maggie (Taylor), to whom he has become cold, have arrived at the vast estate of his father Big Daddy (Burt Ives), who is suspected to have contracted terminal cancer. While Big Daddy tries to come to terms with his situation, Maggie tries to restore her failing and childless marriage, lest she lose the old man's considerable fortune to Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his gruesome family of no-neck monsters. Throughout a hot, humid evening that culminates in a cleansing torrent of rain, the family of characters attempt to reconcile their differences, convinced that they can no longer simply run from their problems. The story ends on an ambiguous note &#150; not quite tragic, but hardly optimistic either &#150; as Brick decides to simply accept the lies and mendacity in his life, even if it means making nightly love to a woman for whom he feels nothing but an obligation.Fortunately, given the film's intimate focus on characters and relationships, the cast is very well-chosen. Elizabeth Taylor, then a Hollywood star for well over a decade, brings a conflicted beauty to the screen, the persona of a woman trying desperately to retain an image of grace and happiness, and yet not quite pulling it off. She also sports one of those annoying Southern accents that, had she been anybody other than Elizabeth Taylor, would have driven me up the wall. Paul Newman spends the first half of the film reserved and isolated, but, through his interactions with Big Daddy, finally begins to open up about what he's really feeling. A subplot concerning Brick's sexuality was among the themes excised from Williams' original play to appease the Production Code, but the subtext nonetheless simmers slightly beneath the surface, all the better for not deliberately drawing attention to itself. All in all, 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)' is a film that's impossible not to admire, even if I can't honestly confess to having loved it.

The yachting scenes and the wonderful score by John Barry really added to the film. Sometimes I seemed to be watching 'Thunderball', the score of 'Masquerade' was so obviously from the same composer.I really liked Meg Tilly, whom I had never heard of before this film. She was the perfect choice for the role of Olivia, the less-than-stunning heiress swept away by the gorgeous sailor Tim ( Rob Lowe). I never realized Meg is 4 years older than Rob until I consulted their entries in the IMDb. Here she plays a naive heiress several years younger than her love interest very convincingly.The film alludes to the death of Olivia's mother in an explosion on her yacht. Since this death would greatly benefit Gateworth, he likely had a hand in it. Cop Mike mentions how many propane explosions occur each year, so this hints that he engineered this 'accident'. However this point is never cleared up in the film.Rob Lowe and Meg Tilly really had chemistry together. Olivia had sort of drifted through her life in a fog because facing reality was too painful. Tim really cut through her defenses and awakened her to the joys of true love. Olivia immediately became pregnant and was overjoyed to have a child with her new love. Olivia's life became a joy instead of a long nightmare. What kept getting in the way was the idiotic plot. Apparently the cop Mike had worked the sailboat racing circuit before joining the police force in Hampton Shores. He met Tim and Olivia's stepfather Gateworth and hatched a scheme to murder Olivia and loot her estate.I could never figure out where the two outsiders expected to share in the loot from the estate. If Olivia died childless and unmarried, Gateworth stood to inherit the entire estate as the sole surviving heir. Why was accomplice Tim supposed to marry Olivia and muddy the chances of inheriting the estate? If Gateworth did in fact inherit the whole estate, why would he have shared the proceeds with his two accomplices? If these two suddenly became rich after the estate was settled, it would increase suspicion of foul play. Gateworth would already be under suspicion as the person to profit most from the untimely death of Olivia.The cop Mike should have deduced that he would wind up dead after contributing to the death of Olivia. His knowledge of the circumstances of Olivia's death would always be a threat to Gateworth. Tim would also be a threat to the continued enjoyment of Gateworth's new riches. After the marriage of Tim and Olivia and the death of Gateworth, Mike would have no claim on the estate. He would have to blackmail Tim with planted evidence that Tim had murdered Gateworth's girlfriend to shut her up. If evidence of Tim's guilt suddenly appeared long after the girlfriend's death, questions about why evidence had been withheld would arise.Tim's mistress Brooke Morrison, wife of his employer, was blackmailed into providing an alibi for Tim when Gateworth wound up dead in Olivia's bedroom. Brooke testified to the police that Tim had been in her bed when Gateworth was shot in Olivia's bedroom. The film fails to consider the problem Tim would have appearing in Brooke's bedroom fresh from his recent love scene with Olivia. To put it delicately, Brooke's nose would have to be numb not to detect the scents of recent lovemaking on her boy-toy Tim.Strangely Brooke's husband never found out what his wife had been up to or else didn't care. He continued to employ Tim on his racing boat and sought his services in future racing events.The film finale killed off almost everyone to tie off the plot threads. I could never understand how rogue cop Mike could hope to murder Olivia right under the nose of the Chief Of Police and escape the consequences.It seemed that the writers ran out of ideas on how to write the climax. I suppose the viewer was supposed to just be swept along with the flow and not think too hard about the logic of the plot.
