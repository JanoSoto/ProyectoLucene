Whereas You Only Live Twice was the usual daft and deft mix of humour and action in a nonsensical plot, Diamonds Are Forever had deft action in a nonsensical and messy plot with a touch of tired and camp cynicism.Bond is enrolled by the British government to find who is cornering the world's diamond-smuggling market and put a stop to it. It's an un-engaging battle for the viewer though, Stout Bond looks for the most part uninterested in putting in the actual work for the money for which he was enticed back. There's also probably the worst scene in any of his Bond films when he's escaping from Tectronics in a Moon buggy &#x96; to someone brought up on Banana Splits it's awful and almost slapstick. The portrayal of younger women purely as sex objects is even more pronounced than before&#x85;although I confess I personally I preferred to look at Jill St. John than Connery throughout.

God help us if the world's safety depended on the quality of cassette tape playback!Overall it's not as witty or memorable as we'd grown accustomed to, but watchable probably even for a non-completist. The next film in the series continued as The Saint, but to this day I still think the unshaken and unstirred Connery would have made a better Bond in the '70's, especially if he could've lost a lot of pounds and got a better wig. Never mind, there are the 6 movies of varying excellence and consistent entertainment from 1962-1971 to revel in every few years.

Everything else about this film is just plain horrible.The film starts off like never before with 3 minutes of black screen. Instantly, we are bored. That's never a good sign. Next, we see pictures of sunset for 2 minutes. Seriously, why show this??? Then we have another 10-12 minute sequence with apes that only needed to be 2 or 3 minutes long where they discover the Monolith and start fighting each other like retards. We even see evolution occurring but all this could've been reduced to 2 or 3 minutes like I said. The boredom doesn't stop here. In fact, I call that the most entertaining part of this film. I'm sorry! Then we see a ship orbiting around space for minutes. It gets so tiring and boring that you wanna wish you were either dead. Then, we see a guy falling asleep. Poor actor probably fell asleep watching the first 20 minutes of the film. The film takes 26 minutes for a bit of awfully boring dialogue to happen. In 26 minutes, all that happened was some ape s discovered the Mononlith. Did that have to be 26 minutes long???? The biggest problem with the film is the atrocious pacing and the absolute lack of any entertainment. I'm not asking for epic battles or explosions. I'm just asking for things to speed up. And don't anybody say Watch the film in the dark with full sound I DID THAT AND IT DID NOT WORK! The second story of the film was awfully boring it nearly put me to sleep. In that, all that happens was 6 astronauts discover the Monolith. That's 55 minutes into the film. AARGH! Remember the film '12 Angry Men' which is only situated in a jury room. By now, we love the characters and are fully immersed into the story. Here, nothing happens. In one scene, we see a waitress even walk so slowly. What was Kubrick thinking??? 12 years from now, he goes on to make the Shining which is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. When a film is terribly slow in pacing, so is the tone to the movie. Don't anybody say Its supposed to be an experience, not an entertainment because that is just the dumbest thing I've heard. It was a heck of a boring experience, even to people who have insomnia. Remember Back to the Future, its a Sci-Fi\/adventure. That film is fast paced and is extremely entertaining and a great experience. What makes this an exception for not being entertaining???The 2 1\/2 hour dull film could've easily been cut down into 1 hour. You'd think that when Kubrick makes a film almost twice as long as it needs to be, that he'd at least develop the characters. NOOOOOO! He did not at all. The characters are as dull as a brick wall. In fact, I'd rather stare at a brick wall for 2 1\/2 hours than watch this film. There's nothing wrong with a quiet film if its paced well, but this just isn't. Awful story, terrible characters and boring dialogue along with elongated scenes which serve hardly any purpose to the movie makes this one of the worst experiences of all time.

When he was left behind one Christmas nearly over two decades ago his story headlined all over the world and became an international phenomenon. His feats of fighting the Wet Bandits while his family was away in Paris can never be forgotten nor will it ever be too old to watch every Christmas Season.HOME ALONE written by the Late John Hughes is one his best work. Whilst Hughes has always a tendency to write along the line of mostly family entertainment, my personal favorites of his work is HOME ALONE and MIRCALE ON 34th STREET. Directed by Chris Columbus who a decade later brings to us HARRY POTTER is the man that requires absolute recognition in this instance. Chris Columbus always knew how to aggressively reach out to the audience and tamper with our emotions through his work. If you have watched his work in BICENTENIAL MAN you will know exactly what he is capable of. HOME ALONE a comedy for the family is a movie of many sorts. Its entertainment to the younger audience, its thrills and booby traps for the younger teen, its Christmas magic to all the children and its family ties for the mature audience. Kudos Mr. Chris Columbus before Hogwarts you still knew your work right sir.The 10 year old marvel that is Macaulay Culkin has been recognized for his role in HOME ALONE acquiring awards back in the 90s. He is absolutely brilliant in his performance. Culkin who was 10 years when he played the role did the magic in making this a movie a hit with the guidance of Chris Columbus. Culkin is confident, different, and lovable and is just as naughty as an 8 year old will be attracting all the attention and creating the most atrocious of troubles. Before the late John Hughes wrote DENNIS THE MENACE he wrote HOME ALONE and now it's clear where the thinking began for him. The supporting cast is good. However when you watch the movie you will not see anyone but Culkin at his best since his 10 year old talent is beyond all of the other support cast combined. In no way is this critic intending that the rest of the cast is bad, its simply that Culkin for his age is THE BEST THERE HAS BEEN.Media states that Culkin is the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple. Unarguably this would seem so. Whilst Shirley Temple has been from a time long ago it is with certainty that no child actor shot to international stardom over night like Culkin did.Tis the season to be jolly and there is only a handful of Christmas Classics out there with nostalgic value for the viewer that hunts for classics during this time of the year. Reaching out especially to the expats of the UAE who are far away from family during this time, this movie may help to bring in some warmth to your living rooms with some fond memories of the Christmas of yesterday.If you are on the hunt for Christmas classics to watch with your family and friends this season, chalk up this title on your list and hop over to the nearest video store.

The Trueman Show is one example of many other films sending out this warning.Truman Burbank represents the people while the actors (bystanders, friends and family of Truman) on the ground are the gatekeepers of the illuminate who are hiding in the hollowed out moon. The audience may be alien intelligence (who in the movie some of which get on the set (inside Trumans world) to interact with Truman, could be representative of aliens interacting with us) watching us from another dimension or from above, or might just be us the viewers looking into the looking glass (TV).His name says a lot and is like an overview of the whole meaning, Trueman is true + man = truth for man, while Burbank is Bur (prickly\/thorn) + Bank (money\/power) = corrupt elite or illuminate, therefore Truman v Burbank = right v wrong or good v bad etc.I believe the warning could be to inform the people who are prepared to see it for what it really is, that if we can overcome our fear of living we can set ourselves free from the illusion of our controlled reality and if we don't then we remain in bondage, as shown in the movie where Trueman overcomes his fear of the water (water represents the essence of all life, so he fears life or living) to eventually escape at the edge of his prison. Truman's fear of the water was constructed through events orchestrated by his controllers and is a mirror of how humanity has been left in a state of fear through controlled and manipulated staged events.There is a screen shot of a view that appears to be a pyramid and is one of many examples of illuminate symboling used in the movie.

But after hearing such hype, especially from my favourite critic who often loves what I love, I thought the time had come to record them when they came on the TV. My plans were ceased from an orange man called Dale Winton, a program that my family would rather record than Lord of the Rings (they wouldn't even give it the time of day!) But fast-forward about 7 months later and there they are again on Channel 4, Christmas day, and so I stick the record on.I didn't really know what to expect, but after hearing all the unbelievable hype I was excited to take a trip to Middle Earth and see what was so amazing about it all! But unfortunately I came out watching a fun, if not occasionally dragging, swords and sorcery epic that did lose me on more than a couple of occasions. I enjoyed it enough to go and watch the other two, but was simply not blown away like everyone else. I enjoyed the opening narration about the origins of the ring and its wearer etc. I thought that it effectively transported the audience into another world which also had some rather breath-taking imagery. I also enjoyed the time at the shire where there was some very likable characters and surprising humour that did not go a miss! It was just once the hooded horsemen were introduced that things began to drag, and unsurprisingly in a three hour film. It began to lose me with its unnecessary complexity such as the encounter with Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee, that scene confused me and some of the dialogue also had me puzzled thanks to their wizardy speak such as, We must retire to Mount Maduro etc. I also felt that some characters and plot lines were unnecessary and detracted from the story, such as the elf woman who wasn't in it for long and didn't really have a lot to do, other than send a tidal wave to the hooded horsemen. The plot also went off on a tangent such as when they enterted the realm of the witch. I didn't feel that there was any need for it and it just slowed down the pace that was beginning to pick up.It also takes quite a long time for the fellowship to actually be created, as it's from there that the adventure really begins and its at least mid-way through, if not over. However, there were a lot of good points about the film. The characters were very strong and I found myself forming attachments to them (not a euphemism). When one of them bit the dust, I did actually care! There are relationships which we can all relate to and it does help to drive the story along and make you care about their quest. There was also some breath-taking cinematography and scenery which really showed off the epic scope of the film. Some of the directing was also very impressive and memorable such as the sweeping shot over Christopher Lee's place.However, in a film with a three hour running time I did expect a little more action than I got! I also didn't think the action was that well handled, with shots being taken too close and too many quick cuts which make it hard to see what's going on. I'd say that there's more thrills and fun to be had in King Kong and that the action sequences in that are better handled. Hopefully we can see Peter Jackson mature as a director as the series goes on like Christopher Nolan did.In the end, it's down to personal preference. I'm not entirely into magic and fantasy, but the characters and underlying simple narrative makes the film relatable and very watchable.

That it's superb and sublime and witty and ingeniously funny cannot be emphasized enough. The film has a great script, direction and cinematography (Rudolph Maté).While the entire cast shines, Lombard and Benny are absolutely stellar. It's a shame that Benny did not get matched with similarly genius director post-TBONTB is a real shame because with the right director and script he could have gone on to be a film star. Perhaps the fact that much of the story takes place in a theatre and then on the many theatre troupe's stages as they foil the Nazis throughout the story, nurtured Benny's own natural unique comedic talent in a way that his other films could not.And then there's Lombard. Carole Lombard was and still is imho, the best comedic actor other than Chaplin-Lloyd-Keaton-Dressler-Stanwyck. I don't find that the comedians of today can even come close to the previously mentioned comedians. Lombard and Benny play the most perfectly narcissistic clever power-couple seen anywhere in film or real life.

First movie introduced the hero to the audience. Second gave Rambo a chance to fight his worst fear and a opportunity to start a new life . The third movie should give Rambo either a tragic ending or find a way for him to exist in the world that doesn't need him anymore. Unfortunately this movie doesn't want to end his story here , but rather is just another installment in the franchise. There's an interesting idea at the beginning of the movie that maybe Rambo is destined to be who he is ( the story about the rock). Unfortunately the movie doesn't follow that idea and we don't reach any conclusion. Only a lot of action .The movie is basically Rambo 2  with small changes . Instead of Vietnam we have Afghanistan and Trautman is the hostage. The movie is predictable , but that's not the biggest problem . The movie suffers from too many action and too little story. Peter MacDonald's direction has a bubble gum quality compared to Ted Kotcheff and George Cosmatos. The movie doesn't always flow well and it times it makes the movie feel a bit clumsy. It is very simplistic, straightforward, brutal , comic-book action-packed with extreme violence. Still there's a lot of memorable dialogues I really liked that helps to lighten up the movie a bit.First movie was very realistic . Second had some unrealistic moments (Vietnam hostages in 1985 , Rambo unaffected too much by the torture) , but still was a believable action movie. This movie leaves no question about it; Rambo is an one man army. We have such ridiculous moments as Rambo taking on a helicopter with his bow & arrow and Rambo taking on with a tank the main villain in a helicopter. Also John Rambo does prize fighting to earn his keep in a Buddhist commune and plays goat football .For the first time in three films we actually get to see Trautman partake in some action. We can also see Kurtwood Smith (unforgettable Clarence Bodicker from Robocop) in a small role. Too bad such a good actor is wasted here . Why couldn't he have a bigger part ? Rambo hasn't change much. He's disillusioned with the world, hiding from himself and his country and he still has his steely determination. With its $63m budget, this was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release. The movie features some beautiful scenery and its obvious that they spared no expenses on the locations.

The red army planting mines and booby traps disguised as toys to blow off the limbs of children and the Soviets use of chemical weapons is true.Rambo III did less well at the box office because of the political detention between East and West. The cold war headed towards the end. At the time this movie was being filmed, the Russians were in fact invading Afghanistan just as depicted in this movie, however about 4 weeks prior to this movie's premiere, the Russians had in fact withdrawn from Afghanistan and were no longer at war with that country. This turn of events had hurt the movie's box office returns, since the idea of the Russians being the primary villains in this movie was no longer really believable.After September 11th of 2001 this movie might be confusing for some people.

And from Oliver Stone no less.But what a cast! Penn, Nolte, Lopez, Boothe, Voight, Thorton, Phoenix, Danes...etc.I expected a little more intensity from Penn. he seemed to weak and easily manipulated. But his character seem to demanded him to be that way.Nolte as the dirty old man who is and has been basically raping his step-daughter Lopez, was OK. He seemed very thin back in 1997. maybe the role demanded it.Lopez as the femme fatale per say did OK also. Her scenes of making love with Penn and Nolte just did not seemed convincing at all. But still, she held her own with the these two heavyweights of the cinema.Boothe was once again doing yet another part as a sheriff. But I felt he was wasted as usual. he really didn't have much to do but just get killed.Phoenix as T.N.T was a treat. he seemed to remind me of a young Ray Liotta. Intense and psychotic at the same time. All for the love of a woman. He was one of the memorable characters of the this unusual film.Danes was wasted as his girl who really wants to leave this hick town and leave with Penn. Thus inciting Phoenix's jealousy big-time.Thorton for me stole the picture along with Phoenix. Thorton's 'Darrell' embodied the true redneck nightmare one can encounter in these small one-horse towns. He's scary and funny at the same time. A real complete treat of casting here for Billy Bob.Voight, I did not recognize at 1st! that's how much i was paying attention. But it's because I was focusing on the other characters in the film. Voight's blind guy was somewhat memorable once you know it's him under that makeup.Julie Hargerty's waitress was OK but her scenes were way to short to appreciate them, plus she was somewhat exemplified a little exaggerating as a typical redneck town waitress.Laurie Metcalf fared a little better as the Bus Station Clerk giving Penn a hard time for not having the exact amount to buy a ticket for the bus. But again her role was brief. good but brief.Abraham Benrubi as a biker\/thief was also way too brief and was also wasted. he could have been an interesting character, but was blown away way to quickly. And by a little old lady no less! I would have had him cast as the Russian enforcer who shows up at the town looking for Penn. But alas I'm not the writer of the film. Shame. But the two stars that I have no idea why they were in the movie at all because their roles were so inconsequential, that any bit-extra actor could have done their brief cameos!! I'm talking about the great Bo Hopkins and the lovely Liv Tyler. Hopkins cameo just didn't make sense to me. He's in the diner when Penn encounters Phoenix and Danes for the 1st time, but he is just a simple customer in the background!? What the hell? I believe he didn't even have any lines!? I think Stone could have put him to better use as the sheriff of the town. And had Boothe as the mafia guy that Penn owed money to.But the worst cameo was Tyler's blink or you'll miss her as the customer behind Penn at the bus station wanting to buy a ticket and Metcalf's clerk is so distraught over Penn's emotional outburst, that she closes for the day leaving Tyler like what the hell?

The movie, which starts with a chase on foot and ends with a chase on foot, serves its purpose by giving us what it was meant to give  undiluted excitement. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that it could well be one of the best films I've ever seen.Detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo (Roy Scheider) are in the Narcotics Department of the NYPD. While having a drink at a bar one night, they see a man Salvatore 'Sal' Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife surrounded by drug peddlers and Doyle is at once interested in tailing the new guy. They start following him day and night for a week and wiretap his house until they overhear him tell somebody that a shipment, presumably drugs, was due to arrive in a week's time. Doyle and Russo continue to tail Boca for more clues when they find that he often meets up with Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), an accomplice in the smuggling of drugs inside the country. The film's plot revolves around these stories  Boca's and Charnier's attempts to smuggle the drugs inside the country, Doyle's and Russo's tabs on the two and the involvement of a famous French actor Henri Devereaux (Frederic de Pasquale), who is responsible for smuggling the drugs inside the country.You can't help but be rapt while watching the tensely atmospheric, intertwined stories seamlessly edited by Gerald B. Greenberg. Director William Friedkin pays great attention to the little details (like Doyle's trivial hat on the backseat) and the finer nuances (the periodic pauses while chasing suspects by the two officers) of the characters, while keeping an eye on the dense plot. That's a skill which few directors can boast of. The film is full of chase sequences, both by foot and car, which are supremely well-directed. The screenplay, based on the non-fiction book by the same name by Robin Moore, is neatly adapted by Ernest Tidyman. The dialog sounds authentic, often speaking volumes about the characters by saying so little. Tidyman does a magnificent job of pulling off a story where people observe each other more than they talk.One of the film's greatest strengths is its cast, wherein every actor turns in a convincing performance. Scheider and Rey are fantastic in their respective roles but the star of the film is Hackman, who gives one of the best performances ever, with his striking screen presence and raspy voice, Hackman is precisely how Doyle's supposed to be  a pugnacious and imperious Narcotics detective. It's one of those performances where you can't imagine anyone else playing Doyle except Hackman. He lives the character.How can anyone talk about The French Connection without mentioning the spectacular car-chase through the streets of Brooklyn where Doyle chases an elevated train to deter a hit-man from escaping? The chase has got it all and it's all too real. You have Doyle crashing his car into a sidewall, getting his rear-view mirror blown fall by a truck and almost hitting a woman with a baby stroller. At the end of it, you see a limping Doyle pretty shaken by everything that transpired. Friedkin handles the chase with an uncanny eye for realism, like Doyle's limping and his confusion when things do not occur the way he expected them to. The sequence will leave you breathless.I can't seem to find anything wrong with The French Connection. It's an exuberant thriller, positively quivering with wicked excitement, which richly deserves the highest of praise.

Twelve years later, we see that there are some experiments involving animal cruelty taking place. After the scientist is done with the corpses of the dogs\/cats, they are dumped down into the sewer. That little baby alligator from years ago seems to have been feeding on the corpses, and has grown into a massive gargantuan beast. The alligator begins killing workers and other people who enter the sewer, and when the limbs start showing up at the harbour, our main character David (a detective) investigates and finds the monster. After a few attempts by the police\/military to flush out the alligator, David comes up with a plan to end it's treachery once and for all.I am not a huge fan of these type of films normally, the giant animal attacks type of horror flicks. But 'Alligator' does it right for the most part! The alligator looks very realistic in the way the film-makers set it up, and the scenes in which the alligator stalks the city streets were done effectively as well. Where 'Alligator fails, like most of these type of films, is that it starts focusing on a scientific plot and explanation rather than focusing on the actual beast. We get the story in this one of the company who is dumping the animal corpses into the sewer, which results in the alligator growing so big. The film moves at such a slow pace during some of those scenes. And then we get the plot- line of the police\/government officials who are covering up the hormonal experiments using dogs. It's just not something that grabs my interest to be honest.The acting is decent in 'Alligator'. Robert Forster and Robin Riker play our two main characters who spark a relationship, and they do a good job. Everyone else is pretty much filler for the movie. Some scenes are really effective like some of the sewer scenes when the alligator chases some of the characters. There is also the part where the alligator actually kills a little child, which was effective but sort of unnecessary. We also get some decent gore, mostly just arms\/legs being torn off by the alligator. I'd recommend this to fans of these movies for sure.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 December 2012","score":"","review":" A giant alligator terrorizes the city of Chicago in this animal-terror flick.

After a few attempts by the police\/military to flush out the alligator, David comes up with a plan to end it's treachery once and for all.I am not a huge fan of these type of films normally, the giant animal attacks type of horror flicks. But 'Alligator' does it right for the most part! The alligator looks very realistic in the way the film-makers set it up, and the scenes in which the alligator stalks the city streets were done effectively as well. Where 'Alligator fails, like most of these type of films, is that it starts focusing on a scientific plot and explanation rather than focusing on the actual beast. We get the story in this one of the company who is dumping the animal corpses into the sewer, which results in the alligator growing so big. The film moves at such a slow pace during some of those scenes. And then we get the plot- line of the police\/government officials who are covering up the hormonal experiments using dogs. It's just not something that grabs my interest to be honest.The acting is decent in 'Alligator'. Robert Forster and Robin Riker play our two main characters who spark a relationship, and they do a good job. Everyone else is pretty much filler for the movie. Some scenes are really effective like some of the sewer scenes when the alligator chases some of the characters. There is also the part where the alligator actually kills a little child, which was effective but sort of unnecessary. We also get some decent gore, mostly just arms\/legs being torn off by the alligator. I'd recommend this to fans of these movies for sure.6\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"30 December 2012","score":"","review":" A giant alligator terrorizes the city of Chicago in this animal-terror flick. It all begins when a young girl's pet alligator is flushed down the toilet by her father, we see it make it's way down to the sewer. Twelve years later, we see that there are some experiments involving animal cruelty taking place. After the scientist is done with the corpses of the dogs\/cats, they are dumped down into the sewer.

No Universal Studios monsters, radioactive insects or invading aliens could bother me, I had seen it all. This film absolutely destroyed my suave, calm self-assurance. I was overwhelmed by the excoriated, enucleated farmer against the bedroom wall and unnerved by murderous birds pecking through a door. I completely unraveled as Tippi Hedren walked up the stairs to investigate flapping wings and had to get up and leave the theater from stark terror (much to my utter humiliation after I settled down). I had nightmares about this movie for at least a couple of years and 50 years later think about it when I'm near crows or gulls. It looks a little dated today but any film that stays with you for for a lifetime is special. I read the original DuMaurier short story a few years ago - very creepy. I could see how a horror master like Hitchcock could have come up with this idea.

Back then the net was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web.I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clichés, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well.There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role.I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.
