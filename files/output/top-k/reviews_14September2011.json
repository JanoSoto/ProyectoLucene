[{"date":"14 September 2011","score":"","review":" Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon are involved in a high school Election in this 1999 satire. Witherspoon plays Tracy, a perky, smart, goody-two-shoes who is running -- unopposed -- for class president. Broderick plays a high school teacher, Jim McAllister, whose best friend's life was trashed when it was exposed that he slept with Tracy. McAllister doesn't like her. At all. He encourages the star football player, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to oppose Tracy in the race, and then Paul's gay sister (Jessica Campbell) decides to run as well. McAllister's involvement and obsession with bringing Tracy down soon begins to affect his life negatively as interest in her did his friend.Good satire, with excellent performances by Broderick and Witherspoon, both in his\/her own way deeply unlikable. Witherspoon's Tracy does have moments that show us that her overachievement has cost her friends, and she's a lonely girl for it. Broderick is very good as well as a slime of a teacher, who goes too far in his plot. The rest of the characters are stereotypical.There isn't a particular moral to the story except that the best candidate doesn't always win the election; it's the one who plays the game and is the biggest sleaze. And the movie couldn't have been timed better - we were faced the next year with the hanging chad debacle. Where was Matthew Broderick when we needed him.
