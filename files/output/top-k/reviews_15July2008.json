It succeeds where others have failed because of the energy put into a film that is mostly dialog. Parker Posey shines as Jackie-O, the mentally troubled sister of Josh Hamilton and Freddy Prinze Jr. Tori Spelling, whose only other film I have enjoyed was Trick, did a great job of playing Jackie-O's doormat.The movie is at its strongest when Parker bares her sadness, always hidden beneath sarcasm. A classic movie of family dysfunction without playing out the same old tired roles. This family is anything but a typical dysfunctional family and though they all appear to be nuts, part of you wants to run out and find a family just like them, because looking past all of the sarcasm and insults, you sense and feel the love.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see strong acting.

Maybe better than anything else he's done. He sighs and wheezes like an old man on the brink of retirement. He's embarrassed in front of the troop when he has to sneak his glasses out of his blouse in order to read the sentiment on his brand-new silver watch and chain. To Captain Brittles. From C Troop. Lest We Forget. Sniff.Wayne had given strong performances before but they were always in the same range -- the steadfast guy who would never change his principles. In this character role of Nathan Brittles, about to retire from the Cavalry in 1878, he does some stunning acting. (John Ford, who abused him like a stepchild, got extraordinary things out of Wayne.) I mean, think of it! In the early 1960s, Wayne was reluctant to admit he'd been operated on for lung cancer because it might be considered a sign of weakness by his fans. Here, Ford has him hobbling along, his footsteps those of an old and tired man. Wayne never matched the scenes in which he accepted the brand-new silver watch and chain from C Troop, or the one in which he chewed out Lieutenants Cohill and Pinell for allowing yourselves to be CHIVVIED into a bout at FISTICUFFS while taps still sounds over a brave man's grave. (He interrupts himself to spit out some chawing tobacco.) The plot isn't really important. In the wake of Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn, the Indians of various tribes get together with the intention of starting a really big war, and Wayne breaks it up. The Cheyenne are the instigators but I don't know why. There were only seven Cheyenne at the Battle of the Little Big Horn and, as an anthropologist, I came to know one or two of their descendants, who remained proud and a little embittered. The sentiment shouldn't be unfamiliar to anyone who feels nostalgic for a lost cause, from the Civil War to Vietnam.That has nothing to do with the movie though. Aside from the brand-new silver watch and chain scene, be sure to catch the bar room brawl with Victor McLaglin. It's done for comic effect, with McLaglin taking a break during the fist fight to reminisce with the bartender, Ahh, Connie, the old days are gone forever. I don't know that the community we see in this movie -- with its ritual dances, it's conversations between the living and the dead, its military protocol -- could have been so effectively conveyed if Ford hadn't actually believed in it.Yet any solidary community has its dark side. Those who do not conform are shunned. (Ask the Old Order Amish.) The next movie Ford made, Rio Grande, Sergeant Tyree, Ben Johnson, a favorite of Ford's, made some innocuous comment to someone else at the dinner table and Ford demanded to know what he'd said -- I'm talking to you, Stupid. Johnson, like most normal people, stood up and told Ford what he could do, then walked out. The next day Ford apologized but Johnson didn't work for Ford for another fifteen years or so. Every solidary community must have must have unquestioned leadership.None of those contretemps affect the movie, which is one of the best Westerns ever made. My God, those vistas.

Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer wants to find out why of course, a reaction similar to the one Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe had in Murder My Sweet when something exactly like this occurred. But Powell didn't have not only the local police, but the FBI snooping around in this apparent street crime.Meeker's motives are not noble, he smells a big pay day.

He runs into a variety of movie bad guys like Paul Richards, Strother Martin, Jack Lambert, Paul Stewart, and Albert Dekker. Some are helpful, some are not. The bodies start to pile up and what this is all about is a McGuffin to end all McGuffins. Let's just say the police in the person of Wesley Addy and the FBI had very good reason to tell Meeker to butt out. In fact his very entrance into the case causes a lot of fatalities.This turned out to be Ralph Meeker's career role. Perhaps had Meeker come along earlier or had gotten better breaks he could have had a great career in noir type films. As it was he became a respected character actor.

Although this movie reminded me of both, but in here it's one hell of an original one where the rhythm is highly hot, the backgrounds are nice, the atmosphere is like everything  masterfully light. (Joe Pesci) is on the top of his game, how he looked so charismatic more than ever, and of course his comic performance is flawless. All the rest presented their best despite that they all weren't as good as the lead. Maybe the music wasn't creative inasmuch as traditional which mostly done nothing but overstating the performance, the ending was that unconvincingly fast, and of course the matter of being disgusting.. However it's the late 1990s ! So after a cinematic history of hunting a duffel with important papers, diamonds, money, or anything polite.. It's about time to chase heads (god knows what could be chased after, but I can wonder !). (Robert De Niro) is being spoofed in here at the scene of (Are You Talking to Me ?), and nothing is odd since (Pesci) spoofed himself in here also where he was smashing any payphone like his character in (JFK &#x96; 1992). The only thing to complain about that when (Joe Pesci) is talking about retirement afterwards from being a gangster he really did it yet as an actor in real life ! As he didn't make something during the next 11 years except (Gone Fishin' - 1997), (Lethal Weapon 4 - 1998), and a guest appearance in one very short scene at (The Good Shepherd - 2006) directed by (De Niro). The smartest of it all  (Pesci) throws the nasty blabber mother-in-law out of the van over the mountain, it's classical as it seemed like everyman's dream of any unstoppable nagger comes insanely true !, seeing (George Hamilton) without his famous hair at the closing credits, another dream comes true. The musical nightmare of the heads singing a sick version of Mr. Sandman, that summarizes the whole beauty of it. True that in movies' stories nothing is totally original though here the plot definitely was, along with the wonderful condition that this movie leaves you with.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"15 July 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It is strange how an established cinematic genre can suddenly disappear within a few years of reaching a pinnacle of excellence. The late fifties and early sixties saw three of the greatest epics ever made, Ben-Hur, Spartacus and El Cid. Within about five years of this last, however, the genre was to all intents and purposes dead.Something similar happened to the musical which, along with the war film and the Western, was a casualty of the cinema revolution of the seventies and virtually disappeared by the end of the decade. Yet the opening years of that same decade had seen two very fine examples of the genre, Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret.Cabaret is set in the Berlin of 1931, the dying days of the Weimar Republic. Brian Roberts, a young Cambridge academic living in Germany, falls in love with Sally Bowles, an American-born cabaret singer from the city's Kit Kat Club. The two begin an affair, but this does not prevent Sally from sharing her sexual favours more widely. To complicate matters further, Brian is bisexual, and he and Sally share a lover, the aristocrat Max von Heune. There is also a sub-plot about Sally's friend Natalia, a wealthy Jewish heiress, and her lover Fritz. Fritz is also Jewish, but in the growing climate of anti-Semitism has concealed this fact, passing himself off as a Gentile.The traditional Broadway or Hollywood musical, such as Fiddler on the Roof or The Sound of Music, observed a convention whereby the main characters would periodically burst into song, regardless of whether or not they were in a situation where people would normally sing in real life. The purpose of these songs, of course, was to convey the characters' feelings in musical form. Cabaret departs from this convention. Four of the main characters, Brian, Max, Natalia and Fritz, do not sing at all, and all the songs, with one exception, are heard during performances at the Kit Kat Club.Most of the songs are performed either by Sally or by the sinister, camp, leering figure of the Emcee, the club's Master of Ceremonies. Although the title song Come to the Cabaret is a cheerful one with a live and be happy message, the others, like Mein Lieber Herr and Money, Money, Money, sound cynical and jaded. The jazz-based score is much less lyrical than that of most Hollywood musicals. Some German cabarets from this period specialised in political satire, often with a left-wing slant, but the atmosphere in the Kit Kat Club, with its scantily-dressed female performers and transvestite male ones, is not one of ideological commitment but rather sleazy decadence and world-weary cynicism. Contrary to the words of the song, staying alone in your room might not always seem such a bad option by comparison.Earlier musicals such as Showboat and West Side Story had shown that the genre could deal with serious subjects such as racial discrimination and juvenile delinquency. Cabaret deals with an even more serious theme- the rise to power of the Nazis. Nazism is an ever-present theme throughout the film, although in the early scenes the Brownshirts seem like no more than thuggish gangsters. As the film progresses, however, we see how their influence is growing. The management of the Kit Kat Club cynically pander to the national mood by including anti-Semitic sketches in the show; a man who has fallen in love with a gorilla sings If you could see her through my eyes- she wouldn't look Jewish at all!. In the final shot of the film we see, in a mirror, that most of the audience are now wearing Nazi uniforms.A key scene comes when Max and Brian drive out to a country inn. The sunny German countryside comes as a pleasant contrast to the Berlin scenes, most of which are sombre and gloomy in tone. This is where we hear the only song sung outside the club, the Nazi anthem Tomorrow Belongs to Me, musically by far the most lyrical song in the whole film. (The devil here, quite literally, has the best tune). At first the song is sung by a single young man, but soon nearly all the beer garden customers, especially the young, join in. (Only one old man shows his disdain).

Within about five years of this last, however, the genre was to all intents and purposes dead.Something similar happened to the musical which, along with the war film and the Western, was a casualty of the cinema revolution of the seventies and virtually disappeared by the end of the decade. Yet the opening years of that same decade had seen two very fine examples of the genre, Fiddler on the Roof and Cabaret.Cabaret is set in the Berlin of 1931, the dying days of the Weimar Republic. Brian Roberts, a young Cambridge academic living in Germany, falls in love with Sally Bowles, an American-born cabaret singer from the city's Kit Kat Club. The two begin an affair, but this does not prevent Sally from sharing her sexual favours more widely. To complicate matters further, Brian is bisexual, and he and Sally share a lover, the aristocrat Max von Heune. There is also a sub-plot about Sally's friend Natalia, a wealthy Jewish heiress, and her lover Fritz. Fritz is also Jewish, but in the growing climate of anti-Semitism has concealed this fact, passing himself off as a Gentile.The traditional Broadway or Hollywood musical, such as Fiddler on the Roof or The Sound of Music, observed a convention whereby the main characters would periodically burst into song, regardless of whether or not they were in a situation where people would normally sing in real life. The purpose of these songs, of course, was to convey the characters' feelings in musical form. Cabaret departs from this convention. Four of the main characters, Brian, Max, Natalia and Fritz, do not sing at all, and all the songs, with one exception, are heard during performances at the Kit Kat Club.Most of the songs are performed either by Sally or by the sinister, camp, leering figure of the Emcee, the club's Master of Ceremonies. Although the title song Come to the Cabaret is a cheerful one with a live and be happy message, the others, like Mein Lieber Herr and Money, Money, Money, sound cynical and jaded. The jazz-based score is much less lyrical than that of most Hollywood musicals. Some German cabarets from this period specialised in political satire, often with a left-wing slant, but the atmosphere in the Kit Kat Club, with its scantily-dressed female performers and transvestite male ones, is not one of ideological commitment but rather sleazy decadence and world-weary cynicism. Contrary to the words of the song, staying alone in your room might not always seem such a bad option by comparison.Earlier musicals such as Showboat and West Side Story had shown that the genre could deal with serious subjects such as racial discrimination and juvenile delinquency. Cabaret deals with an even more serious theme- the rise to power of the Nazis. Nazism is an ever-present theme throughout the film, although in the early scenes the Brownshirts seem like no more than thuggish gangsters. As the film progresses, however, we see how their influence is growing. The management of the Kit Kat Club cynically pander to the national mood by including anti-Semitic sketches in the show; a man who has fallen in love with a gorilla sings If you could see her through my eyes- she wouldn't look Jewish at all!. In the final shot of the film we see, in a mirror, that most of the audience are now wearing Nazi uniforms.A key scene comes when Max and Brian drive out to a country inn. The sunny German countryside comes as a pleasant contrast to the Berlin scenes, most of which are sombre and gloomy in tone. This is where we hear the only song sung outside the club, the Nazi anthem Tomorrow Belongs to Me, musically by far the most lyrical song in the whole film. (The devil here, quite literally, has the best tune). At first the song is sung by a single young man, but soon nearly all the beer garden customers, especially the young, join in.

Jump forward several years & Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is now a man, a very strong man who quickly shines as a gladiatorial fighter. Conan is taught sword fighting skills & is educated until he escapes & meets up with a female thief named Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) & an archer named Subotai (Gerry Lopez), they alone dare to stand up to the cult of the Snake which is engulfing the entire world. Out for both vengeance & profit the three allies must do battle against an entire army if they are to succeed in their quest...Co-written & directed by John Milius this was the first time that the character of Conan the Barbarian had appeared in a film, created by author Robert Howard during the 30's Conan appeared in various stories & novels & indeed eventually films such as this which I have to say I thought was pretty average & don't really see where all the love for it comes from. There are a few different versions of Conan the Barbarian in circulation at the moment, the short US released version, a longer European cut & a third even longer more complete cut & I will be basing my comments on the international European cut. The script by Milius & Oliver Stone of all people is actually fairly slow going for the first half & it's also rather ponderous & bitty. There are lots of annoying fade dissolves from one scene & one location to another as Conan grows up, becomes a champion fighter, gets educated, wanders around a lot & then meets up with with Valeria & Subotai as a large chunk of time passes with very little dialogue, apart from the narrator virtually none in fact, & the film never stayed in one place long enough for me to get involved with what was going on. The film is obviously very pro war & there's a lot of sentiment in it's battle scenes as it portrays warriors & fighters as the real hero's. Towards the end when Conan gets to fight the evil Snake cult then the film picks up & becomes watchable but even then I felt very detached from it because the lack of dialogue, the lack of character's & a story that seemed quite random. The fantasy elements of the film were a disappointment, in Howards original stories the character of Conan fought all sorts of monsters, creatures & demons while here the fantasy elements are a bit random like Thulsa Doom turning into a Snake for no reason, the daft scene in which spirits try to take Conan away & a giant Snake which Conan kills. I wasn't impressed with what little dialogue there is either, all the old style talk just got silly & it's hard to relate to it & is it just me or does anyone else find names like Valeria, Subotai, Thulsa, Osric, Rexor & Thorgrim silly & just impossible to keep track of who is who?The film looks quite nice & again try to watch it in it's original 2351 widescreen ratio as so much is lost on pan and scan editions. This is actually pretty violent at times with lots of blood, a couple of gory decapitations, sword fights, impalings, slashed throats & the like. The special effects are alright, the giant snake looks alright although the scenes where Thulsa Doom 'straightens' out a live Snake & then uses it as an arrow shot from his bow do look a bit silly & like they belong in a cartoon. The whole medieval look of Conan the Barbarian is well realised with nicely detailed sets, costumes & production design. Imagine Lord of the Rings if you will without any CGI computer effects work & your probably not too far off what Conan the Barbarian looks like.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this is well made with good production values, filmed in Spain & Canada.

It's more a character driven drama rather than than plot driven. The plot may not be exactly original but it's the influence of it on the characters is what 'Unfaithful' is about. The film is very engaging as we witness the psychological effects of the consequences of Connie's decision. Lyne deserves praise for his excellent artistic execution. I loved how he used symbolism (such as metaphors and pathetic fallacies) and shows great attention to detail as is evident in the visuals. The editing is clear cut. Biziou's cinematography is great and Kaczmarek's score sets the tone. Note that during the key moments, when the main characters are conversing, the background music is absent. Richard Gere and Olivier Martinez, though a little too old, do decent jobs. However, it is Diane Lane who gives a career-defining performance. Her sublime portrayal of the incredibly sexy Connie is awesome. She carries the film. It is Diane Lane and Adrian Lyne's film. 'Unfaithful' is a magnificent engaging artistic drama. I don't understand why some were even harsh enough to call it soft-core. Do they even know the definition of soft-core? Others seem to have a problem with why Connie, who had the perfect life, would have an affair. But I feel it necessary to stress that nobody is perfect and therefore the perfect life does not exist. Connie's affair wasn't a planned thing. Who knows why it happened? Perhaps she wanted to feel younger, perhaps she was bored, or perhaps she wanted more from her husband. I don't think it was with the intention to ruin her 'perfect' life. There doesn't have to be a clear reason...as affair's don't necessarily happen for the best reasons.

I don't understand why some were even harsh enough to call it soft-core. Do they even know the definition of soft-core? Others seem to have a problem with why Connie, who had the perfect life, would have an affair. But I feel it necessary to stress that nobody is perfect and therefore the perfect life does not exist. Connie's affair wasn't a planned thing. Who knows why it happened? Perhaps she wanted to feel younger, perhaps she was bored, or perhaps she wanted more from her husband. I don't think it was with the intention to ruin her 'perfect' life. There doesn't have to be a clear reason...as affair's don't necessarily happen for the best reasons.

Not only financially but critically as well. To Sir, With Love, In The Heat of the Night, and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Not even Tom Hanks has had three huge hits in one year.To Sir, With Love is kind of a mid sixties answer to the mid fifties high school film The Blackboard Jungle, which featured Sidney as one of the students, so everything came full circle. He was already pushing 30 when he did The Blackboard Jungle, so he could of easily of played Glenn Ford's role as the teacher. But a movie with a black teacher in the mid fifties was not likely. Even in To Sir, With Love there are a few racial issues addressed.And we can't forget the students. Most of the male actors never went on to anything else of note, except for Michael Des Barres to an extent. On the female side though, we had of course, Lulu, who also sang the theme song. Anyone who has seen recent photos of her taken in the last ten years will probably agree with me that she has gotten extremely more attractive than she did 40 years ago. Then we have the cute as a button Judy Geeson as Pamela, who develops a bit of a crush on Sidney. Judy went on to work pretty steadily in films through the rest of the 60's and into the 70's. Then she kind of faded from view a bit, but did turn up again in a recurring role on the sitcom Mad About You. As well as appearing in the made for TV sequel of To Sir, With Love in 1996 i believe, along with Lulu also returning. Also of note is Suzy Kendall as a fellow teacher at the school. Suzy was only in her early 20's at the time but looked more like she was in her early 30's, so seeing her playing a teacher was odd but believable. Just like Judy, Suzy would work steadily through the rest of the decade and into the 70's before fading from view. Mostly appearing in Italian Giallo thrillers such as The Bird With the Crystal Plumage, and Torso.The director of this film, James Clavell, led a life far more interesting than all his films put together. Wounded in WW2, then became a prisoner of war by the Japanese. Then came the Hollywood career as a writer\/director, followed by a successful career as a novelist in the 70's and 80's, before dying at the age of 69.

Mayer), but this striking, captivating film was and is a tremendous indictment of ageism and the disposability of stars. Holden plays a down on his luck writer whose main objective is to stay ahead of two repo men who want his car. When he turns into the driveway of a weathered mansion off the title street, he steps into a nearly surreal world of decaying grandeur, led by former silent film goddess Swanson, aided by her terse butler von Stroheim. She hires him to help flesh out her self-written return to the screen, but, before long, he finds that he's been employed to cater to other needs of hers, emotional and physical. Meanwhile, pert, dedicated Olson, an aspiring writer herself, wants Holden to assist her in bringing one of his unsold works to life. This, however, doesn't sit well with Swanson, who by now requires virtually all of his attention as she prepares to take the cinematic world by storm again. Holden, handsome and in shape (and sporting the thatch of chest hair which Hollywood frequently required him to remove!) does a terrific job in the film. His casual, understated approach is in great contrast with his co-star's, but it works well. He was a late stage replacement for Montgomery Clift. Swanson, who had herself been away from the screen for an extended period of time, is stunning. Practically every line she has is delivered with passion (and many of the lines have since become oft-quoted staples.) Her presence and her claw-like gestures combine to create a desperate, grasping, tragic woman. Von Stroheim is even more understated than Holden, but, again, it works beautifully with his stern visage at odds with the ever-emoting Swanson. The only really normal person in the film is Olson and her fresh, optimistic personality fills out the star quartet nicely. (All four stars received Oscar noms, though none took home the statuette.) Several silent film veterans appear briefly as bridge partners of Swansons including Nilsson, Keaton and Warner. Legendary director de Mille appears to great effect as himself. Director Wilder was known for his watertight, set-in-stone scripts and this is one of his best. The storyline and dialogue are fascinating and have remained so over many years, making this a solid classic. He utilized top people in every area from composer Franz Waxman to costume designer Edith Head. There were plenty of connections between the cast and Swanson. For example, von Stroheim had been one of Swanson's directors in her earlier career, as had de Mille. Swanson and Olson, however, shared no scenes in this film, nor did they when they appeared many years later in Airport 1975. It's an arresting, darkly funny, but also sad view of life in a spotlight that has dimmed almost completely. A very successful stage musical came several decades later, which gave a passel of divas (including Glenn Close and Diahann Carroll) a chance to play the role Swanson created. TV star Carol Burnett milked a parody of the movie into several very amusing and beloved skits with Harvey Korman playing her beleaguered manservant.

When he turns into the driveway of a weathered mansion off the title street, he steps into a nearly surreal world of decaying grandeur, led by former silent film goddess Swanson, aided by her terse butler von Stroheim. She hires him to help flesh out her self-written return to the screen, but, before long, he finds that he's been employed to cater to other needs of hers, emotional and physical. Meanwhile, pert, dedicated Olson, an aspiring writer herself, wants Holden to assist her in bringing one of his unsold works to life. This, however, doesn't sit well with Swanson, who by now requires virtually all of his attention as she prepares to take the cinematic world by storm again. Holden, handsome and in shape (and sporting the thatch of chest hair which Hollywood frequently required him to remove!) does a terrific job in the film. His casual, understated approach is in great contrast with his co-star's, but it works well. He was a late stage replacement for Montgomery Clift. Swanson, who had herself been away from the screen for an extended period of time, is stunning. Practically every line she has is delivered with passion (and many of the lines have since become oft-quoted staples.) Her presence and her claw-like gestures combine to create a desperate, grasping, tragic woman. Von Stroheim is even more understated than Holden, but, again, it works beautifully with his stern visage at odds with the ever-emoting Swanson. The only really normal person in the film is Olson and her fresh, optimistic personality fills out the star quartet nicely. (All four stars received Oscar noms, though none took home the statuette.) Several silent film veterans appear briefly as bridge partners of Swansons including Nilsson, Keaton and Warner. Legendary director de Mille appears to great effect as himself. Director Wilder was known for his watertight, set-in-stone scripts and this is one of his best. The storyline and dialogue are fascinating and have remained so over many years, making this a solid classic. He utilized top people in every area from composer Franz Waxman to costume designer Edith Head. There were plenty of connections between the cast and Swanson. For example, von Stroheim had been one of Swanson's directors in her earlier career, as had de Mille. Swanson and Olson, however, shared no scenes in this film, nor did they when they appeared many years later in Airport 1975. It's an arresting, darkly funny, but also sad view of life in a spotlight that has dimmed almost completely. A very successful stage musical came several decades later, which gave a passel of divas (including Glenn Close and Diahann Carroll) a chance to play the role Swanson created. TV star Carol Burnett milked a parody of the movie into several very amusing and beloved skits with Harvey Korman playing her beleaguered manservant.
