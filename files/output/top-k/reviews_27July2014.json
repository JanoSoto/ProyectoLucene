Gangsters previously were either celebrated or loathed, but never well understood. Then Bonnie and Clyde, released five years earlier, attempted to humanize criminals by showing not only the spectacular bank heists and subsequent car chases, but also the mundane, banal and tragic nature of such a lifestyle. But B&C weren't Mafiosi. Godfather portrayed the Mafia as a unique and fascinating subset of society. Along with the requisite violence, we see the gangsters with their families, at weddings and christenings, or planning a multiple murder over takeout Chinese. Most of all, it is a portrait of Michael Corleone, the war hero and prodigal son, who returns to the fold and ends up running the show.In Godfather II Michael is running much more than a crime family. He's a big shot whose son's first communion is celebrated by senators and other luminaries. As Hyman Roth famously tells him, Michael, we're bigger than US Steel. But his personal life is disintegrating. Michael has promised Kay, his wife, that he's going legitimate but it's clearly not working, and we wonder about the sincerity of the promise. The family narrowly escapes a hit following the communion ceremony, initiating a series of retributions that we know will not stop. Meanwhile, a series of flashbacks to Sicily show Vito, the paterfamilias, as a young boy who himself survives an assassination attempt (his mother is not so lucky), sails to America and sets himself up as a street hood who through guile and guts takes over the neighborhood rackets. He is respected and feared, but he's not without compassion. When his wife tells him of a friend who's having trouble keeping her apartment, Vito intervenes on her behalf. He didn't have to do it, and there's really nothing in it for him.This is the central contrast in the film. Vito is undoubtedly a criminal who'll kill anyone in his way, but there's a humanity behind his calculations. Michael, who disdains his criminal family at the beginning of Godfather I and shows a na√Øve, even playful side, has lost his humanity by the end of that picture, and that hardness only deepens in Godfather II. The only glimpse we see of that earlier man occurs in a scene with his mother, in which he asks how his father kept the family together. It's a rare example of self-doubt in an otherwise scheming, manipulative and deeply cynical personality. When he learns that his weak older brother, Fredo, helped set up the botched Lake Tahoe hit, he permits him to live, but only while their mother lives. By the end of the movie Michael has lost his family (his natural one), and any remnant of human feeling.The structure of Godfather II is problematic for me. The repeated flashbacks to the young Vito, while engaging, interrupt the flow of the film. That this is a strategic error on Coppolla's part was demonstrated when one of the networks aired a miniseries, The Godfather Saga a few years after the sequel. It took a strictly chronological approach beginning with scenes of young Vito in Sicily from Godfather II and then continuing with Godfather I. (Some scenes were edited or omitted entirely, in conformance with network TV standards, while others not appearing in the films were included.) This merging of narratives conveyed all the power of both movies without the distracting flashback device to form a much more coherent whole. What to say about the cast of Godfather II? It is uniformly excellent. DeNiro's Vito is pitch-perfect. Keaton's performance as Kay is striking in its nuanced disaffection as she grows to realize that her husband has no inclination to go straight. Dominic Chianese gives a strong performance as Johnny Ola, a quarter-century ahead of Junior Soprano. Michael V. Gazzo, as the harried, doomed Frankie Pentangeli, won a supporting-actor nod, and his might be the best performance of the film. Talia Shire, as sister Connie, shines as the floozy who -- like Michael in the first film -- finally returns to the fold.But it's Pacino and Cazale who really carry this picture. Theirs is a complex, combustible relationship the strong, ruthless younger brother and the skittish, increasingly resentful older brother share two memorable, but radically different, scenes. In the first, Fredo has just arrived in Havana with Roth's $2 million. They repair to a street cafe for daiquiris as Michael pretends to confide in Fredo -- in fact everything he says is a lie. But Fredo is appreciative of the confidence and regrets that the two never spoke so intimately before. Later, after Fredo stupidly reveals to Michael his association with Roth and Ola, Michael severs their relationship in the harshest terms. Fredo is practically recumbent in his chair, even as he insists that I'm smart! Not stupid like everybody says. I want respect! But he's not smart he's a dead man, and everybody knows it but him. Cazale plays the pathos for all it's worth. The film ends with yet another flashback. It's Christmas, and the brothers have planned a welcome-home for the Don (never seen). Michael announces that he's joining the Army, winning congratulations from Fredo, bewilderment from Tom, and scorn from Sonny. This is evidently Michael's reverie, perhaps driven by the guilt of killing Fredo and his brutal treatment of Kay. Flash to present Michael is seated outside his Tahoe estate, his only companions the fallen leaves whipping around his feet.It's a real tour de force, this movie. It is flawed in its conception but brilliant in its execution. I can see why many people think it's the best sequel ever, even better than the original. I just can't take it that far. It may be the best sequel, but it nonetheless suffers by comparison to its predecessor.

They fall asleep and wake up to discover they've crash landed in an ocean on some planet in the year 3978. Stewart dies at some point while they were sleeping, and Taylor, Landon and Dodge barely make it out of the spaceship before it sinks. They make it ashore, and traverse a huge desert where nothing can grow. They've got three days to find food, or they die, they find a flower, then some weird looking scarecrows and finally trees and a flowing stream of water. The astronauts make it to a corn field where they see some mute prehistoric humans. Taylor thinks he'll be running this planet in no time. But then things grow eerily quiet, there's gunfire and creatures on horseback. The humans all instinctively run, the creatures hunting the humans are gorillas, and they mean to kill every last human they see.Taylor and Landon survive the hunt, but Dodge does not. Taylor is shot in the throat during the hunt, and loses the ability to speak. taken to Ape City where he's given a blood transfusion, and survives. Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) is a chimpanzee animal psychologist who is fascinated by Taylor's attempts to speak. Her boyfriend Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) is a chimp archaeologist, who's done some interesting digs to find out about the origins of the simian society. Taylor communicates to Zira and Cornelius through handwritten notes, a human who can communicate is a direct threat to the order of the society that Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) Chief Science Officer and Defender of the Faith has built. Zaius orders that Taylor be neutered, immediately. Taylor learns of the plan and escapes the cage where he is kept, after a long chase, just when all seems lost for Taylor, his voice comes back and he cannot be killed now because he can speak.Taylor is given a show trial, and remanded to Zaius' custody where he promises to spare Taylor if he outs his talking human colony. Taylor says there are no others and faces certain death. Does Taylor die at the hands of Dr. Zaius? Does Taylor ever find out more about this strange planet where apes rule over mute men?I first watched this movie on TV in the 1970's, when I was around five years old, to my five year old mind, gorillas riding around on horseback hunting humans was the coolest thing ever. As I got older, I understood the many complex issues discussed in this movie, nuclear war, evolution, the tension between faith and science (very timely these days) time travel, animal experimentation, even the cruel treatment of animals in captivity. The trial of George Taylor was similar to the Scopes trial, with apes arguing over evolution instead of humans, there was even a social pecking order in the ape world, with orangutans having most of the powerful government functions, chimps doing the scientific work, as it were, and gorillas doing the military work. All these facets in the story and the fact that the screenplay was co-written by Rod Serling, the genius behind The Twilight Zone made this movie endlessly entertaining and fascinating. The other co-writer Michael Wilson, co- wrote such classics as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai, The iconic line Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape, comes at such a pivotal point in the movie, and is so perfectly delivered by Heston, that the viewer cannot help but cheer that line. The script is not perfect however, most notably regarding women, the female astronaut is killed before ever leaving the ship, Nova is mute, and once Taylor talks to her, he says some incredibly sexist things to her. The strongest feminist voice belongs to Zira, who in a lot of ways is not only Cornelius equal, but superior to him, prodding him to act when he is too timid.The acting especially by Heston is superb, he doesn't play his usual epic hero, like Moses in the Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, in this movie he is an anti-hero, much in keeping with the times, the turbulent 1960's. Heston's character George Taylor didn't like people much, he didn't even like his fellow crewmembers, he thought he had all the answers, in other words, he is a character in search of a comeuppance, and boy does he ever get one. But as the last intelligent member of humankind, the viewer can't help but root for Taylor despite all his shortcomings. Roddy McDowell was still feeling his way in this movie, he has some good lines but he plays the chimp Caesar with much more command in the later movies. Kim Hunter gives an exceptionally strong performance, I just realized that when watching it now, she is the one who moves the story along, and she has some of the best lines, including a comedic one to Heston. She played Stella in Streetcar opposite Brando, so obviously she can act. Maurice Evans was also superb as Dr. Zaius, the tension was palpable in the scene between him and Heston in their scene alone in Zaius office. The direction was eye-catching by Franklin Schaffner, who directed Patton and the Boys From Brazil, another favorite of mine. Schaffner adds many unique touches to this film, The plane crash in the beginning of the film, grabs the viewer immediately, the chase scene that ends up with Heston speaking is gripping, how he waits till the last possible second to show the apes in the hunt scene to get the full shock value is amazing, and of course the last scene is one the most iconic in movie history.For more reviews to go ape over, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" George Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his fellow astronauts, Landon (Robert Gunner) and Dodge (Jeff Burton) take off with a female astronaut Stewart (Diane Stanley) to test theories about time in deep space.

The other co-writer Michael Wilson, co- wrote such classics as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai, The iconic line Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape, comes at such a pivotal point in the movie, and is so perfectly delivered by Heston, that the viewer cannot help but cheer that line. The script is not perfect however, most notably regarding women, the female astronaut is killed before ever leaving the ship, Nova is mute, and once Taylor talks to her, he says some incredibly sexist things to her. The strongest feminist voice belongs to Zira, who in a lot of ways is not only Cornelius equal, but superior to him, prodding him to act when he is too timid.The acting especially by Heston is superb, he doesn't play his usual epic hero, like Moses in the Ten Commandments or Ben Hur, in this movie he is an anti-hero, much in keeping with the times, the turbulent 1960's. Heston's character George Taylor didn't like people much, he didn't even like his fellow crewmembers, he thought he had all the answers, in other words, he is a character in search of a comeuppance, and boy does he ever get one. But as the last intelligent member of humankind, the viewer can't help but root for Taylor despite all his shortcomings. Roddy McDowell was still feeling his way in this movie, he has some good lines but he plays the chimp Caesar with much more command in the later movies. Kim Hunter gives an exceptionally strong performance, I just realized that when watching it now, she is the one who moves the story along, and she has some of the best lines, including a comedic one to Heston. She played Stella in Streetcar opposite Brando, so obviously she can act. Maurice Evans was also superb as Dr. Zaius, the tension was palpable in the scene between him and Heston in their scene alone in Zaius office. The direction was eye-catching by Franklin Schaffner, who directed Patton and the Boys From Brazil, another favorite of mine. Schaffner adds many unique touches to this film, The plane crash in the beginning of the film, grabs the viewer immediately, the chase scene that ends up with Heston speaking is gripping, how he waits till the last possible second to show the apes in the hunt scene to get the full shock value is amazing, and of course the last scene is one the most iconic in movie history.For more reviews to go ape over, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com ","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 July 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" James Cameron delivers his first box office sensation starring the ultimate body-builder legend, Arnold Schwarzenegger in this classic 1980's technical science fiction action thriller. Its one of the coolest conceptual movies ever made taking place in a modern world that may or may not exist in the near future due to artificially intelligent machines deciding to strike back against mankind. Although, younger viewers will find some of the special effects a bit cheesy and dated, the plot is a concept that will define a whole new genre, and changed Americans' perspective of films forever. Schwarzenegger is sheer perfection as a menacing futuristic cyborg sent back to the year 1984 in order to destroy the mother of an unborn resistance leader that will inevitably defeat the machines. The human resistance must counter-attack by sending a human being (Michael Biehn) back to the same year to protect the target (Linda Hamilton). This is slam-bang action from start to finish, and features an excellent cast and the innovative, ground-breaking genius of Stan Winston's blending of computer animation with mechanical prosthetic motion photography. A haunting musical score, clever script, tense mood and atmosphere contribute to the film's suspense, and a revealing climax that is the icing on the cake. Cameron's detailed vision is complex and engaging, and Hamilton, Biehn, Paul Winfield, and Lance Henrickson are all outstanding. Also features early performances by 80's up-comers Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, Dick Miller and more. This will also spawn the excellent ground-breaking sequel, T2 Judgement Day. Its first-rate filmmaking to say the least, and sets the stage for one of the greatest technically challenging film directors of the 80's and 90's.
