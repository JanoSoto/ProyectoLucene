I really love seeing her play quirky and eccentric, and she's quite funny. John Goodman amusingly plays Roland Jones who would appear to be cuckoo if not for the actuality that Harold really is from another planet. Greg Kinnear is great as he presents his acting range and also his handsome charm. Ben Kingsley gives a fittingly unemotional performance; that seems to be well in his wheelhouse. Linda Fiorentino makes an arresting appearance. Judy Greer gets topless and is as cute as she can be. Don't forget Richard Jenkins; he's a standard in comedies.At the crutch of the plot is a penis that vibrates. The movie somewhat revolves around Harold's vibrating penis, as it were. It's ridiculous but I suppose it does carry its symbolic message - enjoy yourself.What Planet Are You From? is particularly humorous and promises for a few chuckles. It really never gets bad and it has plenty of polite moments. It's well-written with very good dialogue and a good cast. The story lacks firmness, but that's alright, the movie is silly and not too full of itself, making it mildly refreshing. I wish I could give this a higher rating because I really like it, but a 5 is good.

I didn't know, going into the film, what to really expect. I didn't think I would be able to stand a whole film without any dialogue. I honestly didn't think that slapstick humor, to the extent that I've seen in a few clips from Chaplin films would appeal to me. Thankfully, I was more than wrong. Charlie Chaplin is not only a funny film, but it is an extremely touching film. The performances are fanastic, especially by legend Charlie Chaplin who was perfect as the often clumsy Tramp. The story was so moving that the 90 minute duration was forgotten by me right throughout the film.The Tramp meets a blind flower girl and immediately falls in love with her. On eday, he rescues a millionaire as he was about to commit suicide and convinces him to not destroy his life. The drunk millionaire befriends The Tramp to the extent of allowing him to stay at the man's mansion, use his car and even borrow money. The Tramp, one day, spies on the blind girl's window and sees a doctor by the girl's bedside and realizes that she is sick. He also discovers that the girl and his grandmother may be forced to leave if they cannot pay their rent in time. 'City Lights' then follows The Tramp's hilarious adventure to try and get enough money to save the girl and her grandmother, whilst running into plenty of trouble.Charlie Chaplin perfectly portrays the Tramp as an extremely peculiar looking and clumsy man yet also brings extreme heart and love to the role. His fantastic performance is matched by Virginia Cherrill who portrays the blind flower girl extremely well. Inarguably, both were fantastic but their brilliance is more evident due to the fact that 'City Lights' is a silent film that has no dialogue. The ability to portray an entire film simply out of facial expressions is absolutely fantastic.My expectations for 'City Light' were to see a completely slap stick humored film. Whilst there is plenty of slapstick humor, the film is incredibly touching and powerful written and directed brilliantly by Sir Charles Chaplin. The humor is plenty throughout the 90 minute duration of the film and whilst the emotion is limited, when emotional scenes are shown in the film they work brilliantly. 'City Lights' is yet another one of those films that many people underestimate and jump to speculations which turn out wrong.'City Lights' is such a brilliant film that is pretty much flawless, making for the most entertaining 90 minutes without any words uttered out of mouths! The brilliance of this film is more evident for myself, as I now wish to see more Chaplin classics! Featuring fantastic performances and a great story, City Lights is definitely one of the classics that every movie lover must view sometime in their life. It is the Star Wars of its era.

As a person who is currently planning to view classic films, I realized that I had to check out 'It's A Wonderful Life' and did not regret it afterwards.James Stewart stars as George Bailey and Donna Reed stars as his wife, Mary Hatch in this absolute family classic. The story is one of extreme depth and emotion as the film takes around three quarters of the duration before the actual plot begins, but never does the film truly bore you. Filled with amazing black and white cinematography, fantastic acting and often great humorous relief, 'It's A Wonderful Life' truly succeeds at creating such a universe and letting one immerse themselves in the story. To not care entirely for 'It's A Wonderful Life' would clearly show that one would not be human at all as this film deals with great emotion as George Bailey comes the lowest point in his life, full of struggle and frustration that he wishes he were dead so that he would not have to deal with this pain and so that his film would be happier. It is then, that George's guardian angel, Clarence, who had been paying attention to him since he were a child, arrives and gives a tour of what life would be for everyone had George not been born.I had absolutely no idea how this film would turn out. I wasn't even sure whether this would be a film that I would enjoy very much but the film is structured fantastically and the writing and directing is amazing. The best element of the film is the attention to detail on George's character and how much backstory there is. Even the small things such as his father or his brother turn into something more important for George. The way the film depicts everything about George was fantastic. From the scene with him as a child, saving his brother, I was endeared by the character. Of course, a great character only works with fantastic acting and Jimmy Stewart delivers just this in the grandest of style! His ability to display emotion throughout the film is unbelievable, completely allowing anyone to buy the character and the performance. In fact, for much of the film, you forget that Stewart is actually acting in the film! Not only is the film amazing in terms of cinematography and depth of characters but the film offers such fantastic moments such as everything at the end of the film involving Clarence. The emotional aspect of the film is truly terrific with each scene carefully crafted, featuring just the perfect amount of emotion to it. Even the humor, which is plentiful in such a film, is done in a way that it does not overplay the humorous side of the film and unbalance the tone. These sequences are so immersive and the fact that this is a feel good Christmas film just truly ensures that this film delivers. The characters are truly unforgettable, the acting and story is amazing, written and directed intelligently, 'It's A Wonderful Life' truly exceeds at being a masterpiece in every way and it is indeed, no surprise that this film be ranked so highly on many of the top films list, most notably IMDb's infamous top 250, to which it holds a place at 29.

Aliens is the best sci-fi\/action film of all time and for a long period my favourite film ever. And then we had Alien 3. If they had been deliberately TRYING to make a bad film that would ruin the series I don't think they could have done a better job and really the franchise never recovered. Alien; Resurrection was a valiant attempt to put things right and my boy Joss Whedon does a commendable job. But he had a long way to climb after the debacle of Alien 3. Really Resurrection isn't a great film overall but it has some terrific things about it. Sigourney is great as always, Wionna does OK in her role, the relationship between Cal and Ripley 8 is brilliant and spawned a thousand slash fanfics. You can see the beginnings of Firefly here, even down to a prototype Jane and River. The scene where Ripley 8 looks longingly at the picture of the little girl who reminds her of Newt is just heartbreaking (come on Joss, why didn't you include a scene during the evacuation where a Michael Biehn lookalike is glimpsed escaping the ship with a little blonde girl, they could always have cloned them too). Love the fact that Walmart have now taken over Weyland-Yutani. The female space pirate has the most AMAZING figure and the director takes pains to show it off. Set pieces like the underwater battle are terrific. OK, so the newborn looks stupid and it rather spoils the implied parent\/child relationship with Ripley (note the newborn actually chooses its' human side over its' Alien heritage). It's a little hard to sympathise with the pirates when they kidnap the poor workers but you have to assume that they didn't know what was going on. The idea that the scientists would be so stupid as not to acid proof the Aliens' cells is ridiculous. A better storyline would be if the space pirates were actually condemned prisoners the military were going to use for alien breeding but when Cal stages a breakout in order to get to Ripley it frees the other prisoners and they inadvertently release the aliens.Is it just me or is there something a little GOT-fic about the Alien drone carrying Ripley away? Joss sure has his heroines have some deeply weird sex! Great ending though, the bugs blasted to atoms (along with poor Angola!), Ripley has her ship, her crew and her little girl back and can now become a female version of Mal Reynolds, she has her happy ending at last after all she's been through and finally returned to Earth (which she never did in the previous 3 films).

Even though a disappointment, Rambo II wasn't a terrible film and it was a truly enjoyable film still giving us Rambo-like moments. However, Rambo III is what completely destroys everything about the series and we are treated with an extremely slow and overly emotionalized story that doesn't need to be. New characters aren't interesting and even the action sequences aren't that entertaining. Sylvester Stallone is definitely a joy to watch in these films. His physical talent and his endurance and strength are so clearly evident when watching a Rambo film. Not only is he a physical guy but he is a truly underrated actor. He gives yet another great performance in the film but possibly, not as great as the first two. Reason being is that in this film Rambo seems to talk more often, especially delivering corny dialogue towards the end of the film with Richard Crenna's, Trautman. These two are the only good thing in the film but surprisingly enough, when you put them together in an action scene in this film, it turns out pretty bad. Trautman returns to John Rambo with a mission to go to Afghanistan but John refuses and Trautman decides to continue with the mission as planned but Trautman is captured by Afghan terrorists as John must venture where he had no intention of going to save his only friend. When the word 'Rambo' pops into one's mind, they immediately think of a jungle and Rambo being in one. The reason that Rambo III should never be called a Rambo film is that, not once in the film are we shown a jungle. Instead, Rambo is shown in the open even more than he was in the previous film. The jungle is easily the best location that a Rambo film could have an action scene, and the fact that most occurs in sandy wastelands truly doesn't make it phenomenal. Most of the action scenes are uninteresting, the characters are annoying and forgettable and the story attempts to humanize itself too much by providing emotional sequences involving civilians explaining to Rambo about their life. Whilst this isn't terrible, it gets worse and worse as this is done again differently. The reason that 'First Blood' worked amazingly well is how little emotional scenes were shown yet how effective it was. Rambo III is the exact opposite of 'First Blood' and indicates that sticking to original source material works best, especially when trying to make sequels to action classics. 'Rambo III' is definitely the worst of the first three Rambo films, full of uninteresting characters and action sequences, not a single scene in a jungle making this a Rambo film an invalid statement and attempts to humanize itself too much making it that much more frustrating. Rambo III, most definitely isn't a great example of how to make an action sequel.

They had already had their send off, and a very fine one at that, in The Undiscovered Country. There was no need for their presence to be stretched out into Generations. That applies to Kirk more than to anyone else, of course. But here, he gets to take his final bow, of sorts. It could have been done better.At the same time, it could be argued that the Next Generation crew did not need to be in this film, either. It doesn't really do much to meaningfully develop them beyond what had already been done in their seven seasons on television. The subsequent film, First Contact, probably should have served as the lone Next Generation big screen-adventure.In any event, Generations is not a horrible film, but in practice it is a bit of a drag to watch, like one of those books that are hard to read without falling asleep. Some will argue that it is superfluous, and most would probably agree that it is exceedingly slow and frankly boring in spite of its decent screenplay and somewhat fresh plot.Speaking of which, the overall story (beyond the obvious 'Kirk meets Piccard, passes baton' gimmick) looks fairly cool on paper. A ribbon of energy writhing through space, which happens to be a portal to a hallucinogenic other-dimension called the Nexus, where time has no meaning? All right. Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Soren, a member of a long-lived species who has been trying to get back into the Nexus for decades, who collaborates with rogue Klingons, and who is willing to destroy an entire populated planet in the service of his obsession? Sure. A sequence in which the USS Enterprise-D suffers a warp-core breach, forcing the crew to evacuate to the saucer section, which then crashes into the forests of the planet below? Why not &#x96; that sounds exciting. Nothing like blowing up the Enterprise to create a spectacle.As mentioned before, however, it all unfolds at an excessively leisurely pace that challenges the attention span of all but the most dedicated of viewers, and neither Enterprise crew (the 'B' crew at the beginning, featuring the old guys, or the 'D' Next Generation crew) really gets much out of it in terms of character development. I do however have to note Jacqueline Kim's brief but excellent performance as Ensign Demora Sulu, i.e. Hikaru Sulu's grown-up daughter. She looks like a terrific captain in the making as she holds the helm in the opening sequence, and frankly I would rather watch a film about her than what the rest of Generations turns out to be.Two specific things dog all of the Next Generation-era films, and they both rear their heads here. The first and arguably the most annoying is the overestimation of Data's fascination quotient. Every single one of the four Next Generation films feels compelled to put significant focus on his character, and with the exception of First Contact, it all feels gratuitous to me. Yes, his search for humanity is interesting. But not this interesting, and his adventures in humor here are more obnoxious than charming (or actually funny). Instead of fixating on Data, I wish that a more involved role would have been written for Dr. Crusher, who I feel to have been neglected more than any other major crew member.The other issue is the hard truth that the Next Generation's tone and aesthetic sensibilities, while well-suited for television, are simply not big-screen cinematic, particularly in comparison to the Original Series elements with which they share screen time in Generations. The uniforms especially could have benefited from a more sophisticated re-design. The common criticism that Next Generation films are more like glorified television episodes is not entirely unwarranted, although to be fair, Generations does have some very nice sequences.Is this the worst Star Trek film? Goodness, no. It might not even be the worst Next Generation-era film, when you consider the respective issues present in Insurrection and Nemesis. If being boring is a crime, then both Insurrection and The Motion Picture have no doubt shared a cell with Generations.

Nothing like blowing up the Enterprise to create a spectacle.As mentioned before, however, it all unfolds at an excessively leisurely pace that challenges the attention span of all but the most dedicated of viewers, and neither Enterprise crew (the 'B' crew at the beginning, featuring the old guys, or the 'D' Next Generation crew) really gets much out of it in terms of character development. I do however have to note Jacqueline Kim's brief but excellent performance as Ensign Demora Sulu, i.e. Hikaru Sulu's grown-up daughter. She looks like a terrific captain in the making as she holds the helm in the opening sequence, and frankly I would rather watch a film about her than what the rest of Generations turns out to be.Two specific things dog all of the Next Generation-era films, and they both rear their heads here. The first and arguably the most annoying is the overestimation of Data's fascination quotient. Every single one of the four Next Generation films feels compelled to put significant focus on his character, and with the exception of First Contact, it all feels gratuitous to me. Yes, his search for humanity is interesting. But not this interesting, and his adventures in humor here are more obnoxious than charming (or actually funny). Instead of fixating on Data, I wish that a more involved role would have been written for Dr. Crusher, who I feel to have been neglected more than any other major crew member.The other issue is the hard truth that the Next Generation's tone and aesthetic sensibilities, while well-suited for television, are simply not big-screen cinematic, particularly in comparison to the Original Series elements with which they share screen time in Generations. The uniforms especially could have benefited from a more sophisticated re-design. The common criticism that Next Generation films are more like glorified television episodes is not entirely unwarranted, although to be fair, Generations does have some very nice sequences.Is this the worst Star Trek film? Goodness, no. It might not even be the worst Next Generation-era film, when you consider the respective issues present in Insurrection and Nemesis. If being boring is a crime, then both Insurrection and The Motion Picture have no doubt shared a cell with Generations. Ultimately, this is a decent film, but probably only of much interest to Star Trek enthusiasts, and even then more as a curiosity than anything else.

Romero is the guy who started the whole trend of making zombie films. For the year 1968, this movie had a lot going for it. As for those who may not find that older films have much appeal, this one does. Its story not only carries its own origin but also contains a well thought out written tone and a very addicting plot. Not to mention this film even has gore. Yes, gore.The premise is very basic, a group of random individuals happen to meet up at house to hide from flesh-eating entranced humans, otherwise known as zombies. Bruce Capristo, the head of the makeup department did a great job at making the zombies look like normal people. Yet, the audience and characters alike can tell the difference between themselves and the zombies. Weird as it is, this will be the only movie Capristo would take credit for. After this he did not move on into other movies. It's also surprising to me how after this movie became a hit, that none of the actors really moved forward with their careers either. Because of this, the actors in this movie remain no-name actors.Which brings me to my next point characters. In most cases, when a movie has such a basic premise, character development ends up taking a back seat. Why? Because most audiences are more interested in seeing the plot device in action more than they are in the main characters. But what Romero and his screen writing partner, John A. Russo did was balance the screen time between the scenes of confronting zombies and the lead roles discussing how they're going to escape. This keeps the audience from becoming too bored with too much dialog or too much zombies. This holds true because too much of one thing isn't good in general. There needs to be a balance.What remains the most potent about this picture is just how overwhelming this situation is and how quickly hope can be lost if this were to be a reality. Oddly enough, one would think that because zombies move so slowly, it would be easy to evade them. Better think twice about that claim. Even for these undead beings, they are relentless. To think if you had twenty to fifty of them around you,...sounds like its time to curl up in fetal position and go to that happy place every person has in their head. This is what Romero does with his audience, by creating a hopeless tone. It will seem like any direction taken towards escaping won't work and it's done very effectively.But while this is effective, another great aspect to this tone is by instilling a small glimmer of hope every time an opportunity opens. This is what makes this story so gripping. I would feel right to let go and give up, but it wouldn't because you know there has to be a way to win. Also, the musical composer, William Loose did a fair job at the score. It definitely sounds like music and it does contain a reoccurring theme for the film and for the zombies themselves, so it does work.The last area that surprised me was just how gory this late 1960's black and white film was. I mean, how did audiences back then take this film? People must have flipped out so much that it caused mass hysteria. It's obvious in a lot of scenes that the people parts used in the zombie scenes were animal parts but wow. I'm surprised Romero was let back into the film business after that. I actually wasn't expecting much at all but I'm pretty sure Romero had a lot more to put on the screen. I liked how things went with Romero's first film piece. It was evenly paced and kept me wondering what would happen next. How many films are like that nowadays?Film legend George A.

I do believe that the 1936 film is one of the most cleverly made comedies I've seen in a long time. It all starts off with a well put together opening sequence showing a glamorous look on New York City with cast titles lit up in the way many people picture it, but then surprisingly transits to a miserable slum section of the town, showing the underside of city life during the Great Depression. Afterwards we are introduced to Godfrey of City Dump #32, East River, Sutton Place, who finds himself confronted by a group of the wealthy upper class snobs on a scavenger hunt for a Forgotten Man. After some coaxing from one of their number Irene, Godfrey agrees to play along, and wins her the prize. Wanting to repay the favor, Irene offers Godfrey work, and he becomes the Bullock family's new butler. He soon finds out that the job is not what its cracked up to be. Godfrey may be one of the best characters portrayed in cinema. He's intelligent and headstrong; comes off as bitter at times but in truth has a heart of gold. He is unafraid to express his honesty and upholds his unique nature. When he's asked to be the Forgotten Man, it gives viewers a glimpse of how poorly the lower class folk were treated by the upper class. The movie goes out of its way to make a mockery of the wealthy, portraying them as having a ridiculously exaggerated sense of fashion, a desire to impress everyone with their money, and completely spoiled, thanks to a life without risk or struggle. I would wholeheartedly agree with one of the backdrop characters who calls a gathering of the rich at the Ritz Hotel akin to a insane asylum. Godfrey couldn't be more accurate in calling them all nitwits. For him experience was the best education. It quickly becomes apparent to Godfrey why the Bullock family has had difficulty keeping a butler, given the family's constant disputes with each other and their ridiculous interactions. The priceless expressions on Godfrey's face tell us What have I gotten myself into? and I can't say I blame him. Godfrey also experiences the worst luck with women. Irene becomes infatuated with him as her protégé but Godfrey denies her, believing it to be for everyone's best interests. Meanwhile her scheming sister Cornelia plots Godfrey's downfall, but ultimately Godfrey uses her tactics against her. His decency never falters. In spite the family's mistreatment, Godfrey saves them from financial collapse and makes the errors of their ways clear. Godfrey also transforms the City Dump where he came from into a nightclub, providing nourishment, shelter, and employment for the once forgotten men. In the time of struggle and desperation that was the Great Depression, people deserved to be given a hopeful outlook on their lives, and a positive role model to look to. Godfrey had a great impact on the Bullock family and in the end even he gained something from the nitwit wealthy folks, including patience, amusement, and humility.

This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned. Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see!We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels?Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel.I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like The Exorcist, Rosemary's baby, Name of the rose, which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of Deliverance, Whatever happened to Baby-Jane, Duel and The Marathon man. Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this.

Given an 8.6\/10 on IMDb.com and 97% Fresh on Rottentomatoes.com A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.Bates Motel the modern prequel series to Psycho has left me absolutely intrigued. I had heard of Hitchcock's masterpiece but I had never actually seen and with myself being an immense film addict, how could I have possibly missed such a remarkable gem? I'd known the entire plot. Every twist turn and stab. I honestly thought I was capable of understanding exactly what I was going to get here, but boy was I wrong. Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling. Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute cinematic genius. Choosing to keep the film in black and white, killing off his protagonist halfway through the film, pushing and pulling the audience in every direction he wants them to be in. His camera angles and overall eye for entertainment has yet to be matched by any modern filmmaker. This man and this film are not only responsible for revolutionizing the horror genre, but showing the world the validity of it. Expect to be mesmerized by this piece.We are given Anthony Perkins, who doesn't just play the role of Norman Bates, but he becomes him. The character is embodied with such power and perfection that seeing Perkins in any role but this terrifies me beyond belief. Vera Miles and John Gavin team up as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis. Together they weave a team of compassionate and caring people, searching for answers in a mind bending mystery. Miles performs beautifully. She's innocent and loving and just wants to find her sister, but there's this air to her that strikes me, making me wonder how complex Lila is capable of being. If you're able to portray a character to the point that a viewer wishes to know more about that character, I give you the utmost respect. John Gavin as Sam Loomis bored me at the start but soon he became ideal. Loomis and Bates are compared and contrasted in an ironically obvious but eye-opening light. They are both extremely handsome men but Loomis is intimidating, strong, manly. Whereas, Norman Bates is a shy, childish, coward. The scenes where the two actors battle in out in conversation kept me on the edge of my seat. Once again, I have to add that Anthony Perkins is a genius and every motion, reaction, and word that comes from him in this film delivers an unforgettable experience.My only complaint worth noting is the scene in which the psychologist explains Norman and His Mother to the audience. It's a bit drawn out and the psychologist is delivering shocking and heartbreaking information but there seems to be little reaction from him or anyone in the room. Rather than telling me what happened, I'd have rather seen it for myself, Something that's easy to do in film. But this scene is necessary and it won't take a single thing away from this movie.Overall, Psycho is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a horrifying thrill-ride with a twist that no one will ever see coming and what it did for the movie world will never be forgotten. Alfred Hitchcock toys with our wildest emotions and fears and spawns a true work of art. I'll have to ask my mother what she thought of the film because, well, mother knows best. But, I'd say that if you decide that Bates Motel has No Vacany's for you, well Norman and I will both in form you that we have 12 Vacancy's and all 12 should be filled by you.

It stars Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, Daniel Stern, Charlotte Rampling, Jane Kaczmarek and Christopher Neame. Music is by Chaz Jankel and cinematography by Yuri Neyman.A loose remake of the 1950 film noir of the same name, the story finds Professor Dexter Cornell (Quaid) staggering into a police station proclaiming that he is dying because someone has poisoned him. Told in flashback by Cornell, we see the events that led up to the point he was poisoned, but not who did it, and then track the frantic Professor as he tries to solve the who done it mystery before he keels over and dies.Not as bad as the poor box office returns suggest it is, D.O.A. is still very much a frustratingly shaky experience. Lifting only the basic idea of the 1950 movie, the makers stamp their own mark on the premise but add too many red herrings to the already fishy stew. Some plot developments are daft, as is the casting of Meg Ryan in the key femme role - seriously she is just too cookie cute and homely for this material &#x96; while the motive reveal is a bit much to swallow. Yet there's still a lot to enjoy and sample here for the neo-noir faithful.Visually the picture is stylish and appreciative to its noir roots. Opening in black and white to set the story in motion, Jankel and Morton then infuse the film with angled shots and frame distortions.

His downfall was vividly portrayed by the great Fox and the miscreant Barrett played with superb calm and maliciousness by Dirk Bogarde was simply insidious but spectacular.Other than a psychological portrait of the moral and societal decline of Tony, it also highlights the blindness and callousness with which people act and don't really see or help anyone but themselves and are just selfish at heart.

It is an odd concoction. It is visually very appealing with some superb locations and the design is quite good. However, the drama at the center is like Who's afraid of Virgina Woolf? It's a domestic quarrel that goes on and on and on and on. And on. That can work on stage but the real weakness with this film is that the script has two-three modes of writing. It is declamatory almost throughout and when that is switched off, it turns to an apothegmatic form as a means to close of a scene or assert power. Then, in between, those two forms, is the small talk of a bourgeois family. It's quite a curious mixture and rather shallow writing from a technical view.The incongruities are raised due to the casting. Hepburn gives another revision of the spinster schoolmistress type.

It's a domestic quarrel that goes on and on and on and on. And on. That can work on stage but the real weakness with this film is that the script has two-three modes of writing. It is declamatory almost throughout and when that is switched off, it turns to an apothegmatic form as a means to close of a scene or assert power. Then, in between, those two forms, is the small talk of a bourgeois family. It's quite a curious mixture and rather shallow writing from a technical view.The incongruities are raised due to the casting. Hepburn gives another revision of the spinster schoolmistress type.

After the fantastic film that was 'Star Trek First Contact', the director and writer to decided to create a ninth installment to this franchise that would fail, just to what..keep the pattern going? All the bad Star Trek films suffer in the same way. They have bad direction, lousy writing, poor explanation of the plot, uninteresting characters and have extremely uninteresting special effects and cinematography. When we look at the previous installment, there were some fantastic special effects and good action sequences, had great writing and directing and had an interesting plot. This film, is Star Trek First Contact or even Star Trek Wrath of Khan done horribly.During this film, Captain Picard played by Patrick Stewart, learns that there is a Federation dispute between the Ba'ku and the Son'a. Apparently the Son'a have begun a plot to wipe out the Ba'ku in order to regenerate the city from scrap. Hearing about this, following a malfunction of the often frustrating Data, Captain Picard and his Enterprise must prevent this Federation dispute from being completed.The plot to the film was rather difficult for me to follow simply because there wasn't enough explanation of the plot. This film is close to unbearable for me, almost topping Generations in its horribility factor. The characters are extremely uninteresting, even the ones we already know about and the romance plot in this film with Picard and the Ba'ku is extremely stupid and it made me want to grab a phaser and kill myself! The plot itself nearly made me kill myself, it was that frustrating. If these Star Trek odd numbered films do one thing, it is that they nearly make me want to commit suicide- that is all about Star Trek III Search for Spock.The special effects were truly bad in my opinion, in this film. First Contact had some great effects and an interesting story. It had fine cinematography but this film throws aside all the great things about First Contact. Apparently this film was the first to use CGI effects but boy, does everything look cheaper than ever before. It is clearly evident that when it comes to an odd numbered Star Trek film, that the director and writer completely ignore everything good about the predecessor. Let us pray that Star Trek Into Darkness, being the twelfth installment can live up to the hype...and the bloody PATTERN The reason that the New Generations films do not work well, except for First Contact which was something miraculous, is the fact that the characters simply cannot measure about to those of the original crew. They aren't interesting.Star Trek Insurrection is everything horrible about the odd numbered Star Trek films and suffers considerably from lousy writing, bad direction, horrid special effects, uninteresting cinematography and most importantly, a terrible plot. If the plan of the film was to simply follow the pattern of the odd numbered films, then this film certainly did its job but I simply don't understand.

Probably not a good film choice, but I vaguely remember realising that I shouldn't really be watching it and was scared by it, my heart beating hard the whole time. It had quite a profound effect on me. Watching it again, whilst not horror as I'd previously thought, it does have enough to make it gripping and I jumped once or twice, despite it being quite obviously dated. The premise is very clever and good science-fiction and possibly the idea behind films like Inception. Whilst I don't like reboots as a general rule, I would be interested to see how this was tackled with today's CGI and technology. The stop-start model animation sequences let the film down in what is otherwise a not-bad watching for a nearly 30yo film.The plot is not as basic as it first appears, and unfolds in conspiracy-esque fashion and Dennis Quaid is perfect in the role; both funny and cheeky, flirty and sexy but also physical enough to handle some action and stunts believably. Christopher Plummer plays villainous research facility mastermind superbly well with his quiet calm and authoritative manner, perfect foil for Quaid's animation and brash style. There are shades of InnerSpace (insertion into a biological function inner world) but with more sinister and dark method, and with greater ramifications. Kate Capshaw as researcher Jane DeVries and David Patrick Kelly as obvious twisted bad-guy Tommy Ray are stereotype made-to-measure but suited and add to the film's plausibility.I'm not going to say it's a brilliant film but for it's time, the psychological potential of it and the fact that it's great science fiction and despite it's age is still gripping, I'm giving it a 6\/10.
