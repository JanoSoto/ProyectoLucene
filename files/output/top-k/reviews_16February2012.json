Like Dark City, this movie deals with the ability to program human memories and thus change our identity. In this movie, the programming is done through computers by hacking into the person's brain and then rewriting the brainwave patterns. This movie also looks at technological advancement and questions its morality. Will we advance to a point where technology will become sentient and turn on us? Ghost in the shell is based around a group of officers belonging to an organisation known as section 9. These cops are heavily enhanced through cybernetics and deal with cyber-criminals. They are chasing a criminal known as the puppet master, who has done everything from terrorism to theft of information. He is a threat because he seeks to undermine international security. The puppet master is very dangerous because he hacks into people's souls (ghosts) and rewrites them and thus uses them to further his gaols. His goals are never really quite clear but this is not what Ghost in the Shell is looking for.The title of the movie suggests the theme of the movie. Can technology reach a point to where we can transfer our bodies and retain our soul? And is the soul something that can be programmed and manipulated? This movie seems to suggest that it is, and it is our soul that makes us human, everything else is simply a shell. We are focused on the cyborgs and they are contrasted with a police officer who has only a phone installed in his head. Yet we notice that the cyborgs are as human as the police officer. They still enjoy the pleasures of life and seek to experience more. The drawback is that their body is owned by the government and thus they have less freedom than those with a flesh body. Even so, they are still human.Sentience is another theme. It questions the structure of our soul and raises the idea as to whether such souls will develop through rapid technological advancement. In an evolutionary way, with the creation and development of cyberspace, the possibility of cybercreatures appearing is theorised. This movie jumps straight to sentient cybercreatures who have no form but a program, though they are very dangerous for they can manipulate the outside world through technology. Such a creature is generated in Lawnmower man, but he was first a human. Ghost in the Shell suggests that such a creature arose out of our ignorance of what we were developing.Ghost in the Shell is a brilliant manga movie. At first I thought it was slow, but the second time I realised that though there is good action, the ideas that are prevalent throughout make it a top rating movie.Favourite Quote Just your standard issue big gun, borrowed it from section 9 armoury and decided to keep it.

Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.

I am not really so sure about that, but then this movie is, at the time of this writing, thirteen years old, so superior films can (and have) been written in the meantime. Personally, I think Thin Red Line is by far the best war film, but Full Metal Jacket still is a good movie and it does address some interesting points.Full Metal Jacket has been divided into two sections one during training and one during the Vietnam War. It follows a marine named Joker through his basic training and into his experiences at war. It is not psychological to the extent of Thin Red Line, nor does is show the horrors of war, but rather is seems to be far more stabbing towards the attitude of the American military.There are a few points that need to be raised. Firstly nobody is ever called by their real name. At the beginning, during the introductions, everybody in the platoon is given a name. In fact, we know absolutely nothing about the soldier's prior lives. Everything we know about them is what we see when they are in the army. We are not permitted to see who they really are but rather only allowed to see them as killers. In fact, the whole purpose of training is to turn them into killers and the whole process, as we see, seems to slowly strip the soldiers of their humanity.The first thing we are allowed to see is the soldiers having their hair shaved. This symbolises their removal from their old lives and entrance into their new lives. They are then babies and as such are put through a naming ceremony, through which their last identifying feature, their name, is destroyed and are now the property of the Marine Corps. The ability to give somebody a name shows superiority over the person, thus by giving them names the Marine Corps becomes their father.Then we have a look at Private Pile. He is the one character that is picked on the most during the movie. The drill sergeant seems to take an instant disliking to him, and turns the entire platoon onto him. We see the vestiges of humanity vanishing mostly in Pile and the way the platoon treats Pile. By the end of training, Pile has lost all sense of who he is, yet he has not become a cold efficient killer. In fact, he has reached a point where the only way to fulfil his life is to destroy that which has been tormenting him - the Drill Sergeant. It is interesting that Kubrick used this here because we see this more in prison type movies, such as Missing in Action II. Yet by linking Pile's final actions with movies like Missing in Action II, we come to see that the Marine Corps is more than just a job, it is a prison.The Vietnam scenes basically take what has been developed in training and puts it into the field. We basically see characters that are little more than bloodthirsty animals. Joker still seems to hold onto his humanity, yet he is a trained killer and does not flinch at the sight. In one scene we have a helicopter gunner shooting at something and talking. From our view we think he is simply shooting to waste ammo, until we look out of the window and see unarmed peasants running for cover. When ask how he can kill women and children, his reply is that they take less time to die.Joker shows this dichotomy, and in fact mentions it to a colonel, by wearing a peace symbol and having the words Born to Kill inscribed on his helmet. The peace symbol symbolises his humanity, while the words symbolise the beast that he has become by joining the marines.The final scene is set in a ruined Vietnamese city where the patrol has been pinned down by a sniper. There is only one sniper present, but he is holding back all of the marines. The born killers do not seem to be able to stand up to this one person sitting somewhere in the building. To add further insult, we later discover that the sniper is actually a woman. A woman, who to a marine is little more that a piece of flesh designed to give them pleasure. Through out the movie, the women are practically non-existent, and those that are, are prostitutes. So when the sniper scene arrives, we expect the sniper to be male, and thus it surprises us that the sniper is a woman and has put the fear of God into the hearts of some of the toughest fighters around. This is another dichotomy of the movie.In fact, Full Metal Jacket seems to be a movie about dichotomy's. Fighting a war to protect the peace, killing for the sake of peace, and the man being bested by a woman. This is a very intelligent film, and is far more than a simple redneck violence feast.

He is the one character that is picked on the most during the movie. The drill sergeant seems to take an instant disliking to him, and turns the entire platoon onto him. We see the vestiges of humanity vanishing mostly in Pile and the way the platoon treats Pile. By the end of training, Pile has lost all sense of who he is, yet he has not become a cold efficient killer. In fact, he has reached a point where the only way to fulfil his life is to destroy that which has been tormenting him - the Drill Sergeant. It is interesting that Kubrick used this here because we see this more in prison type movies, such as Missing in Action II. Yet by linking Pile's final actions with movies like Missing in Action II, we come to see that the Marine Corps is more than just a job, it is a prison.The Vietnam scenes basically take what has been developed in training and puts it into the field. We basically see characters that are little more than bloodthirsty animals. Joker still seems to hold onto his humanity, yet he is a trained killer and does not flinch at the sight. In one scene we have a helicopter gunner shooting at something and talking. From our view we think he is simply shooting to waste ammo, until we look out of the window and see unarmed peasants running for cover. When ask how he can kill women and children, his reply is that they take less time to die.Joker shows this dichotomy, and in fact mentions it to a colonel, by wearing a peace symbol and having the words Born to Kill inscribed on his helmet. The peace symbol symbolises his humanity, while the words symbolise the beast that he has become by joining the marines.The final scene is set in a ruined Vietnamese city where the patrol has been pinned down by a sniper. There is only one sniper present, but he is holding back all of the marines. The born killers do not seem to be able to stand up to this one person sitting somewhere in the building. To add further insult, we later discover that the sniper is actually a woman. A woman, who to a marine is little more that a piece of flesh designed to give them pleasure. Through out the movie, the women are practically non-existent, and those that are, are prostitutes. So when the sniper scene arrives, we expect the sniper to be male, and thus it surprises us that the sniper is a woman and has put the fear of God into the hearts of some of the toughest fighters around. This is another dichotomy of the movie.In fact, Full Metal Jacket seems to be a movie about dichotomy's. Fighting a war to protect the peace, killing for the sake of peace, and the man being bested by a woman. This is a very intelligent film, and is far more than a simple redneck violence feast.

Is this a war movie from the perspective of an Emersonian philosopher or a film exploring the duality of man in a war setting? Let's just say it's a thinking man's war film that also has some of the most barbaric scenes of battle I have seen in a film. The film opens with Pvt. Witt (Caviezel) AWOL on a tropical Eden. He is among the native peoples, unconcerned about war while they frolic in the ocean and catch fish or sing songs as they pick up fallen fruit to eat. More philosopher than warrior Witt longs to escape from the madness of war and become one with his idyllic paradise. That is not to be as he is soon found out and returned to his ship for the assault on Guadalcanal.The assault on Guadalcanal is going to be led by bombastic Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte). As we hear inside Talls stream of consciousness we learn he is a career soldier passed over for promotion and itching to prove himself in battle. Nolte is stellar in this role his, manic blood lusting turn as Lt. Col. Tall is amazing in its earnestness.The storming of the beach is anti-climactic. It has the same run up and tension to the landing and assault as another great war film released that year Saving Private Ryan. However, where the pitched battle in Spielberg's film sets the table for the rest of the film, Malick's assault gives us little clue about the horror that is about to unfold. As the troops move inland they come under machine gun fire from entrenched Japanese positions on the hills above. Capt. Staros (Koteas) is reluctant to lead his men in a frontal assault of the defended position after his troops suffer tremendous losses. His superior officer Lt. Col. Tall explodes in glorious fury as he orders a direct assault. How this all plays out I will leave for you to find out for yourself. I will say that the footage of combat is amazing. The craziness of the combat, the heroism, banality and horror is laid out before the watcher in stunning fashion. At the same time Malick interjects stream of conciseness thoughts of a few of the men most notably Witt and Tall. Some may find these thoughts out of place in the picture. I found that they only enhanced the film in that we get to see the motivations and thoughts behind the actions.The Thin Red Line is also a beautiful picture. The lush tropical jungle with its blades of grass gently blowing in the wind and drops of dew glittering on the leaves is juxtaposed with shots of Woody Harrelson jumping on a live grenade and a man screaming for mercy with his entrails hanging out. How did we lose the good that was given to us, let it slip away scattered and careless? Pvt WittI can see why some war movie traditionalists might not care for this picture. We are all used to seeing the war is hell and we had to do our duty type of film that is a Hollywood standard. Malick does not take that approach with this film.

Generally it means to take off all of your clothes, but in another way it simply means going all of the way. One thing is true, not many movies can claim to have had an impact on the English language, but this one has.Now, the concept of a movie about male strippers doesn't really appeal to me. One would expect it to be rated R, but it is not. The ratings say that it contains nudity, but for an M rating all you can expect to see is bare bums, and yes that is what you do see. The Full Monty is actually about much more than simple male strippers it is about self pride, image, unemployment, and simple trust. It is a movie with a lot of depth but is also quite funny.The Full Monty is set in the city of Sheffield in Yorkshire, England. The movie opens with an expose on Sheffield being a boom town with the steel industry, but 25 years later the steel mill has closed down and the city is suffering from high unemployment. This seems to be a common idea that runs through English television &#x96; the bleakness of life and the hopelessness of unemployment. I remember before the last English election when the Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party, that they interviewed people in some of the English towns where unemployment was very high, and the people had simply lost hope. So has it happened in this movie people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live.But there is hope on the horizon Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them.I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment.It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty.Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me. This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all.The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got.The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society.

So has it happened in this movie people have lost hope to the point where they no longer wish to live.But there is hope on the horizon Gaz and Dave, the main characters, sneak into a female only strip show and realise that these guys are getting paid ten pounds a head to simply take off their cloths. This gives Gaz an idea he has much more than these guys, and he is willing to go the Full Monty, so why not get involved. So he and Dave get some people together to become male strippers with them.I expected the movie to be about them going on the nightclub circuit, becoming really famous, and then loosing everything but it is not the case. Rather it is about the relationships between the people and the work the do to get to the strip show at the end. It is about their pride and overcoming it to humiliate themselves in front of a lot of ladies. It is also about how they try to hide this from everybody to save themselves the embarrassment.It seems that hiding things from people is another aspect of this movie. Dave hides the fact that he is becoming a male stripper from his wife, thinking that she is going to deride him because he is over weight. The truth is, she really doesn't care. She don't care if he is overweight she loves him the way he is and she doesn't care if he goes the full monty.Then there is Dave and Gaz's former foreman. He has been unemployed for six months, yet he is ashamed of it and keeps this from his wife. As such she continues to go obliviously spending as if he were still working. She still has her dreams of going skiing. In the end, when she finds out, her quote is I can handle the television being reposed, but what I cannot stand is that you kept this from me. This relationship is one on assumptions. The partners assume to much about each other and discover that in the end they really don't know that much about each other at all.The shame of stripping against the shame of being unemployed is what really runs through this movie. There is the bleakness of Job Club and the dole queue, lightened up by the strippers starting to dance to a song playing over the radio. Then there is the shame that they face when they are caught practicing in an abandoned factory. Not only do they face a mocking police force, but also the story hits the front page, and everybody knows. But then, they discovered that this newspaper article is the best advertising they could have got.The Full Monty is much better that I originally expected. It is not simply a movie about male strippers, but about the characters that they are and the struggles that they face trying to find a niche in society. Rather than being a movie that one compromises on when trying to find one at a video store, it should be one that is on the too see list.

It is loosely based on Billy Hayes' book of the same name. It tells of American Hayes' (Brad Davis) arrest and subsequent conviction for trying to smuggle hashish out of Istanbul, Turkey, for which he was sent to a hellish Turkish prison to serve his time. It also stars Randy Quaid, John Hurt, Paul L. Smith and Irene Miracle. Music is scored by Giorgio Moroder and cinematography is by Michael Seresin.Although controversy followed it due to its portrayals of the Turkish people, Midnight Express is today still a raw and uncompromising experience. In fact if we strip away Moroder's Oscar winning electro bubbling score, the film holds up as a fresh and pertinent piece of film making. Parker doesn't cut corners or attempt any sort of Hollywood gloss, he keeps it grimy, oppressive and harsh in its telling, whilst the hand-held camera work keeps things jittery, harmonising with Billy Hayes and his fellow cons' state of mind. The narrative unfurls from Billy's POV, and it's mostly in a downwards direction, with that it's hard to call the picture essential entertainment, we are after all observant to mental and physical abuse, with the disintegration of the human spirit front and centre. Billy's alienation is deftly crafted by Parker, where the non use of subtitles for the Turkish characters helps us to feel as isolated as Billy was. However, there's the odd glimmer of hope and humanity, courtesy of Billy's interactions within the few friendships he forms, and of course there's the overriding urge to see him escape his hell.Stone won the Academy Award for his screenplay, and even though it has been frowned upon for some of the perceived bile unleashed on the Turks, it mostly excels on a human's under duress basis. The interactions between prisoners is often solemn and edgy, due to the characters being from different walks of life, while much of Hayes' outpourings of emotion have conviction by way of the words; even if one particular speech is ill advised and over the top. Cast are excellent, where Davis calls on the sadness in his real life upbringing to give a performance of real intensity, while Hurt and Quaid are beaten down by drug fuelled resignation and tempestuousness respectively. It has flaws, and the over dramatising of certain events tends to deviate from a real story that hardly needed extra oomph, but always Midnight Express remains a harrowing and potent piece of cinema. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 February 2012","score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Midnight Express is directed by Alan Parker and adapted to screenplay by Oliver Stone.

What a timeless classic that film was back in the 80's. It broke new grounds in time travel as a sub-genre in sci-fi movies of the 80's. But how about we experience it again? Sounded great and ludicrous at the same time. The original ended on a cliff-hanger and fans were expecting another Zemeckis masterpiece! Did they get it? ABSOLUTELY!!! I will go far as to say its even better than the original! How did it manage to do that? Well it utilizes the time-travel concept in the story very well and it tied together perfectly. Great job Zemeckis for that phenomenal directing! When people first saw it they thought it was gonna be an impossible feat for the film to match and to exceed the original! But it did! Enough of the history lets get down to brass tax! Back to the Future Part II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Back to the Future. Doc takes Marty and Jennifer(Elizabeth Shue) to 2015 to save their son's future! Meanwhile, in 2015, Marty decides to get a hold of a sports almanac and use time travel as a means of making money. Hmm... a wanna-be billionaire? Isn't that what we wanna be now-a-days? Anyway, Biff gets a hold of the almanac and goes back to 1955 and all hell breaks loose in the time lines. What makes this work is that every scene is cohesively done well and is perfectly paced! Michael J. Fox gives a great performance as Marty as always from Fox. Doc Brown is still fantastic as the mad scientist Doc Brown and my favorite character Biff is just as mean and hilarious as ever! Biff is absolutely freaking hilarious in this movie and has the most funniest quotes I have ever heard in movie history! Hey butt head! Why don't you make like a tree and get out of here! OH SO FUNNY XDXDXD Now what did I appreciate in this movie? I love the fact that every scene flows well in this series of events happening in different time periods. I loved the way they fit Old Mcfly with Young Mcfly in the future! Great filmmaking at its finest! I loved all the characters(mainly Biff).

I had never heard of it, at all. Then, about a year back, I saw it on an internet list of underrated horror films, and heard some good things about. Soon after, I saw the film referenced again, on a different website, which equally gave it much praise. When I stumbled on a third reference to how good the film was, I decided to check it out myself. I loaded it up on Netflix and started watching with a small group of friends one night... And I'm glad I did. Session 9 is a genuinely (and surprisingly) strong, developed and frightening horror\/thriller, and it should not be missed!Gordon (Peter Mullan) and Phil (David Caruso) head a hazmat cleaning team, who get a job to remove asbestos from an old, abandoned mental institution. Despite the job requiring a realistic 2-3 weeks to complete, Gordon promises that the job will be done in one week, in order to get the job from a competitor, as he needs the money for his wife and newborn child.Along with them are Hank (Josh Lucas), a nasty man who stole Phil's girlfriend, law-school dropout Mike (Stephen Grevedon, whom also co-wrote the film) and Gordon's nephew Jeff (Brendon Sexton III), a slacker kid.At first, it seems like an ordinary job, although the atmosphere of the hospital (including graffiti and abandoned rooms still adorned with decorations and possessions of former inmates) and some strange noises cause some suspicion from Gordon. As the film continues, Hank soon vanishes after attempting to steal a cache of stashed coins and jewelry he finds in the walls, and uneasiness and paranoia grow between the men, whom are all overworked and worrying about one-another. Mike also spends his time obsessed with old audio recordings of therapy sessions from a former patient suffering apparently from dissociative identity disorder (which is where the title of the film comes from- there are nine recorded therapy sessions), which may hold a key to what is happening.The film works amazing well, considering most modern horror films fall back on gore, CGI and clichés too much, which are avoided in this movie. It feels very fresh. The characters are all extremely well established and developed, and it feels very grounded in reality. You truly do care about everyone, and they all feel like real, honest-to-god people.The acting is also generally good. Mullen is very sympathetic as Gordon, and Caruso covers a lot of ground in his performance, although he does get a little hammy at times. (Including an infamous scene where he swears at Gordon, which is pure cheese, as it is overplayed way too much.) Visually, the film is very atmospheric and elegantly presented. It is a well-directed film. Although it does feel cheap- it was obviously an early digitally-shot film, and some shots have that slightly-too-smooth video look that digital features get sometimes when the cameras and lighting aren't perfect. (More recent digital features have mainly been able to fix this problem, and look almost identical to film, if not better in many cases, but I've noticed it in some digital movies from the early 2000's, before better cameras became available. Although this complaint is more of a knit-pick.)The film is also very mysterious. A lot of strange, seemingly paranormal events occur, although the film never explicitly acts like a ghost-story or haunted-house feature. (Which is why I put ghost in quotes in the title of this review.) The film presents us with a situation, and we are left to interpret whether the film can be explained by natural, earthbound phenomena, or whether the supernatural is to blame. It is left wide open for interpretation.There are some minor problems with the film, however. Like I said, the acting gets a little hammy here and there, and at times, I question the choice of shots Anderson picked for the film. (Like I said, some of the shots have that artificial-digital look you get with early digital features, while other shots are a bit... too blatant and silly-looking, including a funny zoom-in on Caruso during the aforementioned hammy curse-out scene.) Also, a few pieces of the story do get a little muddled, and some of the dialog and scares feel slightly forced. (Particularly the audio sessions Mike listens to, some of which are truly chilling and eerie, while others are goofy and a bit over the top.)However, I really cannot condemn the whole film for these small errors. All-in-all, this is a superb (though slightly problematic) modern horror\/thriller with a lot of mystery and some of the most frightening sequences I've seen in a long time. This has potential to go on to become a cult-classic horror film.I give this a strong 8 out of 10, and would recommend it for fans of horror, or for anyone who wants a scary, fun ride.

But before I go into the theology of this, I wish to look at the movie first.This move is set in Africa at the turn of the century. There is a race with the other European countries, namely Germany, to colonise Africa. A bridge must be built so that the British can move further inland. When Val Kilmer's character first looks at the river he is amazed. He says that the wonder of building bridges is to put land over water. The bridge is also seen as a chain, or a manacle for the river. An unbridged river is an obstacle but a bridge makes this obstacle no more. The bridge tames the land for the river can no longer block the progress of man. But here the land seems to fight back.Right at the beginning, the first lion attacks and is killed with one bullet. Thus Val Kilmer comes out as a hero. Soon after the two lions, the Ghost and the Darkness, come and cause havoc in the campsite. No matter what they do they cannot stop these lions. A great hunter, Remington (Michael Douglas) comes along to help get rid of these lions. He believes them to be simple lions, but when his tribe leaves, he suddenly realises what he is up against. There is a very interesting scene, but to tell you about it would give something away.These lions are considered demons by the natives, and in my mind this is possible. If we look in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, there is the story of the man possessed by the demon legion (he is called legion because he is many). The demon pleads with Christ not to send them back to hell so Christ sends them into a herd of swine. This shows us that demons can manifest themselves in animals as well as in humans. With this in mind, the animal kingdom is not as weak as we make it out to be. These lions were intelligent and would torment their enemies and then turn and indiscriminately kill. If you watch the hospital scene you will note that they kill everybody but do not take anybody away to eat. As Remington says, they do it for the pleasure of it. Even though they are demons, they are still lions, as the swine were still swine. Just because they were possessed did not mean they were unkillable. The soul cannot be destroyed but the body can. The swine ran into the lake and were drowned, the lions were also vulnerable in the same way.This movie comes out as a horror movie, but it is far more than that.

What is the plot and if there is a plot, what is it? Get Shorty is not a mindless action flick, that is not what I am referring to when I am asking about a plot. Most action flicks generally have a plot, even though they are probably extremely shallow. Get Shorty, on the other hand, has a rather strange plot with some even stranger events.Chilli (John Travolta) is a loan shark who has been upset by another mafia boss in Miami named Ray Babone (Hal Linden). Chilli breaks Babone's nose and then shoots him just to let him know that he is not in the mood to be pushed around. Unfortunately Chilli's boss, Momo, dies in Brooklyn when he walks into a surprise party and has a heart attack. Babone then convinces him to go to Los Angeles to chase a laundry operator who owes him $300,000 after he allegedly died in a airplane crash. When Chilli gets to Los Angeles he is also asked by somebody in Las Vegas to get some money from a movie producer (Gene Hackman). When he breaks into the producer's house, he is struck with the movie making bug and decides that the current events would make a good movie. Thus he begins to try to drum up interest, mostly from a famous actor named Martin Wier (Danny DeVito) and gets involved with Wier's ex-wife who is an actress (Rene Ruso). Meanwhile another loan shark is after the producer for money that was lost at a casino.Pretty twisting little plot I thought and there were some quite funny scenes in the movie. It is the twisting plot that makes this movie shine. The major thing with the movie is a satirical look at Hollywood and the loansharking business. All of the films mentioned have really corny names suggesting the meaninglessness of the movies that are made. It is also shown as a bug that influences everybody that comes into the scene. Chilli and the LA loanshark are both caught by the producing bug and want to get into the film industry. Martin Wier is a typical actor and his personality is also satirised. He is shown Chilli's rent-a-car and decides that he likes it so much that he buys one himself. When they are having lunch, he orders everything for everybody and eats none of it suggesting that the actor always wants to be in control of the movie, even though it is the producer and the director that run the show. Then there is the ending where Ray Babone goes to the locker at LA airport and is caught by the DEA agents. This is twisted around in the film being made replacing the agents with Chilli, somebody much shorter, and a bad imitation of Babone. This goes to show the delusion that Hollywood creates. In a true story, the people become vague caricatures of the people that they are based upon, and are twisted to allow the famous actors to take the spot. Martin Wier is nothing like Chilli yet Chilli knows that to capture an audience, one must turn to a famous face.Then there is the film studio ending, the removal of the veil that shrouds Hollywood. It is revealed that all it is is a movie and any bad ending is meaningless because the antagonist is only an actor who walks away afterwards. No matter how evil this bad guy is and no matter how much he is hated, what happens in the movie is only an illusion. The bad guy is only an actor and his apparent death is just some ploy shot in front of the camera. In the end, they will all pack up and go home.Thus Get Shorty is a very intelligent and satirical movie. The bad guys are not threatening, but rather a caricature of the typical Hollywood villain. The movie is focused entirely on Chilli who is fearless and able to bend even the most intimidating person to his will. The most outstanding part of this movie is Gene Hackman's role. When I do not recognise the actor then that actor is doing a very good job. This was the case with Ed Harris in The Truman Show, and it is the case in this movie. Hackman has a famous face, yet it was a face that I did not recognise in this film.

The police's failure to capture him is driving the city into chaos; mobs appear to interrogate anyone who looks in the least bit suspicious. Public outrage encourages police to step up their game against criminals everywhere, disrupting their activities. These underground organizations become so desperate that they themselves decide to lead their own investigation against the killer. Yes, I know,the premise is pretty ridiculous; it is very unlikely that a single killer, no matter successful, would be able to make this much noise, but the above paragraph describes the film's only flaw. M is a masterpiece of the thriller genre, and currently my favorite film of the 1930's. M's greatest strength is its pacing. In M, there are no subplots, no pointless romances, and no distractions. The result is a steady-paced and very focused film (the focus being the investigation(s) itself and eventually its aftermath). Of course, by today's Hollywoodien standards it would be seen as rather slow, but my own opinion is that Hollywood is perhaps just a little bit too fast.But I suspect that even to a viewer who has never seen a movie made before 1980 would be able to hold their attention through this one without a problem. There are only really two character in this film the killer (Peter Lorre) and the public. I say the public because none of the characters besides the killer are truly developed. Instead, what we get is a mob of people who belong to different factions of society (the law, the general public, and the criminals) but who all share the same opinion this murderer is a monster that needs to be dealt with. As a result, the only great performance is Peter Lorre's. But what a performance it is! Lorre's character is only on-screen in the last third of the film, and has only one scene of important dialog, but in that short amount of time Lorre leaves one hell of an impression. The film climaxes with his assertion that he can't help it! while he looks on at his accusers, wide-eyed, scared, and deranged. It is in fact his portrayal of a man to be pitied rather than feared that puts his character apart from the psychopaths of more recent cinema. One of the best of the early talkies, I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good movie regardless of its language or age.

This movie set the bar for disaster films and Hollywood has been using this formula and attempting to surpass it ever since. William Holden (James Duncan) has built a giant skyscraper that is the largest building in the world. Paul Newman (Doug Roberts) was the architect on the project. It's the grand gala opening of the Glass Tower and everyone is there for a fancy party at the top floor resturaunt. Woo that's looks like a fancy fun party it even has Fred Astaire in attendance. What could go wrong I mean OJ Simpson is working security?To Newman's dismay he soon learns that corners were cut when building the project and it has not been built to his specifications. In fact Holden's son in law Richard Chamberlain (Simmons) has been taking kick backs from the electrical contractors and the buildings wiring is substandard. What's that a small electrical fire on the 81's floor in a janitors closet? I am sure that is nothing to worry about. Well looks like it's a good thing that OJ called the fire dept because that fire is starting to get grow rapidly. Steve McQueen (Fire Chief Michael O'Hara) soon arrives on the scene to assess the fire and start kicking some ash. This is about the point when the picture really takes off on its trip to awesome town, if I told you any more plot details I would be spoiling all the fun. Let's just say that this beautiful tower of glass is now a raging inferno of death, and leave it at that. The stunts and FX in this film are top notch. Wow just check out that crazy CGI explosion. O that's right those are actual explosions and real actors and stunt people as there was no CGI. This films action holds up remarkably well after thirty eight years. The stunts are great and Newman and McQueen did a lot of them themselves as part of their well documented pissing contest on this production.While the plot maybe is a bit lacking and the dialogue a bit suspect at points those faults are glossed over by the director's penchant for killing off his stars.
