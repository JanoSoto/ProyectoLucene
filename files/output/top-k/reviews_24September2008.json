This is true, although, given the high quality of the tercet, White (Blanc) is still an excellent film, and compared with the mind-numbing comedies that Hollywood regularly cranks out, it is exceptional. And, at a mere hour and a half, this 1994 film never drags on too long. However, one of the major misconceptions about the film and its hero, Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski)- literally Charley Charley, is that he is a Chaplinesque figure. I believe that the many critics who use this term intend it as a high compliment, as they reference the greatest of the silent era screen stars, Charlie Chaplin, and his character of The Tramp. But, in doing so, they show how little they understand of the character and its portrayer.There is a range of emotion that The Tramp shows in both the short subjects and feature films he appears in that none of the actors whose performances have subsequently been compared with his have displayed. There have never been moments the equal of the roll dance in The Gold Rush, nor the ending of City Lights, where the blind girl realizes her seemingly rich benefactor is The Tramp, nor the scenes of modernity run amok in Modern Times, nor the dance with the globe in The Great Dictator. This is not to demean any of the later performances, for some, such as Giulieta Masina's role as Gelsomina in Federico Fellini's La Strada, or that of Zamachowski in White are excellent, but none rally come close to that Chaplinesque mix of lightheartedness and dark pathos. Karol, as example, is a far more dismal and dark character than any played by Chaplin. Right from the start there is something 'off' about him. In Hollywood a character like his might end up a serial killer or child molester.That all said, White is a delightful if flawed comedy, and had it been a Hollywood film it would probably rank much higher in critical opinion worldwide. It's merely because American minds have been so cauterized by bad art that a film like this has to be judged against its superior European counterparts, and its own siblings in the Three Colors trilogy, rather than the minor leagues that American cinema represents. Were it judged against the standard fart comedy mindset, or that of the tired 'romantic comedy' formulae, it would be seen in a far greater light. Regardless, it is well worth seeing, and a good way to spend an evening. When was the last romantic comedy from America that such a claim could be made for?

BULLY. The film is about a group of teenagers who decide to murder one of their own. Their victim is Bobby Kent(Nick Stahl), a sadistic, cold-blooded, extremely homophobic serial rapist. However, this motley crew of young people are completely inexperienced in such matters and decide to enlist the help of a trailer trash weirdo hit-man, who is barely older than any of them. The film is very explicit, not only in it's shocking violence, but in it's VERY graphic sex and drug use. The scenes of sex and drug use lack joy, excitement, pleasure, and humanity and the camera likes to mash our faces in all the bruised, sweaty, scummy teenage flesh. Many of the sex scenes come off quite disturbing and bizarre. There's no sense of human restraint or dignity, which makes the scenes all the more realistic. The violence and drug use are simply an embarrassment to watch. The drug use makes all the characters look completely ridiculous and foolish. The violence is cold, brutal, and messy, without any sense of style, strategy, or mercy. It's all rather gritty.BULLY is perhaps Larry Clark's darkest film. What is incredibly horrific about this film, to me, is that these characters seem to have no idea what on earth they are doing throughout the entire film. They are completely unprepared and shallow when the time comes to actually murder Bobby Kent, and then when they actually manage to eventually get it done, they make one mistake after another and it's really quite pitiful to watch. I'm not going to give away the ending, but I will say that it won't surprise the audience at all after seeing these characters' blatant clumsiness. The characters make so many stupid decisions that it almost becomes a dark comedy or dark satire. However, the fact that it happens so fast is what keeps us from having time to laugh. The characters themselves are quite bizarre. There's Marty (who is the main victim of Bobby), who beats his girlfriend and gets her pregnant. He comes off as more of a bad guy than Bobby Kent does at times, strangely. There's Lisa, Marty's clearly psychotic and very sick girlfriend. Ali, who has a child of her own and is the one who truly leads Bobby to his death. Heather, an abused, burned out ex-drug addict. Donnie, who is obviously has a good nature but is too stoned on a regular basis to think for himself. There's Lisa's cousin Derek, who just wants to constantly take the easy way out. Then there's the hit-man himself who has a slightly tougher posterior, but ends up being just as unprepared and dehumanized as the rest of the characters when the murder actually takes place. Of the characters, the only two I could really muster up any sympathy at all for were Heather and Donnie, and I could probably personally relate to Donnie the best, but they are, in reality, all equally dumb and crazed. No matter which way I slice it, the only character I end up hating more and more is the Lisa character. I did end up feeling bad for Bobby as he was getting murdered, but that was just because he had more potential and more of a future than all of the other characters, meaning that he had more of a chance of redemption and feeling real sorrow for his actions than any of the other characters. That doesn't make him any less of a bad person, but then again these are all bad people and we should only look at what they do and what the commit in this film as a reminder that parents need to be more in charge and take a stand. This film is incredible and it must be seen to be truly believed.

He A carnival knife thrower. Would you like to be my target, he asks. Sounds like a match made in heaven. Patrice Leconte's La Fille sur le Ponte may be a bit of quirky romantic fluff, but its great fluff. It's a diverting entertainment without much purchase, thank goodness, for the admiration of deeper meanings with which some Anglo cinephiles deaden the experience of good French movies. It's the story of two people who probably could only exist in the movies. Adele (Vanessa Paradis) is 21, endlessly compliant and endlessly unlucky in love (and with just about everything else, too.) She's a charming gamin, especially if you're the guy trying to pick her up. Boys attract me, she says, like beautiful clothes. I always want to try them on. At last she figures out that, for her, while sex is a friendly thing, it never seems to last or to work into anything else. Funny, isn't it, how people can seem madly in love when they're not. It must be easy to fake. So there she is one evening about to jump off a bridge. Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), an older man, tries to talk her out of jumping. He'd like her to be his target. With her figure and his skill, they'll be a hit...although, he points out, past the age of 40 knife throwing becomes erratic. She decides to jump anyway. He rescues her and before long they are an act. Adele continues to offer her innocently explicit friendship to those she encounters. She discovers a gift for luck. Gabor? Well, Adele and Gabor develop a distinctly odd approach to intimacy...knife throwing. Giving and receiving seems to bring out all the heavy breathing and beads of perspiration one would expect from the other activity. Note Do not try this at home just to find out for yourself. What starts as a clever, funny suicidal set up moves into a clever, amusing story about knife throwing as a metaphor for sex and roulette as a metaphor for...well, maybe a relationship. It's so off-kilter, and Adele and Gabor are so attractive and interesting, that their quirky relationship is almost a guilty pleasure to watch. Will Adele decide to move a little so she can find out if one of Gabor's thrown knives is better than a young man's.... Will Gabor ever decide to try something other than a knife to intrigue Adele with.... Will Leconte's amusing mixture of luck, cold steel, eroticism, clever dialogue and shrewd acting come to a happy ending? When things begin to edge a little too close to what passes as seriousness in the movies, about three-quarters of the way through, Leconte has the good sense to pull back. This, after all, is a quirky romantic comedy done with flourishes and knives. You should see the movie. It's well worth it. Daniel Auteuil, one of the screen's great actors, manages to make of Gabor a man with an interestingly unspoken life for us to think about. When a movie depends on quick, clever dialogue, it needs to be delivered matter-of-factly, with no delays for glances, sighs or eye work. Auteuil's matter-of-factness is as deliberately amusing as his lines. Paradis, on the other hand, must make this young woman who lies down so willingly someone we like. Not only does Paradis give us pleasure in sex, when she's around she makes us feel almost young, innocent and erotic ourselves. And how nice it is to see a beautiful star actress without perfect teeth. Some critics have noted the several affectionate references to well known French films Leconte places in The Girl on the Bridge. I wouldn't know. I was too busy enjoying the movie. However, for those who might be intrigued enough to watch some of Leconte's other movies, he'll give you a variety of emotions to deal with. My favorites include Monsieur Hire, full of uneasiness and uncomfortable feelings; The Widow of Saint-Pierre, which comes close to tragedy; Ridicule, as malicious and amusing as you could wish; and my favorite to date, Man on the Train, a wonderful, thoughtful movie of sadness, regret and fulfillment. The Girl on the Bridge is beautifully photographed in black and white.

This, after all, is a quirky romantic comedy done with flourishes and knives. You should see the movie. It's well worth it. Daniel Auteuil, one of the screen's great actors, manages to make of Gabor a man with an interestingly unspoken life for us to think about. When a movie depends on quick, clever dialogue, it needs to be delivered matter-of-factly, with no delays for glances, sighs or eye work. Auteuil's matter-of-factness is as deliberately amusing as his lines. Paradis, on the other hand, must make this young woman who lies down so willingly someone we like. Not only does Paradis give us pleasure in sex, when she's around she makes us feel almost young, innocent and erotic ourselves. And how nice it is to see a beautiful star actress without perfect teeth. Some critics have noted the several affectionate references to well known French films Leconte places in The Girl on the Bridge. I wouldn't know. I was too busy enjoying the movie. However, for those who might be intrigued enough to watch some of Leconte's other movies, he'll give you a variety of emotions to deal with. My favorites include Monsieur Hire, full of uneasiness and uncomfortable feelings; The Widow of Saint-Pierre, which comes close to tragedy; Ridicule, as malicious and amusing as you could wish; and my favorite to date, Man on the Train, a wonderful, thoughtful movie of sadness, regret and fulfillment.

He A carnival knife thrower. Would you like to be my target, he asks. Sounds like a match made in heaven. Patrice Leconte's La Fille sur le Ponte may be a bit of quirky romantic fluff, but its great fluff. It's a diverting entertainment without much purchase, thank goodness, for the admiration of deeper meanings with which some Anglo cinephiles deaden the experience of good French movies. It's the story of two people who probably could only exist in the movies. Adele (Vanessa Paradis) is 21, endlessly compliant and endlessly unlucky in love (and with just about everything else, too.) She's a charming gamin, especially if you're the guy trying to pick her up. Boys attract me, she says, like beautiful clothes. I always want to try them on. At last she figures out that, for her, while sex is a friendly thing, it never seems to last or to work into anything else. Funny, isn't it, how people can seem madly in love when they're not. It must be easy to fake. So there she is one evening about to jump off a bridge. Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), an older man, tries to talk her out of jumping. He'd like her to be his target. With her figure and his skill, they'll be a hit...although, he points out, past the age of 40 knife throwing becomes erratic. She decides to jump anyway. He rescues her and before long they are an act. Adele continues to offer her innocently explicit friendship to those she encounters. She discovers a gift for luck. Gabor? Well, Adele and Gabor develop a distinctly odd approach to intimacy...knife throwing. Giving and receiving seems to bring out all the heavy breathing and beads of perspiration one would expect from the other activity. Note Do not try this at home just to find out for yourself. What starts as a clever, funny suicidal set up moves into a clever, amusing story about knife throwing as a metaphor for sex and roulette as a metaphor for...well, maybe a relationship. It's so off-kilter, and Adele and Gabor are so attractive and interesting, that their quirky relationship is almost a guilty pleasure to watch. Will Adele decide to move a little so she can find out if one of Gabor's thrown knives is better than a young man's.... Will Gabor ever decide to try something other than a knife to intrigue Adele with....

It will suffice to say the story has been simplified enough. Valid reason would be that The Count of Monte Cristo is a rather long story which would have been impossible to fit in your average length film. That's not the qualm I have with the film. Cast is average, but not bad. I could live with that, too. I'm quite used by now to how Hollywood usually treats stories like this one.The main reason I think this movie is bad enough to get 5\/10* is that somehow the main point of it is missed. All the while during the film I was getting the feeling that the story is about love, and not revenge. That it's about how a hero will overcome all obstacles, no matter how big or difficult to be finally reunited with his true love. Revenge was moved somewhere in the background, relegated to secondary goal of Edmond Dantes. Now that is something that I have trouble accepting. I don't mind all those details I already mentioned during hollywood-isation of books, but I can't stand when they change the point, theme or motif of the book in order to appeal more to teenagers.If you're a fan of the story of The Count of Monte Cristo you probably won't enjoy the film.

Capitalizing on the tidal wave of Eisenhower-era nostalgia pervasive on both big and small screens at the time, it manages to be stridently artificial and mindlessly entertaining at the same time, although it still boggles the mind that it has had such an afterlife, including sing-along versions playing at art-house movie theaters. Part of the ironic amusement is watching actors obviously in their late twenties and early thirties pretending to be teenagers. Credit should be given to director Randal Kleiser for his unapologetic stance on maneuvering the contrived silliness with spirit if not much finesse. Set in a period of the 1950's that existed only in Hollywood and lacking any semblance of reality or dramatic conflict, the threadbare plot focuses on greaser Danny, the cool leader of the T-Birds, and wholesome Sandy, a good-girl Aussie blonde enjoying a summer romance on the beach prior to senior year at Rydell High. Sandy was supposed to move back to Australia, but she ends up staying stateside and attending Rydell. With image being of the utmost importance, Danny initially rejects Sandy - now a cheerleader - when they meet again, and we follow all their romantic complications over the course of the school year until graduation. There is also the ongoing power struggle between the T-Birds and the rival gang, the Scorpions, as well as the peer-pressure shenanigans caused by the T-Birds' girlfriends, the Pink Ladies, headed by sleep-around tart, Rizzo. All of this merely provides an excuse for the various musical numbers, the most energetic being the ensemble pieces like the cleverly edited Summer Nights and the stylized Jailhouse Rock knock-off, Greased Lightning. Most of the numbers are from the Broadway show, though there are some deliberately anachronistic insertions such as Barry Gibb's disco-accented title tune and the peppy funhouse duet, You're the One That I Want. John Travolta is perfectly cast as Danny, even if his singing voice threatens to evaporate from his sincerity. Olivia Newton-John has the right manner and looks for Sandy, though she is hardly challenged to develop a compelling character here. The standout is Stockard Channing as Rizzo, the only character that has any connection to the reality of the times, and she expertly sings the mocking Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee and frankly outdoes Newton-John on the touching There Are Worse Things I Could Do. Several familiar faces fill out the cast - Eve Arden in Miss Brooks mode as Principal McGee, Sid Caesar rather constrained as Coach Calhoun, Joan Blondell equally pallid as malt shop waitress Vi, Edd Byrnes as a Dick Clark-type lothario, Alice Ghostley as the auto shop teacher, Dody Goodman as the ditzy school administrator, and of course, Frankie Avalon serenading Beauty School Dropout to squeaky-voiced Didi Conn's Frenchy. Serious examination of the film is useless since it is more a cheery variety show with superficial references to the sexual politics of the 1950's. The new 2006 Rockin' Rydell Edition DVD package comes with extras that should satisfy fans. There is an insightful commentary track by Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch; eleven minutes worth of deleted scenes in black-and-white; a nostalgic Grease Day featurette that contains interviews with Travolta, Newton-John and producers Allen Carr and Robert Stigwood; and coverage of the 25th Anniversary DVD launch party, which includes spirited performances by Newton-John, Travolta and the remaining cast.

Bailey) wants Lassard's job, so he is determined to see the COP program fail. Besides that, it seems the main villains are some skateboarding troublemakers, hardly what you'd call evil master criminals, just naughty kids. What surprised me was the appearance of young pre-Total Recall Sharon Stone, as Claire Mattson, a small love interest I guess of Mahoney. Also starring Derek McGrath as Butterworth, Colleen Camp as Mrs. Kirkland-Tackleberry, Home Alone's Billie Bird as Mrs. Lois Feldman, George R. Robertson as Police Commissioner Hurst, The Emperor's David Spade as Kyle and Ace Ventura Pet Detective's Randall 'Tex' Cobb as Zack. Guttenberg hardly has any highlights, well, neither do many of the other regulars, and you could tell Guttenberg wanted to move on to other films, Winslow adds some entertainment with his self-made sound effects, including a rap while some civilians are exercising, but it's very pointless. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Original Song for Let's Go To Heaven In My Car, why wasn't it nominated any others, same for the two previous and just as awful sequels. Poor!

As any crime drama it opens with a puzzle a scene unfolds and the viewer watches tentatively, every detail potentially being the one that blows the mystery wide open. Soon we find ourselves a fly on the wall, watching an interrogation between a slimy character named Verbal and a rather generic law enforcer. The conversation twists and turns from hostility, to bargaining, to mutuality as angles are played on both sides to try and outsmart the other.Verbal begins to replay his story, and we immediately mistake a point of view for objectivity. Before long a daring plan for a heist arises, as does the name Keyser Soze, a legendary villain unphased even by murdering his own family to proclaim to the world just how much of a big bad wolf he really is. The story itself becomes harder and harder to follow, as motivations and means twist more and more. The mind strains trying to follow it all, blissfully unaware of whats to come. The film presents itself as something to be solved, and we all race to try and beat the movie at its own game. The conclusion, argued by many as brilliant, is nothing more than a Deus Ex Machina. Its the film equivalent of and it was all a dream, with just a little more window dressing. We discover Verbal has used his surroundings to manufacture the entire story, and even more importantly, is in fact Keyser Soze.A stunning realization, no doubt. The more I thought about the shocking final minutes, the more I came to reason that I hadn't been fooled, I had been cheated. A plot twist makes new sense of something you've seen before, but in The Usual Suspects there's nothing to indicate we are seeing Verbals description, and not simply the past.Think of all the movies where a person begins describing a scene, and it cuts back to that scene happening. Are we looking at what actually happened, or what the character is describing? Its difficult to say for certain, but it is hardly unreasonable to expect the former. Playing on such a fickle element of cinematography is risky business, and I was hardly sold.So much rides on the final minutes, and many are impressed because it dares to do what few other movies consider to make an hour long turn of events completely irrelevant. We don't see it coming, but whilst the writers were wondering if they could, they never stopped to wonder if they should.

But I enjoyed watching this particular film. The story takes place in Illinois, although it conspicuously looks like southern California. The acting was very decent and believable. It was very creepy. But best of all it manages to keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. There is a lot of suspense. On the downside, the plot is a bit thin. And I wished the protagonist, Laurie, was a little smarter, particularly towards the end. I know she wanted to protect the kids but fleeing directly to her house, when she could have just run somewhere else and have Michael follow her? Also once in the house, Laurie pokes him in the eye and then gets up to find the kids. Why not make sure he is dead first? And when she had the chance, she should have taken the knife away. But overall a decent film even with these issues. 7.5 of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Horror is usually not my subject.
