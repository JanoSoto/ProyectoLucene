Jerry Bruckheimer really knows how to impress his audience, with previous action hits like The Rock and Top Gun, and now Con Air. Scott Rosenberg's electric screenplay is the aspect of Con Air that really sets it alone. Smart, inventive, and downright entertaining, Rosenberg presents a story that takes us back to films like The Wild Bunch and the Dirty Dozen, where we get to know all the characters and get to like them all too. Bruckheimer and director Simon West really pile on the hardware, and make Con Air one of the most appealing and best looking films of 1997. The aspect of maximum security prisoners- including murderers, rapists, and serial killers- really appeals to teenage audiences. But despite their crimes, the characters become quite lovable, which then turns Con Air into an action\/comedy. Spectacular action scenes on the plane, in the desert, and most importantly, Las Vegas, really make Con Air a top action movie. Although containing some love scenes, it doesn't drag Con Air down much more than any other movie. Con Air's film editing is quick and effective, adding another action movie aspect to it. Con Air really gets the audience involved in the movie, and never lets the audience stop and think. It's real in-your-face action, which never lets up. Con Air is really a prime example of the action genre.

Even though it is a bit long- taking 3-4 mins to get into the real action- it does provide some stunning explosions and inventive action scenes. The cruise missile strike does top all movie explosions to date -totally annihilating everything in it's path- except Bond of course. But surprisingly, this is the down side to the film. This spectacular sequence forces the rest of the film to be better than it.......which doesn't seem to work. The rest of the film was very disappointing, for me, because after waiting 2 years for the film (a film that i thought would be better than GoldenEye, which was awesome!) i walked out of the cinema dissatisfied. Jonathan Pryce's portrayal of Elliot Carver (said to be Rupert Murdoch on steroids!) bored me. He didn't have the wit and power that some previous villains had- such as Goldfinger, Jaws, and Blofeld. Michelle Yeoh's character was a pointless idea......maybe just to make TND longer (even with her character they were just pushing 2 hours). Roger Spottiswoode's direction is the worst I have ever witnessed in a Bond film. He has used some stupid expressions and camera angles that make the action look somewhat insignificant. He has also adopted some of Martin Campbell's directions from GoldenEye (much of Q's scene, Bond's smart comments, and Carver's monotonal speeches). The sexual innuendos were over the top in TND, every few minutes there would be another sexual joke of some sort. Despite all this bad stuff, there were some good scenes- the car chase, the bike chase, and when Bond and Wai Lin are brought before Carver in his Saigon tower. Overall, TND could've been much better, and I really hope that Bond 19 will be the ultimate adventure. But let's not get our hopes up.

Not that it's terribly original in that  (or anything else for that matter), but its gothic sense is pushed into overdrive later in the film, expresses some simple, not too challenging but interesting ideas, gives you an action climax which is loathable for it being an action climax, but entertaining in its setup and execution, interesting designs (I like how the ship is shaped like a cross) and some extreme imagery and style.  Where the film excels, in my opinion, is its excessiveness.  It pushes the gore and horror over the edge beyond what you would have first imagined, and gives you genuine terror with this concept and showing you in a somewhat restrained manner, how it is.  This energy is good enough for me to enjoy the film without necessarily calling it a good film.

I've now seen it 3 times and that's not the easiest thing to do when you've got a newborn baby!! 3 hour movies kind of cut it fine between feeds! But I managed because Titanic is a sublime film experience and I've never felt so touched by a movie; in fact 3 and a bit hours wasn't long enough and I hope there will be a director's cut because there is a fair bit of important historical facts and features omitted but I read they were left on the cutting-room floor. I'm no Leo fan and at first it seemed inappropriate casting him with Kate Winslet, who was wonderful as usual, but 2 viewings later it seemed right and I was into the love story side of it. Winslet and DiCaprio work well together and are believable if you can get past the notion that he looks 15 and she seems so mature when in fact I think they are about the same age. The special effects, direction, editing and especially the costumes and sets were truly awe-inspiring. I could go on and on about the good features of the film such as how close some actors looked to the characters they played e.g. Capt. Smith, J. Bruce Ismay, Thomas Andrews, Margaret Brown, Ida and Isidor Straus and more. The only downside to Titanic was some sections of the script that were corny and ham-fisted but no film is entirely faultless and I think Titanic deserved all the Oscars it received and, contrary to popular belief, it is not only Leo-maniacs who give this movie it's box-office success and seeing it doesn't turn you into one either. There are many scenes from Titanic that will probably stay with me forever; this film grabs you and won't let you go. The class stereotypes were unfortunate and we don't get an accurate picture of the way many people behaved during the sinking; Cameron seemed to ignore the fact that many first-class men willingly gave their lives and the way First Officer Murdoch was portrayed was disgusting.
