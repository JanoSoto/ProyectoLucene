In some films, that would work wonderfully. The atmosphere here is something like Looney Toones as made by David Cronenburg.

The odd sense of humor makes it sort of fun. It also makes it feel like a different film; it doesn't feel like a copycat of the previous films.But it goes on forever. In between dreams, it drags, and when it gets to the dreams, they manage to be weird but not suspenseful or creepy. They're somewhat imaginative, but not enough. Sometimes they kind of work for a little while, but most of them are failures. The video game sequence is just plain stupid, and most of them aren't much better. On top of that, Freddy has more one-liners than all the other films combined --- yes, even more than he had in part 4 --- and every single one of them is absolutely lame. And never is anything even remotely creepy in the film.But it might have been at least somewhat worthwhile if Freddy's inevitable death had been cool. But it isn't. His death in any of the other films in the series would have been better --- destroyed with holy water, torn apart by the souls he has taken, taken away by his mother, castrated and burned alive, or, best of all, what happened in the original he isn't feared anymore. What happens here, though, is just dull. The entire climax just falls absolutely flat. Even Part 2 would have been a more satisfying end for the series. While the other poor ones are frustrating, I genuinely wish this one never existed.Although, Johnny Depp does have a 15-second cameo that was pretty funny. And Breckin Meyer was amusing as a stoner.But man, why couldn't they have found any better way to end the regular series? I mean, honestly, Freddy vs. Jason was more satisfying, and it didn't even have a frickin' ending! Now, you know what's really sad about this film? It's still better than 99.9% of slasher films.

Which clan attacks who, which clan will dominate, who's flag is who's? But I did know the central story of Kagemusha, the shadow warrior, who is made by the (hidden) late Lord Shingen's advisers into the Lord himself to fool his enemies and even everyone else around him, was worth telling. So on the second time around as the story wasn't as much of the issue I watched the film to really get more into it, as it is a three-hour epic (Kurosawa's second longest film, minus the unseen cut of the Idiot), It's not necessarily a dense film though, which adds to the appeal of it- each scene has enough nuance and irony to cut into the impending tragedy that looms over the Takeda clan.It's been said, most of all by Kurosawa himself, that this film was a dress rehearsal for his late masterpiece Ran. Ran is the more artistically overwhelming and incredible film, but Kagemusha on its own two feet is still a staggering achievement for a director with many great films. And he pushes ahead from his 70's films as his third color film, taking from his impressive storyboards (you can see the reprints in the Criterion DVD package), creating scene after scene where colors are heightened and returned and made precisely for specific moods and settings of the scenes.

But the greatest sequence in the film, one that does go on par with the best sequence in Ran (the burning of the castle), is the final climactic battle-turned-slaughter. It's ironic that for a director synonymous with the samurai drama that he doesn't show any contact from the bullets to the charging samurai on horseback. It's all in the aftermath, the horses in slow-motion in the last throws of life, and body after body strewn with blood. Following this with Kagemusha's final stand as he runs madly through the field towards his end, it all marks as one of the supreme set-pieces ever done depicting the horror of sacrifice and futility of war.

Once this is done, The Gauntlet is exciting and entertaining. Clint Eastwood plays the role of loser Ben Shockley to perfection. Not only is Shockley a washed-up drunken bum, he is also short on savvy, easy for a college educated Las Vegas prostitute, Gus Mally (Sondra Locke), to manipulate. Eastwood and then live-in lover Locke make a good team, keeping everything light and breezy.Setting Shockley up as a fall guy, the Phoenix police commissioner sends him to pick up a prisoner in Vegas. Not knowing that the prisoner, Gus, is the key witness in a trial involving mobsters with police connections, Shockley becomes suspicious when he learns that the Vegas gamblers have put odds on the delivery, eventually 100 to one; plus he discovers that Gus is short for Augustina. In the process of escorting his prisoner out of Vegas, Shockley and Gus begin falling for each other which leads Gus to begin helping thick-headed Shockley evade the traps waiting for them.One of the holes in the plot involves the idea of the gauntlet. Why should Shockley tell his only friend on the Phoenix police force, Josephson (Pat Hingle), the exact route he is taking to deliver his prisoner to city hall? It does make for a thrilling denouement for the film. Shockley and Gus jack a bus, empty it of passengers, then Shockley puts armor on it to defy the army of cops lined up on each side of the street to kill him and his prisoner.Sondra Locke, who later seemed to use her romantic ties to Eastwood for self-aggrandizement, does some fine acting in this film. She makes her unbelievable role of Gus believable, especially during the rape scene in a box car. Bill McKinney, who became one of the most notorious villains in cinema history by playing the perverted mountain man in Deliverance, turns in another winning performance as a Nevada constable who likes to talk dirty while citing the law. One the other hand, Pat Hingle is somewhat waisted in a one-dimensional role. The rest of the cast is adequate with particularly effective acting by a gang of bikers corralled by Shockley who even expropriates a hog from them. Since this is basically a Clint Eastwood, Sondra Locke flick, the spotlight is always on them.

Once this is done, The Gauntlet is exciting and entertaining. Clint Eastwood plays the role of loser Ben Shockley to perfection. Not only is Shockley a washed-up drunken bum, he is also short on savvy, easy for a college educated Las Vegas prostitute, Gus Mally (Sondra Locke), to manipulate. Eastwood and then live-in lover Locke make a good team, keeping everything light and breezy.Setting Shockley up as a fall guy, the Phoenix police commissioner sends him to pick up a prisoner in Vegas. Not knowing that the prisoner, Gus, is the key witness in a trial involving mobsters with police connections, Shockley becomes suspicious when he learns that the Vegas gamblers have put odds on the delivery, eventually 100 to one; plus he discovers that Gus is short for Augustina. In the process of escorting his prisoner out of Vegas, Shockley and Gus begin falling for each other which leads Gus to begin helping thick-headed Shockley evade the traps waiting for them.One of the holes in the plot involves the idea of the gauntlet.

It does make for a thrilling denouement for the film. Shockley and Gus jack a bus, empty it of passengers, then Shockley puts armor on it to defy the army of cops lined up on each side of the street to kill him and his prisoner.Sondra Locke, who later seemed to use her romantic ties to Eastwood for self-aggrandizement, does some fine acting in this film. She makes her unbelievable role of Gus believable, especially during the rape scene in a box car. Bill McKinney, who became one of the most notorious villains in cinema history by playing the perverted mountain man in Deliverance, turns in another winning performance as a Nevada constable who likes to talk dirty while citing the law. One the other hand, Pat Hingle is somewhat waisted in a one-dimensional role. The rest of the cast is adequate with particularly effective acting by a gang of bikers corralled by Shockley who even expropriates a hog from them.

However, when she becomes pregnant, Freddy (Robert Englund) uses her unborn child to return yet again.This film is amazing. I mean this is really something. I had no idea that, in terms of writing, the film could actually sink to lower depths than part 4. That is truly incredible. This is one seriously stupid movie. It has some interesting ideas, but a lot of really bad ones, and everything just keeps getting worse and worse.And yet, oddly, the film is actually better than part 4. Why? Better direction. Director Stephen Hopkins takes the piece of junk he's given, and creates atmosphere, intensity, and absolutely beautiful visuals. On top of that, unlike Renny Harlin or Chuck Russel, he actually cares about how the actors read their lines. The acting is as good as you could get with the material. Wilcox was pretty stiff in part 4, but here, she's actually very good. The supporting cast is generally solid as well. And, of course, Englund is clearly having a blast, as always.Hopkins also manages to take the little he's been given and actually create an emotional involvement with the characters. That, mixed with the wonderful images he puts on screen (with help from great cinematography), makes the film genuinely work at times. There are moments when the film works better than any of the other sequels (excepting New Nightmare). He comes close to creating a genuinely good film, and the only sequel (again, except for New Nightmare) to find some of the creepy dream\/reality confusion that made the first one so good.Unfotunately, great direction can only bring a film so far, and, with the script constantly getting worse and worse, the movie just dies by the end. Hopkins still does enough that it's always watchable and occasionally even compelling, but he can't make up for how poorly this was written. However, he does manage to bring Freddy back to life the way none of the previous two films were. If feels as though there may still be life in the series.However, this series has the exactly opposite curse of the Star Trek series. The Star Trek films have an oddity about them the even-numbered ones are almost always better than the odd-numbered ones. In the Nightmare series, the opposite occurs the odd ones are far better than the even ones. Consequently, I'm not looking forward to seeing number 6.

Everything to do with the plot is laid out for us basically right away. Now, all there is to do is sit back and watch those classic John Woo action sequences. In this movie, Ethan Hunt is once again a secret agent, and he is sent on a mission to stop a crooked agent from stealing a deadly virus for his own use.I liked the first Mission Impossible better because it had a more advanced plot. This Mission Impossible is just a bland shoot 'em up action film. Now there's nothing wrong with that. The movie was still immensely entertaining. It just didn't fit in with the first film.

I heard it was the greatest movie of all time and there was no criticisms. i saw this just last month, and it is a near perfect film! I have never seen such a powerful, believable, and moving movie since Schindler's List and Braveheart! The film captures the classical viewpoint of the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo in a very dark, but epic way, revealing the mafia as a manipulating and greedy domain of not just villains, but also of their families. The film is almost a family film in such a way that it is about family, the power of it, and that it should be loved and honored. Taht is one of the main reasons why this is such a glamorous film! The story takes place in the 1940s and 50s, and is about a mafia family called the Coreleone's who came from Sicily. They're a very powerful mafia in New York city led by an aging, persuasive man, Vito Coreleone played by the ultimate Marlon Brando.The story kicks off with the issues and members of the Coreleone family. When Vito Coreleone is gunned down by another mafia family, all hell breaks loose, bringing together the family from the hot-tempered Sonny (James Caan) who is the runner up for leading the Coreleone family, Michael (Al Pacino) who does everything in his power to not join the mob, and Tom Hagen (Rob Duvall), whose the advisable councilor.The story follows these individuals and even more towards the history of this family, with its comings and goings of friends and foes, and issues and solutions.The acting top-notched is excellent, especially by Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar. The story is gripping, the settings and costumes are vivid, the cinematography has that gloomy and dark feel, the pace is moderate, the score is dramatic, and the director was well chosen for this film!
