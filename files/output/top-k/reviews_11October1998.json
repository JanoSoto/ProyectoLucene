Logan's Run is one of those few.Before Stars Wars enraptured audiences with its stunning special effects and created a precedent for a string of similarly effects-laden knock-offs and genre wanna-be's (mirroring what The War of the Worlds had done for audiences in the 50's), true science fiction films such as Logan's Run were giving us stories simply complimented by special effects, not about them.  I say true because Star Wars is of the fantasy genre; it is not a science fiction story, though it does share some common elements.Logan's Run presents us with a vivid, somewhat horrifying vision of a possible future.  It doesn't take place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  It happens on earth in a believable time frame.  It doesn't ask us to greatly suspend disbelief by accepting alien races and magic powers. Instead, it presents us with a chilling fast forward of our own technology, attitudes, and policies.  Concerning the latter, the film includes an almost creepy euthanasia undertone to it.Though, in all honesty, I care more about and become more closely associated with the characters in Star Wars, the disassociation I feel for LR's characters somewhat aids the lack of individuality that the story tries to convey.  The actors, however, give great performances.Beautiful cinematography and settings greatly compliment the film's mood and timeframe, from the sterile domed city to the decimated Washington D.C., which still provides one of (if not) the best visuals of a post-apocalyptic world that I've ever seen.  It's right there with The Planet of the Apes' Statue of Liberty.Another thing that SW does well is disassociate itself from the decade in which it was created.  You have to overlook this aspect in LR because like so many films of the 70's, it carries its decade's time stamp.Though minor, another thing I, in particular, enjoy about LR are the weapons.  Unlike every other weapon in and out of science fiction history, LR's blasters do not actually shoot anything.  There is simply an explosion at their designated target.  It may be campy (or corny), but it's definitely different and a fine example of real, working props.Another interesting note the film varies greatly from the original novel, but most people agree that the film is much better.  I tend to agree with them.For me, in terms of science fiction, Logan's Run takes its place among such decade-defining films as The War of the Worlds (50's) and The Planet of the Apes (60's) and among such thought-provoking science fiction as Soylent Green and Gattaca.Ask yourself this what or where is sanctuary?

This film is a comedy about two 40-something guys fallen on their own miseries, four 20-something boys and girls falling in love, two 70-sth grandpas having fun (alcohol does work) and two cats, one black, one white. Kusturica compose all of the above elements to make a comedy about living, loving and taking the money. I would say that this specific film is more lovable than the other films (perhaps Underground as an exception) because it captures 100% the joy of living (who does that better than the Gypsies?). The soundtrack for one more time reaches sky high though not Bregovic. So, leave us alone and go see the film!

This is the worse horror movie I have ever seen. It didn't worked for the second time, not even the third time. Why would it work for the fourth time? The problem is that some directors are only doing this job because they think that some day, they will win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe or any other prize. If they work only for that, they will get nothing. It makes me go down when I know that a dumb movie is about to come. Most of all, the sequels. I only saw few sequels that worked. I'm gonna name three The Godfather part II and III, Indiana Jones and Star Wars. Beside those and some others, no sequel has ever worked.

For example, co-writer, subject, co-producer, director and choreographer Fosse produces an endless endling, overloaded with songs, dances and drama.Roy Scheider plays a brilliant and self-destructive theater & film director Fosse modeled after himself. The film's final death sequence goes on for 20 minutes or so; its many scenes are fascinating (8 1\/2-ish) to look at, but too many to fully enjoy.There's the operation to save Fosse; Ben Vareen's swarmy song and dance tribute to Fosse; Fosse the movie director shooting Fosse the patient; at least three separate dance numbers, each building on the other, as Fosse hallucinates others' commentaries on his life (with one number straight out of Busby Berkely). It goes on and on. Each is beautiful, perhaps a little too heavy with meaning, but always absorbing.Leading up to that, we see Fosse not so much juggling as diving in and diving out of relationships with his ex-wife, a new young lover, an long-time faithful lover, his new musical, his new movie and his pre-teen daughter. In between he rumages through his life with Jessica Lange, a beautiful, dressed-in-white angel of death.The film portrays Fosse too simplistically a creative genious and a failed, albeit charming, human being. Mere contradictions don't make for subtleties.But its portrayal of show business's inner workings -- dance rehearsals, film editing, business dealings -- are totally absorbing. An oh-so-young John Lithgow's appearance as a director who might take over from Fosse oozes enough phony sincerety to grease a hundred frying pans.And throughout, the film has a rich visual style that ranges from appropriately glitzy to dream-like to straight dramatic.Finally, the dance numbers, specially staged for the camera, reveal that dance can be cinematic instead of static.The brilliant dancing and musical scenes clearly override Fosse's instinct to overdo and overtell. This 19-year-old movie, even when seen on cable TV (in a letterboxed version) has more in it, and more to it, that all of today's over-budgeted, underfed blockblusers.

One week his parents go away and taking his friends advice of saying, What the ****? He starts in with liquor, music, dad's car, and ladies. It's a great depiction of the good student with a little free time and a lot of oat sowing to do before the real world beckons him. Tom Cruise does a good job as the pretentious and idealistic Joel, learning love from the hooker Rebecca De Moirnay, and getting into trouble. I know its a very relative subject for seniors gearing up for college, so its accomplishes it mission as a message film. Overall its **1\/2 , doing well in its category, but not appealing to all.
