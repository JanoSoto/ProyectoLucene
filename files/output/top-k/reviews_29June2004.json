A great story,beautiful settings,superb acting overall,brilliant directing,a haunting and unforgettable score,legendary characters,first class and much imitated dialogues and sublime camera work.Every segment and every scene of it confirm the absolute brilliance of Taxi Driver.The movie is about a guy who lives in New York in the seventies.But he's not normal.Although it is not seen as an important scene or an important sentence the core of the movie lies in the early stages.Here we are introduced to Travis Bickle,played by a brilliant Robert De Niro.The dispatcher takes a look at Bickle's credentials and notices that he's a Vietnam veteran.This moment is crucial for the entire movie as the eventual brutal climax is all based on Bickle's experiences in Vietnam.It is the ultimate decline of an American guy tormented during the war and returning as a complete lunatic. The entire movie is based on this one confession if you will.In two hours cinema you see someone changing from a sad into a crazy man.Bickle accepts the job as a night Taxi Driver,with cab number 3596 hence my user name,since he can't sleep(all because of the war).In the scenes that follow we observe Bickle as he goes crazy,all caused by his experiences in Vietnam and strengthened by his observations of the declined city,depicted as a hell on earth.Travis is disgussed by what he seesOne day, a real rain is going to come through and wash all the scum off the streets. But then he sees the light at the end of the tunnel,in the shape of a woman called Betsy (played by Cybill Shepherd).He is overwhelmed by her appearance and asks her out but eventually she turns him down after viewing a dirty movie.She doesn't understand him or his problems.This is the moment that Travis slowly but surely freaks out,he wants to kill the senator\/presidential candidate just because Betsy works for him. But he doesn't go through with it.The ultimate point of no return is when he meets up with the young hooker Iris (A very young but convincing Jodie Foster).He already met her briefly during one of his nightly shifts and now he wants to save her,she is the physical shape of hope in the world.In one moment of rage and lunacy Travis kills her pimp Sport (played by Harvey Keitel) and some other people.This scene is not only the highpoint of Travis' decline but also cinematically the highlight of the movie.Iris is saved from the clutches of evil and Travis has become a hero.What follows is a coda that is,in my view,the only weak point of the movie since it isn't really necessary.But it is acceptable as a closer.In my demonic mind I would have rather had it that Travis had died in the massacre instead of continuing his life as a hero for the ordinary people.But maybe I'm too pessimistic!For this kind of story no place is better like New York in the 1970's.Although I was born in 1980 and never experienced the feeling of the city at that time I can vision it myself because of the movies made during that decade.Other brilliant movies set in New York during the 1970's areThe French Connection(1971),Death Wish(1974) and Midnight Cowboy(1969).Sure,Midnight Cowboy isn't from the 1970's but it really exhales the sad realism of New York at that time.I must say that not each movie made in that time about New York depict a desperate view of the city.Especially films by Woody Allen like Annie Hall(1977) and Manhattan(1979) show a more fairy tale look of the city.I must say that,although fairy tales a not true,I really like these movies also. I've been to New York in the summer of 2002 and I went back a year later (just because I really love the city).Nothing from the view of the 1970's has remained,Time Square has changed from a central point of crime and prostitution into the center of Disney and tourism.I must say,I'm not really sure which version is my favorite.Taxi Driver is to me the highpoint of the artistic cinema of the 1970's.Never was there any better decade in cinema history.Besides the fact that the 1970's will always be remembered as the starting point of the Blockbuster with Jaws(1975),it is also the decade of some really fine and uncompromising films by some of the greatest directors ever.Martin Scorsese being the best of the bunch!The acting in Taxi Driver is really first class.Besides the legendary role by Robert De Niro there are great supporting roles by Jodie Foster,Peter Boyle (most famous for his role as the monster in Young Frankenstein(1974) by Mel Brooks and his role as the detective in Schrader's (yes the same as the writer of Taxi Driver) movie Hardcore(1979),Cybill Shepherd,Victor Argo,two cameos by Martin Scorsese (one is hard to see,the other hard not to) and there is a great performance from my favorite actor Harvey Keitel as Iris' pimp.It is a shame that Keitel didn't get a bigger role as he had in Scorsese's breakthrough movie Mean Streets(1973).Still,it is an essential character in the movie.Martin Scorsese is the master in this movie as he directs with great power an a superb eye for detail.Each scene is a joy to look at and has some fine trickery.He really lives up as being the greatest director of them all.Together with the underestimated Casino(1995) this is his finest achievement.Scorsese's uncompromising criticism of the war in Vietnam comes to an artistic explosion in taxi Driver.He already had given his view in his classic short The Big Shave(1967).But now the broader audience came to close view with one of the worst chapters in American history.And then to think that there isn't a second of film in Vietnam in the movie.The score is provided by Hitchcock protege Bernard Herrmann and again he succeeds in giving a movie something really extra.Together with Vertigo(1958) and Psycho(1960) this is his best score.The main theme is really powerful and the jazzy addition makes it even better.It almost has the sound of a horror score,it is that haunting.Each character is extremely well worked out.Travis Bickle is the embodiment of dispare and depression while Iris is the embodiment of hope.Betsy is arrogant and the embodiment of the outside world. It is therefore impossible to hate Travis while he is becoming a psycho and a danger for society.Some of the dialogues are simply unforgettable and mentioned in every film book.The finest examples areYou talking' to me? You talking' to me? You talking' to me? Then who the hell else are you talking' to? You talking' to me? Well I'm the only one here. Who do you think you're talking to? Oh yeah? Huh? OK. andLoneliness has followed me my whole life, everywhere. In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There's no escape. I'm God's lonely man. The dialogue really give the characters and the entire movie an extra boost.All the sentences are filled with important words and relevant references to the war.The You Talking' to Me? scene is probably the best known sequence but it ain't the best.The best scene to me is the final massacre scene.Not only is it the scene in which Travis completes his journey into lunacy,but it is a beautiful sequence to look at.The camera work is brilliant and so fluent that it is impossible to blink an eye,Michael Chapman deserves a lot credit for that since he is the cinematographer of the movie (he would cooperate with Scorsese again on Raging Bull(1980).To me the film should have ended right where the camera has finished his pending through the house after Travis has done his killing.The camera then takes on a broad view of the street where ambulances and police cars have arrived. It truly is one of the greatest scene in cinema history and right up there with the Odessa stair sequence in Bronenosets Potyomkin(1925) and the stargate sequence in 2001A Space Odyssey(1968).Finally there are a few things to mentionSteven Spielberg has actually cooperated on this film,he's the supervising editor.Yet another addition to the already monumental status of Taxi Driver.There is a funny sequence in a porn theater where Travis goes in to see a movie,the canvas is all blurry but the sound is there! What a way to to fool the rating commission. Scorsese would go on to make some sort of remake some 20 years laterBringing out the Dead(1999).Although it doesn't have the power of Taxi Driver it isn't a bad movie,not at all.It was mown down by the critics as being bad and pretentious but I really enjoyed it.It is one of the best movies of 1999 and deserves more credit.A definite masterpiece,one of the greatest achievements ever and a must see for every film fan. 10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"29 June 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILERS!!On the first viewing of this monumental picture I was pretty convinced that it was a good movie,but after the second,third.....I was impressedNo overwhelmed by it.This movie truly has everything.

Quite simply, the story is about greed, excess, power, and violence....ahhh the American Dream. Al Pacino pulls out all his skills and gives his performance of his lifetime here, he becomes Tony Montana, literally. Quite simply, one of the best acting performances I've seen, if not the very best. How he nailed that accent is a mystery to me, and while it's convincing, it's also completely hilarious!

Though fearful of what kind of physical rigor he might expect from 'fat camp' Gerry, somewhat of the main character here, he is surprised to find that it is mostly fun and games in the summer sun. But when the owners of the paradise (played by husband and wife, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara) sell the camp to psycho fitness fanatic, Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller at his best), life at 'fat camp' becomes pure hell for the boys. Perkis, determined to exploit the boys as the posterchildren of success for his on-going Perkisizer infomercial, takes away from the boys everything that made camp great.  For a while, the great times at 'fat camp' made the boys forget their being singled out as something to laugh at. But when sleazy Tony I'm everybody's friend in front of the camera Perkis goes too far in his sadistic ways to make Perkisizer a financial success, the boys (and some of the old camp counselors) get together for a bit of tasty revenge. Don't forget, that it's a Dinsey movie. It may not be as ridiculously sentimental as other family features, but there is always a moral to be learned, and most often, it deals with self-esteem. With the Perkins take over, the campers are stigmatized by their new camp counselor, and particularly by the neighboring camp (Camp MVP). In the course of dealing with Tony, they learn to appreciate themselves.Viewers who were young enough to enjoy Mighty Ducks and those family films of the early 90s will recognized many of the young actors in this feature.

Oliver Stone, with the help of a story written by Tarantino, shows us once again that he likes to take hallucinogenic drugs while filming....giving the viewer a true treat straight from the screen. We've seen this before and got a taste of it in The Doors, but here Stone is really able to take it over the top and with reason. Strange lighting, off center camera angles, moving and disturbing back drops, and cut scenes of violent images and cartoons that help express the emotion for the story is what it's all about. Some don't like the film simply because of that but I happen to love it and find it quite suiting. Not only that, it is quite an insane, sick, and perverted film that is difficult to watch so it's no wonder it's not widely received.The acting is second to none, an all out picture perfect cast. Harrelson, Lewis, Downy, Sizemore, and Jones all give unforgettable performances that come burning off of the screen and into your eyes. One of Stone's true talents is his ability to get his actors to give the performances that are best for the film, as we have seen many times in the past, and it is utterly undeniable here. All five give absolutely flawless performances for their equally disturbing characters. The film's premise if over the top, and naturally so are the characters and everything else in the film.The whole premise for the film is that the media glorifies violence and murderers, and NBK mocks that fact into oblivion beyond the infinite. For a film to mock the blood lust of the US media, what must one have? Violence, and there's buckets of it here. Everything in the film, including the violence, is over the top to try and express this point about blood lust and is why a lot of people find it hard to watch. Completely understandable. This applies to myself in certain scenes. However, it's also too bad for those who simply can't bear it because many like myself consider this to be a great film despite it's graphic nature. I feel it loses many points in some viewers eyes simply because the film is perfectly disturbing, twisted, and sometimes sick to make it's statement. It's either that or the fact that people have trouble identifying with the main characters and don't know why they should feel remorse for them. That's the whole point, you're not supposed to feel remorse for them or any character in the film! It's simply stating that all people can be inherently evil on some level, just look at all of the characters, and some people are not as evolved as they'd like to think...which also ties into people's desire to glorify violence and killers in the media. Some might find this ironic or contradictory. I do too, but think it's quite humorous. The fact of the matter is, there's not any finger pointing going on here, it's simply an observation made of the public that has been exploited to display it.Mind-boggling film technique, incredible acting performances, a strong message that ironically must contradict itself, and with a masterful director at the helm, NBK adds up to one extremely entertaining and great film. One of the strangest films I've seen. Love it or hate it. As a fellow reviewer previously stated, a nearly impossible film to review. See it and decide for yourself, if you think you're up for it.Highly misunderstood, but also highly recommended.

Not only that, it is quite an insane, sick, and perverted film that is difficult to watch so it's no wonder it's not widely received.The acting is second to none, an all out picture perfect cast. Harrelson, Lewis, Downy, Sizemore, and Jones all give unforgettable performances that come burning off of the screen and into your eyes. One of Stone's true talents is his ability to get his actors to give the performances that are best for the film, as we have seen many times in the past, and it is utterly undeniable here.

The film's premise if over the top, and naturally so are the characters and everything else in the film.The whole premise for the film is that the media glorifies violence and murderers, and NBK mocks that fact into oblivion beyond the infinite. For a film to mock the blood lust of the US media, what must one have? Violence, and there's buckets of it here. Everything in the film, including the violence, is over the top to try and express this point about blood lust and is why a lot of people find it hard to watch. Completely understandable. This applies to myself in certain scenes. However, it's also too bad for those who simply can't bear it because many like myself consider this to be a great film despite it's graphic nature. I feel it loses many points in some viewers eyes simply because the film is perfectly disturbing, twisted, and sometimes sick to make it's statement. It's either that or the fact that people have trouble identifying with the main characters and don't know why they should feel remorse for them. That's the whole point, you're not supposed to feel remorse for them or any character in the film! It's simply stating that all people can be inherently evil on some level, just look at all of the characters, and some people are not as evolved as they'd like to think...which also ties into people's desire to glorify violence and killers in the media. Some might find this ironic or contradictory. I do too, but think it's quite humorous. The fact of the matter is, there's not any finger pointing going on here, it's simply an observation made of the public that has been exploited to display it.Mind-boggling film technique, incredible acting performances, a strong message that ironically must contradict itself, and with a masterful director at the helm, NBK adds up to one extremely entertaining and great film.

Oliver Stone, with the help of a story written by Tarantino, shows us once again that he likes to take hallucinogenic drugs while filming....giving the viewer a true treat straight from the screen. We've seen this before and got a taste of it in The Doors, but here Stone is really able to take it over the top and with reason.

Not because of the awards and accolades it has won but because it taught me to look at film and film narrative in a different way.Having said that I do admit that I understand why currently some younger viewers don't appreciate it as a masterpiece. In the age of MTV film-making and CGI inspired scripts, many current moviegoers don't have the patience to allow a film to unfold before them, taking literally until the final frame to complete the story and characterization. The truth is that film production has come so far since 1942 that we take for granted many of the storytelling and cinematography techniques that Wells employed. Although he may not have invented these techniques, Wells used them in groundbreaking ways and his influence can still be seen in movies today. There is also little recognition of the film within the context of when it was made. Wells, at 26 years old, had produced a very controversial story using film techniques that were quite new to movie making. Using a cast of mostly unknown stage and radio actors he managed to make a movie that wasn't simply the filming of a stage play, which was a common style of the period. Add the controversy created by the William Randolph Hearst connection (and the fact that Hearst newspapers of the day wouldn't carry ads for the film) and you see a movie-making story that has become a part of American culture.I'm looking forward to re-watching Citizen Kane, this time with my 15-year-old daughter. Hopefully, she'll get it&#133; even without Orlando Bloom or Lindsey Lohan.On the subject of RosebudI never believed Kane's dying word 'rosebud' had a deep psychological meaning such as a representation of everything he had lost or his inability to love. Some have suggested rosebud was 'mantra for memories of a lost childhood' and the separation from his parents which lead to his lonely life. To me, it was simply the last memory of an old man. Spurred by the visual of Susan's snow globe he recalled one of his oldest memories. At the end of the film, when asked what he thinks Kane's final word Rosebud explains, the reporter says, 'I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life.' In actuality, Rosebud, a simple memory of Charles Foster Kane's, was Orson Wells' catalyst for telling the story of Citizen Kane.I've always had a certain fascination with the character of Charles Foster Kane and Orson Wells' portrayal of him as well as many of the themes of the movie. One moment likable and attractive, the next despicable, Well's played Kane with a charisma that has been rarely equaled on film, (or in Wells' subsequent films.) Themes such as wanting to be loved but being incapable of giving love and a man's value being measured by his 'collections' are fascinating to me. Even now, with all the modern advances in film technique and the hundreds of movies I've seen, I still get chills at certain points of the film. I first saw the film at 20 years old and for me the movie represents my awaking to seeing film as art. It also gave me the desire to look below the surface at Wells' motivations and created for me a fascination with his style.Equally fascinating is the 'making of ' story behind Citizen Kane. The power struggles and controversies that surrounded the production of the film are Hollywood legend.Most people with whom I've discussed Citizen Kane, who love the movie, don't really care whether it's considered the 'best film of all time'. The awards and recognition the film has earned are not determining factors in how I look at Citizen Kane and my passion for the film goes beyond any websites top film listing.

Still, at least Billy Crystal is on hand to provide some memorable verbal wit. Two Chicago cops, Crystal and Gregory Hines, are busily trying to put various scumbags behind bars for drug crimes.

For a while, the guys leave wintry Chicago and sample the good life in Key West, Florida, but ultimately they just can't let unfinished business lie. Against their better judgement, they return to Chicago to finish the one job they've still got to complete.... the capture of Gonzalez. Hyams delivers one simply awesome chase in which the heroes pursue their quarry by car, but somehow end up driving on the city's elevated-railway tracks. He also manages to squeeze in a genuinely funny scene in which Crystal makes a wacky anonymous phone-call, complete with goofy voice. However, Hyams is let down - yet again - by the periodic lulls in his story. The whole Key West sequence is boring, even though it bears relevance to the plot. And on too many occasions, Crystal's marital troubles interfere with the story (again, they are certainly relevant, but are played in a very dull way).

Perhaps the best part--the literary portal. Otherwise, a weak beginning, a weak ending, an unremarkable middle, and yet, a pleasant enough way to pass the time. Of course, it was just that, a passing of time, and not a use of it. Targeting a younger audience one would think the moviemakers would capitalize on its influence. We sat begging to be swept away, and because we wished it it was so, but not boldly enough with breathtaking sights and stirring sounds. How did Richard Tyler become so neurotic? Why?

That was perhaps the most disappointing part. Ah--the worlds to which we could go given a ship with a steady course.

Manhunter has been unfairly dismissed as that film with the other Hannibal Lecter, while it is in fact so much more. Adapted from Thomas Harris' first Hannibal Lecter novel, Red Dragon, Manhunter involves Will Graham (played by C.S.I.'s Will Petersen), an FBI agent, who is called out of retirement to help track down a mysterious serial killer nicknamed The Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan).First, the cast. Will Petersen is a perfect Will Graham. Dennis Farina is also an excellent Jack Crawford. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is not so good. While Noonan makes The Tooth Fairy pretty creepy, the rest of the cast (including Brian Cox, who plays imprisoned cannibal Hannibal Lecktor) brings out some horrible acting.One of the reasons Manhunter is so cool is its close resemblance to Miami Vice. The production design has a trademark Vice glitter to it, and the soundtrack is outstanding - also a Vice trademark. Mann takes what would normally be a dark crime-thriller and turns it into a shining thriller.Michael Mann's direction is probably the best part of the film. He has the techniques and he knows how to use them, long before making hits like Heat. Without Mann, the film would likely not have been made, and if so, would have much less cult status. Manhunter is flawed. Occasionally, it's boring, and it has a very unsatisfying feel to it. And yet, somehow, unexplainably, and going against everything I've just said - it's excellent. Dated, and very Miami Vice-ish - but we love it.It's just you and me now, sport.

An unromantic take on Mob life is a refreshing departure from what we are usually fed. Very matter of fact and business-like killings, and penny ante heists more accurately reflect the day to day life of a wise guy if this is movie is accurate. Depp and Pacino might be said to red line the NY accent, but they don't. Born bred NYers talk like this and worse.
