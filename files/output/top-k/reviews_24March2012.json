One of those new territories was the gangster epic, which he jumped into with 1987's The Untouchables, written by David Mamet. He took the job primarily as a way to make a big studio movie that would turn a quick profit (after his last few pictures were financial failures) and allow him to make more movies that he wanted to. His lack of genuine passion is evident early on, resulting in a film that doesn't have much spark. It's a shame really, because the script could have allowed for a much stronger picture if better talent had been involved.De Palma has long been a hit-or-miss director for me and this one misses the mark completely. There are some wonderfully staged sequences that entertain and properly build suspense, but for every bridge shootout there's an unintentionally hilarious moment like the baby rolling down the stairs. De Palma once again pours on his fetish for slow motion shots and once again it results in more hilarity than anything else, often feeling as if it's a parody that the audience isn't allowed in on. Mamet's script had the potential for a lot of punch, but beyond De Palma's poor work here is a cast that screams to be replaced.Headlining the ensemble is Kevin Costner, the head of the titular squad of men organized to bring down legendary gangster Al Capone, and they really couldn't have found a more inappropriate lead if they tried. I'm not entirely sure how a lot of these scenes were able to make it past the editing room, but Costner trying to deliver Mamet dialogue is like Rob Schneider trying to read Shakespeare. There are so many scenes where you can see the passion and the rage that must have been on the script, but when Costner tries to bring it out of his mouth it comes off so forced, flat and borderline hilarious. Moments of damaged frustration have no meaning when the man portraying it sounds exactly the same as he always does. Costner is probably the worst thing about this picture, but the rest of the cast often leaves something to be desired as well.Sean Connery inexplicably won an Oscar for his role here, and I can't say I'm entirely certain as to why he did. His character serves as a mentor to Costner's and there's a lot of the standard moments that come with that dynamic but after the film was over I felt nothing that resonated with his performance. I wouldn't say it's particularly bad as Costner was, but I felt nothing for the character, there was nothing there that allowed me to take him as a believable human being. Taking on the role of Capone is Robert De Niro in a performance that feels almost as wrong here as Costner's. De Niro is often over-the-top, hamming it up to a dreadful extreme, but even when he's not, the performance still stinks of self-awareness. There's never a moment where this guy is actually Capone, it's just Robert De Niro putting on some makeup.The film isn't all bad, though. Like I said, there are some marvelously done sequences that are good enough to feel like they belong in a much better picture. Along with that, you can tell that Mamet's script itself could have been a quality work if it had been taken under the wing of a better group of actors or a director that cared more. I also thought that the film was shot incredibly well, with many scenes that left me impressed with their visual flare. Even when the film overall can fall into ruin, De Palma has always been a master at creating a memorable, unique and impressive style. I just deeply wish that it had been serviced by a better overall product.

He is separated from his mother when she defends him from people who were making fun of him at the circus. The other elephants cast him out and don't regard him as an elephant and he is made a clown.

He is a character that you can root for due to him being a little different just because his ears are a little big. Also he is definitely the cutest Disney animal character out there so you want to see him succeed.Also the supporting character Timothy Mouse is great. He is instantly likable when he befriends Dumbo and wants to help him. Great character.This is one of the shortest Disney films. But I think that it is paced well and it is a good easy watch.

I won't ruin what exactly happens but I think it was a mistake to take a simple horror tale and then try to turn it into something a little bigger and all you really do is take the monster away for way too long. It also doesn't help that the screenplay has several boring dialogue scenes that just keep going on and on. The best thing that can be said about HORROR EXPRESS is that the monster itself is great. There have been many films that features a killer ape but the monster here is among the best I've ever seen. I really enjoyed the make-up job and the creature really does have a realistic look to it. It's just too bad we don't get to see it more. Another major plus is that there's some terrific atmosphere running throughout the film as you always feel as if you're in this dark, dingy train with the creature. Of course, Lee and Cushing always did great work together and that's true here. The two do a very good job with their parts and that magical spark is certainly there when they're together.

It has a fairy tale like quality in a modern day setting, relating it's story in a plastic, pastel suburbia complete with snoopy neighbors who can't wait to find out who the local Avon Lady (Dianne Weist) just brought home.The strange thing about the story is how it juxtaposes the way people usually react to something strange within their midst. With Edward (Johnny Depp), there was no revulsion or fright at the sight of his disfigurement. Instead, they all marveled at his ability to transform shrubbery into animal shapes, and trusted him to do wonders for their hairstyles. It's only after they get to know Edward and accept him into the community that they later turn against him due to an unfortunate incident for which he's virtually been framed. I was surprised that the story took such a tragic turn with the boyfriend\/bully (Anthony Michael Hall) at the finale, and wonder if director Burton couldn't have made his point without resorting to violence.As a fan of Vincent Price, I recall how pleased I was when the picture first came out to see him perform in what would be his last screen appearance. In a way, the creepy mansion at the end of the road reminded me of The House on Haunted Hill, an early favorite when I was just a kid that managed to scare the bejeezus out of me when I first saw it. In time, Price's pairing with Johnny Depp in this picture will be one of those neat trivia questions for movie goers to puzzle over.The one thing that throws me about the movie though is the way it ends. Presumably the story takes place in the present day when the picture was made (1990), as the characters and setting all appear to be of that era. Which would mean that Winona Ryder's character having aged some sixty or seventy years would transport the end of the film well into the mid twenty first century.

I was surprised that the story took such a tragic turn with the boyfriend\/bully (Anthony Michael Hall) at the finale, and wonder if director Burton couldn't have made his point without resorting to violence.As a fan of Vincent Price, I recall how pleased I was when the picture first came out to see him perform in what would be his last screen appearance. In a way, the creepy mansion at the end of the road reminded me of The House on Haunted Hill, an early favorite when I was just a kid that managed to scare the bejeezus out of me when I first saw it. In time, Price's pairing with Johnny Depp in this picture will be one of those neat trivia questions for movie goers to puzzle over.The one thing that throws me about the movie though is the way it ends. Presumably the story takes place in the present day when the picture was made (1990), as the characters and setting all appear to be of that era. Which would mean that Winona Ryder's character having aged some sixty or seventy years would transport the end of the film well into the mid twenty first century. I guess if this is a fairy tale story it wouldn't matter at all, but somehow the transition was just a bit disorienting.

I hate the two dimensional characters. I hate how dated they usually are (I'm looking at you, You Got Mail). I just can't stand them. Every so often, though, a romantic comedy comes along that doesn't keep my eyes rolling for an hour and a half. One where the characters aren't cardboard cutouts of actual human beings. One that's actually able to pull at my heart strings and let out the inner romantic. The Goodbye Girl is one of those movies.The complaint I had with the film was the Lucy McFadden character played by Quinn Cummings. To be fair, I thought she showed a good range of emotions and as the movie progressed I actually started to like her. At the start of the movie, though, she was not a welcomed presence. Her over precociousness made her seem like a Tatum O'Neil wanna be. Lucy McFadden is kind of like taking a dip in a pool really early in the morning. At first, it feels harsh but it warms up to you as you stay a little while longer.The movie does have a lot of the clichés we've come to hate about rom-coms. It has the strong woman with the heart of ice. It has the quirky love interest that melts aforenamed heart of ice. It has the wildly unlikely circumstances leading up to the wildly unlikely romance and the big city backdrop, but somehow it just works. I don't know why or how, but it just does. I thought Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason had great performances and I thought Elliot Garfield and Paula McFadden were likable characters. Is it my favorite movie of all time?

Here, it's the cityfolk who move wide-eyed to the country - and are amazed to find there a roll call of crazies, misanthropes, and just plain wierdos. Does this view of country life have any basis in reality? Probably not, but then the film isn't really trying to be a satire but instead a pure lunatic comic fantasy. And it gives us a rich array of supporting characters - from the town sheriff who hasn't yet passed his driving test and so must ride around in cabs, to the owner of an antiques store whose merchandise are all personal. All these characters are priceless, and the film just keeps coming up with more and more of them - until it has created this pleasantly bizarre and warped Otherworld, of a kind that only comedy can truly provide.Best of all is the way in which Chase and Smith react to all of this and try to make some sense of it. I very clearly say Chase and Smith because the film belongs equally to both of them. It had to be billed as a Chevy Chase Comedy, of course, since he's the big star here, but this is no star trip; from the very first, the wife is made an equal partner in the trials and the laughs, and it's the way the two go through their new life together that provides much of the comedy. It also helps take the edge off of the usual Chevy Chase persona in Funny Farm he's neither glib and disinterested (as in the Fletch movies) nor over the top silly (like in the Vacation movies). He comes across instead like a normal, personable guy who just finds himself caught in insane circumstances.Finally, the climactic sequence of the film is absolutely priceless - one of the most brilliantly sustained comic set-pieces you'll see in any movie, of any era. Funny Farm is the type of movie which gives you a great time and leaves you with a big, dopey grin on your face after it's all over. Trust me, even if you don't normally like Chevy Chase, you'll love Funny Farm.

What could be better than a creepy abandoned insane asylum coupled with the eery paraphernalia of asbestos abatement? To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I would say without reservation that Session Nine is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only thing good about this movie is the setting. The acting is not too good, but, as others have said, it is difficult to act without material. There are a number of things which turned me off to this movie. The plot seemed to be an afterthought, and it was impossible to believe that the characters were actually performing asbestos abatement---the youngest of them is actually wearing a paper mask instead of a real respirator. I seems as if they had one respirator between them. The circuit breaker which kept blowing had to be reset by plugging something in---the extension cord? Working under intense time pressure, no one seemed to be working at all, especially the guy who spent all of his time listening to the sessions with a multiple personality case on a conveniently provided tape player. Granted, everything in a movie doesn't have to make sense in a realistic manner, but, to my mind, the best horror movies (like The Shining) are effective because of the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary. One needs a baseline from which to deviate. The whole movie left me with the feeling that someone saw a really cool building and said Hey, why don't we get together and make a scary movie here? I was not surprised to find out that this was actually the case. I could go on about the problems with this intensely boring, stupid, and pretentious film, but I wasted enough time watching it.

Freddie Krueger became one of the icons of the 80's. Because of this he became completely unscary. You can't really blame the first film for this development however. What director Wes Craven did here I guess was to reimagine the possibilities of the slasher film. On the back of first Halloween and subsequently Friday the 13th, there was a bucket load of these types of movies released in the early 80's. It wasn't the most diverse genre either, and by 1984 it had more or less run its course; Craven's film took the basic idea of this sub-genre but expanded with a much more original approach. Out was the faceless killer who stalked a group of dumb half-naked teenagers and instead we had a weird supernatural villain who attacked his victims via their dreams. This was a much more original idea for a slasher film. It still had murder set-pieces but these ones involved people being dragged over ceilings and fountains of blood erupting out of beds. The surreal and dream-like moments are ultimately what make A Nightmare on Elm Street an interesting movie. Another unusual aspect is the teens themselves. They're actually sympathetic and not merely there to be killed in a state of undress. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the more typical sleazy approach but it is notable and commendable that Craven chose to do things a different way for a change. It's not a perfect film by any means though and there are some cheesy moments. For example the scenes near the end where the heroine constructs home-made traps to snare Freddie in were dangerously close to MacGyver territory. But overall, it's an interesting movie in places.

I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in Brassed Off that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.
