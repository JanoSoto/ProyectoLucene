COF is by far the best version of Frankenstein I've seen yet. Great character development and interaction. Set designs, color, mood, etc. All are first rate. And Christopher Lee's monster is very creepy and much more believable than Karloff's. I love Karloff and I love the Universal film but I'm just blown away by how real the Hammer version is. It's very modern almost. They spend a lot of time showing how Frankenstein is inspired to do what he does, and it goes into depth of him getting all the parts, etc. The rebellion of his friend\/tutor is a nice touch that again makes this film a lot more real. Someone said it's like a soap opera and I agree in that it spends a lot of time on the relationships. But on to the gore. this movie is really creepy. When Frankenstein leaves and we're left alone with the monster in his life jacuzzi or whatever you want to call it and we know he's about to spring to life is just amazing. There's a lot of nice touches that Hammer always put in the movie. Like the blind man with his grandson, it's just so macabre. It's almost gallows humor. Just real creepy.

We definitely sympathize with his monster more than Lee's. But I don't think Hammer wanted us to sympathize with their monster much. He is more of an abomination that has to be destroyed more than a pitiful creature who is put into unfavorable circumstances through no fault of his own. One last thing, the ending is interesting on two points. They kind of leave Paul and Elizabeths relationship ambiguous. Did they get married? it seems like they might have. Also, there's a whole other way you can take the movie at the end. That the monster was really just a figment of Frankensteins imagination, an alter-ego if you will, that allowed him to kill people without taking responsibility. Look at Paul's reaction at the end when Frankenstein is trying to get him to corroborate his story. It looks as though Paul is genuinely confused and just thinks that Frankenstein is mad.

A dread unsettling question. But if harried by the Turks, say, I'd probably have to admit to this one - while agonisingly conscious of all the other favourite films being elbowed aside. And I write as one not overly enthused about Lean's other epic ventures. RIVER KWAI I find offensive for its wilful neglect of real p.o.w. horror in favour of smugly cooked-up ironies and hack-platitudes. ZHIVAGO is undermined by hollow leads chosen only for their beauty, RYAN'S DAUGHTER is insanely overblown soap-opera while A PASSAGE TO India collapses halfway through when the thread snaps and we're just watching the actors tread water. But LAWRENCE, for me, is the real deal, a bewitching tapestry so successful at what it sets out to achieve it's almost incredible. Gobsmacking to watch and a delight to listen to it makes you feel thrilled that movies were invented.Sure, it plays games with history. It's not the real Lawrence, of course, Lean admitted on the box. Quite so. The real Lawrence would require a mini-series or, at the end, a chamber-drama like Anglia's excellent TV film of the Nineties with Ralph Fiennes. The massive river of events, intrigues and personnel as recorded by Lawrence himself (though questioned in some quarters) has been simplified here, channelled into a tributary of pertinent moments and symbols, a loner's odyssey, with key support figures marginalised strategically along its banks. The true extent of Lawrence's role as an Imperialist agent did not begin to be disclosed, officially, until the end of the Sixties. To suit the film's left-wing leanings and better engage with the mass blockbuster audience he's depicted initially as politically naive, an amusingly bumptious misfit with a classical education packed off into the desert, via a wily politico, partly to get him out of the hair of his C.O. who has little faith in him or his mission to foster Arab unity against their Turkish overlords (A sideshow of a sideshow !). That celebrated cut from the blowing-out of a match to sunrise on the desert sweeps us literally into a new world (and still does). Lean's staging, Young's photography and Jarre's surging music combine to breathtaking effect. The winsome weirdo who enjoys preening himself and teasing his own flesh is tested against lethal tribal-rivalry but fires them with a bold vision - the taking of Akaba, a sea-port undefended on its landward side. During the long trek to this objective one of his men is lost in the desert. Lawrence goes out of his way to reclaim him, earning the respect of all and they clothe him in the robes of an Arab chieftain. (In real life this was a more pragmatic suggestion from the Brits). A further rite of leadership arises when he takes it upon himself to execute a man for murder, preventing an inter-tribal war. The man he kills is the man he saved (a deft juxtaposition of two separate incidents in real life involving different people). Lawrence is later to confess to his new C.O. that he enjoyed the experience.Akaba is successfully taken (in a stunning panning-shot) and Lawrence begins to make a name for himself. He gets promoted and becomes a guerrilla-leader in assaults on the Turkish railway. But a turning-point comes when he's captured by the Turks on a reconnaissance, is flogged and (possibly) raped before being released. His bodily integrity shattered he's further disillusioned to discover (in the film) that the promise of independence he's been peddling to the Arabs is a stitch-up to conceal the colonial interests of Britain and France. The self-hurting he once indulged in now penetrates too deeply and the self-image become abhorrent. His request to stand down is refused, he's too important now, and in bitterness and despair takes part in a revenge-massacre of retreating Turkish troops. When Allied victory is secured he's sent home, leaving the politicians to sort things out. While this makes for a fine symbolical end to the drama it also constitutes the film's biggest distortion of history. Prince Feisal effects to dismiss him in the movie while in real life Feisal needed him more than ever in the battle for nation-rights at the Versailles Peace Conference. Feisal, the real fall-guy, was treated very badly by the Europeans and only Lawrence's active intervention as his spokesman won him concessions. It's good that we now have the Ralph Fiennes film which rectifies the record.Robert Bolt's quirky brilliant dialogue, for Lean, tends to short-change some of the characters, reducing the stature of Allenby and Sheik Auda in a generally cynical view of motives which spurred their descendants to seek redress from the film-makers. At the same time it's all wonderfully entertaining and impeccably played by a sterling cast. Omar Sharif showed potential he never has since. And though Lawrence was never really an 'innocent' Peter O'Toole riding the whirlwind with his piercing charisma (and newly-sculpted nose) has an iconic power that will live in movie-history forever - like Sir David's film the likes of which cannot be replicated now that computers have taken over much of the adventure and the excitement. One last thought - the real T.E. archaeologist and map-maker was involved in re-drawing the map of the Middle East with all its volatile consequences through the 20th century and beyond. The final irony indeed. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 April 2009","score":"","review":" What's your favourite film, then ? A dread unsettling question.

But if harried by the Turks, say, I'd probably have to admit to this one - while agonisingly conscious of all the other favourite films being elbowed aside. And I write as one not overly enthused about Lean's other epic ventures. RIVER KWAI I find offensive for its wilful neglect of real p.o.w. horror in favour of smugly cooked-up ironies and hack-platitudes. ZHIVAGO is undermined by hollow leads chosen only for their beauty, RYAN'S DAUGHTER is insanely overblown soap-opera while A PASSAGE TO India collapses halfway through when the thread snaps and we're just watching the actors tread water. But LAWRENCE, for me, is the real deal, a bewitching tapestry so successful at what it sets out to achieve it's almost incredible. Gobsmacking to watch and a delight to listen to it makes you feel thrilled that movies were invented.Sure, it plays games with history. It's not the real Lawrence, of course, Lean admitted on the box. Quite so. The real Lawrence would require a mini-series or, at the end, a chamber-drama like Anglia's excellent TV film of the Nineties with Ralph Fiennes. The massive river of events, intrigues and personnel as recorded by Lawrence himself (though questioned in some quarters) has been simplified here, channelled into a tributary of pertinent moments and symbols, a loner's odyssey, with key support figures marginalised strategically along its banks. The true extent of Lawrence's role as an Imperialist agent did not begin to be disclosed, officially, until the end of the Sixties. To suit the film's left-wing leanings and better engage with the mass blockbuster audience he's depicted initially as politically naive, an amusingly bumptious misfit with a classical education packed off into the desert, via a wily politico, partly to get him out of the hair of his C.O. who has little faith in him or his mission to foster Arab unity against their Turkish overlords (A sideshow of a sideshow !). That celebrated cut from the blowing-out of a match to sunrise on the desert sweeps us literally into a new world (and still does). Lean's staging, Young's photography and Jarre's surging music combine to breathtaking effect. The winsome weirdo who enjoys preening himself and teasing his own flesh is tested against lethal tribal-rivalry but fires them with a bold vision - the taking of Akaba, a sea-port undefended on its landward side. During the long trek to this objective one of his men is lost in the desert. Lawrence goes out of his way to reclaim him, earning the respect of all and they clothe him in the robes of an Arab chieftain. (In real life this was a more pragmatic suggestion from the Brits). A further rite of leadership arises when he takes it upon himself to execute a man for murder, preventing an inter-tribal war. The man he kills is the man he saved (a deft juxtaposition of two separate incidents in real life involving different people). Lawrence is later to confess to his new C.O. that he enjoyed the experience.Akaba is successfully taken (in a stunning panning-shot) and Lawrence begins to make a name for himself. He gets promoted and becomes a guerrilla-leader in assaults on the Turkish railway. But a turning-point comes when he's captured by the Turks on a reconnaissance, is flogged and (possibly) raped before being released. His bodily integrity shattered he's further disillusioned to discover (in the film) that the promise of independence he's been peddling to the Arabs is a stitch-up to conceal the colonial interests of Britain and France.

The hairdos, the attitudes, the cheesiness, the realism...I love Top Gun despite the fact that the movie is outdated for todays fast paced CGI loving audiences, the plot is a little too simple for my liking, some of the acting is over the top and stereotypical *cough* Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis *cough*.But I still love it because it represents it's decade so well. From the very beginning, the music, the yellow lit back round, the aircrafts being maneuvered around the hanger (I'm a chick so I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but whatever). It screams 80's, and that's why it's so good. It's one of those staple films of it's decade along with other classics like Risky Business(which also starts Tom Cruise), Beverly Hills Cop, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and other great flicks.But the cheese ain't the only other fault in this movie. Though I'm a big fan of Top Gun the movie does have it's flaws. One, too cliché...From beginning to the end the film is filled with stereotypical clichés maybe that's what makes it so cheesy. Another flaw too much music...Again the film is just jam packed with classic 80's tracks which gets a bit annoying after awhile. The third flaw no chemistry between McGillis and Cruise. Every time I watched Kelly McGillis trying to woo Tom Criuse I cringed. I found these scenes to be boring and a waste of good time. Fourth flaw, the movie drags on in a few scenes. Apart from a few flaws the movie is a great popcorn flick and a lot fun. It should be regarded for what it is a true classic and one of Tom Cruise's best films to date.Another I have to point out is the fact that the film is subconsciously homoerotic. I know you have all heard this before but it's the truth. Of course this little known fact was made known to the otherwise ignorant masses by none other than Quentin Tarantino in the 90's flick Sleep With Me, and after you watch his famous monologue in that movie you have to admit it does make a lot of sense. As watching the movie recently on TV, and I decided to rent for further inspection. The scenes with Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise are filled with sexual tension most of all the dangerous scene. Awkward...Also what the hell was that volleyball scene about anyway. It seemed to make no sense what so ever. But at the end of the day, the cheesiness, the over-the-top acting, the homoerotic subtext, the stereotypical and almost forced in love story make it the great film that it is. Actually I think it's the flaws that make this film so much fun to watch and so enjoyable. Also the incredible fighter-jets sequences are amazing. The fact that this movie was done before CGI became the big thing in Hollywood makes it so real because you know those aircrafts are real. The danger those stunt men where in when flying those fighter-squadrons is real. You can't fake stuff like that.The realism of the action sequences is I think a reason why the film remains so popular today. Another thing about this movie is that it introduced us to a lot of actors that weren't that well known back them like Michael Ironside (from earlier Scanners' fame), Anthony Edwards, who went on to do ER, Meg Ryan, Val Kilmer and of course how can we forget Tim Robbins' infamous cameo, he's literally on the screen for like five minutes or less on only two scenes in that entire movie.Not only did it make these no name actors house hold names, but it also made it's two main stars leading 80's stars. Kelly McGillis most well known role before Top Gun was that of Rachel Lapp in Witness opposite Harrison Ford, but this was the movie that made her a leading lady. She would go on to start in other 80's flicks like Made in Heaven and The Accused. And then there's Tom Cruise who rose to the limelight with another 80's classic Risky Business, but this is the film that propelled him to real stardom and made him a huge box office attraction. After this he went off to start in other classics like The Color of Money, Rain Man, Days of Thunder, A Few Good Men, Interview with a Vampire, Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia just to name a few.I must say that recently when I was watching this movie and Goose dies I actually began to tear up right when Maverick (Tom Cruise) is holding his body in the middle of the ocean and when he goes to Goose's house to pick some of his personal items from the navy and he shuts the door just before he sees Meg Ryan's character and starts to cry. I thought that apart from his typical badass performance throughout the whole film this scene in particular is some of Cruise's best acting to date. Say what you will about the guy, but he can act, and if you doubt his acting ability even after seeing that scene watch A Few Good Men, Magnolia, Interview with a Vampire and Collateral, I personally think those are his best performances.Overrall this is a great movie for people who love 80's flicks. It's also a movie that makes you smile, laugh and possibly cry as well. If you haven't seen it then watch it. Trust me is better than some of the garbage we are forced to watch these days.

Peter Brackett is a veteran columnist for a rival paper. After they are assigned by their respective editors to cover a major train accident they stumble upon a dangerous conspiracy (involving wrongdoing by a big chemical company). This could have been the plot of a standard thriller, something like Julia Roberts' previous film, The Pelican Brief, in which a rising young lawyer teams up with a journalist to expose a dangerous conspiracy involving wrongdoing by a big oil company. I Love Trouble, however, is not a standard thriller, but rather a light-hearted romantic comedy with thriller elements. A strong influence seems to have been the screwball comedies of the thirties and forties; one can imagine the role of Sabrina being taken by Katharine Hepburn with Cary Grant or Spencer Tracy as Peter.A common feature of these films is an element of friction between the male and female leads; they quarrel throughout but nevertheless end up falling in love. Perhaps the best modern example of a screwball comedy is the Coen brothers' Intolerable Cruelty in which George Clooney plays a cynical, manipulative divorce lawyer and Catherine Zeta Jones plays the mercenary, gold-digging ex-wife of one of his clients. In I Love Trouble the element of friction is provided by the rivalry between the two newspapers, which turns into rivalry between the two journalists. Peter initially takes a patronising attitude to Sabrina, whom he sees as raw and inexperienced, but she starts to win his respect when she scoops him over the train crash story. When they uncover the conspiracy they are forced to work together in order to survive, but nevertheless still continually try to outwit one another to get scoops for their papers.Since 1994 Roberts has become one of Hollywood's most successful romantic comedy actresses, but this was only her second film in the genre. The first, of course, was Pretty Woman, the film which first made her a major star, and like the earlier film, I Love Trouble is heavily dependent on Roberts. She not only looks lovely but also brings her brand of star quality, the ability to seize hold of a film and to make it her own personal property. Nick Nolte is not an actor whom I would necessarily have associated with romantic comedy, but here as Peter he makes a likable hero, even if at 53 (twice Roberts' age) he is perhaps rather too old for the part. Roberts and Nolte bring out the contrast between their two characters; she bright and enthusiastic, he cynical, hard-bitten and more laid back.I Love Trouble is a film which has largely been overlooked; even Roberts' greatest admirers would rarely rank it among her greatest achievements, and its current rating on this board is only 4.9. This is an attitude which I find difficult to understand. The film is not perhaps as complex as Pretty Woman or Notting Hill, or as funny as America's Sweethearts, but I would certainly prefer it to something like the over-formulaic and predictable Runaway Bride.

The twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Leo J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman.The jurors include an arrogant stockbroker, a stressed out man from a poor social background, a wise and endearing old gentleman, a quiet and respectful immigrant, an extreme bigot, a loud and pushy businessman with son issues, an advertising executive who sees everything in terms of sales, and a sports fan interested only in getting out in time to see his ballgame. The jury foreman tries to keep the group organized but isn't a particularly bright or thoughtful man himself and seems in over his depth. The (supposed at least) hero of the piece is the intelligent juror number 8, an architect, who appears to take his responsibilities seriously. He encourages full discussion of the evidence when others seem happy to return an immediate Guilty verdict for a young Hispanic defendant accused of fatally stabbing his abusive father. As a result of this juror's persuasive powers, the vote changes from 11-1 for Guilty to a unanimous final Not Guilty verdict.No one would be interested in watching a movie about twelve calm jurors politely and rationally debating the evidence. Thus we have this drama which makes for compelling viewing but isn't for those preferring some degree of subtlety. The case itself is ultra dramatic 'all or nothing', acquittal or the death penalty with no possibility of life imprisonment. Juror 8 has illegally purchased a duplicate knife to the murder weapon and slams it dramatically on the table. These jurors are constantly bickering. One juror threatens to kill another. Eventually the other jurors all turn their backs one by one on the bigot. Surely this must be a textbook example of everything a jury should NOT be! While real life jurors do bring their prejudices and life experiences into the jury room, some of these jurors were simply too unbelievable. For example, 'the bigot' seemed to flaunt his bigotry at every turn rather than, as would be much more realistic, making some effort to conceal it. I believe one would need to look far and wide to find a juror with so little regard for human life that he would happily send a possibly innocent kid off to the electric chair rather than miss his ballgame.As for juror number 8, at first I admired his sense of responsibility and calm, reasoned questioning. However, by the end of the movie, after he had raised doubts (whether reasonable or not is up to individual interpretation) about every single piece of evidence and testimony, I no longer saw him as the heroic champion of justice we're manipulated into believing, but almost felt as though he had some agenda of his own to acquit and would never convict anyone of any crime, whatever the evidence! This jury didn't rationally debate the case at all but as juror 8 would raise some 'doubt', one or other juror would suddenly change his vote, ignoring all the other evidence. A good case could be made that this jury let a murderer go free because they lost sight of the cumulative nature of the evidence as a whole.While this movie is often classed as a character study, a psychological drama, or a study in small group dynamics, it's also considered a commentary on the American jury system. As such, I feel that the writers should have 'done their homework' and had these jurors follow standard jury instructions rather than the gross jury misconduct they displayed -- juror 8 doing his own independent research by purchasing that knife, their questionable little experiment with the old man's rate of walking, their improper acceptance of one of their number as a switchblade 'expert' and taking his opinion of stabbing techniques as gospel. If all this had become known to court officials in real life, this grievous misconduct would almost certainly have resulted in a mistrial.I also felt the movie quite manipulative in casting a defendant who could hardly be more sympathetic, a young kid with poor social opportunities, the victim of bigotry and paternal abuse. What viewer would ever want this boy to receive the death penalty? This film would have packed a greater punch for me if the defendant had been a rather despicable character (or at least neutral in terms of sympathy factor), yet the jury been able to acquit him anyway due to finding reasonable doubt.Therefore, while this film is a 'must see' classic, a thoroughly engaging way to spend an hour and a half, and a masterpiece by comparison with most modern movies, I don't consider it flawless. At least in my case, it hasn't held up well during subsequent viewings and further scrutiny. Entertaining, yes, but I have a big problem with its clearly intended message that this jury, which I see as a lynch mob-turned-group of pushovers, has ultimately served the cause of justice.

Great role for Nicky Katt as a hood Avery turns to when he needs dirty work tended to. Just as good a cast as you could ask for and director Soderbergh builds characterizations through a careful editing process going back and forth through time as Wilson dotes on his past regarding his daughter, while others surrounding Valentine(..such as Katt's Stacey and his partner, and DEA agents who have been tailing Valentine for helping push heroine)have plans of their own he often gets in middle of. Within a tight 90 minutes, we get all we need to know about Wilson thanks to the way the film is directed and written(..good use of a film directed by Ken Loach starring Stamp as a young man living a rather poor, but happy, existence with his wife, before being sent to jail for petty crimes). I particularly was satisfied with the climax because while everyone is killing each other, Wilson is able to confront Valentine face-to-face with a much different result than we are used to in these types of films. To say this was an atypical revenge film would be an understatement, and that may be it's greatest strength. THE LIMEY also establishes Wilson as a fish-out-of-water character whose slang and language leaves many confused and bewildered, yet he leaves a lasting impression. My favorite scene would have to be Wilson's one-on-one with DEA boss Bill Duke, both out to get Valentine, for different reasons, attempting to understand each other. Lesley Ann Warren had a real chance to show just how good an actress she is when given a great part..her work opposite Stamp, a quiet camaraderie that develops because of her fondness for his daughter, is subtle and effective. Also, Stamp's unusual bond with Luis Guzmán is actually touching. A really great movie if given a chance. Fonda's producer is rather sad, a relic needing companionship, always looking over his shoulder in fear that the boogeyman could come from behind any minute.

I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the perfect horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this impossible-to-miss! film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable. And here is why . . .First and foremost The Silence of the Lambs is, unarguably, 100% unoriginal. There is not a single original&#x97;or even creative&#x97;concept in the entire runtime of the film. This paragraph of my review is not my opinion. The way I view the world has no bearing on what has or hasn't been done in storytelling before. Saying that it's my opinion that The Silence of the Lambs is unoriginal is equivalent to saying that it's my opinion that the sky is blue. And just as childish. With that said, I can literally point you, scene-by-scene, to where every single idea in The Silence of the Lambs has been written and filmed in the past. Dressed to Kill, for a major example. From the formula, to the characters, to the situations, to the set-up it's all, unarguably, one giant genre cliché. And, as I said, I can point to every movie, every book that has used the EXACT scenes in the past. This isn't just a coincidence; it's an unabashed lack of creativity and intelligence from the writer. Just more of the same cliché Hollywood and pulp fiction conventions we've seen all our lives. All the standard clichés are here, folks romantic subplot, tension at the agency, troubled childhoods, etc., etc., etc.Hannibal Lector himself is, admittedly by the author, nothing but a mash-up of various fictional and real-life serial killers. The two most obvious fictional killers he unabashedly rips-off are Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974) and Mark Lewis (Peeping Tom, 1960). Leatherface's actions (cannibal, wears victim's faces) + Lewis's mind (pretentious, psychiatrist, study's human behavior, kills people to study reactions, gives long speeches about serial killers, has a supposed vast knowledge of the human mind) = Hannibal Lector. There is not a single character trait that Lector has that wasn't done nearly 40 years before he was written. Again, a kindergarten lack of creativity. I honestly don't even know how his character got past copyright laws.Not to mention Hannibal's cheesy persona. He pronounces liver with slurping sounds at the end. So did 3-year-olds, but I don't cower in fear of them. He never actually DOES anything on-screen, except talk. And talk. And when he does talk, he talks with the pseudo-intelligence of a high-school dropout who took a semester of psychology. Why? Because his psychological knowledge is laughably limited, and sometimes incorrect all together. He's supposed to be this oh-so-evil genius, but all he ever does is quote cliché phrases from dumbed-down Freud. He knows NOTHING about psychology. The pathetic writers just wrote enough cliché psychobabble between his laugh-out-loud cheesy slurping sounds to make it seem like he knew at least as much about the human mind as the average middle-school student. And then, just like all over-glamorized Hollywood, every time Hannibal is on the screen they point the camera up at his face with light shining behind his head as he stares at the ceiling without blinking. That's not good acting. That's made-for-TV directing they use in low-budget Jesus movies. Hannibal Lector is nothing but an awkward middle-aged man who is obsessed with talking and breaking copyright laws. How is that unnerving? If I met him, I'd laugh in his face and tell him to grow up.So, at root value, I'm just trying to ask What is so great about this movie? It's a generic crime thriller. It opens up with a generic cop-meets-killer scene, and ends with a generic cheesy-killer-in-the-house scene. Everything in between is exactly what you'd expect from an over-glamorized generic Hollywood thriller. It has NO significance whatsoever when it comes to originality. And as far as entertainment value goes, I don't see what's so entertaining in watching a middle-age man talk for an hour on end. If that entertains you, I pity you.Oh my God! This movie TERRIFIED me!

I've read more from the genre than anyone I personally know. Being a soon-to-be-published author myself, I've learned more about the genre by constantly reading than by any writing seminar I've ever been to. For those who don't read, by simple definition, pulp horror is a story that is genuinely terrifying and thrilling, but purposely lacks any forced literary moral. Stephen King is pretty much the poster-child of this style of writing. With all of that said, when The Silence of the Lambs, the novel, was released and received mass critical acclaim for being the perfect horror-thriller, even being the major genre-whore that I am, I could really care less. Why? Simple because I'd read so many books EXACTLY like it, I had no interest. A few years later, when the movie was released, I felt the exact same way. This is why I've waited so long to view this impossible-to-miss! film. Because I knew it was just more of the same. When I finally decided to force myself to watch it, I found my gut instinct was underestimating. The Silence of the Lambs is not only just more of the same unoriginal story that we've all heard so many times that it's second nature to us, it's also cheesy, immature, over-glamorized, and, in the end, completely laughable. And here is why . . .First and foremost The Silence of the Lambs is, unarguably, 100% unoriginal. There is not a single original&#x97;or even creative&#x97;concept in the entire runtime of the film. This paragraph of my review is not my opinion. The way I view the world has no bearing on what has or hasn't been done in storytelling before. Saying that it's my opinion that The Silence of the Lambs is unoriginal is equivalent to saying that it's my opinion that the sky is blue. And just as childish. With that said, I can literally point you, scene-by-scene, to where every single idea in The Silence of the Lambs has been written and filmed in the past. Dressed to Kill, for a major example. From the formula, to the characters, to the situations, to the set-up it's all, unarguably, one giant genre cliché. And, as I said, I can point to every movie, every book that has used the EXACT scenes in the past. This isn't just a coincidence; it's an unabashed lack of creativity and intelligence from the writer. Just more of the same cliché Hollywood and pulp fiction conventions we've seen all our lives. All the standard clichés are here, folks romantic subplot, tension at the agency, troubled childhoods, etc., etc., etc.Hannibal Lector himself is, admittedly by the author, nothing but a mash-up of various fictional and real-life serial killers. The two most obvious fictional killers he unabashedly rips-off are Leatherface (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974) and Mark Lewis (Peeping Tom, 1960). Leatherface's actions (cannibal, wears victim's faces) + Lewis's mind (pretentious, psychiatrist, study's human behavior, kills people to study reactions, gives long speeches about serial killers, has a supposed vast knowledge of the human mind) = Hannibal Lector. There is not a single character trait that Lector has that wasn't done nearly 40 years before he was written. Again, a kindergarten lack of creativity. I honestly don't even know how his character got past copyright laws.Not to mention Hannibal's cheesy persona. He pronounces liver with slurping sounds at the end. So did 3-year-olds, but I don't cower in fear of them. He never actually DOES anything on-screen, except talk. And talk. And when he does talk, he talks with the pseudo-intelligence of a high-school dropout who took a semester of psychology. Why? Because his psychological knowledge is laughably limited, and sometimes incorrect all together. He's supposed to be this oh-so-evil genius, but all he ever does is quote cliché phrases from dumbed-down Freud. He knows NOTHING about psychology. The pathetic writers just wrote enough cliché psychobabble between his laugh-out-loud cheesy slurping sounds to make it seem like he knew at least as much about the human mind as the average middle-school student. And then, just like all over-glamorized Hollywood, every time Hannibal is on the screen they point the camera up at his face with light shining behind his head as he stares at the ceiling without blinking. That's not good acting. That's made-for-TV directing they use in low-budget Jesus movies.

As the main beast, Kong, the gorilla, is physically ferocious and threatening. The film's special effects are very, very good for the 1930s. Stop motion animation, the use of miniatures, and the terrific matte paintings combine to create reasonably realistic prehistoric settings and lifelike monsters. Further, this is one of the first films to use rear screen projection.Of course, the story's underlying premise is ludicrous. But this is a fantasy film. Plausibility is less important than dramatic effect. On the isolated island, Kong is king of all he surveys. But he's lonely. And the beautiful Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) would make a wonderful companion for Kong, however one-sided the relationship.But the film does have some elements that I found unappealing. For one thing, although I can accept some subtle, low-key background music, the ear-piercing sound of a full hundred-piece orchestra not only is distracting, but also is out of place on a remote, prehistoric island.The island natives are mere caricatures. They wear tons of war paint; they carry spears; and they look mean. A little more subtlety in their appearance and in their behavior would have been welcome. And I did not like Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) at all. He comes across as a selfish, egotistical opportunist whose objectives are fame and fortune. He cares not at all about Kong as a living creature.Further, the story is hopelessly dated. Killing wild animals, or transporting them back to civilization for humans to gawk at, is rather heartless. Of course, in those days, wild animals were perceived as threats, not endangered, so the story can be forgiven for its tacky insensitivity to environmentalism.As an adventure fantasy for kids, King Kong is a fine movie. The special effects are wonderful. And Kong, despite his ferociousness, is a beast that the viewer can care about.

That's about as funny as the film gets, which is really not too bad. The wisecracks here and there and Hollywood-related jokes make up for some of the poorly-done romance scenes in the film. We honest are not really able to care enough about the characters to make this a good romantic comedy. The ending doesn't leave the audience with a sense of joy like films such as You've Got Mail and The Parent Trap do. However, since I laughed a few times, I'll admit it wasn't too bad.

As far as a Julia Roberts film goes, it's inferior to My Best Friend's Wedding but slightly better than Runaway Bride. Not highly recommended, but it might make a good date film if you don't take it too seriously and set your expectations way low.**1\/2 out of **** ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"24 April 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Just saw this on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed the love story. Beautiful cinematography, fine acting, lovely women to watch in this story of embracing mid life and retirement. A couple of thoughts - Juan's story is just like he says in the meeting with the judge, Juan in fact struggles with the truth of his life with an unfaithful mother and a father who had just one claim to fame - being dance king of Astoria. An underwhelming life. It's possible Dr. Mickler (Don Octavio) becomes a replacement for Don Juan's real father. Mickler of course becomes DOn Octavio as he is drawn deeper into Don Juan's world. If your reality is not so good, we tend to fill it in with good fantasies. Or, just enjoy it like Neverland or Pirates - a fantasy - a pleasant romantic movie with Depp and a group of fine looking ladies. I prefer to accept Johnny as Don Juan, just as Dr. Mickler did, and to enjoy the fantasy ride. The irony is most of us can identify with Dr. Mickler - having lost our youthful enthusiasm in the midst of raising a family and putting kids through college, still not able to rub two nickles together in our personal life. Like Mickler, we can CHOOSE to live a more romantic, fun, lively existence - all we have to do is choose to do so, give ourselves permission to enjoy. Many middle age men still remember their Don Juan days, many years ago, but not out of reach. Many of us would be pleasantly surprised how our spouses are just waiting for us to rediscover the romantic side of our personality. It's still there, just a bit rusty from non-use, and buried perhaps in tuition bills, mortgage payments, car payments, the office, church and community commitments, etc. We have to give ourselves some 'breathing room' just as Don Juan tells Mickler needs. Love the movie, and love the Bryan Adams song, revived this year on Ameircan Idol with Kris Allen.

He's ten years old, all alone on a dark stormy night, his parents are nowhere to be found, clearly his servants are neglecting him as well as he had to answer the door himself, and he confronted with a hideous old crone. What ten year old wouldn't be scared by that?!And then he has to find love as a beast when he wasn't even old enough to have had a chance to develop any understanding of love as a human!

The writers made little to no effort in creating a decent plot. Albert Brooks plays a scout for the New York Yankees who thinks he finds the next great pitcher, but the guy can't handle pitching in front of large crowds and ends up puking on the mound. When Brooks travels down to Mexico, he discovers a phenom who is a fan favorite named Steve Nebraska (played by Brendan Fraser). When he tries to convince the Yankees GM that he's found an outstanding pitcher, he's told he isn't bringing anyone up and ends up getting fired. I'm a huge baseball fan, but I found this movie appalling, especially near the end when Nebraska pitches in a World Series game. He throws 81 pitches, all strikes, and no hitter even makes contact. Who ends up with the only run of the game? Nebraska, of course, with a home run. Imagine that. They obviously thought no one would see the flaws in that game. For one thing, being in an American League park, they would be using a DH. The pitcher would not be hitting. Another, how did he end up with only 1 at-bat the whole game if he pitched the whole game? This movie was very predictable and, therefore, very boring. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. I wonder if even Fraser looks back on this movie and wonders why he made the mistake of agreeing to do it. It's not Fraser's fault though. No matter who was picked to star in this movie, it would have been bad simply because of the plot. I found Little Big League to be more realistic than this and that was about a little kid managing a major league team.
