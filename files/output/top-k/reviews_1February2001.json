So all right already, six months later, I'm giving it a 10.Now why, you might ask, would I give this movie a 10.  It is not an action movie.  It has no gratuitous sex, no foul language, no senseless death in mountains of living color and tons of gore, and no stunning musical score.  It has no visually stunning graphics, and it doesn't have any really compelling or dynamic characters.  In short, it doesn't seem to have anything that would make it appeal to the masses.  So why a 10.  The answer is that the thing just won't let me alone.  I keep watching it and watching it.  It appeals to the emotional side of me.  And any story that can reach down and touch me like that, has to be well written and well acted, so much so that it does it's job and has its subtle affect before the viewer is even aware that he or she has been hooked.  That is a rare quality, yet such is the quality of the movie we have before us.  That is what makes You've Got Mail worth a 10.Perhaps I am becoming more appreciative of romance and simple, down-to-earth characters than I once was.  Perhaps I'm beginning to understand that life doesn't revolve around violence, sex, and shock language.  Perhaps I'm simply coming back to what I've always known.  Whatever the reason, this movie (and movies like it) make it happen for me.  They are more satisfying than any I can remember seeing in the past.  I hope this is a trend in the industry.A simple boy meets girl, girl meets boy, movie told with elegance and taste.  See the movie.  Buy the movie.  Enjoy!

Everything he makes is a huge project. He even has to be the biggest when it comes to commercials. In Thelma and Louise, he brings together an excellent cast to make an enjoyable road-movie.Yes, I know, a road movie isn't usually considered a big film. But with a cast like this, it's really hard to screw up. Geena Davis is Thelma, housewife who is ruled by her controlling husband (an oddly cast Christopher McDonald). Susan Sarandon is Louise, a waitress in a diner whose boyfriend (Michael Madsen) cares for her a lot more than she expects. One day, they decide to leave on a small vacation, only a couple of days. They stop by a country bar and Thelma dances with a guy who takes her out. There, he attempts to rape her, but the girls shoot him. There starts their odyssey to get to Mexico, to flee from the law. Along the way, they'll pick up a two-bit (but polite) thief (Brad Pitt, who speaks like he has no teeth) and elude more than once the cop who's trying to track them (Harvey Keitel).This film is widely considered as a feminist film, but I don't really see what that's supposed to mean. Yes, our two protagonists are women. Yes, they commit crimes against men. Yes, those men are depicted as pigs. But, there are many other films who follow that kind of, say, guidelines and yet are never commonly known as feminist. However, these are only my opinions, so if you are a feminist, then feminize away.The real problem of this movie lies in the two main characters.  For such a character-driven movie, there are many times where the two women take weird swings that completely negates what their characters were supposed to be. There are so many mood siwngs, character turns and misplaced emotions that by the end, you just don't care who they are inside, just who they are outside.That said, we can dwell on the high points of this film. As mentioned, the performances are spectacular. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are utterly believeable, even when the material runs out. Brad Pitt (in one of his first major roles, even if it a supporting role) is perfectly cast and Keitel, even though he is completely out of place with his Noo Yawk accent, fills his surprisingly small part well.Thelma and Louise is a very good film, feminist or not.

And having been a fan of the comic when I could find it, I think it told the stories very well.  I admit that the green sphere link was silly and did not work, and that the original carousel concept would have been much better (watch the DVD release for details on this).  The simple fact that I have bought 3 copies of this time and still own all 3 of them says something about the movie.Harry Canyon, Den, and Taarna are the be the most remembered pieces of this movie.  Each in itself could even be fleshed out to hour long length, and still be enjoyable.  So Beautiful, So Dangerous is enjoyable, and Harold Ramis and John Candy steal the show with their voices (Hey man, you got any of that plutonium niborg left?).  And I admit, the film version of the story was MUCH more enjoyable then the original one from the comic.PS  Watch for the cameo of a destroyed USS Enterprise.

Recently, a kind person out there notified me of an historical mistake in my previous commentary, pointing out to me that it was Lucius Verus who co-ruled with Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris' character in the film) and not Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  I have to thank that person, because to be honest, I have not read much about the later years of the Roman Empire in many years, and had forgotten many details concerning the end of the Pax Romana.  Nonetheless, and I may be wrong about this as it comes off the top of my head, I do believe that Marcus Aurelius did in fact approve of the choice of his son Commodus, which was not the case in Gladiator.  But I have to say, in this matter, I prefer the fictional account of the events over the reality.  And to me, Gladiator does capture the essence of a broader Roman history in microcosm.  In particular I found it strikingly interesting that at one of the gladiating tournaments in the film, the commentator spoke of the ancient Roman enemy of mighty Carthage as something out of hallowed antiquity... it seems unbelievable to imagine that the Roman empire lasted nearly a thousand years, and its citizens would probably have never been able to imagine it ending (doesn't it LOOK in the film as though the colosseum was built to last forever?  And they do call Rome the Eternal City, after all) or that a dark age would follow, with a thousand more years of ignorance and illiteracy until our modern age.  It's hard to imagine that by the time in which Gladiator takes place, the Punic wars against Carthage which they use to stage gladiator battles in Gladiator had been over for around four hundred years!  It kind of puts it into perspective how short-lived our own modern era is thus far.  And just how long will we prosper before our empire begins to decline?  When I think of this and put myself in Marcus Aurelius' shoes, who, in Gladiator, could foresee that under his son Commodus, the empire would be heading into disaster (it IS nice to think that Marcus Aurelius would have foreseen this), I can understand why he was so determined to choose Maximus as his successor in order to return Rome to a republic (arguably something better).  Gladiator is on one level a satisfying film because it not only asks what might have been possible to save the Roman Empire from collapsing but tempts us with a possible answer!  As it turned out, nothing could save Rome; though the strength of Maximus' character is such that you begin to believe that he can save Rome from itself.  To sum it up if you enjoy a thought-provoking film that will leave you with more questions long after the film is over, you'll enjoy Gladiator.

I'd read the novel this is based on years before and wondered how something so talky and philosophical could be made into a film? The answer is, very very badly. The filmmakers wisely played down the philosophy, but were left with nothing more than a tangled & lame sci-fi tale that was dated when it was new.Now I'm a sci-fi fan and cut my favorite genera flicks a lot of slack, but here different sequences seem to have been done by different directors, as the tone shifts from bad to worse with awkward scatterings of forced humor. These shifts seem an attempt to disguise a confused screenplay that would have us believe that everything from paper books, to Harrier jets and atomic weapons will function just dandy after a millenium of neglect. This comes after we've seen that a few sessions on a teaching machine will enable an ambitious aboriginal and his pals to teleport atomic bombs and destroy entire planets. We also learn that humanity has sunk to the tribal edge of extinction and speak in `Me Tarzan' phrases that also include `Piece of cake' and `Get the hell out of here'. It all feels cut down from a much longer film, which could only have been worse then this one. The bombastic score tries to make us care about characters that we've never been introduced to, and tell us Johnny is doing something important while leaving us to only guess what that could be.

Both films deal with asylums and mental illness, but while Nicholson's character slowly slides into madness, Winona Ryder's character (Suzanna) slowly pulls herself out of it. Not that she was totally crazy anyway. She was withdrawn, introspective, and dissatisfied with her lot in life. One botched attempt at a suicide, and the next thing she knows, she's being introduced to everybody at a mental ward. She eventually befriends the women staying there... Daisy, a girl whom only eats chickens from her father's deli, and stores the bones beneath her bed... Polly, a perpetually happy girl whom burned half of her face off as a child... Valerie, a nurse with a very patient demeanor played by Whoopi Goldberg... and then there's Lisa, played by Angelina Jolie. Lisa is a rebel, and is constantly fighting with the doctors and nurses. At first this seems to be because she has everything figured out, and is too smart to be in a mental hospital. But as Suzanna and the audience later discover, that's not the case at all.Suzanna and Lisa develop an uneasy friendship, and at the times when Lisa turns on Suzanna, the movie takes on a bit of a horror feel, such as the underground scene near the end. It also creates some hilarious scenes, like Suzanna's confrontation with a mother of one of her former classmates in the ice cream shop.I wasn't aware that Girl Interrupted is actually based on the real life experience of writer Susanna Kaysen. This fact alone gives me even more respect for the film, as I imagine it may be quite difficult for her to revisit that time of her life. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a chick flick. True, 90% of the main characters are women, but this is a hard hitting movie that everybody can watch and come away with a slightly different perspective on life. As the tagline says... Sometimes the only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy. How true.

Until I remembered that Girl takes place in the late 60's, and I believe that Cuckoo's Nest takes place in the 70's (although I could be wrong...) thus making the modern compliment a little confusing. Both films deal with asylums and mental illness, but while Nicholson's character slowly slides into madness, Winona Ryder's character (Suzanna) slowly pulls herself out of it. Not that she was totally crazy anyway. She was withdrawn, introspective, and dissatisfied with her lot in life.

We can appreciate everything about this story for being small and unassuming and yet alive. Sebastian's confusion and posing seem somehow sincere and he remains likeable as the protagonist.

At the same time there is a deep sense of loss, of delusion, of dislocation. There is something intangible about this film, something that goes beyond story and plot.
