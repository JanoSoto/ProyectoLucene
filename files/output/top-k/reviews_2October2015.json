Behind schedule and desperate for assistance, the British educated but cringeworthy Japanese commander offers the officer good food and wine, but is rejected. Eventually the Japanese commander relents. After a mere month in an amplified 100% humidity 35 degree Celsius environment, the British officer, showing few ill effects, decides to take over the building of the bridge, to bring a little British civilisation to the jungles of Burma. It's all jolly good show, and very capital, what. It brings great spirit to the men, and they respond with a bespoke bridge, built to last 600 years. They even place a nice plaque on the bridge, celebrating their achievements - written in English, of course.Unknown to the officer, a group of British-US-Canadian 'commandos' (all four of them) are bringing plastic explosives, with young Burmese ladies to carry their possessions and assist in their baths. They encounter only three Japanese soldiers on the way to the bridge, and are soon viewing the bridge from the nearest hill, alongside the Burmese ladies. One of the team sets plastic explosives on the bridge, with a wire from the bridge that is so obvious, that only a British officer can spot it, and he immediately tries to stop his piece of British colonialism being destroyed - even if it does aid the enemy.The ending is so absurd it has to be seen to be believed. This movie is Englishness to its core. If someone asked me to give them a movie exemplifying English culture, this would be hard to go past. It isn't a war movie, it's an attack on the rigid English class system, English superiority complex, and servile masses pushed to its extreme limits.

When Guinness, the epitome of the English class system, falls on the detonator, the film is brought to its natural conclusion. You can almost imagine Lean and co's wry smiles if only one person in the cinema actually got it, and roaring with laughter when the Americans gave him an Oscar for a 'war film'.

Throughout the movie, there are battles between whites and blacks, and the Titans against their weekly opponents. They are playing to prove that they are the best in the state and that blacks and whites work as one. This movie acts as a metaphor for the struggles of life, which makes it easy for anyone to connect with the movie. Remember the Titans is set back in 1971 in Alexandria, Virginia, less than 10 years after the Civil Rights act was passed. Tension between blacks and whites is at its highest in Alexandria when the high school becomes integrated and Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is hired as the head coach of the high school football team and he replaces, now assistant head coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton). This change causes the white kids to second guess playing football because they don't want to play for a black coach or with black teammates. But both coaches come to agreement and take their appointed roles as coaches. They haul both black and white players off to football camp so bonds can be made and they can learn to play as one. The director, Boaz Yakin, does a great job of showing that friendships are important through the plot of this movie. Boaz gives us an important example of finding who your true friends are. He illustrates this point by showing us a scene where a white player breaks up with his girlfriends because she didn't approve of his interactions with the black players. This one decision made by a white teammate proved to most of the other players that whether they were black or white, that they could put aside their differences and just be friends. Boaz Yakin presents the dialogue and setting of this film in a way that makes you feel like you were watching a movie developed in the 1970's. Like explained before, there was still tension between blacks and whites at this time. This movie really gives you a good demonstration of what life would be like to be black, friends with blacks, or even what goes through the mind of white people who discriminated blacks. This is another aspect of the film where the director does a great job.. Though I really like this movie, there is one thing that might take this movie down a notch. That factor is that it isn't very original. This isn't the first movie ever made that shows the integration of blacks and whites in sports. Also, there are characters that have been used in previous sports movies like the classic fat kid. Or the guy that joins the team and has never played before who ends up being a key player. Then there are the moments where two guys that fight each other end up being the closest of friends. Even though they may not be original thought, I think the director and the actors do a good job of using these old news situations and making them intertwine with the plot of the movie. The overall mood of Remember the Titans is excited or happy even though there are some sad moments. I say the mood is exciting because there are lots of moments where your skin begins to tingle from what just happened or from what is about to happen. The mood ties in with the acting and the atmosphere very well. Just look for a slight smirk from Coach Boone or listen to the roar of the crowd. Those small bits in the movie make you feel part of the moment and give you flashbacks of good times. Remember the Titans is a good movie. It has everything a person could want in a film and everything you really need. I personally feel that everyone should watch it, either just to watch a good movie or to have a very good message illustrated for you. I give it an 8\/10.

Amnesia only worked well in one film that I remember -- Ronald Colman's Random Harvest. Frequency is not about amnesia. It is about time travel. And this is that rare movie about time travel that actually works and is rather engrossing.One reason that this works is because they don't try to apply the theme to world-wide events. Instead, they focus on a father and his son over about 3 decades. The father a fire fighter, the son a policeman. As in common with such themes, every time the father and son intervene to change family history, unintended things also happen. So as they fix one thing, something else goes wrong, and then that needs to be fixed. And it all involves trying to solve some serial murders that happened years ago. And how do the father and son communicate over all those years -- the same ham radio that seems to derive special powers due to the aurora. A little far-fetched? Of course. But it works, and it works well. In fact, the way things happen is rather ingenious.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"2 October 2015","score":"","review":" At times John Woo's The Killer has segments that seem directly lifted from those Chinese karaoke videos that my parents and their friends used to crowd around. They share the same dreamlike qualities - random flutterings of doves meant to be symbolically relevant, a hazy background that seems perfect for the haunting vibraphone score, slow motion for the most emotionally tense moments and so on. It is problematic because throughout the film Woo piles on these elements, combined with the shoot-outs upon shoot-outs that seem to last an eternity, and it is difficult to know whether to laugh or not. When Detective Li Ying storms up towards Ah Jong's hideout in fury after the death of his partner, he cocks his gun and right before climbing over the wall, does a forward roll for seemingly no reason. Later, two of the white suited goons of Frank's hire execute a similar manoeuvre as they drive up to assault the house. There are good characters, and there are terrible characters. The latter is firstly Frank, who Woo seems to think can be made menacing merely by suiting him up and placing Ray Bans on his head. This does not make for the deadly assassin that he is stated to be. It is funnier yet when his apparently deadly methods include sending endless hordes of gunmen at the target and in reality just providing fodder for yet another shoot-out. There is also the object of Ah Jong's desire, Jennie, who falls in love with him pretty easily. Their initial encounters evoke a rather neo-noir aesthetic with the grimy neon signs of the karaoke bar, and the glistening asphalt in the back alley. Magical and slightly surreal, but her character itself is bland, displaying no distinct qualities apart from being the voice of innocence which shouts out (okay well she's quite meek really) plot points and warnings. Why is the room so dark, she inquires, right before the dark dramatic shoot-out which will end with her lover's death. There is one moment of saving grace, where she fires a gun then immediately collapses into tears at what she thinks she has done, which highlights exactly how the average civilian might react to such events. Both Ah Jong and Li Ying are portrayed quite well, and manage to create real emotion from the rather oddly paced script. You can almost believe the tears of rage at the end as Li Ying succumbs to his anger and murders the triad boss, renouncing his former morals. Maybe they aren't so different after all. The best character however has to be Fung Sei, Ah Jong's close friend who encounters and struggles with several dilemmas involving friendship, honour and betrayal. Here is a man who has long given up the assassin life but who still has vestiges of pride and commitment to long term friendship left in him. Woo builds up his heroic escape, and then makes him misfire literally by miscounting the number of bullets in his gun, a great moment of characterisation using a dialogue callback.But it still remains impossibly hard to root for these characters when Woo seems to prefer the endless shoot-outs and their dramatic role. They are used to build character and resilience, but very early on they blur and become all too repetitive, and trivial, because although our main characters take hits, they seem to be fine moments later. The first infiltration by Ah Jong is quite well choreographed and edited, but after that point The Killer seems to descend into repeated massacres. I can acknowledge the gun-fu influence on similar Hollywood type action scenes (The Matrix, Tarantino, Rodriguez), but even so The Killer's action sequences are horribly disjointed and chaotic. Hordes of nameless and faceless goons seem to stumble and teleport into the frame, their lifeless bodies spasming onto the ground before we are even aware of what has occurred. Do not fret however, for the most gory and vital bits always seem to be emphasised via this self-important slow motion. This does not build tension, but sentimentality. Sometimes, like when the Triad boss shoots Ah Jong from outside the church and around the door, the action will not make logical sense. Other times, the action is put on pause altogether for moments of melodrama; after Fung Sei is shot within an inch of his life, the goons suddenly stop storming the church to allow our dear friends to say goodbye. Woo seems to lean onto these elongated action sequences as if they are the most important moments for the main characters. After the trio escape from yet another ambush, there is a chance to reflect or simply bask in the reluctant alliance they have been forcibly pushed into. But Woo cuts to that dramatic confrontation where they both refuse to kill each other, and then cuts again rapidly to them tending to each others wounds. Where is the meat? My favourite little tidbit is when Li Ying infiltrates Ah Jong's apartment, sits in his chair and slides over to the doorway, imitating the same shooting action as Ah Jong when forced to defend his home. A bit of subtlety in visualising how they are not so different from each other, both armed guns shaped by larger, uncontrollable forces. It's all very sad of course, but Woo cannot wrap it up. The end of the film has perhaps the most karaoke-like scene of them all, a wistful Chow Yun Fat solemnly playing the harmonica beside the window. Surely we are not meant to take this seriously?

The first infiltration by Ah Jong is quite well choreographed and edited, but after that point The Killer seems to descend into repeated massacres. I can acknowledge the gun-fu influence on similar Hollywood type action scenes (The Matrix, Tarantino, Rodriguez), but even so The Killer's action sequences are horribly disjointed and chaotic. Hordes of nameless and faceless goons seem to stumble and teleport into the frame, their lifeless bodies spasming onto the ground before we are even aware of what has occurred. Do not fret however, for the most gory and vital bits always seem to be emphasised via this self-important slow motion. This does not build tension, but sentimentality. Sometimes, like when the Triad boss shoots Ah Jong from outside the church and around the door, the action will not make logical sense. Other times, the action is put on pause altogether for moments of melodrama; after Fung Sei is shot within an inch of his life, the goons suddenly stop storming the church to allow our dear friends to say goodbye. Woo seems to lean onto these elongated action sequences as if they are the most important moments for the main characters. After the trio escape from yet another ambush, there is a chance to reflect or simply bask in the reluctant alliance they have been forcibly pushed into. But Woo cuts to that dramatic confrontation where they both refuse to kill each other, and then cuts again rapidly to them tending to each others wounds. Where is the meat? My favourite little tidbit is when Li Ying infiltrates Ah Jong's apartment, sits in his chair and slides over to the doorway, imitating the same shooting action as Ah Jong when forced to defend his home. A bit of subtlety in visualising how they are not so different from each other, both armed guns shaped by larger, uncontrollable forces. It's all very sad of course, but Woo cannot wrap it up.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"2 October 2015","score":"","review":" At times John Woo's The Killer has segments that seem directly lifted from those Chinese karaoke videos that my parents and their friends used to crowd around. They share the same dreamlike qualities - random flutterings of doves meant to be symbolically relevant, a hazy background that seems perfect for the haunting vibraphone score, slow motion for the most emotionally tense moments and so on. It is problematic because throughout the film Woo piles on these elements, combined with the shoot-outs upon shoot-outs that seem to last an eternity, and it is difficult to know whether to laugh or not. When Detective Li Ying storms up towards Ah Jong's hideout in fury after the death of his partner, he cocks his gun and right before climbing over the wall, does a forward roll for seemingly no reason. Later, two of the white suited goons of Frank's hire execute a similar manoeuvre as they drive up to assault the house. There are good characters, and there are terrible characters. The latter is firstly Frank, who Woo seems to think can be made menacing merely by suiting him up and placing Ray Bans on his head. This does not make for the deadly assassin that he is stated to be. It is funnier yet when his apparently deadly methods include sending endless hordes of gunmen at the target and in reality just providing fodder for yet another shoot-out. There is also the object of Ah Jong's desire, Jennie, who falls in love with him pretty easily. Their initial encounters evoke a rather neo-noir aesthetic with the grimy neon signs of the karaoke bar, and the glistening asphalt in the back alley. Magical and slightly surreal, but her character itself is bland, displaying no distinct qualities apart from being the voice of innocence which shouts out (okay well she's quite meek really) plot points and warnings. Why is the room so dark, she inquires, right before the dark dramatic shoot-out which will end with her lover's death. There is one moment of saving grace, where she fires a gun then immediately collapses into tears at what she thinks she has done, which highlights exactly how the average civilian might react to such events. Both Ah Jong and Li Ying are portrayed quite well, and manage to create real emotion from the rather oddly paced script. You can almost believe the tears of rage at the end as Li Ying succumbs to his anger and murders the triad boss, renouncing his former morals. Maybe they aren't so different after all. The best character however has to be Fung Sei, Ah Jong's close friend who encounters and struggles with several dilemmas involving friendship, honour and betrayal. Here is a man who has long given up the assassin life but who still has vestiges of pride and commitment to long term friendship left in him. Woo builds up his heroic escape, and then makes him misfire literally by miscounting the number of bullets in his gun, a great moment of characterisation using a dialogue callback.But it still remains impossibly hard to root for these characters when Woo seems to prefer the endless shoot-outs and their dramatic role.

She is a simple secretary that her boss decides one day to kill by pushing her through a window. But she survives. There are miracles like that in life. And she becomes Catwoman out of her total insanity.

But the real problem his secretary, the future Catwoman, discovered is that the factory will be an environmental and ecological catastrophe (3that will be my legacy says Mr. Shreck, showing how vain industrialists can and may be.). The film is very skimpy on this problem and Bruce Wayne, at the end, only tells him to stop speaking because anyway he is going to prison as soon as the film is finished.The main character against Batman is the Penguin, a melodramatic orphan (self orphaned probably), a pathetic story teller, a miserable violent and criminal ambitious nincompoop, a lackluster entertainer who is just the addition of poop to nin, nothing, though it means not of sound mind in Latin. He lives with a whole flock of penguins in an Arctic kingdom of some sort in the sewers and he is surrounded by a band of social cases who are jugglers, acrobats, whizz kids, and plain clowns and criminals who are just there to entertain the crowd before shooting them down like useless dogs. Though it is a cliché to say that a social case or a serial killer is the result of the bad education given to a child by his parents, it is done effectively to make us believe that the poor chap has become a criminal by choice vastly teleguided by what society made him suffer, bear and endure, in this case because he has a certain physical malformation that becomes his total fixation. His orientation and fixation then is a bird that does not fly and eats salmon. I guess that would easily be considered by some as the eleventh gender orientation, because as for gender he is nothing but a bird of no feather at all.The action is packed, the violence is brutal, which is expected, and the end is sadly unromantic, which is saluted by the audience as a good thing because if a cat meets a bat I do not know what kind of a chat they could have under their hats, and one cannot pat the other but scratch and when the other sat on the first one she felt like a rebellious mat. And imagine a rat in that couple. The two would be fighting to have a good bite into it.

It is reasonably historically accurate but neither the script by Michael Thomas nor the direction by Michael Caton-Jones, making his debut, are as strong as they could be. Given the subject matter, it could hardly leave out sex scenes but some of them were a little over the top.The film's strength lies in the acting. John Hurt gives a brilliant performance as Stephen Ward, the social climbing osteopath and artist who uses girls such as Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies to increase his status by introducing them to prominent men. In Keeler's case, the fact that he introduced her to both the Minister of War John Profumo and the Russian naval attaché \/ spy Eugene Ivanov was the source of the trouble. In the film, Ward is not depicted as being a very good man. In fact, he is a rather unsavoury sort whom my mother would describe as a dirty devil. He seems to care about no one but himself. Keeler is fond of him but I think that his affection for her is limited to what he thought that she could for him. However, he is never as interesting or compelling a character as he could be as the writing is somewhat lacking. That said, the film did a good job in eliciting sympathy towards the end when his friends abandon him and he is put on trial for living off immoral earnings or, to put it more simply, being a pimp. In the film's final scene, Ward's suicide is depicted when he takes a drug overdose, no longer able to cope with the pressure of the trial and the constant hounding of the press. He was found guilty in absentia shortly before his death but the result has been severely criticised due to the lack of evidence against him and it is currently under review. There was plenty of blame to go around but the bulk of it was shouldered by Ward, which was unfair. On the other hand, Profumo was able to rebuild his reputation to a certain extent due to his charity work. The cynical part of me tends to think that that was the main reason why he did it.I had never seen Joanne Whalley in anything before but I was very impressed by her performance of Christine Keeler, the last surviving major participant in the scandal. The film depicts Keeler as a troubled young woman, barely more than a child when she meets Ward and moves in with him. Ward does not force her into having relationships with numerous men but he does subtly manipulate her into doing so. She was hardly a naive person in spite of her youth but she trusted him more than he deserved and he let her down. I can't blame her for going to the press in the circumstances. Ian McKellen is extremely good as Profumo, whom the film does not hesitate to portray in a very negative light, but he has surprisingly little screen time. Bridget Fonda has seldom been better than as Mandy Rice-Davies, who delivered the immortal line, Well, he would, wouldn't he? during Ward's trial, even if her English accent does occasionally slip. It also features great performances from the perfectly cast Leslie Phillips as Lord Astor, Jereon Krabbé as Ivanov, Deborah Grant as Profumo's heartbroken humiliated wife Valerie Hobson (the former film star best known for her roles in Bride of Frankenstein and Great Expectations (1946)), Daniel Massey as Mervyn Griffith-Jones, Iain Cuthbertson as Lord Hailsham, Jean Alexander as Mrs. Keeler, Alex Norton and Paul Brooke as the police officers and Trevor Eve as the American erstwhile matinée idol David Fairfax, Jr., who is no way, shape or form based on Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Showing that it really is a very small world, both Hobson and Fairbanks, Jr. appeared in the 1937 film Jump for Glory.Overall, this is a good film but it never reaches the level that it should. When I taught a constitutional law tutorial on ministerial responsibility last year, I described the Profumo affair to the students (none of whom seemed to have heard of it) as a real life Cold War thriller involving a showgirl, a Minister of the Crown, a Soviet spy and a film star.

When I taught a constitutional law tutorial on ministerial responsibility last year, I described the Profumo affair to the students (none of whom seemed to have heard of it) as a real life Cold War thriller involving a showgirl, a Minister of the Crown, a Soviet spy and a film star.

","genre":"Drama, History"},{"date":"2 October 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Based on the 1987 book Honeytrap by Anthony Summers and Stephen Dorril, this is quite a good film treatment of the Profumo affair which rocked the British establishment in 1963 and severely discredited the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan. It is reasonably historically accurate but neither the script by Michael Thomas nor the direction by Michael Caton-Jones, making his debut, are as strong as they could be. Given the subject matter, it could hardly leave out sex scenes but some of them were a little over the top.The film's strength lies in the acting. John Hurt gives a brilliant performance as Stephen Ward, the social climbing osteopath and artist who uses girls such as Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies to increase his status by introducing them to prominent men. In Keeler's case, the fact that he introduced her to both the Minister of War John Profumo and the Russian naval attaché \/ spy Eugene Ivanov was the source of the trouble. In the film, Ward is not depicted as being a very good man. In fact, he is a rather unsavoury sort whom my mother would describe as a dirty devil. He seems to care about no one but himself. Keeler is fond of him but I think that his affection for her is limited to what he thought that she could for him. However, he is never as interesting or compelling a character as he could be as the writing is somewhat lacking. That said, the film did a good job in eliciting sympathy towards the end when his friends abandon him and he is put on trial for living off immoral earnings or, to put it more simply, being a pimp. In the film's final scene, Ward's suicide is depicted when he takes a drug overdose, no longer able to cope with the pressure of the trial and the constant hounding of the press. He was found guilty in absentia shortly before his death but the result has been severely criticised due to the lack of evidence against him and it is currently under review. There was plenty of blame to go around but the bulk of it was shouldered by Ward, which was unfair. On the other hand, Profumo was able to rebuild his reputation to a certain extent due to his charity work. The cynical part of me tends to think that that was the main reason why he did it.I had never seen Joanne Whalley in anything before but I was very impressed by her performance of Christine Keeler, the last surviving major participant in the scandal. The film depicts Keeler as a troubled young woman, barely more than a child when she meets Ward and moves in with him. Ward does not force her into having relationships with numerous men but he does subtly manipulate her into doing so. She was hardly a naive person in spite of her youth but she trusted him more than he deserved and he let her down. I can't blame her for going to the press in the circumstances. Ian McKellen is extremely good as Profumo, whom the film does not hesitate to portray in a very negative light, but he has surprisingly little screen time. Bridget Fonda has seldom been better than as Mandy Rice-Davies, who delivered the immortal line, Well, he would, wouldn't he? during Ward's trial, even if her English accent does occasionally slip.

This film is about the 2 stars trying to escape a curse set by their ancestor on any man that loves an Owens woman. The movie does have some pretty cool looking special effects, and there is very good chemistry between all the characters in the movie. Although the film's plot seems a bit jumbled and unfocused. The movie's comedy falls flat many times even though the characters are likable. At a few points I was confused as to what the movie was actually about.

In one corner there's Gavin Banek (Affleck), an insensitive, 29-year-old Wall Street attorney who's married to the boss's daughter (Amanda Peet), already is a partner in a major law firm In the other corner is Doyle Gipson (Jackson), an older, recovering alcoholic who works in an insurance-selling sweatshop for low wages, and is desperately trying to remake his life so he can keep his wife and two young boys from leaving him. One stressful day the pair run into each other while, yes, changing lanes on the FDR Expressway. Late for court, Gavin brushes Doyle off, and leaves him stranded at the scene of the accident, preventing him from making the court appearance that might have saved his family.The film does not take much nor does it add anything new. A lot of it seems much as if it is filler time or time to pass upon film. It's relativity short but feels lengthy- which isn't good in this case. In the end it just suffers from boredom.
