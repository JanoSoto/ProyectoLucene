Still, I decided to finally see this film for the first time and thought I'd toss my impressions into the HUGE pool of information.Jack Nicholson, like the story's author Stephen King, is a school teacher who has quit in order to become a writer. He arranges an unusual job that will give him LOTS of spare time--he and his wife and son will move to a resort in the mountains and be the caretakers during the off-season. This is problematic for several reasons. First, they are all alone and the snow will keep them alone for months on end. So, if there are any problems, they are screwed. Second, Nicholson plays an alcoholic in recovery--and there's no booze in the place. Third, and probably the biggest one of all, is that the place is evil and begins screwing with the family--particularly their weirdo kid and the father. For the most part, the wife (Shelley Duvall) is there to look scared and be preyed upon! I could tell you more about the film....but won't. I don't want to spoil the suspense.I should also note that this is a very adult film. I am not talking about the violence--though it is violent and scary. But the language and very explicit nude scenes make it something you might want to think about before you watch it or let your kids see it.So what did I like about the film? Well the music was great--and REALLY pulled off the scare-factor!! And, the film is quite tense and exciting. I also liked the cinematography. It's odd, though, that the opening scenes shot by helicopter were GORGEOUS but the VERY Obsessive-Compulsive Kubrick (who was known to make a bazillion retakes of scenes) didn't catch or care that you can actually see a shadow of the 'copter in the opening. Look carefully at the bottom right of the screen and you'll see it.My complaints about the film are few. But, I do think that Nicholson's characterization is something you'll either love or hate. I thought he seriously over-acted and agreed with King's assertion that he ALREADY seemed crazed when the film began. King's notion of the problem being related to alcohol are pretty much minimized in the Kubrick treatment---it's much more a film about insanity and evil spirits.I understand that Stephen King hated this particular adaptation of his novel and later he produced his own mini-series more in line with his vision for the film.

I am not a huge fan of horror films but can sure respect what was accomplished here.By the way, it's interesting that this film is an awful lot like King's later film 1408--an awful lot.

THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a film picking up Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay. It's a very rare thing for any film to do that but once you see this film it's easy to see why it was such a hit back in the day and why it hasn't lost a bit of its impact in the years since. I've always felt that the film was about as close to flawless as any film could get and it's strongest aspect is the brilliant performances mixed in with some of the greatest characters ever written. The film really is a mechanical workshop for how to build up suspense and beat the viewer over the head each step of the way. I've heard many people say they love the film but felt that it was just too intense for its own good, which I think is almost fair to say. Director Jonathan Demme does a masterful job at building all of this tension up and I really love how they pretty much try to make each and every scene something very creepy. This film has rightfully become legendary over the years and many of the best scenes contain some of the greatest suspense. The early scene where we first see Lector looking out at us. A wonderful sequence where Foster must crawl into a garage not knowing what she's going to find. There's a creepy autopsy sequence. Then, there's the famous scene with Lector inside the new jail cell and of course the perfect ending. The movie certainly doesn't throw in cheap humor to try and break the tension and instead it just continues to assault the viewer. The violence, while graphic at times, never takes away from what you're viewing and the film is so classy that it never falls into some sort of cheap exploitation flick. The performances really bring the characters to life and the way Foster and Hopkins play against one another has rightfully put them as some of the most memorable of all time. The way the two play their little chess match while trying to gather information from the other perfectly adds to the creepy atmosphere and you really do feel as if you're watching something very special. Scott Glenn is also very effective as Foster's mentor. Ted Levine plays the serial killer and I've always felt that he's the one who most often gets overlooked. There's no question that this film belongs to Hopkins and Foster but Levine is just so terrific in his part of Buffalo Bill that I've always been somewhat shocked that he doesn't get more attention. The tense music score, masterful cinematography and wonderful dark look just adds to what really is the perfect thriller. Since the release of this movie there have been many sequels, rip-offs and countless other films inspired by this one but nothing has come close to the perfection which is this movie. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a blockbuster actually delivering the goods and it's clearly not only one of the best films of the decade but also one of the greatest ever made.

This film has rightfully become legendary over the years and many of the best scenes contain some of the greatest suspense. The early scene where we first see Lector looking out at us. A wonderful sequence where Foster must crawl into a garage not knowing what she's going to find. There's a creepy autopsy sequence. Then, there's the famous scene with Lector inside the new jail cell and of course the perfect ending. The movie certainly doesn't throw in cheap humor to try and break the tension and instead it just continues to assault the viewer. The violence, while graphic at times, never takes away from what you're viewing and the film is so classy that it never falls into some sort of cheap exploitation flick. The performances really bring the characters to life and the way Foster and Hopkins play against one another has rightfully put them as some of the most memorable of all time. The way the two play their little chess match while trying to gather information from the other perfectly adds to the creepy atmosphere and you really do feel as if you're watching something very special. Scott Glenn is also very effective as Foster's mentor. Ted Levine plays the serial killer and I've always felt that he's the one who most often gets overlooked. There's no question that this film belongs to Hopkins and Foster but Levine is just so terrific in his part of Buffalo Bill that I've always been somewhat shocked that he doesn't get more attention. The tense music score, masterful cinematography and wonderful dark look just adds to what really is the perfect thriller. Since the release of this movie there have been many sequels, rip-offs and countless other films inspired by this one but nothing has come close to the perfection which is this movie. THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a blockbuster actually delivering the goods and it's clearly not only one of the best films of the decade but also one of the greatest ever made.

THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a rare example of a film picking up Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Screenplay. It's a very rare thing for any film to do that but once you see this film it's easy to see why it was such a hit back in the day and why it hasn't lost a bit of its impact in the years since. I've always felt that the film was about as close to flawless as any film could get and it's strongest aspect is the brilliant performances mixed in with some of the greatest characters ever written. The film really is a mechanical workshop for how to build up suspense and beat the viewer over the head each step of the way.

I've watched Gremlins which is an absolute classic and I'm looking forward to seeing The Howling. The 'Burbs is one of his films and I don't think I can say anything less than that it was a really fun movie that had some witty yet dark humor, a wonderful 80s feel, an expectedly brilliant performance by Tom Hanks and an engaging mystery. On top of that, I've detected a lot of influence from classic thrillers from Alfred Hitchcock, notably Rear Window and Psycho as well as slight resemblances to To Kill A Mockingbird.The story is set in a neighborhood like any other. Ray Peterson is off from work and doesn't have anything to do on his vacation other than to walk around in his pyjamas all day looking for something to do. A month earlier, new neighbors moved into the dark house next door to him but something's strange about them. Nobody has seen or met them, weird noises come from the house at night and the property is an absolute mess. One of Ray's other neighbors, Walter disappears and Ray along with his other pals being to suspect that the Klopek's are committing murders. A very Hitchcockian plot, and who doesn't love that? The humor in the film is dark yet witty and always amusing. I especially love how the filmmakers have gone out of their way to make the Klopek family seem as unusual as possible. It creates the right sort of mood to fit with the fun loving tone. I do feel that the design of the family and their household does come off as really clichéd and corny, but I can see what they were doing when putting the movie together.The acting is great. Outside of a wonderful performance by the always great Tom Hanks, the other actors do very well too. Rick Ducommon and Bruce Dern are highly entertaining as Ray's neighbors and provide a nice mix of verbal and physical humor which I really got good laughs out of. I also quite liked Carrie Fisher. I haven't seen many movies with her outside of the Star Wars trilogy, but I feel she did fine in her role as the wife reluctant to embrace her husband's far fetched theories. Another favorite of mine is Corey Feldman. I don't think this is the best performance of his career and his character isn't all that important, but I still enjoyed him nonetheless.One thing I think is worth criticizing though is a movement done with the camera in the scene where Ray and Art find a bone. The camera quickly zooms in and out. It seemed like an attempt at creating tension or indicate surprise, but it just looked silly to me and I admit that I actually got a little giggle out of it. As for my reference to 'To Kill A Mockingbird'... look at the design of the house and the way in which the Klopeks are viewed by the other neighbors. As if they aren't making a reference to Boo Radley. Another thing worth making note of is the wonderful level of twists and turns in the story. This film didn't come out in a way I expected it to and I freaking loved that.Overall, The 'Burbs is a classic and criminally underrated film. It's a great piece of fun that mixes lightheartedness with slight Gothic undertones which results in a film that can be enjoyed by almost everyone.

The result is a film that straddles both the director's unique sensibility and more generic thriller elements. The original Cape Fear was a straight thriller, albeit one which was controversial in its day; Scorsese's version takes that template and complicates things. The Bowdens here are no sanitised nuclear family, instead they are a family in crisis. The father is an adulterer, the mother is indifferent and the daughter, as a result, is deeply unhappy. The psychopath Max Cady is not only a sadistic menace but also a catalyst for all the problems inherent in the Bowdens already. In this way Scorsese creates a narrative with a lot fewer moral certainties than the original. Nothing is black and white here but various shades of grey. Even the historical connections between Sam Bowden and Cady are made less certain. He is not a man who bravely intervened when Cady was assaulting a woman, instead he is a lawyer who withheld evidence that would have helped his client. Although the latter action is completely understandable given Cady's vile nature, it is a considerable difference from the original good vs. evil relationship between the two men. While the other significant difference in character relationship is between Cady and the daughter Danielle. In this film he gains her trust and plays on her difficult relationship with her father; this of course results in a very uncomfortable and transgressive scene in the school basement. All in all this is a much more complex film.It isn't one of Scorsese's best though, because eventually he has to adhere to more clichéd genre conventions. The final confrontation on the boat seems like it belongs in a different film. Its an overly sensational finale that feels like it was a requirement fulfilled by Scorsese as part of his agreement to make a commercial movie for the studio. That said this is still a good film helped rather a lot by the cast. De Niro is pretty unforgettable of course. But Juliette Lewis really impresses in an emotionally deep and difficult role, while Nick Nolte's character is a complex one which he handles with great skill. Add to this some nice visual touches and a new version of the classic Bernard Herrmann score and you have some great cinematic aspects to add to the quality dramatics from the great acting ensemble.In many ways this was a very different kind of film from Martin Scorsese. Even though he is a great lover of genre cinema, up to that point in time he hadn't really made many such pictures.

It was the way this tribute was conceived that made some reviewers to declare Shadow Magic a light movie, unpretentious, not to be ranged within the masterworks of today's China film.Well, like any tribute of this kind, it is a warm story, the fathers of Chinese cinema are followed with genuine sympathy like any pioneers in any domain they simply were not aware of their future role in history; the fathers didn't know that some day they would be THE fathers. They were seeing themselves just as common guys and were behaving as such, sometimes with mistakes, sometimes with naivety, sometimes like fools, sometimes in love, sometimes bad tempered.It is also another criticism brought to Shadow Magic that it suffers from lack of originality, copying themes and moods from Cinema Paradiso. It is true that the wheel cannot be reinvented each time one makes a movie about the beginnings of cinema. However I would note that Cinema Paradiso is built differently, on a play of memory and nostalgia, while in Shadow Magic there is no place for nostalgia it is not about a vanished world of movie theaters; by the contrary, it shows the beginnings of what is today one of the most important schools of cinema worldwide.Shadow Magic called in my mind rather another film, Diarios de Motocicleta, where the main character, a sympathetic medical student nicknamed Che is also totally unaware that one day he will become a famous (or infamous, matter of perspective) revolutionary leader.There is also another plan (that was also in Ann Hu's previous Dream and Memory) the Englishman comes with his projector and suddenly East meets West in 1902's Beijing. This contact seems to be of great interest for director Ann Hu. What happens when the two universes come into contact? What happens there on the border? Do they explode, do they remain separate looking at each other across the trenches, or is a new universe emerging on the surface of contact? In Dream and Memory the border is in the mind of Hong, the Chinese who (like director Ann Hu) moved long time ago to the US. For him one universe looks like a dream, unclear and remote, while the present universe needs the mechanisms of memory to reenact the lost dream. It's East coming to the West, and West trying to recuperate East China is far away and long ago, America is here and now, China needs to be appropriated.Here in Shadow Magic it is West that comes to the the East. England is far away, China is here and now. And the border is in the heart of Liu, the Chinese passionate to go beyond the limits of his known world, while torn out by the force of his loyalties. It's a pop-out and a push-back bringing the border now and then on the brink of explosion, while little by little a coalescing universe begins to take shape. Maybe this was also the case in the Big Bang model? Just kidding.Shadow Magic is also a tribute paid to the charm of old Beijing, with its incredible mix of people and carts and camels on the streets, that incredible mix of present with its seemingly chaotic agitation and past with its quiet force; all these found in Ann Hu an exquisite artist painter. Here all reviewers are unanimous in recognizing her talent in rending the images, her sensibility for each nuance of color, for each detail of the street. Her mastership of the visual language is amazing, and also her science of controlling the movement of each actor on the scene. The movie has the synchronization of a ballet, any movement comes in its exact place, no earlier, no later, no slower, no faster, no shorter, no longer.And I think nowhere in the movie it's the cinematic genius of Ann Hu as overwhelming as in the scenes at the Great Wall. When it came there I was afraid I would see kind of a tourist commercial (the risk any moviemaker is running when shooting in a famous place). Well, it was far from that.

Lillian and Paul invite their neighbors to drink coffee with them in their apartment and Lillian shows her treadmill to Carol and Paul shows his collection of stamps to Larry. While drinking coffee, the elderly couple tells that they have been married for twenty-eight years and they have a twin tomb in the cemetery. Lillian tells that she is in good shape and uses her treadmill everyday.On the next night, Carol and Larry go to see The Flying Dutchman in the theater and when they come back home, they learn that Lillian has died of heart attack. A couple of days later, Carol and Larry meet Paul on the street and Carol believes he is too perky for a widower that has just lost his beloved wife. When Carol accidentally finds an urn with Lillian's ashes in Paul's kitchen, she suspects that Paul has killed Lillian and comments with her friend Ted (Alan Alda). They decide to investigate her neighbor and Carol steals the keys of Paul's apartment from the super. She finds that Paul will travel to Paris and not to Caribbean as he had told to Larry and she, with a woman called Helen Moss. When Carol sees by chance Lillian alive in a bus, her curiosity increases and she decides to go further in her investigation. Yesterday I was setting in order and cleaning my films on the shelf, and I decided to see again the VHS Manhattan Murder Mystery. Last time I saw this film was in the 90's and I did not recall the story in details. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors and actor, and that is the reason why I do not dare to say that this film is one of his best films because I love practically all his filmography.Manhattan Murder Mystery has mystery, suspense and the refined and witty humor typical from Woody Allen. One of my favorite moments is when Larry compares the need to Carol returning to her shrink with a GM's recall. Another very funny moment is when the clumsy Larry plays the wrong tape during the phone conversation with Paul. If the reader wants to spend 104 minutes laughing, watch Manhattan Murder Mystery since this film is funny even for those that are not fans of Woody Allen.

The motto of Timon and Pumbaa- the comedic duo of this wonderful film. These two words has to sum up what the film is about. When something goes wrong, don't worry about it. Everything will be alright. Disney's ability to convey deep, thematic scenarios does justice to it's story line and makes the audience feel every emotion you can think of. Simba (Matthew Broderick), a headstrong, young cub and son of Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is tricked into thinking that he is the cause of his father's death, thanks to his evil uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons). He therefore gets exiled and looses his identity as the future king. However, things turn around, when after a while, he realises the effect that it has on everyone within the kingdom. With Scar as the new 'king', will Simba be able to take his rightful place and king and stay true to who he really is, with the help of his friends; Nala (Moira Kelly), Rakifi (Robert Guillaume), Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella)?Disney's modern adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' in a unique and entertaining way, makes the audience see the deeper meaning of the film, along with making the film fun for the younger audience. Making the characters into animals, in my opinion, is the best thing that Disney could think of and I can see that they have done their research into the African lands and the characteristics of the animals living within. Even though the film deals with such major themes such as revenge, death and identity, the colourful characters like Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa makes the audience remember that this film is fiction. Scar, the antagonist in the film isn't a likable character, and it seems that his inspiration is from past Disney villains, like Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty), Captain Hook (Peter Pan) and Lady Tremaine (Cinderella). Everyone HAS to go and watch this film at least once. And after that... you will not be able to forget this epic story in your life(Which is a good thing!)

So, if the occasion offered itself, how would you expect an average American male to deal with the golden opportunity (like a gift from the gods) of being able to re-invent the woman of his dreams, who, already presumed dead, was also the ultimate love of his life? Well, if you were supposedly normal like Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo, then you'd simply mold her, shape her, and torment her. Through the ruthlessness of intimidation, domination and humiliation you'd repeatedly trample on her feelings until she finally succumbed to your will and became a living replica of the frickin' Barbie doll of your warped fantasy. Yeah. That's what you'd do.Of all the Hitchcock films that I've seen over the years, I'd certainly rank Vertigo as my least favorite, by far. When you carefully look below the surface of things in this one, not only can you smell the reek of misogyny, but you also get the stink of one of the most vile and unpalatable character studies (of an apparently normal American male, in the form of Scottie Ferguson) that you are ever going to see.I personally found Scottie to be an even bigger monster than, say, Norman Bates from Hitchcock's Psycho.I mean, at least we all knew well-enough that Norman wasn't normal and so that, in a sense, rendered the horrid acts that he committed as somewhat (Remember, I said somewhat) acceptable.But, on the other hand, there was Scottie who was undoubtedly presented as being about the most normal male alive in America. And, yet, his final actions belied his normalcy, 'cause when it came to re-inventing Judy into his beloved Madeleine, Scottie clearly crossed well-over the fine line of sanity and stepped straight into a madness of the most obsessively dangerous in nature.Scottie's actions were so clearly that of a bona-fide psycho. So much so that, in a sense, he ended up killing Madeleine, not once, but twice. And if that ain't crazy, then I don't know what is.As slow-paced as Vertigo initially was at the start, all-in-all, it was a fairly intriguing Mystery\/Thriller that worked fine up to about the half-way point. Then once Madeleine was killed for the first time, things quickly deteriorated into one of the most morbid and thoroughly tasteless obsessions involving a memory of the dead and a feeble attempt at its subsequent resurrection.Trivia note - Actor James Stewart, who played Scottie, was 50 at the time. Kim Novak, who played Madeleine\/Judy, was only 25. From my point of view, this huge age gap alone didn't help matters much when trying to pass these 2 off as believable on-screen lovers.
