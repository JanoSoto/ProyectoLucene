An incredible true story that demands to be told (and it sticks to the truth, which is rare in a Hollywood film). It doesn't get any better than this - in a biography. Kingsley delivers one of the finest performances ever captured on film. You instantly believe you're watching Gandhi and he stays consistently true to his character throughout this lengthy effort. What an awesome performance! To me, Kingsley's performance as Gandhi rivals Peter O'Toole's fabulous performance in Lawrence Of Arabia in greatness - as does this movie as a whole, on every level. And, in fact, given the choice to watch either film again, I'd choose Gandhi - if only because Gandhi's work made a bigger impact on the world, for the better, and his fight was more protracted and noble. In other words, the story here is the classic battle of Good versus Evil (unlike that presented in Lawrence, where the lines are not so clear - especially in retrospect). That's saying a lot - because I don't think anyone would argue that Lawrence of Arabia, the movie, did not set the standard for movie marathons, movies on the level of a Gone With The Wind (although that was, artistically, a greater triumph than Lawrence or Gandhi, I would argue). This movie is done journalistically rather than artistically. There's no attempt to inflate or make the story bigger than it was or the lines more dramatic than they were in real life - and that's, in fact, one of its strengths. That's what gives its believability and makes you care about the outcome. Plus - Gandhi, the man (as portrayed by Kingsley), comes off as one of those people you would have idolized and followed given he chance...certainly someone you'd given your eye teeth to meet (unlike Lawrence Of Arabia, toward whom I feel an indifference, at best). You really care what happens to Gandhi and those around him as the story progresses toward its inevitable end - which, by the way, speaks loudly to the times in which we live today. What an incredible accomplishment - from top to bottom! My only disappointment - following this film - was that Kingsley was never again given a lead half as great as this. Why did Hollywood not give him suitably major roles after this film? Makes you wonder. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2014","score":"","review":" Stunningly filmed.

The action is superb but much is left to be desired with some of the over the top hokey dialog and cheesiness throughout the film. Now granted there is a good bit of this film that is extremely enjoyable, the pacing of the film is well and most of the acting is decent, personally i believe Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker but a let down as Spider-Man. Let be known that as a child I grew up reading Spider-Man as he was my favorite MARVEL comic book other than Captain America, so the character holds special relevance to me. Now I'am not saying this is a bad film, not at all, but certain aspects of the film left me flat and I felt as though much more could be perfected and achieved through this film. Now granted compared to its eventual sequels this is by the far best of Raimi's Spider-man trilogy, but not the best comic book film. Enjoyable action sequences, a true to form story and with a decent pacing within the film. The biggest drawbacks are in its acting and in its dialog throughout.

But first, I want to respond to one of the recent posts that faulted this film for being unrealistic, in her words, and on the cheap. She misses the point - and knows nothing of human nature. I was in a very similar position once, in danger in a small town. And this is exactly how people react - most people are cowards and will never support you when you need their help. This movie is brilliant, in its depiction of human nature. It's a rare person who stands up for what's right and that person will be very lonely indeed. As the judge puts it in the film, I have no time to give you a civics lesson - or something to that effect. In other words, heroes are few and far between. That's what makes this movie so great - the depiction of heroism in the face of impossible odds. These kinds of men existed in the West. Wyatt Earp was one such man. So was Billy the Kid. In addition - with regard the negative reviewer's comment that this movie was made on the cheap...what did she expect? Towns in the 1800s were simple and small, just as shown here. There were no car chases, crashes, explosions or loud noises or music. I think that reviewer's naiveté about what to expect in a great film is all too telling about the lack of sophistication of today's movie goers. All they want is special effects - that, to them, makes for a great film. Shame - because she cannot appreciate true greatness, as in the acting in this film, and the subtleties it represents, in human emotions and motivations. Not to mention the commentary it makes about love - as in the taut scene between Cooper's former lover (played by Katy Jurado) and Grace Kelly (whose depth of love is tested by Cooper's decision to fight it out). In spite of the narrow range of experience expressed by the negative reviewer I referred to above, yes, there were men who stayed behind to fight it out, in truth, in our American West of 1800s, and this movie is a fine representation of them. (The Battle at the OK Corral, in fact, was the result of several brave men deciding to stick it out, in Tombstone, in the face of impossible odds - choosing to battle it out with the Cowboys (a band of real bad guys) rather than high-tailing it out of town. And they, too, had those who told them to leave - just as Cooper had happen to him in High Noon.) And Gary Cooper puts in the performance of his life here. What a brilliant film - and so unique.

The acting is so-so at best with the exception of Tony Leung who does an excellent job of showing the anguish and conflict of an undercover cop. You can see it in his eyes. Yun-fat is just plain angry all the time and does various acrobatic things with his mouth. But his character does not have depth despite some effort to portray otherwise with the implementation of a former cop friend played by John Woo himself, who Yun-fat would sometimes confine deep subjects with such as friendship, life and death, etc. However, the conversations are stiff, shallow, and lacked of emotion. This film is widely praised for its action sequences and I could see how it's come about but I'm seemly biased by today's standard. I know I shouldn't do this but I just can't help it. The action sequences are just too over-the-top. I understand the unrealistic element of action movies to entertain but this one really irks me. Unlimited amo, bullets wouldn't go through car door yet throw a person across a room as if he just got hit by a truck, people miss their marks constantly in the most obvious way - yes, I'm talking about you Mad Dog, you were in an arm base with high caliber rifles yet you used a single shot pistol, you were 12 feet away and caught your targets off-guarded, and you still missed - which by the way somehow miraculously helped Tony, who was shocked with high voltage and on the verge of death just moments ago, back on his feet faster than a stallion; Wong, the main villain, tries to explode the building filled by gas (ordered by him by the way) that he was in, with C4s. Even my kid cousin knows better and Wong't do that. I know I'm really nitpicking here but it did strike a nerve. I'm willing to overlook all that but the main problem is hard-boiled down to this it's too exaggerating, too much, and dragged on way too long which really tiresome to watch after awhile. Stripped the action and the plot is weak full with holes. There are some really cheesy scenes and dialogs. Most importantly though, I didn't feel any chemistry between characters. I didn't feel an emotional surge when a close friend is killed or when he's in great danger (A Better Tomorrow was great on this). I just didn't care for them; I was a mere spectator not an engaged participant that was drawn into the scenes. However, I'd not discredit this film for its influence. This and other Woo's films helped popularize the gun fight ballads. The scene where Yun-fat slides down the stair, back rested against the stair rail, tooth-pick in mouth, pumping the dual pistols is spectacular; wicked cool.TL;DR average at best with lots of over-the-top actions that gets old really quickly while doesn't have a good enough plot nor acting to sustain it.

I didn't feel an emotional surge when a close friend is killed or when he's in great danger (A Better Tomorrow was great on this). I just didn't care for them; I was a mere spectator not an engaged participant that was drawn into the scenes. However, I'd not discredit this film for its influence. This and other Woo's films helped popularize the gun fight ballads. The scene where Yun-fat slides down the stair, back rested against the stair rail, tooth-pick in mouth, pumping the dual pistols is spectacular; wicked cool.TL;DR average at best with lots of over-the-top actions that gets old really quickly while doesn't have a good enough plot nor acting to sustain it. Probably was great when first released but doesn't hold the water now. A Better Tomorrow and The Killer are both much better films with similar theme.

The sequel, The Secret of the Ooze is a horse of a slightly different color. It's not as good as it's predecessor but I still think it's a highly entertaining flick and a great way to kill 1 and a half hours. This sequel, like many superhero movie sequels, dives deeper into the main characters' origins and explains where the mysterious ooze that made the turtles what they are came from. In the original Mirage comics, the ooze, which was called mutagen was created by jellyfish like aliens called utroms working for a research company called T.C.R.I. In the movie, the ooze was created by humans for T.G.R.I. and the whole cosmic aliens from another dimension element was eliminated. Jordan Perry, played by David Warner (Sark from Tron) is captured by the reborn Shredder to create two new mutants to take on the green teens and eliminate them once and for all. He may seem like a bad guy at first but he comes around towards the end and he evens helps the turtles conquer old Shred head.The new mutants, Tokka and Rahzar are this film's Bebop and Rocksteady. Sure they are dim witted and inarticulate, but they are also strong and cunning and brought to life beautifully by Jim Henson and his creature making team. Henson also works on the turtles once more and even though they have slightly bigger heads and their facial expressions are a bit off, they are still just as stunning and breathtakingly realistic as they were in the first movie. Ernie Reyes Jr. who was Donatello's stunt double in the last movie plays Keno, a pizza delivery boy martial artist who does his best to fight on par with the turtles. The new actress portraying April does a decent job filling the shoes of Judith Hoag and all the voice actors do a good job giving a voice to their respective characters. Unfortunately, Casey Jones is absent in this movie, but we all know he'll show up once TMNT 3 rolls around.The action is good, even though the turtles don't fight with their respective weapons and the atmosphere and look of the movie really sucks you into the world both Eastman and Laird brought to life back in 1984. I like to consider TMNT 1 and 2 a two parter, for their similar style and direction almost makes them feel like the same movie. And although The Secret of the Ooze didn't intrigue me as much as the first film, it's still full of great TMNT goodness and entertainment only four anthropomorphic turtles could deliver. It's a grand addition to the turtles mythology and the kids will have their eyes glued to the screen the entire time.There's also Vanilla Ice. Nuff said.

But The Shawshank Redemption, based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when The Shawshank Redemption comes dangerously close to sounding one of those triumph of the human spirit notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him a particularly remorseless and icy man. He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But The Shawshank Redemption has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself.Eventually Andy begins to fit in, especially after he wows the guards with skills left over from his pre-prison banking career. From the first time he advises one guard to make a one-time-only tax-free gift to his wife, Andy gets a new lease on life as a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.Andy does special fiscal favors for the warden. (You know, the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow, he says about this. I had to come to prison to be a crook.) He also makes the occasional dramatic gesture, like commandeering the prison's loudspeaker and playing a Mozart aria for all his fellow inmates. The film has a tendency to wax romantic at such moments, but more often it sustains an intelligent reserve.Mr. Freeman is so quietly impressive here that there's reason to wish Red's role had more range. As written, he spends his time observing Andy fondly and describing prison life. But Mr. Freeman's commanding presence makes him a much stronger figure than that. Mr. Freeman is especially moving when he suggests how dependent Red has become on the prison walls that give shape to his life. Even so, Red has kept his ruefulness. Only guilty man in Shawshank, he jokes about himself.Mr. Robbins has the trickier role of someone whose still waters run deep, but whose experience doesn't add up until an exposition-packed denouement. (The film's swift, enjoyably far-fetched closing scenes are a sharp reminder of who is the author of this story, after all.) Andy's is the more subdued role, but Mr. Robbins plays it intensely, and he ages effectively from newcomer to father figure during the story. One of Andy's projects is improving the prison library, which once contained nothing but the equivalent of books by Stephen King.To raise funds for this undertaking, Andy is steady and patient, writing weekly letters to state officials until he gets what he wants. Mr. Darabont, a screenwriter making an impressive directorial debut, works in much the same quietly persistent way. The Shawshank Conspiracy takes shape slowly and carefully, displaying an overall subtlety that's surprising in a movie of this genre.

So it might boost the publicity then, but 15 years later, when our memories fade, the film actually has weathered pretty good, narrating from a Black young novice Henry (Lester)'s eyes, who assists Governor Jack Stanton (Travolta)'s presidential campaign for the democrats, initially Henry thinks Jack is different from other politicians because he viscerally cares about adult literacy and dyslexia, but when he gets closer to him, the stain of Jack's personal life is far more reprehensible and the conniving political game is far too scurvy for an idealist like him. With a light touch, the film sets its campaign process in a vibrant tempo, benignly portrays Jack as a zestful candidate who canvasses and panders to his voters with great facility (through the different connotations from his body gestures and a memorable slapstick cameo from Allison Janney) in spite of the relatively youthful and uninitiated team. Then when Jack's wife Susan (Thompson) comes into the scene, the placid surface cannot dissemble the cracks beneath as soon as we detect Jack's philandering nature. A sex scandal is well-expected, which invites the troubleshooter Libby (an open lesbian and a close friend of Jack and Susan since college), plays by a fiery Kathy Bates, a devil-may-care warrior can track down any sources and break them, Bates is well-deserved for this hard-earned Oscar nominated performance, her wrangle with Jack and Susan about the integrity she cannot forsake is purely magnificent. Emma Thompson is perpetually excellent, especially under Nichol's guidance, a perfect wife behind a successful man mode is such a cinch for her and she nails it with much more nuances to accentuate her vulnerability and snobbishness. As for Travolta, it has hitherto been his last decent offer (if one can count out his droll transvestite transformation in HAIRSPRAY 2007, 8\/10), underneath his cordial impression, his true color does not betray easily even in the hardest times, maybe that's why makes him a successful politician.

Forget about its reality allusions if you can, PRIMARY COLORS qualifies itself as a better-than- expected dissection of what politicians are made of, we are all characters with flaws, sometimes moralities and political expertise should be discriminated in order to see through the murky smoke screen and select the credential-ed ones instead of stalking horses.

I think some of these modern romance comedies, need to have their producers look back at this film as research, on how to make a good film. Still, why the title? Nothing happened one night? The movie takes place over several weeks, it appears. They first met one night, sure, but it didn't take a night settling to have them, fall in love. I like the title to be, Night Bus like the book by Samuel Hopkins Adams, in which the movie is based on. At less, that makes kinda more sense. Directed by Frank Capra, the movie is told through a screwball comedy that has the two leads engage in a funny battle of the sexes where the woman is often dominating and the male character is often challenge in the masculinity sense. You have to love the fast-pace repartee, farcical situations, and escapist themes here. It's hard, not to get into this film. The format came to be, whenever a major film is trying to avoid censorship from the harsh Hayes Code of the time. Verbal sparring between the sexes often serve as a stand in for physical, sexual tension. Indeed, this movie is a sex comedy without any sex. The screwball comedy also serve as a mention in discuss the issues of social classes between the different of the poor to those of the rich. The movie starts with spoil brat pampered Miami socialite, Ellen Ellie Andre (Claudette Colbert) is trying to get out from under her father's (Walter Connolly) thumb by trying to marries fortune-hunter King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against the wishes of her father who wants to have the marriage annulled. She wants to run away to go meet up Westley in New York, only to find herself sharing a bus ride with roguish out of work reporter, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) whom is wanting to use her story to get him the biggest new scoop in his life. There are numerous famous scenes throughout the film, that is later recycle, remade or spoof after such as the runaway bride or the famous hitchhiking leg scene. One of the biggest impact, the film had on popular culture was the influence it gave to a certain animator. The scenes with a minor character, Oscar Shapely (Roscoe Karns), continually calling the Gable character Doc, plus the imaginary character named Bugs Dooley mentioned once to frighten Shapely, and a scene in which Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, gave the animator, the idea of Bugs Bunny. Other mentions of Looney Tunes characters from the film include Alexander Andrews and King Westley being the inspirations for Yosemite Sam and Pepé LePew, respectively. I do have to say, my favorite scene in the movie is the 'flying trapeze' singing bus scene. While, it's mostly unlikely this would had happen in real life, I have to say the song gives the movie, its charm.I do have to say, while the movie seems lighted hearted; there is several dark humor that is still kinda risking even in today's standards. There is a scene where Warne and Andre act like a hillbilly domestic abuse couple that is a bit disturbing. Then there is a scene where Warne steals a car, after the driver tries to drive off with their luggage. That's still Grant Theft Auto, Peter. You can go to jail for that. It doesn't help his case if he even did go to trial, as he also pretended that he was indeed a gang leader in another scene in the movie, admitting to 'kidnapping' Andre. Still, with his good-natured, street-smart, and breezy performance, Gable would likely be not guilty of the crime, but found guilty on his sex appeal. He did influenced the un-sale of undershirts by taking off his shirt and exposing his bare chest in the film. The acting was pretty good here. I didn't think, Colbert deserve her Best Actress role, as her character wasn't so far off from her real life. Plus, she only took the role because her salary was doubled and she can get a well-planned vacation. Gable was more reluctant participant in the film. It's hard to believe that these two actors are supposed to fall in love with each other, as there was a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert did reading. However, they established a friendly working relationship and found that the script was no worse than those of many of their earlier films. Colbert continue to bark trouble during her time on the set, complaining. There are some critics out there that blame the movie for being a bit sexist. Both, Ellen and Peter can seem like unlikeable character because Ellen is a brat and Peter is pompous. His treatment of her reflects his disdain for her class, not because she was a woman. Her behavior reflects her inexperience with the real world, her disdain for his arrogance, and her fear of being out on the road alone. It's very easy to look back and criticize, the social norms of another era but our standards and culture have changed gradually over time; how can we look back and impose those standards on another. I really don't see the movie as sexist at all. The movie did help the bus system more as travel by women substantially increased as a result of the film. Overall If a fan of classic movies, this movie is one movie, you need to watch. Show a leg, and get hitched.

It doesn't get any better than this.True - Wilder's comic genius is not at its height especially at the start of this film - but as it goes along, you'll discover so many little classically funny and amusing vignettes - scenes created by a master, scenes you'll remember forever - that you'll be glad you stuck with this film to the very end.Enjoy!

It seduces you, thrills you and deviously makes you beg for more and at just the point you believe its all over, surprises you with the possibility of a new future. It was so amazingly directed with some fabulous work by the cast, offering everything one desires of a film. A highly satisfying film which can get creepy at parts but mostly you'd be amazed at how beautifully the characters are presented and how effectively they did their job. What makes it most satisfying is how it becomes complicated and rewarding as it goes along. It questions the priority between Love and Ambition.

It's not the conventional drama, thriller or whatever. It's the real deal. It's about the real horror. But this is just possible to realize after the end. Why? You need to see for yourself.It don't has that much of a character development, an aspect that I think important, and the dialogs says nothing overly important for our perception about the characters, but everything which happens in the submarine is so intense and sincere, that the viewer don't need much more to be involved in the story. The acting is outstanding in my opinion, and so were the terrific FX(given the year, 1981) and the excellent direction and cinematography. And after all, it's a cruel and unfortunately truth about the world in war. The horror, the fear and tension the confined men suffers for a long period , things that can drive even the bravest man to a mental collapse. Though is not flawless. Some things aren't explained and others are way too confuse, and the soundtrack don't has an important presence. And again, I didn't feel connected with any character in the submarine. I was a viewer that sometimes was 'into' the story, but sometimes 'out' of it. It couldn't live up only by the thriller and the tension, both the fuel of the film.

Let's see. The general idea is lifted from Field of Dreams, only this is episodic instead of linear and lacks the happy climactic bonding of son and deceased father. I mean, each of the protagonists has a weird experience alone in a farming community, after which he becomes obsessed and hypomanic, and the local Sons of the Soil regard him as nuts. Then, in the odd ball villagers, there is a touch of Northern Exposure and Rocket Gibraltar, the film to which the television series owes a good deal. The structure runs parallel to Charlie. I think maybe the jumbo but pathetic monster of Frankenstein may be stretching things too far.Travolta is convincing enough as the cheerful, modest, perceptive brain tumor victim. I liked Kyra Sedgewick because she fits the role of the single mother with two children who wants to keep her life uncomplicated out here in the wilderness of buff hills and bunch grass. Forest Whitaker is fine as the recluse -- the only black guy in town as far as we can tell -- who seems to be Travolta's sole friend in this village. Robert Duvall's part is relatively small but he lends it more energy than he has in any of his other recent films.The FBI, academia, and famous brain surgeons provide the villains. The most famous brain surgeon in the world is Richard Kiley who tries to persuade Travolta to let him operate on his brain while it's still working, though it may not even prolong his life, let alone save it. Travolta could open new doors. Travolta replies to this importuning with You don't get it, do you? You have one hand on technology and one hand on science and you have nothing left for the human spirit. I'm on the side of Richard Kiley. Let them go ahead and peel open my head. The worst (or the best) that could happen is that you expire painlessly while in deep anesthesia. The alternative, which Travolta chooses, is to die at Kyra Sedgewick's farmhouse with its vista of live oaks under blazing blue skies. Yet, death from an astrocytoma is a horrible death. You don't die peacefully. You vomit, act irrationally, lose your wits, wind up immobilized, and suffer excruciating pain. The ending is a fantasy.It struck me as a tale aimed at the heart rather than the head, as Woody Allen once put it. There are pop songs about love and self actualization played over long scenes of smooching and driving around in a beat-up old pick up truck. It was all a bit much.
