[{"date":"17 August 1998","score":"113 out of 158 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Lola rennt' by Tom Twyker is the final step for German film-making towards a professionality and technical perfection that used to be Hollywood's alone.80 mins. of brilliantly shot action will keep the viewer enthralled with the love story of Manni and Lola who have to fight against time 20 mins. to be exact. It is 11.40 a.m. and Manni who is into smuggling diamonds across Eastern European borders has to turn over 100.000 DM at 12 o'clock sharp to Ronni, a 'gangster' par excellence, who would kill anyone for stealing a bottle of beer from him.Unfortunately, Manni forgot the money in the tram and is now more desperate than ever. He calls the one person who has always taken care of him the love of his life, Lola. She asks Manni to wait for her as he is going to rob the 100.000 DM from one the shops in town as he knows that turning up at Ronni's without the money would be his immediate death. Lola starts running immediately thinking of a million different ways how to help the man who is the most important person in her life and she runs and runs.....The quality of cuts and camera shots, innovative techniques at the top of modern filming practically unknown to German viewers up to now will hopefully make 'Lola rennt' a blockbuster in the cinemas as it fully deserves it.Like 'Der Himmel über Berlin' (City of Angels', Ryan, Cage') and 'Bandits' this film is surely to be copied by Hollywood. A symbol of the emerging new strength and innovative qualities of German film-making. You HAVE to see it )) The world-premier screening on 15th August, Cologne, Germany at the chocolate-museum Open-Air-Cinema had a 1,000-strong audience screaming and laughing, breaking into applause on several scenes as the story unfolded. The director and the actors and actresses were present and will have been delighted by the spontaneous reactions of the audience proving this film to be one modern masterpiece of film-making.
