Since I love sword fighting movies\/3 musketeer flicks, I just had to give it a try. Plus, I had seen the previews, and they looked interesting.  Well, let me tell you...from the opening scene to the ending credits, I was hooked with this film!  It grabbed my attention, and was just pure fun!! I don't know why this movie got such a low rating on IMDB.  It may not be a masterpiece, but it's surely a great, fun, entertaining film!First of all, the cast is great.  I mean, have you seen so many good actors in one film?? Byrnes, Depardieu, Malcovich, DiCaprio, and Irons.  All such a WONDERFUL cast, with good acting.  I liked Leo's duel roles too.  At first I thought it would be cheesy, but Leo delivered it well!  He played both roles of Louis (bad king) and Phillipe (good king) so diversely!  I liked how he had you loving one king, and totally despising the other!  Someone also mentioned the way Leo totally changed characters with his eyes.  THe EYES say a lot, and Leo nailed it.  I almost had to ask myself if this was the SAME actor playing Phillipe!The plot was good (eh...might have been predictable, but still...great), the cinematagraphy was awesome, the music was moving, the sword fighting\/action was cool! I absolutely loved Gabriel Byrnes in this movie.  He was so great as D'Artagnan (sp?).  John Malcovich was perfect for his role of Athos too. I really felt his pain.  I have both the VHS (older) and the DVD version (hey, it was on sale for 9 bucks!! lol) of The Man In The Iron Mask, and the DVD version (although not a whole lot of extras) has a nice directors commentary.  It really tells the director's vision for the film and all the behind the scene info.  I STILL can't believe that this movie was his FIRST film!!Very entertaining movie.  I really don't know why people dogged this movie so much.  It was SOOOO much better than that OTHER more RECENT musketeer movie that came out called THE Musketeer.

The first time, I only watched 45 minutes of A Clockwork Orange and thought Kubrick was only trying to shock his audience, much like the terrible movie KIDS did.  After deciding to make it through the entire movie, I was so glad I finished it.  The movie has many issues to ponder and I will try to explain them below.POSSIBLE SPOILERS1)The priest in the film sums up the entire meaning of A Clockwork Orange.  He says that once man loses the ability to choose, he is no longer a man.  Alex is forced to views viddies that show ultra-violence he was once a part of.  In fact, the videos are a complete copy of the crimes he was committing, rape and murder.  Alex is forced to be good due to his violent, nauseated reactions to violence and sexual encounters.  He doesn't want to be.  When the naked woman is presented to him, he says he wants to give her a bit of the old in-and-out but then he gets sick.  He is not cured.  He wishes to be bad because that is his true nature.  2)Kubrick shows violence for the first hour of the film, which is actually the film's most ingenious trait.  What Kubrick is actually doing is giving his audience the treatment Alex went through.  The audience is supposed to be sickened by the shock value in the opening parts because we are supposed to despise it and want to be good.  This is masterful and highly thought-provoking.The most gratifying part of the film for me has to be the end where Alex gives his little smirk.

I was disappointed.  It had great potential, it just fell short.The movie starts off with a very interesting plot.  Very unique.  And the acting is good.  Bill Paxton and both of the young boys pull off their parts.  But i dont like Matthew McConaughey in this part.  He doesn't play a good somber person, he needs to stick to romantic comedies.  Also this film has too many twists and turns.  It should have been delivered simpler. It leaves you sortof confused at the end, asking yourself......what?!I know this was Bill Paxton's first movie as far as directing.  In that aspect the film is good and i don't blame the films flaws on him, more on the writing because the main flaws are in the plot.**Spoilers**The biggest flaw is in the twist at the end where we find out that the main character is Adam.  In most films with big twists there are all kinds of clues that didn't make sense throughout the movie, and when the twist happens everything comes together and makes sense.  This didn't happen here. There are no clues whatsoever so it seems very random and a bit confusing.The twist might have worked if there was almost no narration and if he had never said which brother he was.  The story seemed to be delivered from him, so we would assume it was him.  The twist might have worked that way, but if there was no narration there would be no emotion and we wouldn't know what was going on.  So i don't even think that twist should have been in there. The others in it were good enough.The other thing, if this story is really being told by Adam, did he just make up allll of those feelings Fenton was having.  He just made up the whole thing?  That seemed really annoying.  The whole thing just didn't work.  I know what they were trying to do, make us realize we were pitying the villian all along, but it just didn't work.

Then he ends up being a killer as an adult?!!  i dont care how many days he spent in that basement.  I dont believe that change, i think it was just so we felt justified in destroying him.And it also left me feeling like if you were a little short on the faith side you were a demon.

However, since there are those who victimize children out there, it is healthy to see the theme explored rather than pretend it doesn't exist.As a film, the good news is that the performances are generally excellent. There are some cartoonish characters (such as the boy's father and the friend who thinks it's fine to sleep with his sister), but the leads are uniformly excellent.In particular, Brian Cox as Big John, Paul Dano as Howie and Billy Kat as Gary bring believability and a multitude of dimensions to their roles.Some of the direction tended to be a bit choppy and, some of the minor situations seemed rather implausible.

Like other films from that era of history, it's lost some of its shock with time but unlike true classics, Thomas Crown Affair has lost a lot of its charm. Worth a viewing, but not worth worshipping.Only vague concepts carry over from film to film, really. The same basic plot curve, same basic events, same basic characters, except everything is retold and reinterpreted from a different point of view. And I much prefer John McTiernan's interpretation despite the more glaring plot holes such as 'Why didn't the security tape reveal who set the briefcase in the gallery to begin with?' Theoretically the culprit could've been caught then and there, but then there'd be no movie. The caper's execution is rather spectacular, far more entertaining than the original's, though much less likely to happen. But who cares, really? McTiernan directed this as a film you can't take 100% seriously anyway. This is a fun cat and mouse movie, not a documentary.The premise-an art theft-strikes me as more interesting than the original's robbery; besides, how many films have bank robberies? How many films steal art? It's something different.The characters and their portrayals are colorful and interesting, walking a thin line of camp but never pushing it too far. This movie isn't about 'Everyman' nor is it meant to. It's about a billionaire who gets his kicks out of high stake gambles and wages-how do you do that without a larger than life portrayal? I particularly liked the ending sequence, as goofy, perhaps corny as it is, it's still fun. Especially the music selection, Nina Simone's Sinnerman, a well chosen track. Bill Conti provides the underlying score, which proves quite unique having a slightly bouncy 'piano recital' quality to its first few themes. Very fitting for the museum setting. It's a CD worth purchasing for the sake of variety alone. In the end, Thomas Crown Affair works not because of the film's subjects or its characters . . . it works because of -how- it portrays everything. Its tone is fun and relaxing, and it never tries to take itself too seriously. After all, we are at the movies and not a training seminar . ..

Everything is funny in the movie, and I can really relate to Gord, because i'm like him in many ways.

The only things that can shock me are toilet humor and drug jokes, and there are none in the movie. That's why it's perfect.  Everything is perfect in the movie, for example, Betty.  She's incredibly cute, she always wants to give oral sex, and you can beat her with a bamboo stick and she will enjoy it, now that to me is a perfect woman. I don't really understand how anyone can not like the movie, but judging from the reviews and imdb rating, i'm one of the few who can really appreciate Tom Green for what he is.  I think most people who like tom green like him for the stupid things he does, but I like him because I can totally relate to him and I think that's what sets apart those who like only his show and those like me who like everything he does because they think like him.
