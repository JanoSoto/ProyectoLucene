The plot is tight, the dialogue is fast-paced, and the actors deliver with great precision and aplomb.Macy plays the director of a movie that has had to leave its earlier location for a reason that leaks out of the dialogue without ever being stated. And we watch as history repeats itself with the inevitability of history itself. Macy's character, Walt Price, is a lying, conniving, manipulative, unfeeling jerk that Macy keeps from being unlikeable by showing us that Walt _needs_ to be all those things to get the film in the can.Walt Price and his crew are trying to shoot a film in a small town in Vermont, where the residents are wowed by the attention. Mamet's script is a silent riot, as we see the rubes go from reading the local paper to Variety, all in the background, so if you're not paying attention to the background, you're missing a substantial part of the humor and foreshadowing of what's going to happen. Everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, so lawyers are brought in, cash is brought in, and love is brought in. Rebecca Pidgeon is great as the straight-faced, straight-talking love interest for Hoffman, and Hoffman delivers a great performance as Mamet -- the writer of art who gets the full Hollywood treatment and who must decide between love\/art and seduction\/corruption. As Hoffman's character keeps saying, it's all about purity.This is a very funny movie, and I wouldn't want to be an associate producer. (Oh, and be sure to watch through the credits and read them.

Ignored in life, mocked in death, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a real phenomenon in American cinema history, especially famous for his Z-budget filmmaking. Making a biopic about such a schlocky visionary reputed as the worst director of all-time is just a groovy idea, which only Tim Burton dares to do it.Shot beautifully in moody black & white, the film centers on Wood's most prolific period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond-awful debut Glen or Glenda to his groundbreaking 1959 sci\/fi Plan 9 From Outer Space. Paying a final tribute to this idiosyncratic director, Burton opts to portray Wood and his misfit menagerie in an over-exaggeratedly sympathetic way, not to depict the darker side of his life. The film ends before his slide into porn, misery and alcoholism. The film charts Wood's tragi-comic career his flagrant ineptitude as a writer, producer and director; his efforts to beat the bushes for cash; his indifferent, hyper-enthusiastic and over-optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks; his sheer passion and child-like naiveté; his transvestite tendencies with a particular taste in fluffy Angora sweaters, blond wigs and high heels; and lastly his strange friendship with 70-year old sepulchral Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi.The film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e.g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of Plan 9 From Outer Space) are hysterically funny. But such a film desperately needs a some degree of gravity. The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film. Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood. But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together. His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi. This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.To me, Ed Wood shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money; but rather about your creative spirit, and how much you cling to your principles and how much you love what you do. Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking. Today, despite the fact that his films are used as a benchmark that the most awful films are measured by, that's not the problem at all. The wonderful irony of the film is that it won two Oscars with the name Ed Wood written on it ) ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2012","score":"","review":" Original, sweet-tempered and enjoyable movie, one of my favorites out of Burton's oeuvre.

The film charts Wood's tragi-comic career his flagrant ineptitude as a writer, producer and director; his efforts to beat the bushes for cash; his indifferent, hyper-enthusiastic and over-optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks; his sheer passion and child-like naiveté; his transvestite tendencies with a particular taste in fluffy Angora sweaters, blond wigs and high heels; and lastly his strange friendship with 70-year old sepulchral Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi.The film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e.g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of Plan 9 From Outer Space) are hysterically funny. But such a film desperately needs a some degree of gravity. The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film. Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood. But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together. His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi. This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.To me, Ed Wood shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money; but rather about your creative spirit, and how much you cling to your principles and how much you love what you do. Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking. Today, despite the fact that his films are used as a benchmark that the most awful films are measured by, that's not the problem at all.

Ignored in life, mocked in death, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a real phenomenon in American cinema history, especially famous for his Z-budget filmmaking. Making a biopic about such a schlocky visionary reputed as the worst director of all-time is just a groovy idea, which only Tim Burton dares to do it.Shot beautifully in moody black & white, the film centers on Wood's most prolific period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond-awful debut Glen or Glenda to his groundbreaking 1959 sci\/fi Plan 9 From Outer Space.

Running time 125 minutes Year 1940 Directed by Charlie Chaplin Written by Charlie Chaplin In his time, Chaplin has made some great films. Compared to lacklustre comedy of today it is still a masterpiece, despite still being completely out there. His comedy is not for everyone and at times is very subjective, especially with it being repeated from film to film, however with The Great Dictator we find something completely different, this is a comedy but one with huge themes and a giant message. The film is based around the beginning of the Second World War and pokes fun at the tyrant that is Adolf Hitler, before he had even become his most evil. The film brandishes him for all of his sins before he has even committed them. After doing a little research, some believed that this film could have been the tipping point for Hitler himself! We start off following Chaplin during the First World War, where he accidentally saves a man's life on the eve of its end. This man ends up rising high in the new government where as Chaplin suffers memory loss from his exploits during this war and ends up being hospitalised. When he finally returns to his home in the Ghetto, where he is a barber, he sees that a new Dictator has taken over and his town is being terrorised by Storm Troopers. This new Dictator is Henkel, a portrayal of Hitler himself, also played by Chaplin. He is the leader of Tomania and is deciding whether to issue war or a truce against fellow Dictator Napaloni, leader of Bacteria. If this isn't taking the mick I don't know what is. In the Ghetto the Barber , on several occasions, attacks the Storm Troopers for racially abusing him as a Jew, and upon capture is save by the man he saved years before in the war. The Barber is then deemed untouchable and continues his life whilst wooing the woman next door. However his luck changes when the man he saved is outcast as a traitor and the Storm Troopers cease their chance to get their own back on the Barber, leaving him in a Concentration Camp. The film is hard to believe considering it came out before many of Hitler's war crimes took place, especially with on watching you see how true all this seemed to become. At the time the film was tarnished as unwittingly brandishing the Jews. Little did Chaplin know that in hindsight he was right on the money. On reading this you will think the film is very unlike Chaplin and to be fair it is, but we are still treated to the very same Chaplinesque moments, all which break the tension when it is needed. At one point Henkel shoots a guard dead before walking off and tripping up his own feet. You get his evil brandished with his stupidity. However Henkel is portrayed in a way that you never sympathise with him and in fact always hate him. You laugh at him, not with him and I can only imagine how hard that must have been to do at the time of this film. In hindsight we can happily laugh at the man that attempted to destroy the majority of the planet but back then, on the eve of the beginning, this must have been seen as a step too far. It is deep considering it is Chaplin and upon watching I found myself enjoying it but not for all the typical Chaplin reasons. Yes it made me laugh but it is nowhere near as funny as some of his previous work. On the other hand there is a much deeper plot and narrative and ultimately a real meaningful message. The only thing that keeps this in keeping with previous Chaplin is the horrible continuity problems, but I'm starting to expect that from old films. It's just something though I can't allow my eye to miss. It is a decent film and you will be engaged, however you will find yourself at times thinking that the comedy elements are completely out of place, especially when it is not seen in hindsight by Chaplin himself. Not one of Chaplin's best but I'm sure the film he will be most remembered for. His final speech, spoken out of character by Chaplin himself, is a message to all those out there during the war and does put a lot of their pains into perspective.3 \/ 5TolliCheck out my blog www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Great Dictator Starring Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Jack Oakie, Reginald Gardiner.

What i did like about the movie was the addition of different races and the actors and actresses they had to play the characters.

The acting from the leads was good enough and it was a delight to see veteran horror stay Christopher Lee appearing as the scientist in charge of the lab.

This movie plays out exactly like a James Michener novel from beginning to end. I loved this movie. Rock Hudson was amazing, James Dean was James Dean, amazing in everything that his short career gave. One has to appreciate Dean's performance, in Giant, in the aspect that he goes against all of the usual acting technicalities (as usual). For example, watch the movie and see how many times all the other actors look down in their scene while they are talking or not talking. Observe how many times Dean does it throughout the movie, that's usually a big no no(looking down) for an actor in Film or TV, but Dean kind of always defied all odds as an actor and broke through with his own style where many mimicked his style for years to come such as Steve McQueen all the way to Heath Ledger. James Dean's few performances made a huge impact on the actor and the viewer. Also the scene at the end where Dean's Character is drunk and the viewer can hardly understand what Dean is saying, that is very taboo not to be heard whether drunk or not, in a movie at least. But Dean didn't care, and that's how a drunk talks when they're going in and out of consciousness. Giant is an epic movie, all 3 hours and 21 minutes of it, although it doesn't feel that long, but it needs to be that long. Giant needs to be that long to really appreciate Rock Hudson's performance because the length of the movie is how Hudson's character comes into his own. It's a movie about prejudices, racism, the good, the bad and the ugly of work and relationships between loved ones. Giant kind of let's me relate to how my grandparents got through the lulls of their marriage, but stuck it out and changed and adapted with the times. Giant makes a bold statement about change. We all change in life and everything is out of our control as the Rock Hudson character learns throughout the years, but I like Hudson's character because even though he may not necessarily like the change, he's a fair man, a good man, who in the end, loves his wife, his friends, and his children, and that love, in the end, always supersedes the Hudson character's Ego and Pride, and one has to respect a person like that, as I know my grandparents to be that way and also my parents too. So it is a movie that helps a generation of mine, the Pepsi Generation ;) relate to the Generations of my parents and grandparents. Hudson's character goes through life finding out through the years what it's like to let his pride go and fall on his ass 'mentally', as then he finds out what it feels like to fall on his ass 'physically\/literally' towards the end of the film. Giant is a Monumental film and I recommend it to any movie lover, any Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor lover, any Dennis Hopper lover and last but not least, any James Dean lover.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"18 January 2012","score":"","review":" Even after the passage of just over twenty years, Beauty and the Beast remains one of the best animated films Disney has ever made. I knew this even before attending this rerelease, which, following the tremendous success of The Lion King 3D last fall, has been given the 3D treatment. But there was something about seeing it once again on the big screen that brought it home for me. Perhaps it was looking at the picture in a format larger than a television set for the first time in years. Or perhaps it was hearing the music emanating from a source other than my TV speakers or a set of earphones. Whatever the case, I watched the film as transfixed as I was when I first saw it as an eight-year-old boy in 1991. I then left with the satisfying knowledge that it hasn't aged a day; like Disney perennials such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, it's a film you can grow old with.When I saw The Lion King back in September, I found myself in torn between two very different reactions. On the one hand, I appreciated reliving the story, becoming reacquainted with the characters, and once again experiencing the music and the animation. On the other hand, I was quite disappointed by the 3D conversion, which seemed to me the only reason the film was rereleased at all. When I learned of Beauty and the Beast 3D, I was wary, for I didn't want a marketing ploy to diminish the power of its hand-drawn animation, the kind no computer could come close to achieving. Thankfully, my fears were put to rest. The technicians responsible for the conversion have seen to it that the process was immersive rather than gimmicky. It helped that I saw the film in a theater equipped with digital projectors that allow for bright, clean pictures.Having said that, the 3D is unique, for it has been applied to images that began life as two-dimensional cels. This is obviously different from modern-day computer animated films, where objects are intentionally rendered to exhibit depth, even when projected in 2D. One of Walt Disney's innovative touches on Snow White was the use of the multiplane camera system, in which drawings were layered one on top of the other and then moved separately towards or away from a camera mounted above them. The drawings in front would move faster than the ones in back, ensuring the illusion of depth. The opening shot of Beauty and the Beast, which used the multiplane system, is a slow zoom towards the Beast's castle through tree branches and over a forest; because of the 3D conversion, each layer of drawings takes on the appearance of a theater flat, or a piece of plywood onto which scenery was painted for use live stage productions. This results in an uncanny storybook quality appropriate for the film.In other instances, most notably the musical number Be Our Guest, more of an effort is made to make the characters and objects seem like dimensional beings. The moment in which the character of Lumiere is lifted into the air by a geyser of pink punch is surprisingly effective, as is a rapid tracking shot through a chorus line of living candlesticks as they raise their heads, eventually revealing Lumiere standing on a cake. The ballroom waltz of the title characters during the title song featured some fantastic aerial shots around a chandelier, all of which take on a new kind of grandeur with the 3D process. And there are many shots showcasing either rain or snow; because both represent a flurry of activity &#x96; visual noise, if you will &#x96; they seem the most dimensional of anything else in the film, making them the best post-conversion shots.But why am I making this about the wonders of technology? Beauty and the Beast should be seen first and foremost for the sheer magic of its storytelling. Equal parts exuberant fun, heartfelt drama, and sweeping romance, its plot of a lonely beast who must love and be loved in return transcends the simple archetypes of the traditional fairy tale and becomes a lasting form of family entertainment. The characters are all individually realized so that none of them disappear into the background; this wouldn't have been possible were it not for the vocal talents of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Stiers, and Richard White. The songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were Broadway caliber long before the film actually made the transition to Broadway. For Menken in particular, the film represents some of his best musical work &#x96; second only, perhaps, to what he would accomplish several years later with the tragically underrated The Hunchback of Notre Dame.The opening number, Belle, is surely one of the greatest in the history of musicals, stage or screen; apart from being rousing, melodically memorable, and lyrically clever, it does a fantastic job establishing the character it's named after. It even has a thing or two to say about Gaston before a he's given a song of his own, a hilariously wicked ode to his overinflated ego. Be Our Guest is a showstopping and catchy display of choreography and gravity-defying acrobatics. And then, of course, there's the title song, which earned an Oscar for its touching sentiments on learning to love despite obvious differences. (Human Again, a deleted musical number restored for the film's 2002 IMAX rerelease, has once again been omitted.) But I think the songs are only part of the reason why Beauty and the Beast has endured for all these years and will endure even in 3D; the filmmakers saw to it that the animation, story, and characters would appeal to all members of the family, not just young children.

I then left with the satisfying knowledge that it hasn't aged a day; like Disney perennials such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, it's a film you can grow old with.When I saw The Lion King back in September, I found myself in torn between two very different reactions. On the one hand, I appreciated reliving the story, becoming reacquainted with the characters, and once again experiencing the music and the animation. On the other hand, I was quite disappointed by the 3D conversion, which seemed to me the only reason the film was rereleased at all. When I learned of Beauty and the Beast 3D, I was wary, for I didn't want a marketing ploy to diminish the power of its hand-drawn animation, the kind no computer could come close to achieving. Thankfully, my fears were put to rest. The technicians responsible for the conversion have seen to it that the process was immersive rather than gimmicky. It helped that I saw the film in a theater equipped with digital projectors that allow for bright, clean pictures.Having said that, the 3D is unique, for it has been applied to images that began life as two-dimensional cels. This is obviously different from modern-day computer animated films, where objects are intentionally rendered to exhibit depth, even when projected in 2D. One of Walt Disney's innovative touches on Snow White was the use of the multiplane camera system, in which drawings were layered one on top of the other and then moved separately towards or away from a camera mounted above them. The drawings in front would move faster than the ones in back, ensuring the illusion of depth. The opening shot of Beauty and the Beast, which used the multiplane system, is a slow zoom towards the Beast's castle through tree branches and over a forest; because of the 3D conversion, each layer of drawings takes on the appearance of a theater flat, or a piece of plywood onto which scenery was painted for use live stage productions. This results in an uncanny storybook quality appropriate for the film.In other instances, most notably the musical number Be Our Guest, more of an effort is made to make the characters and objects seem like dimensional beings. The moment in which the character of Lumiere is lifted into the air by a geyser of pink punch is surprisingly effective, as is a rapid tracking shot through a chorus line of living candlesticks as they raise their heads, eventually revealing Lumiere standing on a cake. The ballroom waltz of the title characters during the title song featured some fantastic aerial shots around a chandelier, all of which take on a new kind of grandeur with the 3D process. And there are many shots showcasing either rain or snow; because both represent a flurry of activity &#x96; visual noise, if you will &#x96; they seem the most dimensional of anything else in the film, making them the best post-conversion shots.But why am I making this about the wonders of technology? Beauty and the Beast should be seen first and foremost for the sheer magic of its storytelling. Equal parts exuberant fun, heartfelt drama, and sweeping romance, its plot of a lonely beast who must love and be loved in return transcends the simple archetypes of the traditional fairy tale and becomes a lasting form of family entertainment. The characters are all individually realized so that none of them disappear into the background; this wouldn't have been possible were it not for the vocal talents of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson, Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury, David Ogden Stiers, and Richard White. The songs by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were Broadway caliber long before the film actually made the transition to Broadway. For Menken in particular, the film represents some of his best musical work &#x96; second only, perhaps, to what he would accomplish several years later with the tragically underrated The Hunchback of Notre Dame.The opening number, Belle, is surely one of the greatest in the history of musicals, stage or screen; apart from being rousing, melodically memorable, and lyrically clever, it does a fantastic job establishing the character it's named after. It even has a thing or two to say about Gaston before a he's given a song of his own, a hilariously wicked ode to his overinflated ego. Be Our Guest is a showstopping and catchy display of choreography and gravity-defying acrobatics. And then, of course, there's the title song, which earned an Oscar for its touching sentiments on learning to love despite obvious differences. (Human Again, a deleted musical number restored for the film's 2002 IMAX rerelease, has once again been omitted.) But I think the songs are only part of the reason why Beauty and the Beast has endured for all these years and will endure even in 3D; the filmmakers saw to it that the animation, story, and characters would appeal to all members of the family, not just young children.
