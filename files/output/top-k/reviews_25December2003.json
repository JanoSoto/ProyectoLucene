[{"date":"25 December 2003","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  'Rushmore' is different from most movies. I know you can say that for a lot of movies but with 'Rushmore' you expect one thing and something completely different happens. Early in the movie student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) meets a teacher named Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams). I thought the movie was about to give us a strange romance between them, but the romance here is only from one side and therefore not exactly what I expected.The private school where this happens is called Rushmore. Max never studies and doesn't pass any subjects but is the leader of almost every extra-curricular activity. Too bad for him he is expelled after he has done something the principal was not so happy with. Since Rushmore, and Rosemary Cross for that matter, was his life he is not very happy. Mrs. Cross doesn't love him back but she is his friend. His two other friends are the much younger Dirk (Mason Gamble) and the much older Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Unfortunately for Max we see that his friends Rosemary Cross and Herman Blume fall in love with each other.Again, from here on you think you are able to predict a lot of the story but with 'Rushmore' it simply isn't so. It is one of the great things in this movie. I was also very surprised about the performances. Schwartzman and Williams are very good and Bill Murray does an extraordinary job. In a movie like this he finds the perfect note for his character. May be this movie is not for everyone, the funny moments are not right there on top, but it definitely is a good movie.
