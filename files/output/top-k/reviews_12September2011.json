How does nobody know about this?! It has one of the best cast of characters in a Disney film, one of the best Disney villains ever (voiced by the amazing Vincent Price, no less), and is packed with fun and adventure.Brilliant and eccentric detective Basil of Baker Street is given the case of a lifetime when young Olivia Flavisham comes to his doorstep for help. Her father, a gifted toymaker, has been abducted by Professor Ratigan, a notorious criminal whom Basil has been chasing for years. With the help of the young mouse and the kindly but down-to-earth Dr. Dawson, Basil sets out to rescue Olivia's father and foil Ratigan's scheme.The story seems a bit plain, but the plot isn't what makes TGMD exciting. It is the characters which bring the movie to life and make it worth watching. Being based off Sherlock Holmes himself, Basil is naturally an intelligent badass. He's enthusiastic about his work and little else at the beginning of the film, and doesn't care much for Dawson and Olivia upon first meeting them, but as the film progresses he starts opening up to them, especially Olivia. It's a nice bit of character development which gives the film heart without becoming sentimental. Dr. Dawson's warmer and less dramatic personality provides the perfect foil for Basil, and Olivia is charming and adorable without being cutesy-cutesy or annoying. But the best character has to be Ratigan, one of the great unsung Disney villains. He's funny as hell, gleefully enjoying every bit of evil he engages in and doing so with larger-than-life style; on the other hand, he can be pretty scary too, and if he snaps, boy are you screwed. He's voiced brilliantly by Vincent Price, who you can tell had a lot of fun doing the part.The animation isn't breathtaking, but it's still good. A lot of the character animation is done extremely well, in particular facial expressions. The backgrounds are lovely and dark, perfectly giving the film the atmosphere of foggy Victorian London.Though it's not much of a musical, the few songs in TGMD are good. I especially like Let Me Be Good to You, which is catchy and, when viewed in context to the film, very suggestive and adult. Hilarious. Good characters, good songs, humor, heart, adventure&#x85;it's all there. It's no Pinocchio or Beauty and the Beast, but it's still a wonderful movie. How awful it is that it isn't well-known! It's one of those Disney films you'll still enjoy even when you're older, and if you haven't seen it yet, definitely check it out.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2011","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The Great Mouse Detective is so underrated, it's criminal.

There are whole scenes, lasting just seconds, that are breathtaking not only for the setting (or the sets) but for the way it's composed, a pair of figures in one place, a different scenario (and light) in the background. It's endlessly fascinating and evolving, this play of space and light and figures (actors, yes) moving through it all. It's also so stylized it becomes a force of its own, above the plot, which has its own kind of surreal fragmentation. So the end result is simply being there, somewhere, and having events twirl around you. This is almost enough. It's magical and moving and simply beautiful. The cinematographer was Vittorio Stararo, in one of his first films. He has worked with the director, Bernardo Bertolucci, on a whole bunch of films (Last Tango in Paris might be the most famous for American viewers), and also with other directors for some of their masterpieces Apocalypse Now and Reds are just two.This large, controlling, sometimes self-serving style might not suit everyone, but it does me. And in this case (The Conformist) it's actually the strongest element. The rest of the movie is really a little bit of a mixed bag. That the end result is pretty fabulous is a testament to making some odd pieces fit, or not fit, perfectly.What doesn't become clear for some time is the point of the title, which is the moving, significant point of the movie the main character survives Fascist Italy and then post-War, anti-Fascist Italy, but conforming, which is to say, he doesn't have particular beliefs, but he knows what will get him to survive. And for him, survival is all that matters, even if it means a watered down life. His professor of many years earlier is just the opposite, and is a kind of hero and de-facto enemy to him. This professor has left Italy in order to fight Mussolini, and he has to face death threats as a consequence. It's always interesting when the main character, this blow-with-the-wind Marcello, is not especially admirable or even interesting. He is surrounded by some quirky and inevitably interesting people, for sure, but even the two most important of these, his wife and his lover, are kind of symbolic and slightly unaffected types.

Yes, I know this movie gets hugely appreciative reviews, and I think it's for the ambiance, and for the big anti-Fascist message (which is smart and powerful and I agree with). But as a drama between people trying to find themselves, to love the right people, to accomplish a violent political crime, it remains distant, at least most of the time.Another thing to note even though the titles are in English, this was and is an Italian movie, with dialog in Italian and a little French. You'll find the sound is awkwardly dubbed--and I mean dubbed in the original language, a looseness of lip-synching that just wouldn't make it in Hollywood (and which you see in other earlier Italian films). Because in fact the dialog is often re-recorded later in movies like this (for superior sound, or because there was too much ambient interference), the synching becomes an issue. Ignore it if you can. It bugged me sometimes.Overall, yes, this is a kind of masterpiece--flawed, a little bit at arm's length, but stunning, too, and with an important theme.

It's too bad Spielberg's Jurassic Park sequel came out as early on in the calender year of 1997 as it did, since a similar train of thought needs to be applied to it; the film, a mouthful in itself entitled The Lost World Jurassic Park, wanting to go bigger and better than that of its 1993 blockbuster counterpart with larger clumps of characters; more monsters and a heavy later reliance on off-the-wall content which isn't even set on dystopian islands as much as it comes across as the director patting himself on the back for being able to pay homage to Godzilla.Returning from the first film is Jeff Goldblum's doctor of mathematics Ian Malcolm, a man now riding subways to meet with the entrepreneur of the last film's titular Jurassic Park, John Hammond (Attenborough), at his stately home home rather than travelling with said gentleman on helicopters to touch down on tropical paradises rich with the latest scientific breakthroughs. Times are tough for Malcolm, his whistle blowing on what happened in the first film has people ignominiously confront or stare at him, whilst his funding from certain institutes has been cut due to these ill received tales. The company predominantly behind Hammond's enterprise, InGen, appear to be taking over; their grey suits and blunt tones replacing that of the kindly elderly man act Hammond fronts for the organisation, as we observe him worn and somewhat frail.The reason for Malcolm's summoning lies with the fact a second site of dinosaurs and such is becoming a nuisance, a second site verbally established as this locale less secure than that of the first film's and much more dangerous; a place Hammond desires Malcolm to venture toward so as to lay claim to it prior to InGen's newfound fondness to exploit.

Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by Weird Al Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films laughs.Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities.When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, No Dick can stop me, which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early.The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award.There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films.The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to GoldenEye (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from Cliffhanger (1993), Pulp Fiction (1994), Home Alone (1990), Apollo 13 (1995), Speed (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern.Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the Speed spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in Pulp Fiction, and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it. I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make.

It's a bit difficult to compare the two movies, since the original definitely wasn't aiming for gore or spectacular kills. The first CotC tried to build a bit of mystery and played it a little more creepier. Sure, by today's standards that might very well translate to 'a little more goofier'. But truthfully, upon re-watching CotC II, I couldn't help noticing it also has its fair share of (unintended) goofy moments.

And where did that Indian mumbo-jumbo explanation all of the sudden come from? Christie Clark was an enormously cute teen-babe at the time; just thought I'd mention that.After this first sequel, 4 others followed each other rapidly throughout the '90s, so CotC II is much more responsible for starting up the whole franchise than the original was. And all sequels are pretty much on par with what all other sequels from other franchises were being cranked out those days (the '90s installments of the Amytiville series, for example). Hardly great horror movies, but they always managed to entertain me, trying to come up with some original & amusing kills time after time or desperately hoping to bring a new twist to tired concepts.Noteworthy is that Bob Keen & Gary J.

","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"12 September 2011","score":"","review":" Much as we tend to think of cinema as being propelled by ground-breaking and innovative new movies, in truth it's a little more complicated, with progress being made in lots of little nudges as trends and movements come and go. What is true is that some pictures seem to encapsulate an upcoming wave so well that they appear revolutionary. Breakfast at Tiffany's is a movie that one cannot imagine having been made any earlier than it was, that despite its straightforward style and romantic plot seems far more modern than any of those edgy jazz movies from the late 1950s. In retrospect it seems to herald the beginning of 1960s cinema more than any of its contemporaries.Director Blake Edwards was recently commemorated as cinema's Mr Cool, and it's for movies like this he got that distinction, even if it's not exactly representative of his whole career. He is not an exceptional dramatic director, but he handles things with simplicity and confidence, giving us some considered long takes and pretty shot compositions, such as the one of Audrey Hepburn lying on the bed as pillow down falls like snow around her. But probably the most unique thing about Edwards was his bringing slapstick back to the Hollywood movie. For Breakfast at Tiffany's his physical comedy stylings are in their infancy, but there are still a few chuckles to be had, mostly in the party scene that occurs about a third of the way through and was apparently thought up by Edwards during production. The trouble is that it is not really the right sort of comedy for this movie. Standing alone as it does, turning extras into characters for a few minutes, it unbalances the first half somewhat. Edwards would make better slapstick movies when he found characters and stories that suited the style.Oddly enough though, the thing that makes Audrey Hepburn's performance really stand out is her ability to do comedy &#x96; not Edwards's slapstick, but a gentler, smoother humour that weaves its way through the picture, material that may come from Truman Capote's novella, George Axelrod's screenplay or may again be on-the-set inventions by cast or crew. It's the way she drinks milk from a champagne glass or does her makeup in a mirror on the inside of a letterbox, with an air of innocence and total normality. It's the look of determination in her eyes as she bears down on the millionaire Rusty Trawler. It is Hepburn, through her subtly comedic performance, who brings Holly Golightly's chaotic, ditzy, adventurous world to life, and makes it a place that looks like fun to live in. It is, in other words, Hepburn who really makes this picture work.But there are lots of other wonderful little titbits that go into the mix. The seemingly trivial moment where the staff member at Tiffany's says it's nice that they still have prizes in Crackerjack boxes is, I feel, one of the most significant in the whole movie, because it provides a very human link between the upmarket jewellery store and the earthy sentimentality of the characters. The Henry Mancini score, all seemingly built around the song Moon River, is appropriately sad and beautiful. Yes, overall there are some problems with the movie's structure and pacing, but the thing about Breakfast at Tiffany's is that the sum of its parts is greater than the whole.

To be frank, that first hour is less than riveting. We find ourselves following the romance and the early part of the marriage of the wealthy and lonely widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) to his new young bride (Joan Fontaine.) There really isn't much meat to this part of the story. It's a bit of a rich meets poor love story, as the young bride finds herself in a romance with this man who was quite above her socially, and it's even got a bit of humour to it, as we watch the young woman's employer Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) try to ingratiate herself with Maxim. It's a pleasant enough (although not exactly engrossing) love story for a while, and after their return to Maxim's Manderlay estate it still seems to be little more than the challenge of the new Mrs. de Winter (whom I don't remember being named) to overcome the reluctance of the servants - and especially Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) - to accept her, since they appear to have been fiercely devoted to the late Mrs. de Winter (whose name was Rebecca.) Yes, Mrs. Danvers is an unusual, and therefore suspicious, character who has more than a bit of mystery about her, but still this really doesn't seem to be going anywhere very fast.Once we're through that first hour, though, plot twists start to emerge. Maxim starts to pull away from his bride - is he also having trouble accepting her as the new Mrs. de Winter at the estate? Are the differences in the marriage just too much to overcome? Then Rebecca's body is unexpectedly found and questions begin to emerge about how she died. At this point, director Alfred Hitchcock manages to turn what had been a rather empty story into a pretty good suspense\/thriller.

It simply falls flat, and it is all due to a script that is chock full of gaping errors and head scratching moments.I have to give away some spoilers to prove my point, so stop here if you wish to be surprised.Here are some of the examples about inconsistencies, and other head scratching problems.At one point, the three leads decide to venture outside to witness the insanity caused by the blackout. But they leave the baby at home, alone, unattended, while it's sick with a fever, and there is no electricity.I can understand long lines at places like a gas station or a grocery store or hardware store, but Kyle goes to a pharmacy and a gun shop where there are lines practically out the door. OK, maybe the gun shop I'll accept, but a pharmacy? All of a sudden people need to go to the pharmacy? Why now? And then Kyle gets into these totally unnecessary heated arguments with the pharmacist and the gun shop owner. Why?? If he would just talk to them in a calm, rational manner, he would have been able to get what he needed like the medicine from the pharmacist. It just made no sense. It's like, Kyle, calm down, dude! After Rupert is shot, and they end up losing their car and having to use Michael Rooker's car instead, they try desperately waving cars down on the road to help them, but to no avail. Why didn't they just place Rooker's car in the middle of the road to block traffic? This would cause all oncoming drivers to stop, then that way Kyle could have asked them for a ride to a hospital. But nooooo, what does Kyle do instead? He runs all the way to that lone farmhouse that he ends up breaking into---and this brings up even more questions Why did Kyle run all the way to the farmhouse for help? He passes a NUCLEAR FACILITY. Don't you think that the NUCLEAR FACILITY would have MANY people working inside? People who could have helped him get to a hospital? But, noooooo, he runs to the farmhouse.When he gets to the farmhouse, he gets into yet another heated argument with the owner for no reason whatsoever. Had he just remained calm, I am sure the owner would help him. But, nooooo, they fight which causes Kyle to return later with the rifle that he gave to his wife to keep with her for protection. So, let's think about this. It means that Kyle ran from Rooker's car passing the NUCLEAR FACILITY to get to the farmhouse where he gets into a verbal fight with the owner, then ran back from the farmhouse passing the NUCLEAR FACILITY again to get to the car to get the rifle, then he runs from the car passing the NUCLEAR FACILITY yet again in order to get to the farmhouse where he gets into a gun fight with the owner after he unnecessarily breaks into it. Are you confused, too? So am I! At the beginning of the movie, there is a sequence where a woman obliviously cuts into a line at a concession stand to get popcorn. Except for one person, no one else in this looooong line complains that this woman just cut right into them. Not even the concessionaire tells her to get to the back of the line. Wow. Such a kind, forgiving group of people.At a time where cash is of the utmost importance, our leads happen to come across an ice cream truck (!!!???!!!) on the side of the road, and decide to blow some of their ever-so important cash---on ICE CREAM??? And why is this truck there to begin with, and how is the vendor keeping the treats frozen when there is no electricity? A man breaks into Kyle and Elisabeth's house. After they chase the criminal into the street, their neighbor ends up shooting and killing the guy. For the rest of the film, Kyle resents the fact that his neighbor did this. Why? The criminal was even waving a switchblade in the middle of the street when he was shot, but for some reason I guess Kyle felt that his neighbor's action was too extreme. If this were me, I'd be kissing and bowing down to my neighbor thanking him for killing the guy!!! I mean, he just broke into my house carrying a weapon which I'm sure he would have used on me, my wife and my child. Yet Kyle, I guess, ends up resenting his neighbor for doing this good deed. Whatever.I know it's 1996, but doesn't one single person in this entire HUGE city own a cell phone?!?!? I could go on, but I'm sure you will find the same problems with this script that I did. The more I think about it, I realize that people in this movie just don't act rationally. I know that during a blackout people will do the strangest of things, but it's just that there are so many inconsistencies and scenes that make no sense whatsoever.

But they leave the baby at home, alone, unattended, while it's sick with a fever, and there is no electricity.I can understand long lines at places like a gas station or a grocery store or hardware store, but Kyle goes to a pharmacy and a gun shop where there are lines practically out the door. OK, maybe the gun shop I'll accept, but a pharmacy? All of a sudden people need to go to the pharmacy? Why now? And then Kyle gets into these totally unnecessary heated arguments with the pharmacist and the gun shop owner. Why?? If he would just talk to them in a calm, rational manner, he would have been able to get what he needed like the medicine from the pharmacist. It just made no sense. It's like, Kyle, calm down, dude! After Rupert is shot, and they end up losing their car and having to use Michael Rooker's car instead, they try desperately waving cars down on the road to help them, but to no avail. Why didn't they just place Rooker's car in the middle of the road to block traffic? This would cause all oncoming drivers to stop, then that way Kyle could have asked them for a ride to a hospital. But nooooo, what does Kyle do instead? He runs all the way to that lone farmhouse that he ends up breaking into---and this brings up even more questions Why did Kyle run all the way to the farmhouse for help? He passes a NUCLEAR FACILITY. Don't you think that the NUCLEAR FACILITY would have MANY people working inside? People who could have helped him get to a hospital? But, noooooo, he runs to the farmhouse.When he gets to the farmhouse, he gets into yet another heated argument with the owner for no reason whatsoever. Had he just remained calm, I am sure the owner would help him. But, nooooo, they fight which causes Kyle to return later with the rifle that he gave to his wife to keep with her for protection. So, let's think about this. It means that Kyle ran from Rooker's car passing the NUCLEAR FACILITY to get to the farmhouse where he gets into a verbal fight with the owner, then ran back from the farmhouse passing the NUCLEAR FACILITY again to get to the car to get the rifle, then he runs from the car passing the NUCLEAR FACILITY yet again in order to get to the farmhouse where he gets into a gun fight with the owner after he unnecessarily breaks into it. Are you confused, too? So am I! At the beginning of the movie, there is a sequence where a woman obliviously cuts into a line at a concession stand to get popcorn. Except for one person, no one else in this looooong line complains that this woman just cut right into them. Not even the concessionaire tells her to get to the back of the line. Wow. Such a kind, forgiving group of people.At a time where cash is of the utmost importance, our leads happen to come across an ice cream truck (!!!???!!!) on the side of the road, and decide to blow some of their ever-so important cash---on ICE CREAM??? And why is this truck there to begin with, and how is the vendor keeping the treats frozen when there is no electricity? A man breaks into Kyle and Elisabeth's house. After they chase the criminal into the street, their neighbor ends up shooting and killing the guy. For the rest of the film, Kyle resents the fact that his neighbor did this. Why? The criminal was even waving a switchblade in the middle of the street when he was shot, but for some reason I guess Kyle felt that his neighbor's action was too extreme. If this were me, I'd be kissing and bowing down to my neighbor thanking him for killing the guy!!! I mean, he just broke into my house carrying a weapon which I'm sure he would have used on me, my wife and my child. Yet Kyle, I guess, ends up resenting his neighbor for doing this good deed. Whatever.I know it's 1996, but doesn't one single person in this entire HUGE city own a cell phone?!?!? I could go on, but I'm sure you will find the same problems with this script that I did.

Choosing to go on a two week vacation to the Wild West where they will drive cattle from New Mexico to Colorado, the three men and an assortment of other vacationers meet Curly (Palance) who will teach them to become Cowboys. But the journey will not just see them learn the art of a cattle drive, it will be also be life affirming for a number of reasons.The theme of a voyage of self discovery is hardly new to cinema, but immense credit goes to Underwood and his team for creating a funny, fresh and heart warming entry into the collection. Planting this out of place group into a Western setting, beautifully realised by Semler's photography (actual New Mexico & Colorado locations), allows for much comedy and detailed character driven drama. The nods to classic Western films and TV shows is evident, but it's the about turn of watching normal tourist types attempt to emulate the likes of John Wayne et al that keeps the film from stagnating. The cliché's from some of those Westerns, the kind that these city folk would know only via the silver screen, come thick and fast, but with a great script to work from, the on form cast provide a true family winner of a picture.The complaints are small when judging the film as a whole, but only having one woman character in the group is a disappointment, for even though Slater is perky and crucial to the group dynamic, it still feels like there's a missed opportunity by the makers to broaden the narrative with at least another female in the mix. But with the central theme being that of male mid-life crisis, it's not hard to understand why the focus is fixed firmly on the principal male characters.

Tron it is not. But it's not on par with plan 9 from outer space either.The actors deliver a variable performance, nothing really stands out, or draws away. The actor playing Jobe is rather creepy, and genuinely gives off that off his nut, power hungry personification up until the end.All in all, this movie was a fairly straight forward run, more about the special effects then the plot, and simply didn't hold up well to the tests of time. The only bit that confused me in the least, was the Pyramid or Egypt analogy.

Well, growing up on horror flicks like I did, I can honestly say this HAS A plot, its just everyone's looking for some schlocky sci-fi plot and missing the real one.In a nutshell the plot is pretty simplistic, Jobe is a cripple, def and Dumb, who's brain has been hardwired to every computer in the world, after spending a life time crippled, and helpless he now has COMPLETE control, and absolute power, or near it.

Simon brings together five famous fictional detectives, slightly re-named no doubt for copyright reasons, with sidekicks in tow, to solve a murder at midnight for a prize of one million dollars to whomsoever solves the crime.It sounds funnier than it actually is and though well cast and reasonably enthusiastically acted, it stutters rather than races along, failing as it goes to deliver a really big belly laugh. Of the players, Sellers is mildly amusing as Charlie Wong (read Chan), with his perennial problem of pronoun pronunciation (see what I did there?,) Niven and Smith make a suitably aristocratic Thin Man and wife, but the actors playing Marples and Poirot barely register and oddly old Columbo Peter Falk seems wrongly cast as Sam Diamond (read Spade), but isn't as bad as Truman Capote, who can barely act at all. Eileen Brennan, as she often did, steals what little show there is as Falk's long-suffering, lovelorn secretary.The sets and costumes are fine, recreating the requisite mood and atmosphere, but the film refuses to take off and would have benefited from an infusion of some really good jokes to help it stand up. This genre definitely deserves a hilarious comedic spoof but this isn't it.

To be fair, the story does stretch credulity to breaking point on many occasions, not just the unlikely romance between crusty old Bogie and prim and proper Kate, but their whole adventure down the river surviving in one piece culminating in the highly improbable destruction of a German warship...and they survive that too.Of course with all this to swallow, for the movie to work you have to engage with the lead characters in what is basically a two-hander for much of the time and who better to engage with than Bogart and Hepburn. Both are in great form in what must have been very physically exacting roles and even if I didn't fully swallow their romance, I decided early in to go with the flow, much like the old African Queen herself.John Huston keeps a sure hand on the tiller, moving the story from episode to episode with little time for reflection until the big finale, which is just about the right approach. Of course it helps that he has the great Jack Cardiff behind the camera who only a few years was filming Scott of The Antarctic in a completely different climate to the steamy jungle here.All told, holes in the plot apart, the film is great fun to watch and with such a heavyweight team behind and in front of the camera, it really couldn't fail.
