Not that this is a glamorous movie; for all the famous scenery, this is a very ugly Newscastle, with most of the action taking place in boarding houses and slums, building sites and toilets (with as many as three key scenes featuring the latter!). The final scene of all takes place beneath a cable car designed to dump coal spoil into the sea; the world depicted seems a lifetime away from our own. But how does the film hold up after nearly 40 years? The answer is surprisingly well. Some of the dialogue is wooden, and the action sequences flat (at least by modern standards), but this only re-enforces the film's refusal to indulge its protagonists with any sheen of false attractiveness; and Caine does a lot of good acting with his face. Director Hodges seems actively involved in every scene, with persistently interesting composition of shots; and at heart, it's a straightforward (though never gratuitously crowd-pleasing) thriller that as it progresses, fosters an increasing sense of disassociation between the feelings of the audience and the actions of its hero. Though it may now be feted as a quintessential lads movie, it's actually far more intelligent than that; and well worth watching, even after four decades.

But of course, everyone could've seen this coming, because that's how sequels tend to be like; very, very pale in comparison to the original.This time we have the Predator not in the jungles of Central America, but now in the streets of Los Angeles that has become over-run with a gang war between the Jamaicans and the Columbians. Putting the Predator in the big city wasn't a terrible idea, because where else could you put him besides the jungle? But the thing is, it worked a whole lot better when he was in the jungle, because you could feel the deadly silence and the claustrophobic feel. But in a metropolis like LA, you're just gonna find yourself being distracted, and you can't focus enough on the Predator to be intimidated by it. And also, the film spends over 20 minutes trying to hide the Predator behind its camouflage, question is, why? We've already seen the Predator before and we already know what it looks like, so the movie is basically wasting time trying to keep us guessing.But what really killed this movie for me was Danny Glover. And Predator 2 did nothing for him except prove one fact; Glover can't play the bad@$$\/maverick cop. Why? Because that's just not him, he's better off being the good cop who plays by the rules in the Lethal Weapon series. He somewhat acts very awkward when he tries to be the tough guy, but that's just ruined by his stilted mannerisms and his good boy face. An the bottom line is, he's just not very convincing. And what makes it even worse, is that his character Mike Harrigan is totally shallow and not a lot is explained about him. For instance, who is Mike Harrigan? What are his motives for him being a maverick? Did he used to have a family? What were his past experiences like? Movie doesn't say. In the original Predator, we knew who Dutch Schaeffer was, we knew he was an ex-combatant who got involved in too many battles and he's seen a lot of death happen. And that's when he decided to tone himself down and become a rescuer and not an assassin.And also the supporting cast is way outta the league of the one in the first movie. The special forces team members were their own individual characters and we basically wanted to see a spin-off prequel for each of those characters. But in Predator 2, all we get is Bill Paxton being bought in to do what he does best; comic relief. But the jokes that tells are so out-of-place and awkward, and in a few small parts, you can tell that Paxton is just embarrassed to be there in front of the camera and spewing out those crappy lines.Gary Busey's performance is nothing special, and he basically just keeps the same expression throughout the whole way. And the idea of an NSA agent trying to capture an alien isn't even realistic.But one thing I liked about this one is that it revealed new facts about the Predator itself. It reveals that it follows a code and a law and the killings that it commits is just an act of sport. And it only kills those who are armed and it doesn't strike at a pregnant woman so it won't take away any innocent lives.But the action just doesn't interest you and the suspense is pretty much abysmal. Just watch this if you want to learn more about the alien and if you are a real die-hard fan of the first movie....even though you might be disappointed.

Brent has dark, and long lashes, low and heavy eyebrows (the shots of the killer did not), and no old-man wrinkles around his eyes. So that aspect threw me off right away since the shots we saw were of an older man and one with very short, if any, lashes. The eyes were also more along the line of the constable, and also someone who was thin, from what little we saw of any facial features. I was thinking maybe the older doctor, but even a cripple could knock that old geezer out of the way. The acting was okay, but I have seen much better from the heavy-hitters in this flick. McGuire was McGuire. Nothing that special, but one could tell she put her heart and soul into the part. Lanchester was a total waste. Barrymore, always good, was the best part of this movie, other than how she kept repeating how she was such a good shot, so we all knew how the murderer would meet his end. And once Blance was killed we knew it was. Process of elimination. I was expecting better, and if in the beginning, and any shots of The Eye, I would have liked this movie better. It was slow, but a lot of thrillers from that time period were.

I just do not think the Ernest character should be center stage for a movie. The short lived television show was the only thing this character needed as it featured other characters and such to draw some of the focus away from Ernest himself. Lets face it, the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment Vern, but more funny to see Vern get back at Ernest for bothering him in the first place. The movie here would feature a couple of the characters from the television show as cooks and they provide some comedy and Ernest has his moments. However, most of the movie is rather groan inducing and to top it off it gets overly sentimental at times as well.

It's got a tale of a future America, run by a power-hungry but seemingly docile dictator named Cocteau (like the poet\/filmmaker?), and many of the details that go with one of these 1984 rip-offs, and it's also got Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes duking it out on and off throughout the running time. This could have been tricky, but somehow it works better than it should. I wouldn't watch it right away again- it's something that you'll maybe catch on video once, maybe in part again if you really feel like it late at night on a cable channel- but for its running time it's enjoyable as a half red-meat-headed action movie and as self-knowing parody\/satire.It's about a cop and a big-time criminal who are already facing off in 1996 (yes, apparently it's already turning into the future, um, three years into the future taking this as set in 1993), and then after a big blunder where Stallone's cop is unable to save a load of hostages that Snipes offs, the two of them are cryogenically frozen (Stallone for letting those people die, Snipes for being a, uh, big-time gangster who is about as evil as possible within his means) and brought back to life decades later. How this happens is already amusing- and will not be too much of a shock to fans of Austin Powers- but what makes Demolition Man tick, for the right and occasionally dumb reasons, is how much it knows that it's a sci-fi satire starring two big-name stars.It's not even so much about the plot of this cop being warmed up and set loose to track down Snipes after his failed parole hearing where he busts out.

All they need to do is find a guy named Eddie Shoebridge. Unfortunately, what they don't know is Eddie happens to be a ruthless diamond thief who doesn't want to be found.Many critics are disparaging of Hitchcock's final film, dismissing it as lightweight, but I'm rather fond of it. What they all miss is that it was always intended to be a whimsical, fun, kooky mystery of the kind he liked to make (The Lady Vanishes, The Trouble With Harry), not some heavy doom-laden drama. Scenes like the amusingly ridiculous high-speed dash down the mountain, where Blanche does everything possible to make things worse, are a gleeful Hitchcock chuckling to himself. While there is a clever cross-plotted intrigue, he keeps weaving in humour, from Blanche's occult histrionics, to our heroes' crass but endearing lovers' spats, to the central joke that Arthur\/Eddie will be a hundred times richer if he comes out of hiding. The four leads are all good, with a pipe-smoking Dern especially getting the tone right (trivia - he had a bit part years earlier in Hitch's Marnie) and the supporting cast has several fine twitchy performers like Lauter and Helmond. I also like the continual contrast between the two couples; Blanche and George have got no class, bicker all the time, eat hamburgers in her tiny kitchen and are more than a little small-minded. Arthur and Fran on the other hand are distinctly upmarket and already want for nothing, but are slimy, calculating, vain and vicious. It's clear where our sympathies should lie and for all their faults, Blanche and George are fun to watch. With an agreeably overenthusiastic score by John Williams and great jazzy costumes by Edith Head, this is a very pleasant way to spend two hours and a fine coda for the career of perhaps the most prolific and influential filmmaker of all time.

Unfortunately, script writer's imagination could not transport the effects of this half century, on the contrary, technology, clothing and behavior mention more a regression than improvement.First laugh (in a bad sense) was, when Ripley was accused for destroying her worthy freighter Nostromo. Of course was the Nostromo worthy like a supertanker, but isn't a ship of this size and the cargo insured ? They had 57 years to get the insurance sum, so what's up with this future ?Later it comes out that the contact to the colony on the Alien egg planet is lost. Surely they had no opportunity to report what happened. A colony around an expensive atmospheric modifier doesn't give any reports about what's happening or any dangerous incidents.Someone in the movie says that it lasts decades to transform a planets atmosphere. Meanwhile the colonists, which are obviously researching the surface, didn't find any trace from the huge stranded spaceship, which sent the distress call that led the Nostromo to her final destruction in the first movie. OK, colonists are dumb or simply blind.Also dumb are the marines. Confrontated with Ripley who is the last survivor of a deadly alien encounter, they are not willing to hear anything what she says. I as their officer would have made them shut up immediately, because every information could be important for surviving. If soldiers of the future are such idiots as shown here, there would be no need for powerful aliens to destroy humanity.I can't imagine that any officer wouldn't send artificial drones ahead to research the situation. I can't imagine, too, that anyone would send such a small and dumb team to investigate the possible alien-caused death of 70 families. The mission in the later AVP movie is much better prepared with scientists from all over the world. OK, here we have Bishop, but he doesn't seem to be very helpful, and he has no rights to make decisions. A few more Bishop's, especially for fighting purposes, would have made the mission more serious.The greatest disappointment in Aliens is the disappearance of the alien's being nearly indelible. When the alien in the first movie is not even destroyed by the escape pod's jet engines (it's adapting to the heat, i suppose), it is here like destroying cockroaches. You can squish them with your car, you can shoot them, or simple burn with a standard flamethrower. A bunch of well-armed soldiers with a little bit more brain than the people shown in this movie would be able to eliminate a complete alien population. For what purpose would the military use such a weak race defies me. Sure, you can infest a planet of your enemies, you don't have to care about them any more. But then your own world would be also in danger because of the revenge of the survivors. And the infested world is useless. However, I know, military is always interested in new and dangerous toys.The mystery of the aliens and the other race - the big stoned guy - from the first movie is completely gone. It is simply a bug slashing feature film. When they find out that the colonists have already caught two living facehuggers, Burke's mission would be done. Instead, they are going ahead for certain death. There are many errors in the script. One is, how did Burke mange to put the facehugger to Ripley's sleeping place. Did he carry the containment tank, or did he carry the alien under his arm ? Then, there is the first confrontation between the Queen and Ripley. Ripley fills the eggs with loads of ammo and explosives, Mother's bearing channel is slashed, and there is no acid burning Ripley and Newt. And in the final fight, the ladder where Ripley is hanging is always within reach for the queen's second hand. Instead, she is angrily swinging around with her free arm. And I thought (almost), come on, big lady, take the ladder, take it, please, and then eat Ripley for killing your babies. Poor mother, so big, so dumb.The positive side is, that - blinding out the mediocre script, visuals, dialogs and actors - the movie is actually thrilling. It's more thrilling than most of the movie's of it's time, and the idea to fight the queen with the cargo loading exoskeleton is really funny.

And while I was in Blockbuster, I saw Run Silent, Run Deep on the shelf and I remembered that movie being mentioned in Crimson Tide during the whole submarine movie trivia sequence on the bus. And the question that was asked was who the submarine commander in this movie was. And the guy answered That guy with the ears and the mustache, Cary Grant. For those of you don't know what the answer was, it was really Clark Gable, and those massive ears and the thin 'stache were his trademarks throughout his career.And once I picked up the DVD case, I showed it to my mother and she immediately saw the two actors on the front (Gable and Burt Lancaster) and told me how famous those two were. But the truth is, I didn't even know who those two guys were, obviously because of my young age at 17. But after I decided to rent it since it couldn't do any harm, my mother told me about the kind of acting legends that Gable and Lancaster were on the ride back home. But of course, it was a bunch of romance flicks that she told me about (Gone with the Wind, Elmer Gantry etc.), but I knew that if Gable and Lancaster were practically legends, and that this was a submarine film, I knew I might've started loving this. And strangely enough, I did. And I didn't even care for the fact that it was black and white, and the fact that it's 51 years old.When it came to movies, I realized for the first time that my mother was right about Gable and Lancaster. Those two had real acting skill and were 2 of the best I've ever seen. But now in Hollywood we get too many male\/female models who act and they have no talent. But I get to see what it was like in the old days when Hollywood cared about talent over money, fame and hotness.Clark Gable is the submarine commander named P.J Rich Richardson. Rich is haunted by his memories of a Japanese battleship that destroyed his sub and his crew. For over a year, he dwells on that memory and wants vengeance more than anything. And then when a younger guy named James Bledsoe (Lancaster) heads a new sub that would be heading out into the Pacific to combat the Japanese, Rich abruptly takes command after convincing his superiors. And of course, Bledsoe isn't too happy about it but keeps his cool. And during the mission, Rich disobeys orders just to get the sub into the restricted areas which pushes the crew to planning on a mutiny, and causes tensions to rise between the two commanding officers (and I guess this is how Crimson Tide got that idea&#x85;&#x85;).The acting is excellent, thanks to Gable and Lancaster, we can feel the tension going on between these two. Oscar-winning acting in the 1950's was no different than it is today, and Gable and Lancaster could exhibit powerful human emotion especially when the 2 men clash over the safety and lives of the crew. And you're gonna find yourself siding with the both of them; you might side with Rich because of his quest for revenge even though he has to be doing the unethical to achieve his goal and Bledsoe just cares about the lives of the crew and even risked the sub being spotted when he ordered them to rise up to prevent a crew member from drowning. But by the end, the 2 men basically become each other when Rich realizes that revenge might not be worth it and when Bledsoe decides to go after the Japanese destroyer even when they're on their way home. Excellent character development to go along with the great story.The action was, for its time, very well done. To be honest I expected much worse from the special effects, but you can still see what's going on with all the torpedoes and the subs underwater. And especially the explosions of the ships, while they were black and white, they still captured the grim reality of warfare on the ocean.Also the thrills will make your heart pound like it did to mine and if the thrills were any more thrilling, I would've fainted. The scene at the end when the two subs face-off is among the best underwater battles I've seen in my life. The suspenseful part came when the fighter planes were dropping the bombs onto the sub underwater, and when one of the bombs hits the top of the sub and rolls over to explode and barely misses is when I nearly bit my fingernails off. And this was all perfectly edited and directed by the genius Robert Wise.And another thing, that pin-up girl that the crew slaps on its back-side before battle is a total icon to me and it's hilarious. I wish that I had a poster like that at home, haha, but that's just the boy in me talking. And I think that was even referenced in Die Hard when John McClane pats a similar poster of a girl on the wall, and given Die Hard's reputation, that has clearly gotta be saying a lot about RSRD. And I'm gonna remember that part forever because it displays the crew's humanity as men.I'll admit that I said before that Crimson Tide was my favorite submarine movie of all time, but now I'm on the fence, because Crimson Tide took the idea of two submarine superiors clashing, from RSRD. And I'm not sure when I'm gonna decide. But anyway, this is a classic in its own right with two legendary actors and a great story about vengeance set in World War II.

Additionally, it might have been easier to follow but for the annoyingly consistent voice-over work which features the constant use of words and terms, spoken in hushed and annoying whispered tones, that only those invariably well informed with Frank Herbert's 'Dune' will even begin to understand. What the film ends up being is a cocktail of science-fiction, horror, revenge and self-discovery played out amidst a sea of stars, planets and gross-out visuals that force me to label Dune one of the films with some of the most misguided material I've ever seen. A case of fluffy but nonsense voice-overs one minute, harmless space travel the next and then a disgusting scene about 'heart plugs'. To think, we go through all this before having the film boil down to a drab knife fight between good and evil.Yes, Dune's a mess but it's one that puts us through a blender of varied emotions; even if I'm not sure I wanted to experience the majority of them. The film is, predominantly, a story about one man being established as someone rather important before a tragedy befalls him and he is whisked away to another lifestyle, having to re-establish as an individual, both to himself and those new around him, in the process. Eventually, that character we follow will become the leader of a small band of people he'll lead to supposed victory; he is the holy leader ancient texts predicted and a glorious warrior at times of need. To some, this'll sound quite daft but to others it works very effectively as the classic escapist fantasy focusing on a lowly, but capable of extraordinary things, ranked in terms of word-of-mouth male being whisked out of his 'normal' life and plunged into a mission of great importance. Two examples of varying quality produced since Dune might be 1994's Stargate and 2006's Children of Men, both of which feature relatively hapless and unsuccessful males of varying degrees burdened with missions linked to saving an entire population under an umbrella of a world thats float in and out of both science-fiction and horror.It's a shame Dune wasn't as good as it could've been. You can most definitely see why some may like it; its appeal of a broad and escapist world in which stars, planets, adventure and different sorts of species exist is one that was booming at the time of Dune's release given the success of Star Wars plus-sequels. But Dune feels laboured compared to those films and it feels inconsistent in its tone enough to turn off its audience. The lead of the film is Paul Atreides (MacLachlan), a young man and son to a very important Duke named Leto Atreides (Prochnow), residing on the planet of Caladan. Very early on, and in clear cut contribution to Dune's wavered feel, Paul is put through a series of tests to do with pain, commitment and some sort of reaction to possible imminent death. Some of the scenes, particularly when he must place his hands in a mysterious box and take whatever's in there, are quite torturous in their execution. For all his supposed importance in the hierarchy, they certainly make life hard for him.But it's a test, and following this, a plot involving several clans from neighbouring planets arises to do with destroying the Atreides family from which the idea to kill Paul is born. All this and the increasing tension between everyone linked to the planet of Arakis, a lonely desert planet on which an element known as 'The Spice' is found; a vital ingredient for life and space travel &#x96; without it, most things are useless. The film, in a sense, reminded me of Ridley Scott's 2000 effort 'Gladiator', if only in structure. The idea that a relatively important individual must begin again after a family bereavement, gain the trust of a group of people and lead them to glorious victory while vanquishing his own enemies.But there is no battle weary Russell Crowe having his family killed before becoming a slave, a gladiator and then an avenger happening here, although that it what Dune essentially is but for its more bizarre inclusions. With this, we get a lot of fancy images and a bizarre emphasis on the visual as Paul dreams what he is supposedly destined to be. This is put across through droplets hitting water in slow motion and bizarre green moons eclipsing as Paul drifts in and out of consciousness. Around all this is the film's antagonist named Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (McMillan); a fat, flying, oozing, spitting, bumbling character with a severe case of acne &#x96; it may be many-a millennium into the future but facial cleansing, it would appear, still manages to elude certain people. The good Baron dresses in dark, rubber outfits and gazes at Feyd Rautha who is, bizarrely enough, played by musician Sting.I read that in recent years Lynch himself has dis-owned Dune, something that I guess isn't surprising given his style and legacy that has evolved since 1984. After all, it's not as if David Lynch has become renowned with large scale genre pieces that rely on the visual over all else and contain a large scale battle scene here and there. It's not like he's become the sort who uses the mise-en-scene to assault our senses and force us to turn away rather than engross us and bring us into this dream-like picture he's created. Still, it could've been worse at least Lynch didn't cast himself in the role of the saviour\/visionary\/leader whom acts as certain sections' 'second coming' and leads everyone to glorious victory. That really would've entrenched the film in the realm of the unwatchable.

The lead of the film is Paul Atreides (MacLachlan), a young man and son to a very important Duke named Leto Atreides (Prochnow), residing on the planet of Caladan. Very early on, and in clear cut contribution to Dune's wavered feel, Paul is put through a series of tests to do with pain, commitment and some sort of reaction to possible imminent death. Some of the scenes, particularly when he must place his hands in a mysterious box and take whatever's in there, are quite torturous in their execution. For all his supposed importance in the hierarchy, they certainly make life hard for him.But it's a test, and following this, a plot involving several clans from neighbouring planets arises to do with destroying the Atreides family from which the idea to kill Paul is born. All this and the increasing tension between everyone linked to the planet of Arakis, a lonely desert planet on which an element known as 'The Spice' is found; a vital ingredient for life and space travel &#x96; without it, most things are useless. The film, in a sense, reminded me of Ridley Scott's 2000 effort 'Gladiator', if only in structure. The idea that a relatively important individual must begin again after a family bereavement, gain the trust of a group of people and lead them to glorious victory while vanquishing his own enemies.But there is no battle weary Russell Crowe having his family killed before becoming a slave, a gladiator and then an avenger happening here, although that it what Dune essentially is but for its more bizarre inclusions. With this, we get a lot of fancy images and a bizarre emphasis on the visual as Paul dreams what he is supposedly destined to be. This is put across through droplets hitting water in slow motion and bizarre green moons eclipsing as Paul drifts in and out of consciousness. Around all this is the film's antagonist named Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (McMillan); a fat, flying, oozing, spitting, bumbling character with a severe case of acne &#x96; it may be many-a millennium into the future but facial cleansing, it would appear, still manages to elude certain people. The good Baron dresses in dark, rubber outfits and gazes at Feyd Rautha who is, bizarrely enough, played by musician Sting.I read that in recent years Lynch himself has dis-owned Dune, something that I guess isn't surprising given his style and legacy that has evolved since 1984. After all, it's not as if David Lynch has become renowned with large scale genre pieces that rely on the visual over all else and contain a large scale battle scene here and there. It's not like he's become the sort who uses the mise-en-scene to assault our senses and force us to turn away rather than engross us and bring us into this dream-like picture he's created. Still, it could've been worse at least Lynch didn't cast himself in the role of the saviour\/visionary\/leader whom acts as certain sections' 'second coming' and leads everyone to glorious victory. That really would've entrenched the film in the realm of the unwatchable.

Reiner smartly chose to cast strong actors instead of pure comics whose uncanny ability to play the funny material with completely straight faces is what makes the film so funny. Armand Assante is surprisingly funny as Ned Ravine, a cop and a lawyer who is being cheated on by a scheming wife (Kate Nelligan), being pursued by a sexy client (Sean Young)and being loved from afar by his faithful secretary (Sherilyn Fenn). There are also funny turns from Christopheer McDonald as Nelligan's dim-witted lover, James Remar, in a perfect take off of Max Cady from CAPE FEAR, and Tony Randall as a judge. The gags come fast and furious and most of them work, there's even a very funny cameo by Bob Euker, as a color commentator for a trial. Just sit back, relax, don't think about it too much and there's a lot of fun to be had here.
