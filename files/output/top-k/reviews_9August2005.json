What in hell were people thinking, giving this guy awards for his saccharine, watery-eyed everyman schtick? This kind of acting belonged in ibuprofen commercials.Then I saw 'Cast Away.' I was nervous at first--although the prologue contained nothing overtly vomitous, it was still way too cute for my sensitive palate. Cute, boring guy's cute, boring girlfriend thinks he works too much; he very cutely, very boringly tricks her into thinking he's not going to propose, etc. Again, to the filmmakers' credit, the cute stuff was approached with a pretty subtle hand--but it doesn't take much to make me gag.Then the plane goes down, and the movie turns into something else part silent film, part philosophical indie, part horror movie. The direction is really quite amazing, especially coming from Robert Zemeckis. Who knew he had it in him, to combine such beautiful cinematography with such powerful imagery (the spear-fishing transition is an incredible movie moment), all in the context of what can only be thought of as an introspective non-story? Who knew that he was so tuned in to the power of silence? Who knew that he, or anyone, could milk honest-to-God tears from a man keeping himself sane through his 'friendship' with a volleyball? There were times when I couldn't believe this thing had played in mainstream theaters, it was so quiet and strange and sad. It had almost none of the usual crowd-pleasing crap, and that was beautiful.And yes, Tom Hanks is good, very good. And I was ready for him to bomb, believe me. I may have even smiled at the idea of him marooned on an island with no food. (Where's your watering eyes now, Buffy?) But he surprised me--his performance was completely subtle, and completely believable, and completely sad.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 August 2005","score":"","review":" This movie really brought a fairy tale type story to life. A must see for everyone. I guess this film obviously makes for a great date movie. This is an excellent romantic comedy about a man and a mermaid who fall in love for each other in a modern fairy tale. This film was one of Tom Hanks' earliest hits that made him the huge superstar that he is today. Co-star Daryl Hannah, who plays Madison the mermaid, became herself a huge star from this film, but now times have changed in her film career, which has faded during the 1990s, which is sad. She is a great actress. John Candy plays Tom Hanks' older brother with Eugene Levy playing a crazy scientist who tries to prove that mermaids exist. These two provide some of the film's hilarious comedic moments.The romantic chemistry between Hanks' Allen Bauer and Hannah's Madison are just well done. Their characters' relationship just becomes true romance throughout the entire film. When Madison eventually gets caught as a mermaid, Allen realizes that Madison is the one true love that he can never lose. Allen, along with his brother and the crazy scientist, band together to rescue her. Later, Allen realizes that Madison was the little girl mermaid that rescued him when he was a young boy in the film's opening flashback sequence.Splash was directed by Ron Howard, who is, of course, one of Hollywood's great filmmakers. A movie about a mermaid has to be good, and Splash does this so well. Tips off to the crew of this movie who made it so real. The underwater sequences are well done, as well as Daryl Hannah herself as the mermaid. She is just utterly believable as a mermaid! I must say that she is just so sexy in the rubber mermaid tail suit. She swims in it so well! I really thought that she played Madison to perfection! I can really enjoy a movie about a mermaid nowadays.On one other note, most people probably don't know this, but Splash was followed up by a Disney TV movie sequel in 1988 that aired in two parts on the ABC network on what used to be a show called The Disney Sunday Movie. The sequel was called Splash, Too and starred Todd Waring as Allen Bauer and Amy Yasbeck (movies Problem Child 1 and 2, The Mask, Pretty Woman, Robin Hood Men In Tights, and TV's Wings) as Madison Bauer, now married from a Neptune ceremony. This sequel has Allen and Madsion come back to New York from their island hideaway to help Allen's brother Freddie (played by Donovan Scott) save Bauer Produce from going out of business. Madison has her own agenda later on as she finds a dolphin she knows from her past, named Salti, captured by another crazy scientist for study. Not a great sequel of course (as sequels usually are) but it was sort of nice to know that Allen and Madison had another adventure together. There were some funny moments in the movie. It was particularly challenging to see Madison cope with suburban life and trying to understand how to be a housewife. I wasn't bothered that much with the recasting of new actors as these characters either. I did like Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison in this sequel. She too swims and looks nice in a mermaid fish tail as well! A worthy successor to Daryl Hannah in her own right. Some people who have seen Splash, Too think that its even better than the original film. And to others, its an awful sequel that doesn't compare to the original. Some folks even think that Amy Yasbeck's portrayal of Madison is even better than Daryl Hannah's! Mixed reviews none the less. Unfortunately, this sequel is not available on home video to my knowledge. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 August 2005","score":"","review":" This movie really brought a fairy tale type story to life.

While I agree that there are some areas of the film which are not exactly original ideas, I was not disappointed at all with the film. I felt the acting was superb, actually some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. Gibson was magnificent, Phoenix was very convincing, and the two kids were very believable. There were a few scenes in the movie which were slow, but I think this is mainly because there were some other areas that really made me jump out of my chair. I also feel that M. Night uses music or the lack thereof to increase tension for the viewer during the film which at times can make the film appear slower than expected. I was however left with a good feeling as I exited my seat after the movie was over. The final message of the film was upbeat and gave a sense of hope to those who have questioned their faith in a higher being.One concept of note which was very evident to my mind watching this film is the underlying question of what would I do in the shoes of these characters. I have read a review stating how nice it was to see the lack of any weapons other than a baseball bat throughout the film. As obvious as this lack is, I believe it was an intentional part of the overall writing in this film I was interested to see how M. Night would tackle a subject that has seen lots of screen time over the years, an alien invasion. His previous films spend a great deal of time delving the human emotional psyche, and this film does not disappoint in this regard. I thought it was refreshing to see how the concept of an alien invasion was treated on a more personal and intimate level than other films of a similar type of subject matter. The characters and circumstances that start to unfold during the course of the film are believable and realistic. The reactions of the characters to events as they occur are also very real and leave little doubt of the fears and angst being experienced. I would not be surprised to see at least one if not more of the cast recognized next March during the Oscar night for the performances in this film.Overall, I believe viewers expecting a Sci-fi thriller will be better prepared if they go into this film expecting a psychological thriller instead. Sometimes, what you don't see, is scarier than what you do. Ask the producers of The Blair Witch Project, they mastered that in their film, M.

There were a few scenes in the movie which were slow, but I think this is mainly because there were some other areas that really made me jump out of my chair. I also feel that M. Night uses music or the lack thereof to increase tension for the viewer during the film which at times can make the film appear slower than expected. I was however left with a good feeling as I exited my seat after the movie was over. The final message of the film was upbeat and gave a sense of hope to those who have questioned their faith in a higher being.One concept of note which was very evident to my mind watching this film is the underlying question of what would I do in the shoes of these characters. I have read a review stating how nice it was to see the lack of any weapons other than a baseball bat throughout the film. As obvious as this lack is, I believe it was an intentional part of the overall writing in this film I was interested to see how M. Night would tackle a subject that has seen lots of screen time over the years, an alien invasion. His previous films spend a great deal of time delving the human emotional psyche, and this film does not disappoint in this regard. I thought it was refreshing to see how the concept of an alien invasion was treated on a more personal and intimate level than other films of a similar type of subject matter. The characters and circumstances that start to unfold during the course of the film are believable and realistic. The reactions of the characters to events as they occur are also very real and leave little doubt of the fears and angst being experienced. I would not be surprised to see at least one if not more of the cast recognized next March during the Oscar night for the performances in this film.Overall, I believe viewers expecting a Sci-fi thriller will be better prepared if they go into this film expecting a psychological thriller instead. Sometimes, what you don't see, is scarier than what you do. Ask the producers of The Blair Witch Project, they mastered that in their film, M. Night has already proved in his two previous films of note The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable that he is a master of this art as well. I give a standing ovation to M. Night for the work he and the cast did on this film, it will be a classic in time.

For the first time since the Empire Strikes Back the trilogy really focused on the mysteries of the Force and really gave viewers a gutsy well written story. I have read critics who have lambasted the movie as having campy dialogue and less than stellar acting. I am a regular movie goer and know the original trilogy by heart and if the reviewers that were critical of this movie had actually watched the movie as a continuation of the same story or a preface to the original series, those reviewers would see that this movie comes much closer to the vision of the earlier movies. Lets face it folks, when it comes time for the Academy Awards, the Star Wars movies win on technical merit as well as musical accompaniament. I am sure these same critics are the ones that complained about the Lord of The Rings as a chase movie. Well duh, if they had read the book, they would have known that.Episode II is a fantastic glimpse into a universe and history that anyone familiar with the Star Wars universe would really like to see. Many questions that have caused fans to wonder about have finally begun to be answered. The movie does a good job dropping your jaw at how various characters from the Old trilogy are related to people and events in the new trilogy. Origins of some of the conflicts and characters are explained in greater detail, helping fans to better grasp the vastness of the storyline laid down by Lucas. Many people, myself included have felt that Episode I really seemed disconnected from the original series as it seemed more like a fantasy film gone amuck.Even some of the humor in Episode II which does contain plenty considering some of the darker nature of the subject matter is amusing and is capable of introducing irony into the sequence of events for those viewers familiar with the events that take place in the old trilogy. Lucas is not afraid to have a character make a comment which is funny but at the same time carries a much deeper meaning to it. There is one scene where Obi Wan Kenobi is chasing after Anakin Skywalker and makes the statement why do I feel like you will be the death of me someday, for the ironic twist is that Darth Vader ultimately DOES kill Obi Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars. Episode II recaptures the magic of the films and left me hanging on the edge of my seat to see the third installment which hasn't even begun filming yet.My children are 9 & 4 and between the three of us we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and left feeling excited. Even my 4 year old was left staring at the screen being caught up in the action sequences. There were only a couple of times in the movie when dialogue that was intended for more mature audiences left the younger kids antsy and a bit bored. Thankfully these scenes while important to the story do not last very long between the action sequences.I would like to tell any of the critics of this movie that those criticisms are unfounded and they need to rethink their concept of what makes a movie entertaining. I heard people in the theater cheering and laughing all the way out the door of the theater because they had FUN! This is not a Shakespearean tragedy nor should a reviewer go into a movie always looking for a reason to dislike a movie and appreciate it for what it is.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding has to be one of the best written and best acted comedies I think I have seen in a long time. While the concept of making a movie about weddings is not unique, I believe that those of us who either have gone through planning a wedding or have experiences with family having too much influence in our lives will relate to this movie better than other wedding movies.This movie is about an ordinary rather plain looking thirty something unmarried woman who comes from a large extended Greek family. All Greek women are expected to go to Greek school, find a good Greek man, marry him and have lots of Greek babies according to the narrator who is also the main character in the movie. This simple premise is what sets us off in almost two hours of raucous humor centered around planning a wedding where a couple coming from completely different backgrounds has to deal with all the external pressures that happen when two people decide to go down the aisle together.This movie has several very heartwarming and somewhat emotional scenes in it so don't expect it is just a funny movie. Acting in this movie on all characters was very well done and very believable. I thought however that the roles of the Grooms Mother and Father were rather flat and two dimensional. This movie reminded me quite a bit of Father of the Bride starring Steve Martin, except in this case, the writers for Monty Python obtained the script for final treatment. While the writers for Monty Python did not actually write this movie but was instead written by the leading lady, there were some moments where it appeared that the humor was drawn right out of a book of British comedy. All in all I felt that the whole movie had a British feel to it.This movie will delight you and leave you with a smile on your face.

Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien.

Knowing that this movie too was from his hand and that it told a story situated in China during the Japanese occupation of the country in WWII, really made me look forward to it, hoping for a movie that would be at least as good as the three others that I mentioned above...At the start of WWII, when the Japanese start to occupy China, there are a lot of British citizens living in Shangai. A lot of them flee as the Japanese army comes closer, but the aristocratic family of the young James Graham stays, not easily willing to give up the privileged life that they are leading. But when on December 8, 1941, the Japanese take over the city, it's too late for them to get out. James gets separated from his family and finds himself living on the street and fighting for food, until he is eventually captured and taken to a confinement camp for British civilians, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Here he develops an admiration for the American captured pilots that are kept prisoner with the British civilians, as well as for the Japanese fighter pilots who take off from the airfield. And while he tries to survive among all the sick and hungry people, he keeps believing that one day he will see his parents again...Overall I liked this movie, but I must say that the second part was definitely the best. As soon as he is in that POW camp and gradually calms down, I could feel sorry for James, but as long as he was that spoiled and annoying little kid who liked to boss the staff around, who didn't seem to care for any rules or regulations,... I can't say that he did something to me. And that's something that I can't say about the Japanese boy who was always hanging around on the airstrip and who I liked from the beginning. When he was about to finally realize his dream of flying a real airplane, although that would mean certain death because he was about to embark on a Kamikaze mission, I was happy for him. And it's weird, but when he couldn't take off, I truly felt sorry for him, knowing what this meant to him. So in the end I would say that for me personally it was a lot easier to empathize with him than with that spoiled British kid.The acting in this movie is good. Takatoro Kataoka was excellent as the young Japanese boy and John Malkovich was my favorite as Basie, but the others were OK as well. I'm not going to say that the performance of most of them was exceptional, but it was good and their acting certainly supported the interesting story. The fact that the story was written from the perspective of the young James isn't new though. Already in 1979, there was a war movie that used this concept. Die blechtrommel from Volker Schlöndorff already showed the rise of the Nazi's in Gdansk, Poland (back then Danzig).Overall this certainly isn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't as great as what I'm used to see from Spielberg when it comes to this kind of movies. When you've seen for instance Schindler's List, then you know that he is capable of a lot more than what he has shown with this movie. I just couldn't get completely and emotionally involved in it, like I could with Schinldler's List and that's why I will give this movie a 7\/10, which certainly isn't bad, but just not as much as what I would give to the other one.

Gui-Gon who believes strongly in young Skywalker chooses to take him with them back to the Jedi council to have him trained in the ways of the force, unaware that the path way he is taking will change him into the evil Sith lord we all now from the originals as Darth Vader.

I know, I know  with too many «ifs» and suppositions, there wouldn't be a movie - or a completely different one (no wonder that the author on the novel on which the film was based was not satisfied with the result of the adaptation!)! At any rate, fiction has to be somewhat more «believable» even if we all know that movies (as fiction) are often magnificent «illusions». After all, we like so much to be «taken on a ride» by a good story with a solid construction - not a patched-up one. Alas! in spite of all its undeniable qualities, «Laura» fails to past the test of logical close scrutiny ! Notice how many scriptwriters have worked on the film  three &#150; one alone and then two others together. It's usually a bad «omen» which often gives... patched-up results !

The punishment is poetic justice for a nosey private detective and one which serves as a stark warning for the character to keep his nose out of other people's business in the future. But of course Jake does nothing of the kind. His investigation becomes more determined. However, what he doesn't know is that by poking his nose in it, he'll destroy the woman he loves and help a corrupt millionaire.If there's a lesson to be learned from Chinatown it's that ordinary people are powerless against the greed and corruption of the wealthy. Powerful men can break the law with impunity, hold cities to ransom, destroy lives and never be held accountable. Ordinary people, on the other hand, are easily intimidated and powerless against petty bureaucracy. That's the way capitalism works. That's the system. Jake knows this. And he tries his best to keep out of it. Just take the Chinatown motif. There, in that community, it's best to keep your nose out of things because you don't know what's going on. And it's the same higher up in the system. To poke your nose into things is to open a can of worms and expose your ignorance. The only possible response to meddling is one of great hostility. But like all film noir, Jake just can't help getting involved. And like all film noir, a woman rouses Jake's interest.Mrs Mulwray is an interesting character because she goes against film noir tradition. She's introduced as the typical black widow, a cool, icy woman who will knowingly destroy the hero. But in actuality Mrs Mulwray is a sad, vulnerable woman. One who's forced to create a harsh façade to keep her dark secret under wraps. But underneath it she's a much warmer female character than you usually find in film noir. She's almost motherly. The way that she dresses Jake's nose certainly illustrates this, as does the lengths she goes to in order to protect her daughter. However, despite all this, she is a femme fatale. She certainly leads Jake to emotional ruin. But like much of the film, a mixture of crossed wires and blind ignorance drives events.It's a genre convention of film noir that the hero knows nothing and ends up ruining everything with his quest for the truth. And so it is with Chinatown. It's Jake who destroys Mrs Mulwray and it's Jake who unwittingly helps Noah Cross. By trying to find out of the truth of their lives he reconnects these two estranged individuals and instigates the inevitable conclusion. And as always in life, it's the powerful person who ends up winning.However, Mrs Mulwray has a part to play in her fate. It's Jake who reconnects her with her father, but it's her secrecy that fires his passion to discover the truth. If she'd told him everything earlier, such a tragic ending would have been avoided. But that's noir for you. Everyone's got their secrets and everyone holds onto them tightly. That's the fun of the genre. But even though the ending is inevitable, it's absolutely perfect. It couldn't have ended any other way. But although the ending is perfect in the sense that everything feels right about it, it's not filmed perfectly. The choreography between Nicholson and the cops before they shoot Mrs Mulwray should have been a lot better. If you watch it, it seems as if Lopez (playing Escobar) is waiting for Jack to tackle him. The timing is off. And the cop that steps forward to shoot at the car does it rather too theatrically in my opinion. It's a shame because it's the only mistake in the film. I really can't find any other faults. The story is magnificent, the dialogue is great, the acting is superb, the photography is luscious and I love the musical score and the production design. I just wish the choreography at the end were tighter and more natural.Another thing that I love about Chinatown is John Huston. He's such a perfect embodiment of evil. He's good company and extremely charming, but he has malevolence running through his veins. And I like the subtly insulting way that he pronounces Jake's surname. He wants to come across as a harmless, perhaps slightly barmy old man, but he knows exactly what he's doing. Everything is coldly calculated. And he also captures the attitude of corporate America. Why spend a lot of money building a safe dam when you can shave costs at the expense of safety and lives? Everything is about money. Well, money and power. Oh, and the future too. He wants to shape the new Los Angeles. He wants to control it. Unlike his former partner Hollis Mulwray, who's attitude, if anything, was socialist. He wanted the people to own the water, and therefore the new city. But that sort of idea is abhorrent to Cross. He represents the ethos that won the battle to control America. The capitalists took everything. And as the argument in the barbershop shows, there's a perverse respectability to greed in America. A banker is respectable, but a private detective isn't. In essence people aren't interested in the truth. They certainly don't want it plastered across the newspaper while they're having their breakfast. All they want is to make money and be left alone. Jake should have known that when he begun his investigation.

I remember seeing this film as a child and being intrigued, which was rare with kids films for me, but also experiencing many of the emotions that are with the best Grimm fairy tales- there are the heroes, but there is a dark side, a side that has to be looked at as a reflection of how the world is, without making it too bold for a kid to understand. This film does that, with some unexpected elements thrown in. And this works as well that it can appeal to the adult animation fans, as its not too childish (there are some comedy bits thrown in for good measure and balance), and like Cooper and Sabbath in comparison, makes for some intensity for any age.The concept involves a struggle any child can understand- the tales of mice vs men, or rather the dominance of men over the mice and rats. Mrs. Brisby is a widow, who's husband was a hero among the mice and rats who were in cages getting horrifying scientific experiments (as revealed later in the film). But she also has a problem- her little mouse house is in the way of a tractor about to plow it down, with her son Timothy in a near-death state of Pneumonia. She seeks help, and it takes her all the way to the home of the rats, and an old, wise, near-creepy rat named Nicodemus.

For me, he is, apart from Clive Barker, the very best British writer today. He is like how Stephen King should be. He does not make compromises; he tells a story, and it's not oh-so-bad-forces from oh-so-far-away, but his heroes are anti-heroes, his world is black and rotten. His books have inspired many a writer and director so far. Also, he takes a theme and varies it in different books; the denying sceptic from Haunted can also be found in Moon. What I want to say, read his books; they are no mainstream, but books like The Fog, The Spear and '48 will be different and stimulating reading.That said, let's review Haunted. Haunted, the first in the series of anti-hero David Ash (second being The Ghosts of Sleath), one of his best (and best-selling) novels, is set in modern-day Britain. The title has more than one meaning; apart from Edbrook Manor being haunted, David Ash himself is by the ghost of his evil older sister, Juliette, who drowned when she fled from the sudden anger of David after torturing him again; since then, she tortures him in his dreams - and found ideal companions in the Muriell family.David, himself, has a drinking problem, and is one of the best investigators of the Psychic Institute with a reputation to expose frauds. He denies the existence of ghosts, but not of para-psychic phenomena. As he enters stage, his driving license is lost. Again.Enter the Mariell family - prankster Simon, upright Robert, and schizophrenic Christine, stewarded after the deadly car accident of their parents by crazed Tess Webb. Having made an arrangement with evil Juliet, they order an investigation of the Psychic Institute in order to torture David. Dead all of them, Christine and her dog incinerated after Simon locked them in the cellar, Robert died trying to save them, Simon hanged himself within the week of their deaths.That is the reason for Davids experience in the book, revealed at the very end of a suspenseful Fantasy\/Horror tale. The torture starts subtle, and becomes more and more blatant, at the end leaving David questioning his sanity and being saved by nanny Tess alone.If you watch the movie to view a mediocre ghost story, the lacking of all of the above may not disturb you. If you watch it to view what you read in the book - given all the deficiencies dramatisations have -, you think wine and get stale water.Lewis took the story to 1928, and Prof. Dr. David Ash is not the borderline-alcoholic borderline-failure haunted man we know and love from the books, but a stable, successful teacher. Instead, we get incest in the Mariell family - if Herbert wanted incest, he would have put it into the book. Apart from that, we get cardboard characters where Herberts book stressed on the discovery of the characters and character development, and shallowness where Herbert delved into the deep. The delicate effects of Herbert that left Ash wondering whether he hallucinated, or whether all was simply a normal circumstance, are totally left out (and where they are, they are totally unmotivated - Ash being not the subject of their torture, and we ask ourselves why nanny Tess keeps her secrecy - plot holes where Herbert put delicacy). The fire in the wine cellar where Christina, Robert and the dog died, for example - in the book, David extinguishes it, and stops seeing it - but still \/hears\/ it and \/feels\/ its heat, one of the finest effects in the book - is totally low-budget SFX in the movie. Kate Beckinsales nude and sex scenes are enjoyable and lead to the (male) viewer's strong identification with David - the character development of Christina is totally left out (which I am sure Beckinsale as an actor would have been capable of). When David discovers that Edbrook is a totally different world than the outside, and is not what it seems, this is done step by step adding suspense the movie lacks.All in all, this movie adds to the B-grades Kate Beckinsale made between Much ado about nothing and Underworld - why? She's intelligent, educated, a much better actor than Catherine Zeta-Jones and many others, why is she selling herself so cheaply and does movies like Van Helsing? You would think she could chose between much better scripts.The movie itself has good actors, and the story of Herbert is excellent, but the script is catastrophic. You could only guess whether it aimed at a mainstream marked that would find Herbert too complicated, or it wanted to soften the hardest things about Herberts black-in-black world here - the movie did neither become a popular mainstream success, nor did the script use the potential even Haunted, light version did offer.A little more money on the effects - and a few well-placed additional effects - would not have harmed.

While I liked 'On the Waterfront' a lot the first time round, I appreciated it even more the second time. There are some slight negative points - the music is at times overbearing and the religious side it tries to bring forth does not quite work - but there is not anything significant that I would flaw the film on.The acting is definitely the film's strongest point. Marlon Brando gives and intense and realistic performance. It is not just because of the famous car scene, or the well-known scene in the bar with Saint, that makes his performance great. It is everything that he does throughout, in particular the facial expressions that he captures on his face. Towards the end there is a scene in which he stands alone and just stares at his fellow workers. His expression is unflinching without being unrealistic. Eva Marie Saint is quite good too, also giving off a performance in which her face is central. However, there is less to talk about with her than there is about the supporting actors.When I first viewed the film, it was Karl Malden's acting that stood out the most to me. His performance and character are powerful, however on a second viewing it seems a bit over-the-top, as does the whole religious side of the film in which he is involved. On the other hand, Lee J. Cobb is brilliant as Johnny Friendly, providing a fierce performance while not letting his character turn into a stereotype of evil. Then there is Rod Steiger, whose acting, after only one viewing of the film, I did not take much notice of. He is hardly there, and until the point when he instructed to talk with Brando, he does not have much to do. Indeed, Rod Steiger has very few good scenes in the film, however he is excellent in those scenes. It is incredibly realistic acting, the way he interacts with his brother, and the way he is torn between the mob and his family.The next thing to mention is that this film could never be as effective in colour. The bleakness of the black and white prints is used well by Kazan. There are many shots of the characters, which just show their heads against a white sky a bleak white sky. We cannot even see if it is cloudy or sunny day. The sky is as plain and as barren as what the future holds for each of the characters. Leonard Bernstein's music deserves a mention too. It is an electrifying score and often fits the actions very well. It is at times a tad overbearing (note the scene where Brando goes to Saint's house) as it has a tendency to over-ride the dialogue and the action. However, this does not subtract much from the overall picture.The sound recording is very realistic. The dock noises can often be heard, which helps to set up the waterfront atmosphere, and there is one scene in which the noise of a ship plays a key element in a conversation between Saint and Brando. In that conversation it is metaphoric, and it could even be argued that it is only heard through perceptual subjectivity. The other noises are sharply recorded too, such as banging at the basement of the church. The photography is excellent, using shadows very well to set up the atmosphere, all of which is captured well with some glides and tilts.One can praise a film for many different reasons, but it is not worth much unless one can explain what the film is about. I would say that 'On the Waterfront' is a drama about struggling against the restrictions of society, and of what it takes to stand up for what one believes in. However, I also see it as an exciting thriller about fighting corruption and the harshness of stevedore life in a community that is effectively run by gangsters. Perhaps it is about love and how relationships develop, and the events that help them to grow strong. I think different viewers will take some different out of it. And it is perhaps that, more than the artistic and cinematic qualities of the film, which makes it a great piece of cinema.

There are some slight negative points - the music is at times overbearing and the religious side it tries to bring forth does not quite work - but there is not anything significant that I would flaw the film on.The acting is definitely the film's strongest point. Marlon Brando gives and intense and realistic performance. It is not just because of the famous car scene, or the well-known scene in the bar with Saint, that makes his performance great. It is everything that he does throughout, in particular the facial expressions that he captures on his face. Towards the end there is a scene in which he stands alone and just stares at his fellow workers. His expression is unflinching without being unrealistic. Eva Marie Saint is quite good too, also giving off a performance in which her face is central. However, there is less to talk about with her than there is about the supporting actors.When I first viewed the film, it was Karl Malden's acting that stood out the most to me. His performance and character are powerful, however on a second viewing it seems a bit over-the-top, as does the whole religious side of the film in which he is involved. On the other hand, Lee J. Cobb is brilliant as Johnny Friendly, providing a fierce performance while not letting his character turn into a stereotype of evil. Then there is Rod Steiger, whose acting, after only one viewing of the film, I did not take much notice of. He is hardly there, and until the point when he instructed to talk with Brando, he does not have much to do. Indeed, Rod Steiger has very few good scenes in the film, however he is excellent in those scenes. It is incredibly realistic acting, the way he interacts with his brother, and the way he is torn between the mob and his family.The next thing to mention is that this film could never be as effective in colour. The bleakness of the black and white prints is used well by Kazan. There are many shots of the characters, which just show their heads against a white sky a bleak white sky. We cannot even see if it is cloudy or sunny day. The sky is as plain and as barren as what the future holds for each of the characters. Leonard Bernstein's music deserves a mention too. It is an electrifying score and often fits the actions very well. It is at times a tad overbearing (note the scene where Brando goes to Saint's house) as it has a tendency to over-ride the dialogue and the action. However, this does not subtract much from the overall picture.The sound recording is very realistic. The dock noises can often be heard, which helps to set up the waterfront atmosphere, and there is one scene in which the noise of a ship plays a key element in a conversation between Saint and Brando. In that conversation it is metaphoric, and it could even be argued that it is only heard through perceptual subjectivity. The other noises are sharply recorded too, such as banging at the basement of the church. The photography is excellent, using shadows very well to set up the atmosphere, all of which is captured well with some glides and tilts.One can praise a film for many different reasons, but it is not worth much unless one can explain what the film is about. I would say that 'On the Waterfront' is a drama about struggling against the restrictions of society, and of what it takes to stand up for what one believes in. However, I also see it as an exciting thriller about fighting corruption and the harshness of stevedore life in a community that is effectively run by gangsters. Perhaps it is about love and how relationships develop, and the events that help them to grow strong. I think different viewers will take some different out of it. And it is perhaps that, more than the artistic and cinematic qualities of the film, which makes it a great piece of cinema.
