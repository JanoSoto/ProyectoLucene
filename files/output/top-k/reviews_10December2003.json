His comedy is borderline wacky, and he is the expert at physical humor, but unlike Jim Carrey he knows when to contain himself, how to make a real character, and how to make those zany qualities work just right.His writing is dazzling and offbeat and wacky and outrageous. Part of my computer's harddrive is dedicated to old Steve Martin albums from Saturday Night Live and his standup routines. I give him credit for coming up with the word Google in his Googlephonics skit. But anyway.L.A. Story (1991) is Martin's homage to Los Angeles. It's a slapstick comedy and a touching romance story. Sometimes we get jokes nearing ridiculous, and sometimes we get moments of pure reality. Normally this uneven blending of two very different genres would never work, but give the guy credit for making it work splendidly well.In L.A. Story, Martin plays Wacky Weatherman Harris K. Telemacher, the type of loony guy you sometimes wish would take the place of those boring meterologists on your local news channel that point at their boards and seem as if they're about to fall asleep. Harris has got it all, living the highlife in rich L.A. with a beautiful gal (Marilu Henner) and a great job. But then, one day, he's fired, his girlfriend dumps him for his agent (Kevin Pollack), and he's got nowhere to go in life.That's when he meets Sara (Victoria Tennant, Martin's real-life wife), a British journalist researching L.A. for a news article. Harris takes her on a tour of L.A. Some of these buildings are over twenty years old, he says.Harris also sparks a relationship with a young ditz named SanDeE* (Sarah Jessica Parker), who doesn't care if she's being used as long as she's having fun. She twirls around and does cartwheels and makes Harris feel young again.And thrown together with all this is an electronic highway sign. The sign gives Harris a riddle to unscramble throughout the film, and when the answer is finally revealed it's pure Steve Martin humor.Steve Martin has a way of parodying anything. I laughed so hard at L.A. Story I cried; but then the movie takes a break from being silly and throws in lots of romance and such. But, unlike other movies, it seems to fit perfectly. It's beautiful and offbeat. It sort of reminds me of last year's Punch-Drunk Love, only L.A. Story seems to have a bit more purpose and the characters are a lot more likable. It's also a lot funnier.This is probably one of the most quotable films of all time. It's not as good as Martin's Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), but I'll admit that Martin's writing lends better one-liners than the former (which is strangely funnier, though). I just can't get enough of Steve Martin's wonderful wit. Every time you think that L.A. Story is settling down to go into the typical romantic comedy cliches, such as the slow-motion shower scene with the beautiful woman splashing her wet hair over the camera, something happens. (In this case, we see Harris in HIS shower, bathing himself and glancing down at the tap. One knob says Slow Motion, he turns it, and suddenly he's splashing over his hair and the camera in slow motion.)The movie features cameos ranging from Rick Moranis (who has starred in four films with Martin), Patrick Stewart, Woody Harrelson and even Chevy Chase. The best is undoubtedly Moranis' British gravedigger (Finally, Harris says, a funny gravedigger!) I wouldn't want to ruin some of the scenes or quotes, but the beginning sequence with Harris in his car, swerving through neighbors' backyards and sidewalks and down stairs to avoid rush hour traffic, had me laughing hysterically, and so did a scene where he grabs a handgun from his glove compartment and gets in a road duel with a delivery truck.They key to all this humor, I think, is how delightfully over the top and realistic it is. Martin finds a funny social topic -- such as restaurant booking procedures -- and stretches it out into the absurd. And you know what? It works. Because it's Steve Martin. And Steve Martin has hit gold with L.A. Story. Fans and non-fans alike will love this movie.

I honestly remember mulling over this epiphany as a pre-teen, sitting comfortably in a sparsely-filled movie house, completely enthralled with not only my independence as a lone audience member, but also by my enthrallment over this strange story with an astronaut's mentality at its center. I was a slightly strange kid. But, it's a slightly strange movie.`The Right Stuff' no longer holds the appeal for me as it once did. How could it?? I'm older, more discerning & critical of film, but also more knowledgeable about the history represented through this story. I know that most of it is fiction. I can argue all day & night about film's responsibility to be historically accurate (my philosophy more or less boils down to, `well...it depends.' Nice, eh? Years of schooling helped me come up with that one). I guess in the case of The Right Stuff, I take the inaccuracy personally. The astronauts were heroes of mine as a kid and when I was old enough to understand the actual depth of their stories, I guess I just came to love the real-life drama over the spiritual, and fictional, context Kauffman presents them in here. Just a few historical notesa) The `fireflies' John Glenn saw from his capsule window was actually urine emptying from his catheter into space. The effect was duplicated time & again by the astronauts that followed. Why the film would want to juxtapose this event with the tribal fire of the Aborigines is beyond me.b) There simply was not as much doubt about Gus Grissom's splashdown snafu investigation as was portrayed. Even though Fred Ward is great in the role, it makes appear as if Grissom was a brute, which he wasn't. He was a very well respected engineer amongst the NASA staff & kept himself highly involved in the development of the capsule. The film represents this in an off-the-cuff remark about having a window & explosive hatch (get ready for the irony folks!). In fact, NASA was so impressed with Grissom, even after losing his capsule, that he was granted the first spot in the Gemini program as well as the Apollo program in which he died in a fire. Anyone who's familiar with the Apollo 1 story knows that he was tirelessly in the process of testing the capsule's equipment when the fire broke out. c) Gordon Cooper & Grissom & Yeager were never at Edwards Air Force Base together at the same time. The timelines are completely out of whack. In fact, Pancho Barnes' Happy Bottom club had burnt down long before Cooper was ever there. More than that, Barnes was a good friend of Cooper's family & he had known her since a child. The film shows her berating him for his cockiness. Didn't happen, at least not there. d) Sally Rand, whose famous fan dance is recreated here, was really, really old by the time the astronauts are shown watching her show. She did, however perform this routine well past her prime in actual life, but wouldn't have looked nearly as good as she does here. e) The astronauts not represented in depth here (Carpenter, Slayton & Shirra) also had fascinating stories. Too bad they're given so little time here. f) Why isn't Kennedy, a huge supporter of the space program, represented at all?? The political figures that are here (LBJ, Ike, nameless others) are completely clownish and cartoony. The press corps seems entirely robotic.I know I'm leaving out some major stuff, but that's good enough for now. So, yes, I am not such a hard case that I can't still enjoy `The Right Stuff' for its entertainment value, and it even manages to get a few things correct (e.g., the testing sequences & press conference scene are great & Glenn did actually scold Shepherd & the others for their carousing).

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, History"},{"date":"10 December 2003","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Ask any cinemaphile and they'll doubtlessly tell you that the best films come from the biggest risks. Terminator 2 was a risk because it was the first film with an official budget of a hundred million. The current Lord Of The Rings adaptations were a big risk because they entailed nearly a third of a billion dollars and a principal photography stage equivalent to that undertaken for Apocolypse Now. Speaking of Apocolypse Now, well, anyone who knows enough about cinema won't need to be told about that one.Police Academy is nowhere near in the same class as those films, but even the most intelligent audience needs some mindless fun every once in a while. Instead, Police Academy's big risk was in managing to squeeze in a lot of jokes that were certain to offend at least someone. People claim that the film discriminates against gays, women, and blacks, conveniently ignoring that the stereotypical nerdy white man and the NRA-endorsing, gun-toting white man also get a good serve here. Nobody is safe. And please, don't read past here if you care about what happens in the film as well as having not seen it yet.Unfortunately, and there always is an unfortunately about adult-oriented comedies of the 1980s, Police Academy does not give its audience a lot of credit. No joke is too low-brow here, and ones like the queer dog were pretty off, even in those enlightened days. The launching of Harris into the horse's butt is a pretty divisive moment in the film, causing fans and critics alike to battle over whether it is just good fun or a moment where the film sinks so low that it will never return. I prefer to see it as an excellent use of trick photography (ie creative problem solving in film, a lost art these days) that, given Harris' character, is pretty damned funny when seen in the right frame of mind.There's also a lot of whining these days that the Blue Oyster scene is discriminatory against the gay. Well, I'd hate to break it to these self-appointed defenders of the outsider, but the Village People pretty much opened this door long, long ago (or at least a few years ago when the film was made). The stereotype of the leather-clad gay man with the handlebar moustache is still firmly ingrained in the mind of every human being who speaks English.

Director Stephen Sommers isn't a master storyteller, but his work in The Mummy clearly shows he has a love of escapist filmmaking and crafted the plot in a simplistic but engrossing enough manner that it didn't get in the way of the characters, the action, or the adventure. He obviously didn't learn his lesson.I'm actually a pretty big fan of the man's work, but this is easily his biggest misfire since The Adventures of Huck Finn. The Mummy Returns is just turgid filmmaking in almost every aspect of its production. Only the likeable cast and the general fact that Sommers is better at delivering pure spectacle than say, the likes of Michael Bay, Joel Schumacher, and Roland Emmerich keep this film generally watchable.But didn't Sommers realize that what would have made this second go-round far more invigorating would have been to place our already beloved characters into a totally different environment with new dangers and villains? He seems perfectly content recycling virtually every aspect of the original film, and then geometrically bloating every little detail into something bigger, which appears to have been the key word going through his mind.Everything about this movie is bigger than the original. There's more action and it's larger in scale; there are more badguys, more special effects, more flashbacks, more Magi, and more prophecies, all this without the much-needed freshness or the rousing sense of adventure.Whenever Sommers gets into a bit of a speed bump in the plot, he simply explains it away with prophecies and reincarnations. Rick O'Connell himself is a bad-ass adventurer, making him into a prophesied warrior destined to save the world puts a bad taste in my mouth. Couldn't they have just kept him a rugged, hunky hero without the mystical crap? Same goes for Evelyn, who as it turns out, is the reincarnation of a murdered pharaoh's daughter, conveniently the same pharaoh killed by Imhotep (why he didn't recognize her in the original is beyond me.oh, wait, that's right, Sommers just made this B.S. up for the sequel). The reincarnation bit does little for the character other than explain why she can suddenly fight so well with sais; why was it included again?  At one point after the hour-and-a-half mark, Sommers knocks off one of the main characters in a scene that would have been genuinely affecting if this same character hadn't been revived by an ancient Egyptian ritual ten minutes later.Cliffhangers can be a lot of fun, but when they're resolved the way they are here, it's like someone's intentionally slapping you in the face. At one point, O'Connell, who's carrying his son in his arms, actually outruns the sunrise. In one of the climactic battles, there are not one, but two instances where characters grab spears that have already been thrown mid-air and one of those moments is shot in Matrix-style slow motion!And thus we segue into the action, which should be the movie's selling point, but is instead a good part of what holds the film back. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any adventure movie so intent on piling on one action scene after another, so much that it becomes a bit of a headache after awhile. I should be in action movie heaven, but Sommers' occasional miscalculated direction makes a lot of the fights and chases pretty boring. The slow motion I've already covered, but a couple of the fights and chases boast too many quick cuts, nothing as extreme as a Jerry Bruckheimer production, but too distracting to make the action genuinely exciting.You remember how in The Mummy, it was damn cool and exciting to see what sort of havoc Imhotep could reek? To find out what cool power he would use next? All he does here is repeat what he'd already accomplished in the first go-round, he `telepathically' lifts people off the ground and tosses them around and instead of making a giant sandstorm, he makes a giant wall of water. Yawn. As far as new villains go, Velazquez's Anck Su Namun is hot, but where the hell was her reincarnated self in the previous movie? The Anubis warriors are pathetically useless and The Scorpion King is just a terrible visual conception.But much as I wish I could hate the movie, I just can't. The cast is just too damned adorable. O'Connell is no Indiana Jones, but he's about as cool and fun a substitute as you can get. Fraser is obviously having a ball in the role, even if he has put on a slight bit of unflattering weight. Rachel Weisz's Evelyn is the best Indiana Jones girl Indy never had. Hell, forget that, she could kick all the Indy girls' asses in a three-on-one match and still come out looking as pretty as ever. Evelyn's my kind of woman tough, intelligent, beautiful, with all these great qualities wrapped around a warm, caring heart. I think I'm in love.John Hannah is, unfortunately, not as funny as he was before; like the movie itself, his humor's lost its sense of freshness, but he's still a bit amusing and certainly still a charming, greedy doofus. But then there's that crucial casting error, Freddie Boath as little Alex. Kids in action movies tend to be the purveyor that destroys tension and excitement. As a matter of fact, the only kid sidekick I've ever liked was Short Round from Temple of Doom and let me tell you something, Alex sure as hell is no Short Round. He's funny in spurts, but ultimately just not a charming or talented enough actor to pull the role off.A good cast can do a lot for a film, much like what Fraser and Wiesz do here, but while they make The Mummy Returns ultimately a middling experience, it's a little sad to see such fun characters that don't get the movie they deserve.

There are the `classic' movies, the ones that all critics love but the major of people don't really like, and then there are the classic movies, ones that can never not entertain. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those that never cease to entertain. Also, in today's movie environment, it's hard to find an action movie that also constantly entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is a rarity nowadays.The famous plot has Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) first being chased by a gigantic boulder (which has been parodied so many times it felt like I had already seen it), and then going on a treasure hunt to find the Biblical lost ark, which supposedly holds the original Ten Commandments before some Nazis do. Along the way, he meets up with his former teacher\/friend's daughter Marion (Karen Allen) who has an important piece of the puzzle, and together the travel to stop the Nazis from, basically, taking over the world.It's easy to picture this movie as a cheesy serial, and, in fact, Steven Spielberg himself said that that's all he thought this was as he was making it.

Many have done the `map with the line tracing where the hero goes' now, and it seems like Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the first action movies that has a lot of comedy in it, and now every action movie is labeled as an `action comedy'.Rarely does a movie come along in this vein where you are entertained even when there isn't a fight scene or something that most people would consider exciting on screen.

Also, although John Williams is a genius composer, the same few bars got a little tiring after he played them over and over again in every scene.

The Bat mobile chase, axis chemicals explosion, and the vandelization of the museum, were all memorable scenes. But nothing was as insane as the man himself Jack Nicholson. He's one of the most gifted actors ever, (12 academy award nominations) and was the best comic villain ever (Made AFI's Top 50 villains.) WB spent a lot of money on this project and put it all in the hands of director Tim Burton. A gamble, maybe, but did it pay off? I think so. This is even today probably his best movie and his first really dark movie. His Dark knight makes the old batman obsolete. This in my opinion is the best comic book movie ever made, and is still visually impressive today. The plot was deeper and more meaningful then other movies of the genre. Unfortunately all of the sequels got steadily worse. Batman Returns was almost as good, but Batman Forever wasn't nearly as good, and Batman and Robin just stunk. Danny Elfman composed a brilliant score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, and I think its one of his best scores.  It probably is the best super hero score.  I haven't seen enough super hero movies to tell you. Hopefully Mr. Burton makes some more super hero movies, but until he does we still have the best in the genre!

I usually enjoy King written films and when I saw the DVD for this movie on sale for 10 bucks, I had to pick it up.  After viewing, I realized that I hadn't missed anything much.  King's stories usually have more depth.  This was your average werewolf tale with few surprises.  Some of the acting was pretty laughable but leads Corey Haim as a wheelchair bound teen and Gary Busey as his carefree Uncle did a good job with their roles.   I still don't know why the film was narrated by an older version of Haim's sister, played by Megan Follows.  I assume it has something to do with the novella but since she was not the lead character, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense telling the tale through her perspective. The gore effects were fairly good, particularly a beheading at the beginning and a scene where police chief Terry O'Quinn gets bludgeoned with a baseball bat.  The werewolf looked decent for a film made in the mid 1980s but generally you could easily tell it was a costume.  A good werewolf comes across when you don't think 'costume' or 'animatronic' every time it appears on screen. Then again, I'm sure it must be pretty hard to make it look very convincingly real.  On the plus, some of the transformation stuff was good.  So how do I rate this movie?  Well I think it is safe to say that it probably would have had more impact if I saw it as a child.  What I see now is a fairly straightforward werewolf trip, and not that it's necessarily a bad thing to be that way, I think I expected more of a narrative coming from the fingers of King. Some of the goofiness makes the film laughable in spots not intended to be. Overall a C+.

STAR WARS released in the summer of 1977 by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and by Twentieth Century-Fox. Fox pulled some great odds for this film since the studio itself was fighting to stay alive and it needed a blockbuster to bring it back to prominence,and it did just that.

Together they must rescue the princess,and above all get-by the guards and save the universe from a certain fate. This builds up to a showdown against the forces of evil that is vastly entertaining with a mix of some modern myth,and it is a thrill-and-a half FX spectacular galore that is in a class by itself. In other words,STAR WARS,not only saved 20th Century-Fox from a complete disaster and a near bankruptcy of the studio, but also it was the movie that saved Hollywood,thanks to George Lucas.

The film of 1977.However,STAR WARSEPISODE IVA NEW HOPE,didn't stop there since Lucas insisted there was more to come,and it came too. The next one was even bigger and would be heralded as one of the best in the original trilogy and still holds up very well.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,also released by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and 20th Century-Fox roared into theatres in the summer of 1980,and it would become one of the darkest of Star Wars series. This worthy first sequel features more depth in its characterizations and the best storyline so far which included revealing many important secrets about the origins of Luke Skywalker and man he rarely knew whom would become his father before turning into the evil Darth Vader. However,a new character was introduced as well,a renegade named Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee-Williams(whom most remember from Lady Sings The Blues and Mahogany with actress\/songstress Diana Ross back in the early 1970's). However,the sequel has no wooden dialogue from the first film,but here it is more adult-oriented of the original trilogy while that open-ended cliffhanger of a finale makes for a suitably spectacular windup since of this one George Lucas serves as executive producer and writer here and leaving the directorial duties to Irvin Kershner.

This was indeed a worthy sequel or leftovers from the last installment,but in all fairless it was a bitter disappointment.

What didn't make it stand out in some of the segments is the weakest entry in the series which is overrun by Jabba The Hutt,cute-furry Ewoks,and the realization between Luke and his long lost sister he never knew.

This was a visionary blockbuster that was eyepopping from the get-go which was a quantum leap that redefined the entertainment industry and established a dynasty by locating the universal in a galaxy far,far away where original critters,futuristic samurais,side with a put-upon princess against the ruthless evil empire controlled by the most diabolical villain in the history of cimema,the merciless evil tyrant,LORD DARTH VADER for the control of the galactic empire and the universe itself,only to be stopped in his tracks by a unknown lad named Luke Skywalker,his companion Obi-Wai Knonbi,and renegade ex-soldier named Han Solo and a furry sidekick Chewbecca,a wookie. Together they must rescue the princess,and above all get-by the guards and save the universe from a certain fate. This builds up to a showdown against the forces of evil that is vastly entertaining with a mix of some modern myth,and it is a thrill-and-a half FX spectacular galore that is in a class by itself. In other words,STAR WARS,not only saved 20th Century-Fox from a complete disaster and a near bankruptcy of the studio, but also it was the movie that saved Hollywood,thanks to George Lucas. The movie made international stars of its cast which consisted of a unknown actors at the time who were hitting their stride,Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Harrison Ford,with a stellar cast of British actorsSir Alec Guinness,Peter Cushing,and the voice of Darth Vader,James Earl Jones.The first STAR WARS film won six Oscars including several for best musical score from the legendary Hollywood composer John Williams,and for it impressive special effects. The film of 1977.However,STAR WARSEPISODE IVA NEW HOPE,didn't stop there since Lucas insisted there was more to come,and it came too. The next one was even bigger and would be heralded as one of the best in the original trilogy and still holds up very well.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK,also released by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and 20th Century-Fox roared into theatres in the summer of 1980,and it would become one of the darkest of Star Wars series. This worthy first sequel features more depth in its characterizations and the best storyline so far which included revealing many important secrets about the origins of Luke Skywalker and man he rarely knew whom would become his father before turning into the evil Darth Vader. However,a new character was introduced as well,a renegade named Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee-Williams(whom most remember from Lady Sings The Blues and Mahogany with actress\/songstress Diana Ross back in the early 1970's). However,the sequel has no wooden dialogue from the first film,but here it is more adult-oriented of the original trilogy while that open-ended cliffhanger of a finale makes for a suitably spectacular windup since of this one George Lucas serves as executive producer and writer here and leaving the directorial duties to Irvin Kershner. Also Oscar nominated as well for John Williams' musical score. One of the top ten highest grossing films of 1980.The final episode of the Star Wars trilogy ended with Richard Marquand taking over the directorial duties with George Lucas serving as executive producer for THE RETURN OF THE JEDI,released by Lucasfilm,Ltd.,and Twentieth Century-Fox on Memorial Day weekend in May of 1983. This was indeed a worthy sequel or leftovers from the last installment,but in all fairless it was a bitter disappointment. The storyline was very good in every detail,especially with the good-versus-evil conflict between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader in a climatic showdown and some of the coolest special effects ever devised especially in the amazing final battle in the destruction of the Death Star is amazing beyond belief. What didn't make it stand out in some of the segments is the weakest entry in the series which is overrun by Jabba The Hutt,cute-furry Ewoks,and the realization between Luke and his long lost sister he never knew. But in all fairless,this was the end of a trilogy that was really completely destroyed 16 years later in 1999,by THE PHANTOM MENACE,which was the weakest link in the history of the Star Wars series.

Yes, it had some nice special effects, and it SURE made use of that SDDS sound system, but overall I was not particularly impressed with Titan A.E. The animation was less than spectacular (it seems like Don Bluth studios always uses the same stock footage of someone moving as reference for animation, because in every movie you can easily predict how a character will move according to the situation), the 3D characters moved choppily, the 2D characters were so badly colored (Don Bluth doesn't believe in shading unless a VERY strong light is on the character or the character is frowning), and the story was abysmal (aliens blow up the Earth because we develop a technology that in the end poses absolutely no threat to them or gives any reason for them to fear us, and everything ends happily even though we only stop some of the aliens and the credits roll while I imagine scores more of them coming to kill us all).

It's seen as a haven from the troubles of the world. No gangs, no unrest and total peace of mind that order will prevail are all assured. American Beauty ponders the possibilities of mid-life goals burying one's identity and the keys to knowing yourself. It's a frightening portrayal of how that buried knowledge can rot under a picture-perfect topping.That quiet seems to be more of a ravage on the town that Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) inhabit. The routine is all that's left of their marriage as Lester narrates his stumbling through work, dinner and sexual deprivation. Carolyn has destroyed friendships with her neighbors by having a favorite bordering tree removed for the sake of getting more sun in her yard. The new family occupying the home of the scorned neighbors are, for all appearances, perfect. The father boasts a military career; the mother is a quiet homemaker, and son studious and reserved. No one here is really everything their appearances project. Happiness is elusive even for those who have it all. Those who drop the need for appearances (such as openly gay, but economically stable, couple Jim and Jim) are clearly more relaxed than the intense Burnhams. Lester has hit his limit, and a brief encounter with his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) sexually overt friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), is all it takes to set Lester off looking for the things missing in his life.Broadway veteran and film freshman, Sam Mendes, has made an actor's movie, an exquisite debut from a stage director. Spacey's Lester frustrates Carolyn as he starts taking a stand for himself becoming increasingly unpredictable while remaining unflappable. He turns that cool onto everyone and begins shaping his life into the dreams he had forgotten. The precise control that Bening infuses into Carolyn is frightening to watch as she clings to every shred of her status as a floundering real estate agent. Thora Birch and Wes Bentley bring quiet and believable passion to their two introverts awakening to each other. Bentley's quiet, but strong performance is a surprise as he is an actor with almost no previous experience. (He is rumored to have auditioned with only a Polaroid for a headshot.) There are few movies that could give the near-perfect production in American Beauty competition. The photography of Academy Award Winner, Conrad Hall, is still dead-on; illustrating every detail, but never showing off. The camera is patient, but colorful, particularly when Lester dreams about Angela. Those dream sequences bring the audience into the sensuality of Lester's desire of Angela but never gratuitously expose Mena Suvari. After garnering multiple Oscars in 2000, this is destined to be a classic.9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 December 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  \tIdealistically, suburbia is the embodiment of many goals held up as the American Dream home, family, and all the proper accoutrements from the best stores.
