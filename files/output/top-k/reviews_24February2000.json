Going by the title,  I was expecting a really light comedy.  It was funny as all hell, but incredibly thought-provoking as well.Too bad this movie hasn't gotten as much attention as it deserves.  The characters were so fleshed-out, likeable, and funny that I felt like I was friends with them all, and present at Jennifer Tilly's party.  This is one of the best ensembles of the year.The funny moments in the movie mixed in well with the more serious moments without ever being awkward transitions.  I especially liked how they handled the scene in which Vincey retaliates against the gay bashers.  It was very intense, and it was given the attention and consideration it was due.  The movie managed to be incredibly funny as well, it was amazing.  I loved all the movie references, like when Jennifer Tilly compares two of the male characters to Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest and Elizabeth Taylor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  Every time I think about that I could just die laughing.This is definitely a movie that I want to see again, and, perhaps to own.  It is also the first movie that I have seen in a long time that I would make all my friends see.  My only regret is that I missed this movie when it was theaters last Spring.

A couple of the folks with whom I saw American Beauty said afterwards It was great - Spacey was incredible.  His performance, it seems, is enough to have convinced people that they had just watched a decent movie, even though there is little else to recommend the film.  The other significant plus is the advertising campaign - marketing it as a funny drama and a moving comedy is an ingenious way of disguising the fact that it is neither. Since there are only two or three really good laughs in the piece it isn't really funny enough to be a comedy (but since it's written by someone who used to work on Cybill, that's hardly a surprise) and since it only gets vaguely dramatic towards the end, it doesn't maintain the atmosphere of a drama.  But the audience happily accepts this schizophrenic mess because the adverts told them to.  The adverts also told them to Look closer. Again, this is a tip-top marketing ploy, since it implies hidden depth, significance and meaning, without the content actually being there.  The average audience member is going to think Wow, that plastic bag blowing around must be really poignant, because this is a DEEP movie.  Heaven forbid that they should actually think for themselves.  Look closer, indeed.What then, of the characters?  Well, what characters?  Every one on display here is little more than a stereotype, from  fortysomething midlife crisis guy, to the uptight career-driven wife, to their moody teenage daughter to the moody teenage boy, to the homophobic soldier who - gasp - turns out to be gay, etc etc etc.  Take the gay couple across the street, for example. They are only around for two or three scenes, and only then to provoke some more bigotry from Lieutenant Colonel Asskicker.  They might as well have been two cardboard cut outs labelled Gay for all that they were able to develop.  I know they are only supporting characters, but if you're going to do a movie which tackles the issue of homosexuality, you could at least have some believable homosexual characters in it, rather than 2-D cliches.This is indicative of the whole, ghastly, contrived nature of this film. Characters don't feel like characters because they don't behave in an even remotely plausible manner, they don't behave consistently, and they seem to stumble through from one set-piece to the next.  For example, Spacey getting a job at Happy Burgers; sure, that's amusing, but the whole thing is engineered just so he can catch his wife out, and then it's dropped.  It doesn't fit in with any discernible character arc, but is simply contrived to get a cheap laugh.  What about Ricky Fitts at the beginning?  You've just moved into a new neighbourhood, you sell drugs but you have an incredibly strict father, and you notice your new next door neighbour at a party.  Do you A) introduce yourself, chat to the guy, find out if he's the sort who will report you to the police etc. before making your move or B) march right up and offer the dope to him there and then because it expedites the action? Or how about the daughter's friend towards the end of the movie.  You're 16 years old, you've just had a blazing row with your best friend, and your car is parked outside.  Do you A) run off, leave the house asap, and drive straight home, or B) slink off downstairs and hang around interminably just in case Kevin Spacey shows up to carry out his perverted, sub-Lolita fantasy?  I could go on all day...The direction is, dare I say it, directionless.  Sam Mendes should stick to his so-called risque theatre productions at the Donmar Warehouse.  His debut film, as I have intimated, reeks of incoherence.  In addition to the tonal uncertainty, there is no clear directorial vision.  The only memorable images are borrowed from Blue Velvet and Lolita, the rest of the time it seems to be left to the cast to try to carry the picture, whether through Bening's OTT hyperactivity or Wes Bentley understatement.  When you look at The Straight Story, or The Insider, or even The Sixth Sense, it galls me to think that this has been nominated for Best Direction...That this movie is so highly rated by critics, IMDb users, and Oscar personnel, is a great shame, because ultimately its success is a testament to people's stupidity.  A (substantial) crowd of non-thinking buffoons, easily satisfied by the occasional cheap laugh and a couple of relatively strong performances have been sold a complete lemon.  This film is not deep. There is no coherent philosophical notion of either truth or beauty evident.  A few shots of Ricky Fitts looking sullen and waving his camcorder around do not, I'm afraid, amount to a radical thesis on the nature of the world.  And nothing can get over the contrived, episodic nature of this D-grade screenplay.Someone earlier on this comments page claimed that they could not like anyone who didn't love American Beauty, for it would mean that they have no soul.  Well babe, by the same token, I will proudly say that anyone who does like this movie can't be my friend, because they clearly have no brain. Look closer everyone, I implore you.

Without any doubt. Great settings (it makes you wanna move to Italy right away) and a great story. The movie has its own relaxing pace without becoming boring or too slow. All characters are a bit dubious (especially their sexuality). The entire movie is cast by a strange kind of tension or call it suspense. The Hitchcockian script has a few lacks but the beautiful scenery and character-development makes up for that. Okay to mention one why does Cate Blanchett show up everytime Tom Ripley moves to another town (Rome, Venice) and boat? That's a bit too coincidental.But as I said that doesn't harm the joyful experience of watching and being dragged through this movie.Matt Damon is perfect and I am still astonished he didn't get an Oscar nomination. His acting is so excruciatingly smooth and although his character is set to take over Dickie's (Jude Law's part) life you cannot blame him for asking for at least some sympathy. Gwyneth is graceful as always but her part is pretty regular and quite flat.

I don't know if he'll win the Oscar (which after all is mostly about studio politics), but his is one of the best performances I have seen in the last years. A few small sillinesses of the movie (such as Lester spitting his beer when he hears that Angela is going to spend the night in his house, or the Marine watching old Reagan movies) are not bad enough to spoil the general effect.

The actors did what all actors should do in a successful motion picture, or stage play, and that is submit their own egos to the needs of the production.  Matt Damon especially surprised me with his total devotion to the part of Ripley.  Jude Law, once again, proved his talents as an actor by becoming Dickie Greenleaf.  Paltrow and Blanchett also totally believed in whom they were playing and brought that to the screen.

Actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy.  Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer) are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been.  He is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and an explosive hair trigger temper.  She is pragmatic, a compulsive perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control. She takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight.  They both blame each other for their disappointments.  The pattern is clear.  He doesn't meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening.  She then throws up every mistake he's ever made and every fault he's ever had.  This goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits.  Like moths to a flame, they keep returning for another scorching.  This film is thought provoking in that it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society.  The problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them together.In watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, Rob Reiner and writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson discuss how the story evolved.  As it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital problems.  So the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director.As filmmaking, it was terrific.  Rob Reiner weaves the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship.  The film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character.  It took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her.  Bruce Willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up.  Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style.Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship.  He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.The problem is the story.  Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face.  But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis.  It is really The War of The Roses lite only it takes itself too seriously.  No one I know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks, no less 15 years.  The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while.  It is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant.  The whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you don't go home feeling like you've had a nice evening.So, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film.  I gave this film a 6\/10.

There are no humans in this movie, and yet not a single shot was achieved through stop-motion photography or pre-programmed animatronics.  Obviously, it also uses no CGI.  I do wish more filmmakers would realize the inherent strengths of puppetry over CGI; it's really no more expensive when you consider that you won't have to spend time worrying about lighting your virtual actor and your real actors the same way, nor will you have the lengthy post-production a CGI character requires.The Dark Crystal is a story about a gelfling (a small, elfin humanoid) named Jen.  He has been raised by the large, ponderous Mystics who adopted him when his clan was destroyed by the Garthim (giant beetles who work for the cruel Skeksis).  He believes that he is the only gelfling left alive, although he later meets a female named Kira who also believed she was the last, having been adopted and raised by Podlings (fun-loving potato-like people).  The two embark on a quest to save their world from the cruel Skeksis, who will become all powerful if they are allowed to take the power of the Great Conjunction (this world has three suns) as focused through the Dark Crystal.You see, a thousand years ago, this world was green and good, until the wise and powerful urSkeks who ruled the world decided to use the coming Great Conjunction (whose power would be focused through the Crystal) to burn all the evil out of themselves.  It worked better than they had expected, and split them into two selves the gentle Mystics and the cruel Skeksis. The Skeksis immediately threw the Mystics out of their castle, then, in a rage, one of them took a swing at the Crystal, hitting it so hard a shard flew out of it, darkening the Crystal.  A gelfling prophet then had a vision which said that the next time a Great Conjunction came around, a gelfling would return the shard to the Dark Crystal, healing it and preventing the Skeksis from getting the power needed to make themselves immortal, which would presumably destroy the Mystics as well.  (They're long-lived, but definitely not immortal.)  To prevent this, the Skeksis embarked on a campaign to eradicate all the gelflings.  They missed two Jen and Kira. It is their job now to make sure the Prophecy comes true -- at any cost.There are no humans in this movie, although occasionally midgets and dwarves wore gelfling or Aughra costumes to portray the characters doing things a puppet could not do (like jumping through a window or falling down a hill). By far the most expressive of all the characters is the Chamberlain (Skek Sil) played by the one-and-only Frank Oz.  He sneers, he smiles, he simpers, he whimpers, his eyes go wild with terror, he hisses, he shrieks...and it's all completely believeable.  The Mystics, portrayed by dancers and mimes, do their parts in incredibly difficult postures (squatting with one arm outstretched to operate the head) and yet manage to move with a ponderous grace that clearly communicates great age and great wisdom.  Fizgig is perfect -- a little doglike furball with a truly enormous mouth for his size.  Frank Oz once described one of his characters, Aughra, as spectacularily ugly, and such she is -- and it's beautiful.  She's a unique character, and seems to be the only one of her species on this planet.  She also provides a nice counterpoint to the Scientist (a Skeksis) -- he represents the dark, exploitative side of science, while she represents the pure thirst for knowledge.  Interestingly, she ends up imprisioned by the Scientist at one point, which I see as symbolic of how the quest for knowledge becomes so often imprisoned to favor the quick return of producing a nice commercial product (in the Scientist's case, he turns the Podlings into mindless slave workers and also produces Essence, a liquid which is extracted from living creatures and which is a powerful -- if temporary -- restorative).All these creatures are beautiful.  There are the occasional bluescreen problems, but for the most part the characters were clearly meant to live without the aid of additional special effects.  Thousands of unique creatures flit about the dense forest where Kira lives.  Rat-like creatures eat the table scraps tossed by the Skeksis.  Strange organisms cross the line between plant and animal, with moving plants and stationary animals. And above all this are the rich cultural worlds of the Mystics, the Skeksis, the Podlings, Aughra, and even the virtually extinct Gelflings, who have left behind extensive ruins near the Podling village.  This is a world that sucks you in, living and breathing all around you.  And now that it's available on DVD, I have seen it on widescreen for the first time -- and it's even more spectacular than I ever knew.  It's not mere special effects. To borrow a line from another film, it's a kind of magic.  Really.  As Jim Henson once said of puppetry, it's as close to real magic as you ever get.

There are no humans in this movie, and yet not a single shot was achieved through stop-motion photography or pre-programmed animatronics.  Obviously, it also uses no CGI.  I do wish more filmmakers would realize the inherent strengths of puppetry over CGI; it's really no more expensive when you consider that you won't have to spend time worrying about lighting your virtual actor and your real actors the same way, nor will you have the lengthy post-production a CGI character requires.The Dark Crystal is a story about a gelfling (a small, elfin humanoid) named Jen.  He has been raised by the large, ponderous Mystics who adopted him when his clan was destroyed by the Garthim (giant beetles who work for the cruel Skeksis).  He believes that he is the only gelfling left alive, although he later meets a female named Kira who also believed she was the last, having been adopted and raised by Podlings (fun-loving potato-like people).  The two embark on a quest to save their world from the cruel Skeksis, who will become all powerful if they are allowed to take the power of the Great Conjunction (this world has three suns) as focused through the Dark Crystal.You see, a thousand years ago, this world was green and good, until the wise and powerful urSkeks who ruled the world decided to use the coming Great Conjunction (whose power would be focused through the Crystal) to burn all the evil out of themselves.  It worked better than they had expected, and split them into two selves the gentle Mystics and the cruel Skeksis. The Skeksis immediately threw the Mystics out of their castle, then, in a rage, one of them took a swing at the Crystal, hitting it so hard a shard flew out of it, darkening the Crystal.  A gelfling prophet then had a vision which said that the next time a Great Conjunction came around, a gelfling would return the shard to the Dark Crystal, healing it and preventing the Skeksis from getting the power needed to make themselves immortal, which would presumably destroy the Mystics as well.
