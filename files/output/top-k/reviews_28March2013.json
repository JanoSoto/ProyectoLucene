A Dinosaur's Story simply on its own terms. It's a children's movie that works for nobody but little, little children. Even when they're five, by showing them this movie you could be pushing it. I've stood by my realization and claim that one of the contributing factors to a child's growth, development, and success is their imagination and experience to things other than what they're used to. What you find in this film could easily be substituted by a more ideal episode of PBS's Dragon Tales.The selling point (which also serves as the most surprising name on the project) is executive producer Steven Spielberg, who of course made the other dinosaur movie released in 1993 that deserves no introduction. It's baffling to the mind to think that Spielberg, whose dinosaur epic is now the quintessential motion picture about the ferocious beasts, would want his name stamped all over a kiddie flick with minimal heart and imagination. A better investment would've been to bet on Disney, whose pictures were sweeping up money at the box office like disposed trash. Hell, if he would've waited a few years, Pixar would've been on its way. And then Dreamworks.But what's done is done, and now we have a mediocre children's film on our hands, bearing the name of one of cinema's finest men. Our story revolves around an orange Tyrannosaurus Rex named Rex (voiced by John Goodman) and his dinosaur friends, who run into Louie (Joe Shea) when they are transported in time to present day New York City. Louie is a young boy, who is running away from home to join the circus and feels lonely and helpless in the world as both his parents have neglected him. He then meets Cecilia (voiced by Yeardley Smith - who voices Lisa Simpson on The Simpsons - explaining why her voice sounds like a blend of Lisa's and Cindy Brady's), another neglected soul, leaving Louie with a source of companionship and empathy. That's all well and good, until an evil circus owner (Martin Short) reveals his plans to kidnap the kids, leaving the dinosaurs as their only source of rescue.The plot alone makes this a very strange movie. Certainly not frightening to its target audience, but weird it definitely is, consistently giving us goofy situations, a laughable villain, and a repetitive strain of events before the ends credits roll. There's also a rather bleak color drawing style to the film that had me craving the likes of that polished, fluent Disney style. Certain images (like the character's themselves) seem to be over-colored, the color-palette itself is never consistent, and the cityscapes seem as lifeless as the dinosaurs themselves.And the final point of criticism is the length of the picture, further cementing the fact that We're Back! is as unsubstantial as it is. It credits itself at seventy-two minutes, when in reality, minus the credits (which are slowed down meticulously to try and pass for feature length) it's roughly sixty-five minutes, even making this an inconceivable TV special. The fact that thousands of parents had to nestle in their theater seats for a drab sixty-five minute affair makes me upset in ways just as inconceivable.We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story isn't detrimental to the intelligence of your children the way some franchise are, put it's not particularly vital either. It's a decidedly random film, featuring one modestly-catchy but forgettable song, repetitive events, lame characters, an archetypal villain, and blatantly obvious voice-acting.

The film was made with a budget of $63 million but grossed just a little over $100 million in it's initial theatrical run. Critics were pretty split on the film with the positive reviews being extremely positive and the negative reviews being extremely negative (which is always the sign of a great movie in my opinion). It was one of the most talked about and controversial films released in 1999 and was heavily criticized for it's violence and (what was seen as) immoral content. The movie went on to be a huge hit on DVD, making it's studio a big profit, and quickly developed a cult following. As it's grown immensely in viewer popularity, since it's release, critics have also changed their tune as well (which is often the case). Many now cite it as a great, ground breaking film and most of it's negative criticisms have all but disappeared. The film is based on the 1996 novel, of the same name, by Chuck Palahniuk. It was adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. It tells the story of an unnamed 'everyman' (Norton, who also narrates the film) who works for a traveling automobile company and hates his job. Suffering from depression and severe insomnia he attends several different support groups as a form of relief (pretending to have different problems for each one). He meets a woman, named Marla Singer (Carter), at one who appears to be pulling the same scam. He also meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), on a flight, and he forms a bizarre relationship with him as well. Durden and our narrator turn to fighting one another at a bar one night as a form of therapy and this later develops into a 'fight club' which attracts a lot of other men with similar problems. 'FIGHT CLUB' was named the 10th greatest movie of all time by Empire magazine readers (in 2008) and also currently claims that same ranking on IMDb's Top 250 movies (voted on by IMDb users). That's about where I'd place it on my 'all time greatest films' list. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors and I'd say it's arguably his best movie (although for me 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' would be a tough rival). I really liked it when I first saw it in 1999 but I actually, initially, liked a few other films even better that year (like 'DOGMA', 'THE SIXTH SENSE' and 'AMERICAN BEAUTY') but with each viewing I've come to like it even more and I'd now say it's probably my favorite movie of 1999 (as well as one of my top ten favorite films of all time). Anyone who's seen it knows how powerful it is but it holds many different qualities and meanings for each viewer. Without going into the twist and all the different layers to the plot and characters here I'll just say it's a movie that really speaks to me. It did when I first saw it in 1999 and it does even more now.

Carpenter only added unnecessary, offensive gore to an already great story. The effects on the eyes were good & the extended gov't involvement with more focus on science than paranoia was also a refreshing addition as was the stillborn specimen (but that should have included more details on the lab findings than we got.) The priest character was OK until he became a suicidal gun nut which was ridiculous on too many levels to list. The boiling pot, self evisceration, barbecue, consumption by inferno & walking tall gun battle were just intolerable gore which added nothing to the movie.The original movie only had the children harming someone who had caused them harm or perceived as intended. This movie had them killing the innocent for no reason. That seriously degraded the story. The original contained unjustifiable gov't paranoia over acts of self-defense. By the killing of innocents such as the mothers suicides which made no sense whatsoever, it justified the paranoia to kill the children. The original idea was the children were unfairly judged because they were different & had unique abilities; acting only in self defense.I did like the survival ending on the new version. That could make an excellent sequel.It is a mistake to remake popular movies like this film, The Omen & Stepford Wives which were already great to begin with.

Only an idiot would take plot change advice from disgruntled complainers instead of fans.It would be OK to colorize BW films and beef up the special effects & sound improvements on the originals for redistribution as was done for Star Wars & Star Trek. Sequels of great cliffhanger films would be much better ideas to pursue if done in the spirit of the original story. But it is a bad idea to redo an original classic verbatim without offering much more to the story. The desire to see more details & missing parts of the stories is what makes deleted scenes so popular with the public. They don't like to be left hanging in the dark.

Perhaps he should do something original for a change rather than riding on the coat tails of someone else's ideas & efforts.Don't listen to the opinions of people who get off on gore. They are only happy with chainsaw, saw & serial hacking butcher type Jason films with no appreciation for thrilling & innovative story lines.This classic, one of a kind story has captivated audiences for over 50 years since it was first released. So even a glory stealer like Carpenter can't do too much damage to ruin it. So forget Carpenter. The actors did a good job portraying their roles despite his direction.This new version of the movie is still based on the original classic so it is still enjoyable to watch if you use the fast forward to elude the gore scenes.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"28 March 2013","score":"","review":" This movie is still enjoyable to watch despite Carpenter.In fact, Carpenter had no business entitling this movie as his own since it was not his story or his screenplay in the first place. That was pure, unearned ego on his part as he tries to make his fame by latching onto the brilliant efforts of the original films & writers. Carpenter only added unnecessary, offensive gore to an already great story. The effects on the eyes were good & the extended gov't involvement with more focus on science than paranoia was also a refreshing addition as was the stillborn specimen (but that should have included more details on the lab findings than we got.) The priest character was OK until he became a suicidal gun nut which was ridiculous on too many levels to list. The boiling pot, self evisceration, barbecue, consumption by inferno & walking tall gun battle were just intolerable gore which added nothing to the movie.The original movie only had the children harming someone who had caused them harm or perceived as intended. This movie had them killing the innocent for no reason. That seriously degraded the story. The original contained unjustifiable gov't paranoia over acts of self-defense. By the killing of innocents such as the mothers suicides which made no sense whatsoever, it justified the paranoia to kill the children. The original idea was the children were unfairly judged because they were different & had unique abilities; acting only in self defense.I did like the survival ending on the new version. That could make an excellent sequel.It is a mistake to remake popular movies like this film, The Omen & Stepford Wives which were already great to begin with. (& never ridicule a cult classic such as was done with Stepford). Only an idiot would take plot change advice from disgruntled complainers instead of fans.It would be OK to colorize BW films and beef up the special effects & sound improvements on the originals for redistribution as was done for Star Wars & Star Trek. Sequels of great cliffhanger films would be much better ideas to pursue if done in the spirit of the original story. But it is a bad idea to redo an original classic verbatim without offering much more to the story. The desire to see more details & missing parts of the stories is what makes deleted scenes so popular with the public. They don't like to be left hanging in the dark. Hence, the need for a sequel on such movies. Not a remake of the same hanging, unanswered questions which offers nothing extra to fans.It would be better to make follow up sequels on these popular stories rather than trying to duplicate the original verbatim with a completely different cast. There's also nothing worse than an actor doing a popular film remake, who refuses to watch the original or a director who makes changes simply to imprint their ego onto it like a dog marking a hydrant.We might like to see what happens if the children survived & learn the source of their origins; as well as endings where they are successful in survival & goals as well as exceptions to their demeanor like David with multi-layered personalities.Classic films should not be used as a venue for some egomaniacal director to headline his name on the title of a movie he didn't write as Carpenter has been repeatedly guilty of doing.

It's a place he considers as dull on earth, the festivities pointless and beneath the broadcasting talent he feels he has. The plan is to get the broadcast done and get out of Punxsutawney as quick as possible.

Where the focus was once on people, the focus is now on the mashing up of people; where once it was interesting, it has, by the point of Rocky IV, become extremely uninteresting. One of the easiest pieces of criticism in the world is to cite 1976's Rocky as better than most of its sequels, but there was a film about people wandering around; talking; falling in love and ambling through unremitting times. Now, we witness all that shelved for aggressive caricatures and crass causality which underpin a really unbalanced air of smug nationalism. Throw in a tacked on message at the very end, in spite of all that precedes it, about how sport brings everyone together (regardless of nationality, political belief or otherwise) anyway and you have a badly judged; poorly thought through mess of a sports film that does few people many favours.Sylvester Stallone is the eponymous Rocky Balboa, a man with countless opponents already vanquished and a heavy number of victories already under his belt. As is the case with the beginnings of most of these sequels, we're introduced to Rocky as a man living the ideal life amidst the big-time; he's got the latest sports cars, a fantastic domestic set up, complete with wife and kid, and is the world champion again. He even finds room to encompass into his world the latest in modernity in the form of a curious, automated robot butler such is the depth of his personal wealth. Where time has passed; infants have grown and money expanded, so too have the years on Balboa &#x96; careers in boxing do not last long, and Rocky has been around the block enough times to lose big bouts; come back and win rematches, before further succumbing only to successfully garner the fame once again. This fuss arrives when a Russian amateur named Ivan Drago (Lundgren) arrives in The States to test themselves against what the Americans have to offer. Drago is a quiet, seemingly shy, boxer who's well built and shepherded around by his entourage, of whom appear just as friendly as they do ignorant of their surroundings and American's boxing depth. Apollo Creed, one time foe turned mutual accomplice out of the bouts and respect Rocky and he have for one another, is around, but is long past fighting in spite of still possessing the itch to do so. With Drago's arrival, and Creed's eagerness, the pair match up in a fight Creed reckons will be easier than everyone thinks given this young opponent is foreign; not professional and just generally a bit of alien to things. Creed's gaze, as he watches Drago on the television on the evening's news, besots him with the idea of getting back into the ring &#x96; his observation of Drago as this young, unknown amateur seemingly ripe for the taking carries with it an odd dynamic of homoeroticism at the thought of once again implementing power upon someone inferior to him.Disaster strikes when, under dramatic circumstances, the Soviet boxer upsets all odds and wins the fight killing our Creed in the process; an instance that hits Rocky hard and throws his domestic bliss into turmoil when he's determined to get back in there and take the fight to Drago in honour of Creed. Overlying the drama is the tension born out of the fact Balboa and Creed were always at similar stages in their boxing career, and a mere exhibition fight against an eccentric wrestler earlier was enough of a challenge in itself. Thus, Rocky's own proposed idea of going up against this now indomitable force from the East is fraught with madness and danger, and is very much the plan of action wife Adrian (Shire) goes against. Regardless, Balboa gets it into his head he must for sake of retribution on account of his dear friend Creed while certain others get it into their heads that Rocky must win on account of resorting national pride. So much for him being the Italian Stallion.The bad news is that a great deal of it is nonsense and the film on the whole is just a bit rubbish. The Russians are cartoonish and underdeveloped; their inclusion, in a political and propagandist sense, clumsy and ill-judged; the idea to change the nationality of the opponent this time around sussed by the dissatisfied audience fairly quickly in that it's essentially a ploy to disguise the fact you're watching the same sequel a third time. Very little works, although I quite liked Brigitte Nielsen's inclusion as this prim, photogenic dominatrix-type who does all of Drago's talking for him at the press conferences as he obediently sits beside her.

If you like the film after watching it, I will consider you an admirable one. Harmony Korine's Julien Donkey-Boy is a difficult film to endure for ninety-nine minutes; a complex and crippling one. It twists your emotions, saddens the soul, and repulses every preconceived notion, or lack thereof, you had entering the film in the first place.Korine's first picture in 1997 was called Gummo, and it stands as one of the most lurid, controversial pictures of the nineties decade. The film utilized a non-linear narrative, stringing scenes together with little continuity and providing an unblinking look at a scummy town in Ohio that was ravaged by a tornado and never fully recovered. It was a true cinematic wonder, and still remains that way in 2013. Korine followed Gummo up with Julien Donkey-Boy, a film done in the style of Dogme 95, a filmmaking movement that focused on the naturalism of dialog, story, and plot-progression by using hand-held cameras, source sound, lighting, and props. It also prohibited that directors be credited from their work, so Harmony Korine isn't even known as the official director of this film.The plot Julien (Ewen Bremner) is a young, schizophrenic man who lives in his home with his extremely dysfunctional family, consisting of his instigating father (the great German director Werner Herzog), his passive brother Chris (Evan Neumann), and his sister Pearl (Chloë Sevigny), who is carrying Julien's child. We see the world through Julien's eyes, as he rarely leaves the screen for more than a minute. We see the unrelenting madness that unfolds in his home, and sometimes, we become submerged so deeply into Julien's baffling, schizophrenic mind that the film begins to become incoherent and blurry. When I say blurry, I mean that quite literally, as the film was shot on a DV tape, converted to 16mm (already a sketchy transfer), and finally blown up to 35mm, giving the film an extremely grainy and visually washed-out look.There's something to be said about Ewen Bremner, who is completely terrific here in a beyond difficult role. Bremner was made famous by his role in Trainspotting, and here, he embodies a character unlike anything else currently present in his filmography. This is the kind of role veteran actors fear taking on, and this is the kind of the story veteran directors neuter or make easier to digest for the public. Not Korine; every project he has done thus far has been exercised to almost complete full-force. He's an uncompromising auteur, putting character before plot and impact before publicity to ensure long-term memorability. He's a requirement for cinema.When I say uncompromising, take for example the scene where Pearl falls on the ice-rink, with lethal consequences to someone close to her. This scene is polarizing and frightening all the more. It left me with a boiling feeling of sadness, and had such an impact on me that it never left my thoughts for the remainder of the day. Take another scene, for example, when we see how Julien's father shamelessly bullies him by soaking him with the hose and demanding that he don't shiver. Or even the scene where Julien pretends he's God and Adolf Hitler simultaneously.I can compare this to Gummo in the regard of shock, but Julien Donkey-Boy is showing something a tiny bit more distant from reality. To elaborate, Gummo is showing a culture and a town that very well could be real, but it isn't directly based off of any specific part of the world. Yet the problems dealt with in that film since as loss of innocence, vandalism, animal abuse, rape, etc are apparent in our society. Schizophrenia is a mental-disease with effects like those portrayed in the film, and therefore, the reality is more distorted as we are seeing it from the title character's perspective. Both pictures are viscerally gripping for the opposite reason; one shows a toxic reality, while the one merges toxic reality with an even more hypnotic and smothering one.Julien Donkey-Boy is a hard film to get through, and at one-hundred minutes, can be occasionally maddening. We're being bombarded with so much repulsion and depravity that it becomes a bit of an overload. With that said, the overall disjointedness and the grainy aesthetic can be a bit much, too. But all those reasons are the same reason that I liked the film so much. Korine is a force of nature, one who seems to often rebel, test, and manipulate the rules of cinema to fit his own tendencies, regardless of how explicit or inane they may be. I wouldn't have him, or this film, any other way the more I think about it.Starring Ewen Bremner, Chloë Sevigny, Werner Herzog, and Evan Neumann. Directed by Harmony Korine.

From the movies, to the video games, to just about anything. However I stopped watching them when I was 10 or 11 (maybe because I was sick of them).

This film was obviously very important because it brought to life the struggles of the Midwestern people during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, which may only ever have been depicted in books or literature in times to date. The film is masterfully made. This film is in black and white but this does not take away from the experience, it actually adds to the theme by using dark shadings to symbolize the struggles and poverty and desperation. The actors do their part well, and make the audience connect with and feel the struggles they went through at the time. Many people know about the history and hardships of the people who lived in the big cities and were directly affected by the stock market crash, but what is less known, is the plight of the farmers who were wiped off their land by the severe drought that also took place during the Depression era. This movie does justice in bringing to life the struggles thousands of people faced. Through all the endeavors, one major quote from the movie sums up the feelings of many Americans at the time.We'll go on forever because we're the people.

Elmer Gantry, directed by Richard Brooks, is one of his best.Set in the early 1920s, the film stars Lancaster as Elmer Gantry, a fast talking charlatan and con man who uses his seductive tongue to weasel his way into the church of Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons), a Christian fundamentalist and female evangelist. Together the duo travel from town to town, setting up massive revival tents and seducing thousands upon thousands of believers.At its best, Elmer Gantry draws parallels between the words of business, entertainment and organised religion. In Brooks' hands, the church's foot-soldiers are more hucksters and crafty salesmen than men and women of God. They're selling a product, tailoring their pitches and pep talks to the wants and needs of the people, and even actively manufacturing desires, phobias and neuroses. Lancaster's character is himself a creepy sales machine who always knows exactly which screws to turn. His product? Himself. Ego-maniacal and craving attention, Gantry will do anything to be at the head of a pulpit.Burt Lancaster has often been accused of overacting. His character in Elmer Gantry is admittedly bombastic and exuberant, but fittingly so. Like an advertising executive on caffene, Gantry is a man of wild gestures and big promises, though there is subtlety and truth in the way Lancaster sculpts Gantry's smiles and the edges of Gantry's eyes. Gantry's facial features are hard, forced and false, all an act designed to seduce. Think of him as a precursor to Paul Thomas Anderson's Daniel Plainview (based on a 1927 Upton Sinclair novel).Elmer Gantry was itself based on less than 100 pages from an ahead-of-its-time novel by Sinclair Lewis (released in 1926). But where Lewis is satirical, edgy, angry, funny and resolutely anti-Christian, Brooks' film is kinder, gentler, ambiguous and scared of offending Christian audiences. Is Brooks' Gantry a believer? It seems so, despite his motivations. Do miracles happen within the film, thereby proving the existence of Christ? Again, it seems so, though the film is ambiguous enough to also suggest the exact opposite. Lewis' stance may have been too militant, even for the supposedly progressive 1960s; just another example of how timid cinema can be.Still, as a watered-down critique of fundamentalism, and even religion in a broader sense, the film works well. It's most sympathetic character is an atheist journalist, played by the great, underrated Arthur Kennedy. Kennedy's character sees through everyone's shams, but empathises with them nevertheless. A key scene involves him writing a newspaper article which shocks readers. Gantry and Falconer are hucksters and racketeers, he writes, selling superficialities in a world in which well-meaning intentions, religion and social goods offer no resistance to vices or social evil. Kennedy's readers support him, until the fast talking Elmer Gantry once again shifts popular opinion. Rather than change people, religion tends to force man to compartmentalise, repress or engage in wanton denial.The film missteps in its final act, with a fire-and-brimstone climax and an ending which is arguably too sympathetic toward Gantry. Better to portray him as a snake. A wolf in sheep's clothing. Brooks, though, has Gantry redeemed. He's just another soldier answering God's call. The film's best scene? Gantry stepping into an African American church and singing I'm On My Way To Canaan's Land. The sequence is brilliant, Gantry's words like a threat, his tongue like the tool of Satan.8.5\/10 - Richard Brooks is not well known today, but he directed a number of very good films (think of him as another John Huston).

But back in the 1930s until at least the 1960s...well, it's a rare British film I'm impressed with. This is one of those rare British films.I watched it primarily because I wanted to see Wendy Hiller. I'm always impressed with her, although I've only seen her in films when she was much older (such as Toys In The Attic). She was a gem...and that is certainly true here. Being that I usually don't watch British films, I was not familiar with Roger Livesey, the male romantic lead. To Americans I guess he seems like an odd romantic lead, but I rather liked him once I adjusted my thinking. The other performances are (sometimes) a bit odd, but interesting. And I was particularly interested in seeing Finlay Currie as the old man. I found his fascinating as a follower of Christ in Ben-Hur, and as Cary Grant's odd friend in People Will Talk. Of course, as a Scotsman, he was probably more at home here in this movie filmed mostly in Scotland! Along with an interesting cast, I was also impressed with the dramatic scenery and vivid black and white photography...although there were a few places where the photography seemed a tad amateurish (such as one scene where vignetting is clearly evident). Both in terms of the natural photography, and in terms of the culture, this film probably gives one a better sense of what Scotland is really like...or at least was really like. Stunning and interesting. The whirlpool in the boat segment...a bit amateurish compared to today's special effects, but quite impressive for 1945. And by the way, that whirlpool really does exist in Scotland to this day.The story is not particularly unique -- girl on her way to marry a rich man living in Scotland meets a poor man and falls in love. Will she follow love or money? While the plot may be rather traditional, the characters and settings and some of the situations are unique, and that makes the film very interesting.Is it a great film? Well, in my mind it's an extraordinarily good film. But Martin Scorsese once wrote that, I reached the point of thinking there were no more masterpieces to discover, until I saw I Know Where I'm Going! Highly recommended, especially for the performance by Wendy Hiller, who -- in a review here on IMDb for another of her films -- one of our reviewers wrote, she can do no wrong! I second that opinion.

To Americans I guess he seems like an odd romantic lead, but I rather liked him once I adjusted my thinking. The other performances are (sometimes) a bit odd, but interesting. And I was particularly interested in seeing Finlay Currie as the old man. I found his fascinating as a follower of Christ in Ben-Hur, and as Cary Grant's odd friend in People Will Talk. Of course, as a Scotsman, he was probably more at home here in this movie filmed mostly in Scotland! Along with an interesting cast, I was also impressed with the dramatic scenery and vivid black and white photography...although there were a few places where the photography seemed a tad amateurish (such as one scene where vignetting is clearly evident). Both in terms of the natural photography, and in terms of the culture, this film probably gives one a better sense of what Scotland is really like...or at least was really like. Stunning and interesting. The whirlpool in the boat segment...a bit amateurish compared to today's special effects, but quite impressive for 1945. And by the way, that whirlpool really does exist in Scotland to this day.The story is not particularly unique -- girl on her way to marry a rich man living in Scotland meets a poor man and falls in love. Will she follow love or money? While the plot may be rather traditional, the characters and settings and some of the situations are unique, and that makes the film very interesting.Is it a great film? Well, in my mind it's an extraordinarily good film. But Martin Scorsese once wrote that, I reached the point of thinking there were no more masterpieces to discover, until I saw I Know Where I'm Going! Highly recommended, especially for the performance by Wendy Hiller, who -- in a review here on IMDb for another of her films -- one of our reviewers wrote, she can do no wrong! I second that opinion.

There is SO much going on, so many things easily over looked. It's easy to see why so many dislike it and\/or don't understand it. It's not so easy to see why anyone idolizes it, but I can. It contains some pretty amazing stuff. I completely agree with what one review said about saying that had I not known what year this movie was made, I would have not guessed correctly. My guess would have been along the lines of late 70's to early 80's, which alone says something about the movie. It definitely make you think as well.Negatives? Soundtrack is repetitive as hell. If anyone denies that then they're just lying. It gets annoying and takes some enjoyment out of the film. Some scenes ARE too dragged out. I'm not in any hurry when it comes to movies, but good lord. The final scenes.....whew....they will be talked about till the end of time, and for good reason. This was one of the unreasonably long scenes. It was almost torture. Maybe that's the way Kubrick meant to portray it, idk. I joked saying that the character in the movie was probably praying for death, and that the wrinkles were probably a result of unheard of boredom. The perfect word is assault. The final scene is a relentless assault, and although amazing, it's excruciating at the same time. This movie is a remarkable thing, but I'm not sold on how great of a movie it is. It just doesn't have a lot of substance. People will disagree and say I just don't understand it, but it just drags...period.

Silence. He doesn't know much about welfare policy or topics under heated debate, so when Bess asking him formally or the senator seeking his advice in a condescending manner, he didn't know what to say but cramped as a fool. Though, he believes that, You are the most beautiful woman I have ever met, and you senator, you are gonna win and become a good president.So what's about a taxi driver's life? We transport people from one spot to another and connect them with those important to them, as Marx quoted we would be an urban ghost. Painstaking, lower class, boring and working with loneliness. Passengers pay, and we are heading to any direction or anywhere appointed to us, even the hell provided you tip well. I am just a humble servant behind the wheels, not entitled to ask anything about why they choose their destination, I can't choose my own way, just a zombie obeying orders from my superior as Travis did in the Military, the difference is now he's serving another god, the customer in the back seat. He never made a choice of his own.Temptation Of SleepThis can be a monologue of a taxi driver, or such confusion applies to the modern generation. But the point of this film is that in position of a taxi driver, it is focused and amplified, he is aware and awake all the time, he silences and drives, he saw and couldn't let it go, and end up in pain and insomnia. Wheras we could fall asleep easily. Sleep helps us forget what we shouldn't keep in mind. We ignore the dark side of the society and enjoy ourselves in the production-consumption cycle, but for some upright souls that's irresponsible. Our veteran driver witnesses the dirty city, with a good will at the beginning, he had Bess, pure as an angel out of this filthy mess, and her campaign team stand for a political hope for the citizens especially for our driver, if elected this new administration may wash away all the unjust and foul on earth. Bess and her team is a piece of white paper, an utopia for our idealist, it represent an exit door for him, so once the door shut down by her refusal, he confused and became angry. Bess could not help him any more, his colleague the witch couldn't help him, so as a veteran he had to rearmed hims with weapons he no longer needed, yes the guns, he thought he would never touch them in a civil society since he discharged from the Marine, so he declined other fellow driver's suggestion and insist that he didn't need one to protect himself, but now he believed he's in need of one to reestablish order and justice. If the politicians couldn't wash away the scum off the street, then he should replace them or even perish them.A Return To GreatnessSo he walked out of his taxi and reenter the society to interfere. He met the underage prostitute and mentioned that he wanted to take actions. His ultimate goal, probably A return to greatness? as is the propaganda poster issued by Candidate Goodwin, what a coincidence! Goodwin means Good wins and defeats the evil on earth, in this campaign it indicates Travis on Goodwin's side against Bess and her senator candidate. Yes Travis knows little about politics and politicians like the senator were just making use of the ignorance of the public for their own profit, votes and power. Travis saw through this and was disappointed by it, so his political utopia and romantic illusion broke at the same time, he couldn't count on other's mercy to achieve Good, if he still expect A return to greatness, he's all alone.Unfortunately return to greatness is an unseasonable slogan, far less popular than We are the people with WE underlined. The masses don't care greatness, they are obsessed with mediocre stuff, free choice and cheaper goods.

It turned out Iris was rather satisfied with her life as a prostitute, she didn't feel the need to be saved by anyone, it's her independent decision as a child, not an adult yet though, would you please mind your own business, Mr Driver?It's also the democracy dilemma.

Modernization has blurred the distinction between good and bad, the driver wanted to restore the great order, he failed, he would be called a dictator if he force someone else in the name of their good, wouldn't he?
