We're so into them that we can't help but imagine or think of what it might be like if we ever had the opportunity to go on an adventure with the characters or even just to talk with them, how they would react to us and likewise.This is one of my favorite films of all time, being a huge fan of the sci-fi genre it really felt like a dream come true making a sci-fi comedy that homages Star Trek which is cool since that's one of my favorite TV shows, but also some of the sci-fi genre in general.It's kinda like with the movie Scream where it's pretty much a movie within a movie format. Thought for that film it was for the slasher horror genre, this film it's for Star Trek and any other space opera you can think of. Personally I thought this was a brilliant idea and it's almost a wishfulfilment dream for any Star Trek or sci-fi fan. With that notion there could of been a film about the cast of the sci-fi TV series Firefly being taken up into space to fight the alien's version of The Alience, that would be awesome.The effects are great made from Stan Winston's company which is cool. From the aliens to the design of the ships. There is some CGI which actually turns out to be good. I really like the music, mainly the theme song which is one of my favorite theme songs, it really feels like it can be a theme song for a real sci-fi TV series.However what really gives this sci-fi comedy speed and power is in the characters and their dialog. The verbal humor as well as in jokes on some of the clich√©s,elements, even inconsistencies in sci-fi or even certain homage jokes that are all there, there are so many of them that it would take more than one watch to find them all.This film just has such an amazing ensemble, all of them just really play off and go well with each other. It almost feels like they all could of been in a sci-fi TV series together which is why they all work. I really love seeing how each of them react to the adventure it's sort of like how any of us might. Alexander played well by one of my favorite actors Alen Rickman is just fantastic, this is probably my favorite role from him. He is just so dryly hilarious at playing a former Shakespearian thespian whom feels he's made the biggest mistake of his life, taking on the role of playing an alien to be in the visual medium. It's just hilarious how sour he acts, from complain about his acting career to his bruised ego how his character is always considered second best.Kwan played well by Tony Shaloeb. This is my second favorite role from him, he is also just dryly hilarious as a character and actor that practically isn't very useful. I really like how laid back and burnt out he's is which makes him almost act and sound like a stoner, it sort of makes sense since he's played a role where he's practically useless which is why it seems like when he delivers certain news he half assing it.But my favorite character and one of my favorite actors is Guy played by Sam Rockwell. He is just fraking hilarious from the beginning feeling psyched that he even got lucky enough to play a bit role from the show. But also he is constantly scared and paranoid throughout most of the adventure and most of his fear is justified. I also like the fact that he's a sci-fi fan and knows most of the clich√©s and principles that happen. It's funny how we're constantly reminded he played a red shirt character which in Star Trek is always a no name character that dies, hence the name of this character. My favorite is seeing what he says as he is looking at the radar screen, it's comic gold.But I also love that this film has heart as well, it has an ongoing them about believing in yourself. Each of these actors have one thing in common they all stopped believing in themselves. Due to what happened with the show and their acting careers each suffering from typecast syndrome and having nothing but the fame of the show and conventions to keep them going, their sense of self worth has diminished.What great in this film is that thorough this journey each of the actors go though an amazing transformation where at first their just acting out the characters their meant to play but then actually they become those characters as their the one's that have to save the Galaxy.And also about the importance of fandom and how it truly fuels belief. From what the Thermian aliens created all because they were inspired by the idea the show has given them. To even keeping the idea of a franchise alive by supporting it though conventions, merchandise, fan\/licensed fiction, just anything much as it is with our shows or movies we support. Though this is did lead to something in the end which proves how much belief in something can make the biggest difference.Galexy Quest is an journey worth taking.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"2 May 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Sci-Fi has always been my favorite genre since childhood, we've all had those favorite TV shows we've seen Star Trek, Firefly, and my personal favorite Doctor Who.

I don't like being scared, and avoid horror films religiously (pun unintended). I am scared of my own shadow. So the proper course of action when told I had to do a presentation on something, of any medium, that showed tropes of the American Gothic, was to go ahead and do it on what's considered by many as the scariest film of all time.My boyfriend (who will be addressed always as Himself), was delighted at the prospect of watching me squirm through a horror film. So we watched it on Valentine's Day. How romantic.The Exorcist is based off the best selling novel of the same name, by William Peter Blatty. Blatty also wrote the screenplay and won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his efforts. It tells the story of a little girl named Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), who appears to be possessed by some malevolent demon. Her mother, actress Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is beside herself with worry, and, at the advice of medical professionals, goes to a trouble priest named Damien Karras (Jason Miller), to request an exorcism.The film is frightening, but not conventionally. The only jumpscare is that of the demon's face for a split second. No, this film is psychologically chilling. Yes, chilling. It effects you, deep down. One sees themselves within the demon, as the little girl struggling to cope. We identify with Karras, who is on the fence about his faith.

Two years after his success with his debut film Reservoir Dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this 1994 black comedy Pulp Fiction. This film boasts a strong ensemble cast of actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keital, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Maria De Medeiros, and Eric Stoltz. Told in a nonlinear prospective, the plot follows the separate lives of their characters and how their lives untold in events that lead to their fate. The movie mixes elements of violence, humor, and satire, creating one of the most memorable and quotable movies of all time.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play two mobsters, who acquire a briefcase containing a secret item, and are assigned to protect it for their boss Marcellus Wallace (played by Ving Rhames) while facing troubles along the way. Travolta and Jackson put on some mesmerizing performances and showed incredible chemistry between each other. These two were probably the best characters of the whole film. Bruce Willis plays a professional boxer, who is caught up in a kidnapping plot while obtaining a watch from his father. Uma Therman plays the wife of Marcellus Wallace, who is invited on a date with John Travolta's character, only to face a serious dilemma involving heroin. This part includes one of the most shocking scenes where John Travolta makes an unprofessional attempt to save her condition.

Travolta and Jackson put on some mesmerizing performances and showed incredible chemistry between each other. These two were probably the best characters of the whole film.

I remember asking my dad, so these are the bad guys? His response was along the lines of well, they may be stealing something but they're still the good guys. I still liked the movie as a kid, but this concept confused me a little bit. Many years later, it is still a delightful B movie to watch.It is pretty awesome that they have so many people on their team to create an ensemble cast, but some of them get barely any screen time when I would want to see an equal balance of the cast. For example, all we know about the little acrobat is that he is really good at what he does since he doesn't speak much English, besides dropping the second use of f*** in the movie. We also don't delve too deep into the back story of certain characters, such as the oldest member on the team. We know all of these guys either have a connection to Ocean or Pitt's character or that they are found, and for this senior citizen we know he has a connection to Pitt's character and that is about it.The funniest bits of the film come from the twins, one of whom is played by Casey Affleck, who really gets how annoying his character is supposed to be. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Affleck's character's toy car is going faster than his brother's monster truck just to get destroyed by his brother.Getting back to the point of the movie, the heist seems to go way too smoothly, which is meant to satisfy the viewers I guess, but a great film requires conflict - no matter if it is external or internal - but this film's struggle seems mainly to be internal struggles within Ocean and his enemy played by Andy Garcia. One is trying to win his ex- wife back, and the other is dying inside as his money is getting stolen. As Brad Pitt's character points out, it is really selfish of Ocean to concoct this plan with some motivation to win Tess back. Romance makes a good subplot in movies - in fact a lot of producers want at least some type of romance in their movies - and while it holds up and illustrates that Ocean is a better man than Garcia's character, but it seems to stray from the focus on the rest of the team.While watching this my friends were pointing out how gadgets in this movie go unexplained, especially for a film released in 2001 where this type of technology wasn't even in many James Bond films. Each step of the plan seems to go almost too well, with the exception that they almost blow the acrobat away.This is an enjoyable heist film that makes us feel for Ocean, but I wish there was more connection to the other characters in the film.

Their names then appear with the rush of a bold statement; in 1946, they were the titles of stars, of top- drawer actors. In 2015, they're godly, legendary, untouchable. As the shadowed bodies, the gigantic names, and the dangling cigarettes of the leads appear before the title of the movie itself, a tone is already established. The Big Sleep will be a film in which Bogie and Bacall prefer slippery chats over liquor and smoke to breathy romance; it will be a film in which style, wit, and danger come first and intelligibility follows second.The Big Sleep is perhaps the film noir, the quintessential Bogart and Bacall pairing, the movie that sidestepped the sunniness of all those Technicolor, 1940s morale boosters in trade of something almost unhinged in its cool. It was the film that initially showed me just how beguiling actors could be, how captivating pure cinema could be, how bewitching dialogue could be. I've seen The Big Sleep twenty times or so (who's counting?), but each viewing brings some new discovery unnoticed by the previous undertaking. My last was an attempt to introduce my sister to its enticing world. This time around, some months later, I find myself re-enchanted by the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, more appreciative of the silky screenplay. Each viewing changes &#x97; some are out of a nostalgic need, some are out of a desire to consume flawless filmmaking &#x97; but one thing always remains the same no film has ever matched The Big Sleep's unflagging ability to excite.This is an amazing accomplishment for a film that doesn't make any sense &#x97; famously, the author of the novel, the incomparable Raymond Chandler, had a hard time deciding if a major character had been killed or had committed suicide &#x97; but one doesn't worry about plot twists or big payoffs here. We become so wrapped up in the stunning rapport between the leads (to be married after completion) and the quick (but razor sharp) dialogue that it's easy to forget that films normally, you know, make sense. It's not a case of style over substance but rather style with substance that gives us many memorable moments that just so happen to lead to nowhere. But those moments.It's the story of a private detective, Phillip Marlowe (Bogart), and a case given to him by the poisonously wealthy General Sternwood (Charles Waldron). It seems that one of Sternwood's wild daughters, Carmen (Martha Vickers), has put herself in the middle of a blackmailing scheme, and the girl, thumb-sucking and Lolita-esque, is too na√Øve to get herself out of the racket. Marlowe, sardonic and clever, is the perfect man for the job &#x97; but the case, as it turns out, is much more complicated than it appears to be. It also, unfortunately, involves a murdered pornographer (Theodore von Eltz), a secretive gambling-house proprietor (John Ridgely), Sternwood's other daughter, Vivian (Bacall), who Marlowe is attracted to, and more shady figures.As Marlowe wanders around in this muddled labyrinth of captivation, it's difficult to keep up with his thoughtful antics; but it isn't hard to find ourselves smitten with the hard-boiled world Howard Hawks and his congregation of screenwriters (including William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman) concoct for us. Enhanced by Max Steiner's fierce score, interludes don't slow things down but rather keep the swiftness of everything intact; scenes, in the meantime, are brimming with such fantastic exchanges that it's difficult not to laugh along with the virtuosic lines the actors challenge each other with.And if the actors aren't part of the atmosphere, then they're sticking out of it, making it. Whereas Bacall stole scenes from Bogart in 1944's To Have and Have Not, her career defining debut, in The Big Sleep they are equal, equally sensational. Bogart played several interesting men in his long career, but Phillip Marlowe is one of his most intriguing parts, surely among his finest performances. He can spit out lines at a machine gun pace, all the while cherishing Marlowe's dexterity, having fun with it. And though only Bacall's second movie (filmed before 1945's Confidential Agent, which nearly destroyed her blossoming career), she is a presence in the same way Dietrich or Garbo were in their early days positively magnetic and unlike anything else found on theater screens of the time. Together, Bogart and Bacall almost set the camera on fire, and not just during love scenes; their real-life romance makes every scene throb with intrigue, and it still shows today. Supporting performances, particularly from the underrated Martha Vickers and Sonia Darrin, make huge statements, no matter how small the part.Almost 70 years later, The Big Sleep remains vital. It's a landmark in the personal lives of its stars, a landmark in cinema, and a landmark work for a director so versatile that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Red River are completely separate yet somehow fronted by the same man.

Maybe I wandered into Steel Magnolias, this film committed the worst sin in marketing; MISREPRESENTATION. Look, I know a chick flick when I see one we all had to sit through THE AGE OF INNOCENCE or other excruciatingly boring movies but hey you knew it going in one look at the poster. Slump down in the seat pretend you are watching. This took a scientific premise promised action disaster mayhem and what did we all get AS THE COMET TURNS. Forgive the misogyny but do you think we could think of the rest of the entire planet instead of the soap opera with Jenny and her family problems. How about the Young and the Restless the early years with Leo and his squeeze? Hello, yes remember the comet crashing into the planet could we get back to that soon after jenny her mommy and estranged daddy work out their BORING AND IRRELEVANT problems? You know in other countries how they died laughing at Mimi Leder's narcissistic self absorbed crap pile. Yes was the comet going to only hit the united states? Even Armageddon showed the impact on other parts of the world without all the Kleenex interpersonal new age bringing the light soap opera. Tea Leoni I concur with an earlier reviewer is perhaps the worst living actress. Range she has none emotional depth spray on tears miss cardboard she looks like she is on very strong medication. Pity two great old actors Maximilian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave how would you like to do scenes with tea leoni?

A knuckles-to-the-face romp that has a big bite and a big heart, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown sets its sights on Pepa (Carmen Maura), a fashionable but depressed voice-over actress. Her career has been mostly successful, but in just the past week, her life has turned into a housewife's dream of a soap opera. Her lover has left her, she's pregnant, she faints at the slightest source of drama, she nearly overdoses on sleeping pills, and her friend (Mar√≠a Barranco) is dating a terrorist. If that doesn't sound like Almod√≥var, then you must not associate Steven Spielberg with E.T. and all-American families thrown into otherworldly situations.Almod√≥var isn't in the mood to bump us around; he'd rather charm us, in the same way Doris Day vehicles did when soap commercials were still around. For Almod√≥var, the '80s were a time to figure things out, drape his colorful images and themes onto unusual projects, and hope they'd stick. Usually, they'd be so outrageous that they'd be inevitably smacked in the face with the dreaded NC-17 rating. By Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, it seems as if he's bored with outright camp, in the same way John Waters was in the days of Cry-Baby.As one of cinema's most confident directors, Almod√≥var restrains his inner wildness and lets the zippiness of the film speak for itself. In return, it becomes his calling card. Audiences don't want to be left in shock, after all; they want to have a good time.

Her career has been mostly successful, but in just the past week, her life has turned into a housewife's dream of a soap opera. Her lover has left her, she's pregnant, she faints at the slightest source of drama, she nearly overdoses on sleeping pills, and her friend (Mar√≠a Barranco) is dating a terrorist.

Unlike the ambiguities of The Birds or Suspicion, we do eventually find out the answer to the question that so harshly eludes us. But like The Birds and Suspicion, we have a director at the front of the film that makes us care about the answer. If it was devoid of its smart suspense, surely the results would not be so startlingly entertaining. The 39 Steps comes fairly early in Alfred Hitchcock's lustrous career, arriving in 1935 (keep in mind his last movie was released in 1976) and acting like a sample of the more assured wronged man\/chase movie\/adventure romps of the Master of Suspense's future. I was reminded of later masterpieces, like Saboteur and North by Northwest, two wronged- man on-the-run actioners that slid along with electric thrills and winking humor that felt at ease in the tense atmosphere.Robert Donat portrays Richard Hannay, a young man confronted with murder and intrigue at a rate most normal folks would faint at. One night, Hannay attends a sideshow highlighting Mr. Memory (Wylie Watson), a performer with startling memorizational abilities &#x97; ask any question (besides a personal one), Mr. Memory will know the answer with the detail of a much tended to Wikipedia page. Hecklers attempt to damage the wonders of the scene, but just as things are beginning to turn around, shots are fired, causing a massive panic and the thud of a dead body. Hannay finds himself comforting an attractive woman, Annabelle Smith (Lucie Mannheim), in the midst of the ruckus. He takes her back to his flat in sympathy, but just because it's 1935 doesn't mean that some people aren't hoping to get just a little bit lucky.Before anything can happen, though, Annabelle reveals her true motive &#x97; she is not just a woman who trusts that men will take her back to their apartment and not try anything questionable; she is also a spy who is being pursued by deadly assassins. You see, she has just discovered a wicked plot to steal important British military secrets. Why she is foolish enough to tell all this to a bystander she only met a few minutes ago I don't know, but here's where the plot kicks in she (a) mentions the 39 steps (but doesn't include its meaning!), (b) warns that the mastermind behind the entire plot is missing the top joint of his finger, (c) is murdered, and (d) leaves Hannay not only confused but also wanted for her murder. So he goes on the run, and throughout the course of his unwanted adventure he finds out what the 39 steps actually are\/is, meets the man who probably has a difficult time handling a pencil, discovers who offed Annabelle, and teams up with a blonde (Madeleine Carroll) who acts as his love interest and sidekick.Truth is, Hitchcock has made plenty of movies that bear similarities to The 39 Steps (he can't get enough of wronged-men and sophisticated blondes), but our inhibitions are nonexistent because this is a Hitchcock movie, for crying out loud. Even if many of his themes and characters could pass for brother and sister, there is never a feeling of repetition in his films. As one of the best (and most inventive) directors of all time, he is never lazy, always devising new ways to fondle the camera, finding the fun in actors and their characters, making them people we can root. It's impossible not to remember a specific shot or a specific character in his films considering they all feel so utterly distinct.The 39 Steps is perhaps a seamless example of Hitchcock's genius. It's uncomplicated, totally enjoyable fluff, but like all of his films, there is a harmonious relationship between unaffected escapism and true art. The plot moves along with remarkable speed, resembling a roller coaster ride or an old-fashioned adventure film in the same mindset of The African Queen or King Solomon's Mines. But the punchiness would simply not work if not for Hitchcock's extremely deliberate attitude towards his camera-work and his storytelling. Take, for instance, the scene in which the first murder takes place the crowd, heckling their brains out, are almost a single body, one big ball of sassiness. But when the gun is fired, it isn't just some random noise that interrupts the situation. Hitchcock skims around the entire group of people, defining them as a large mass. Then, suddenly, he cuts to the hand that shoots, sending the room into a frenzy. A quick move like this only builds the suspense. It gives an impression that in any setting, even a sideshow act where things seem safe, there is always some sort of faceless threat, establishing our, and the leading man's, paranoia. We can laugh at the wit that we're faced with near constantly, and we can sweat bullets all we want at the sight of a villain, but never do we feel completely at ease. Other quirks, such as keeping the mugs of the men who eventually kill Annabelle far away but dangerous, keeping a close-up on Donat whenever he enters a situation where he may or may not be recognized, heighten the giddy thrills Hitchcock magnificently creates.Donat is wonderful, and so are Carroll and the writing, but The 39 Steps is more about Hitchcock than anyone else. It is, perhaps, the film that started it all. It began the legend of the macabre adoring director just as much in love with entertaining audiences as he was with his camera and his thoughtful manipulations.

This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.What separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the other sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world.

This is followed by the Terminator and the human making their appearances from the future into our present, gathering clothes and weapons and heading out in their own respective ways in the search for Sarah Connor, a teenage girl part-timing as a waitress upon whose survival rests humanity's future as both she and us learn later. What follows is a cat and mouse game where the human goes all out to protect her and the Terminator is all out to get her and it won't stop, literally right till the end.What separates this movie (and its immediate sequel) from the other sequels is James Cameron's balancing act who, much like Spielberg, allows the story to take center-stage and drive everything else and has perfect control over the length of sequences, edits, camera cuts and angles. 10 minutes into the movie and you're in, drawn to this world, completely forgetting that the futuristic crafts and landscapes are miniatures with absolutely no chance of being drawn out of this world. While I didn't find the characters to be groundbreaking or as interesting as in other dramas, the plot was extremely well constructed and allowed for some really cool paradoxes that would make for some interesting discussion (would John Conner even exist if he hadn't sent Kyle back in time).The effects deserve special mention too. It is incredible how much Stan Winston's crew and Fantasy II were able to achieve at the time. All the futuristic scenes, the sequence with the Terminator treating his injuries, the chase sequences and the entire ambitious final act all work and some of them still hold up three decades later. And Brad Fiedel's theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it, as if signaling an impending apocalypse.All the actors do well in their respective roles, particularly Arnold who shines in a part that seemed almost tailor made to suit his acting capabilities. But it is Cameron who is truly the star of this endeavor, believing in his project and driving it to execution. Thank God for the success of this movie, which gave us many more masterpieces by Cameron. But then, it was entirely deserving of it. A sci-fi tech-noir classic.Overall Score 8.0 \/ 10.0 ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"2 May 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Show me an actress who isn't a personality and you'll show me a woman who isn't a star, declared Katharine Hepburn when asked about her smashing screen persona. Humble, no. Correct, yes. Take any legendary performer &#x97; Humphrey Bogart, Joan Crawford, Cary Grant, Marilyn Monroe &#x97; and you will not only find a terrific actor but also a presence that could interrupt the breathing patterns of an entire room just by walking through a door. And if you don't inspire that same breathless room to immediately bow down in a we're-not-worthy Wayne's World dramatization, then you probably aren't a star.Fortunately for us, fortunately for Funny Girl, but unfortunately for the self-proclaimed icon herself, Katharine Hepburn, Barbra Streisand just so happens to be a star &#x97; a star that, incidentally, matched Hepburn's explosive performance in The Lion in Winter so well that the two ended up tying for the Oscar win. Now that Funny Girl and The Lion in Winter are nearly a half-century old, it's probably safe to say that Hepburn and Streisand are unofficial gods of the entertainment industry; but Funny Girl is the more important film, introducing the world to a new voice, a new actress, and yes, a new personality.In the years since Funny Girl, Streisand hasn't lost her bewitching zeal, but only a few of her following films have captured the same sort of youthful gusto of her debut. The early days of Babs, with roles in What's Up, Doc? and The Owl and the Pussycat, bring lasting joy. Like many actresses that appeal to the Broadway inclined crowd, she is more fun to watch in quickly-paced adventures in comedy than sappy behemoths like The Mirror Has Two Faces. Funny Girl is a snapshot of everything we've come to admire about Streisand &#x97; that immediate likability, that one-million- miles-an-hour comedic timing, those dramatic chops, and that voice. You can bet that the film itself is given the standard Hollywood musical treatment &#x97; but what isn't standard is the girl from New Yawk with charisma the size of Alaska and Texas put together.Funny Girl is technically a true story its leading character, Fanny Brice was, in fact, a famed Ziegfeld girl, and she was, in fact, married to Nicky Arnstein. But Streisand is such a ball-of-fire that we aren't paying much attention to Brice's accomplished (and melodramatic) life. Streisand demolishes every confine a characterization can bring. She's not so much playing Fanny Brice as she much as she is Fanny Brice. She doesn't act out a scene; she is the scene.I suppose for the sake of a plot summary I should cover the basics so you know what you're getting into. The film travels across the life of Brice from the early 1900s to the beginnings of the 1920s, detailing her whirlwind (and lasting) relationship with show business and stormy marriage to gambler Nicky Arnstein (Omar Sharif). There's comedy and music and tear-jerking and romance and overtures and more hoohas that come along with the big-budgeted movie musical genre; Funny Girl has all the makings to become an epic production of the Sound of Music class. But Streisand keeps the film from getting whisked away into unremarkable giganticness. The film is about her, not its supporting characters, photography, or set design. Roger Ebert noted that everything other than Streisand is mostly flat. While this is partially true, I think, on the other hand, that if Streisand wasn't the star, suddenly the supporting characters, photography, and set design would seem bigger-than-life, extraordinary even. But she's like a blinding light from outer space running around a soundstage; you can only wonder why the items surrounding her don't spontaneously combust.I'm not a part of the devoted fan base that refers to Streisand exclusively as Babs and lists Evergreen as their theme song, but I am a part of the fan base that recognizes her as one of cinema's most unique and versatile actresses.

It is the closest thing the movies have ever come to capturing a nightmare on the screen. With its blaring, screechy progressive rock soundtrack (courtesy of the spine chewing Goblins), overwhelmingly (and nauseatingly) Technicolor set design, and convoluted stalk-and-slashes, Suspiria is unlike anything the horror genre has ever offered, for better or worse. I cannot say watching the film is a particular enjoyable experience; but yet again, being scared is not something most seek out when they want to have a good time. Tell me were you ever really comfortable the first time you watched Halloween?I probably shouldn't be name-dropping Halloween willy-nilly; Suspiria is much more ambitious, and certainly much more excruciating to the eye. It's simultaneously offensive and luxurious to our sensitive pupils; the film drenches itself in the color palette of a Crayola based pop art painting, but the lack of realism in the atmosphere supplements its mystifying horror. As much as we attempt to throw our logic around in the visually combative mixture, it's impossible to truly understand what's really going on. There's something about witches and secret societies and Irises that lead to hidden hallways, but how can you focus on the plot when Dario Argento, bless his artfully messed-up heart, throws around red paint, rooms filled with barbed-wire, possessed German Shepherds, and maggot showers like its no big deal? Suspiria is comprised of the stuff your worst dreams are made of. It's not frightening in the traditional sense (i.e sitting at the edge of your seat, jumping when a cat is suddenly thrown at the camera). Imagine laying on your couch peacefully; you blink, and suddenly, you find yourself falling off a cliff. Just because something doesn't make sense doesn't mean it isn't terrifying.With the wide-eyed power of a final girl, Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American dancer staying in Europe after being accepted into a prestigious ballet school. Her arrival is anything but welcoming; she enters the country during an explosive thunderstorm, and, when at the entrance of the academy, is not greeted by a well-meaning headmistress but a trembling girl, mumbling something about irises and secrets like she's mouthing her very last words. Most would know something is afoot, especially considering that that very same girl dies a mind- numbingly grisly death later that night; but Suzy, excited by the opportunities in her horizon, doesn't let an unfortunate death get in her way. But one can only ignore murder for so long. Slowly but surely, students and staff who even think about questioning the strict teachers drop like gutted flies. Surrounding the deaths are even more bizarre events, coming in the forms of poisoned food, spiteful bats, and yes, even maggot showers. Soon, Suzy discovers that her school is not suffering from a case of eccentricity but rather something &#x85; supernatural, you might say.Horror directors are usually annoyingly bent out of shape when it comes to their movies. It's as if they feel bad for frightening us, offering an apology in the form of a long-winded explanation as to why all the crazy events we recently witnessed happened and why the villains are so damn villainous. But Suspiria is vague, putting our brains in a blender of hallucinogens and then pushing us out onto a busy street. Argento wants nothing more than to terrify us, and that's that. He's done his homework, fondling a fish-eye lens and a passion for claustrophobic camera angles. The film is both vast and inescapable the dance academy seems to be endless in its rooms, like a country of evil; but don't expect to stumble across an exit door anytime soon.When I say Suspiria is terrifying, I'm not putting it lightly. This is one of the scariest -and goriest - films to ever headline a mainstream cinema screen. It isn't any less shocking than it was 38 years ago, and, despite its pitiful dubbing, is awe-inspiringly aggressive. The colors slap you, and so does, well ... everything.

Just because something doesn't make sense doesn't mean it isn't terrifying.With the wide-eyed power of a final girl, Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American dancer staying in Europe after being accepted into a prestigious ballet school. Her arrival is anything but welcoming; she enters the country during an explosive thunderstorm, and, when at the entrance of the academy, is not greeted by a well-meaning headmistress but a trembling girl, mumbling something about irises and secrets like she's mouthing her very last words. Most would know something is afoot, especially considering that that very same girl dies a mind- numbingly grisly death later that night; but Suzy, excited by the opportunities in her horizon, doesn't let an unfortunate death get in her way. But one can only ignore murder for so long. Slowly but surely, students and staff who even think about questioning the strict teachers drop like gutted flies. Surrounding the deaths are even more bizarre events, coming in the forms of poisoned food, spiteful bats, and yes, even maggot showers. Soon, Suzy discovers that her school is not suffering from a case of eccentricity but rather something &#x85; supernatural, you might say.Horror directors are usually annoyingly bent out of shape when it comes to their movies. It's as if they feel bad for frightening us, offering an apology in the form of a long-winded explanation as to why all the crazy events we recently witnessed happened and why the villains are so damn villainous. But Suspiria is vague, putting our brains in a blender of hallucinogens and then pushing us out onto a busy street. Argento wants nothing more than to terrify us, and that's that. He's done his homework, fondling a fish-eye lens and a passion for claustrophobic camera angles. The film is both vast and inescapable the dance academy seems to be endless in its rooms, like a country of evil; but don't expect to stumble across an exit door anytime soon.When I say Suspiria is terrifying, I'm not putting it lightly. This is one of the scariest -and goriest - films to ever headline a mainstream cinema screen. It isn't any less shocking than it was 38 years ago, and, despite its pitiful dubbing, is awe-inspiringly aggressive. The colors slap you, and so does, well ... everything.

It is the closest thing the movies have ever come to capturing a nightmare on the screen. With its blaring, screechy progressive rock soundtrack (courtesy of the spine chewing Goblins), overwhelmingly (and nauseatingly) Technicolor set design, and convoluted stalk-and-slashes, Suspiria is unlike anything the horror genre has ever offered, for better or worse. I cannot say watching the film is a particular enjoyable experience; but yet again, being scared is not something most seek out when they want to have a good time. Tell me were you ever really comfortable the first time you watched Halloween?I probably shouldn't be name-dropping Halloween willy-nilly; Suspiria is much more ambitious, and certainly much more excruciating to the eye. It's simultaneously offensive and luxurious to our sensitive pupils; the film drenches itself in the color palette of a Crayola based pop art painting, but the lack of realism in the atmosphere supplements its mystifying horror. As much as we attempt to throw our logic around in the visually combative mixture, it's impossible to truly understand what's really going on. There's something about witches and secret societies and Irises that lead to hidden hallways, but how can you focus on the plot when Dario Argento, bless his artfully messed-up heart, throws around red paint, rooms filled with barbed-wire, possessed German Shepherds, and maggot showers like its no big deal? Suspiria is comprised of the stuff your worst dreams are made of. It's not frightening in the traditional sense (i.e sitting at the edge of your seat, jumping when a cat is suddenly thrown at the camera).
