James Marsden plays Steve Clark, a new kid in a small town who befriends local outcast Gavin Strick (Nick Stahl). One of the high school cliques Gavin points out to Steve is a bunch dubbed The Blue Ribbons model citizens who've been made that way by the nefarious Dr. Caldicott (Bruce Greenwood). Naturally, Caldicott's scheme has ugly side effects the kids turn homicidal whenever they get turned on, for one thing. Steve teams up with another outcast, Rachel Wagner (Katie Holmes) to foil the mad doctor's scheme. The very brief running time, and fast moving, straightforward story amounts to both a good and bad thing. It ensures that the movie never gets boring, but the lack of a lot of detail, and more meat to the story, will leave some viewers less than satisfied. There's tension in Steve's family because of the suicide of his brother (Ethan Embry, wasted in a nothing part), yet we never find out what drove the brother to do it. The seemingly slow witted janitor Dorian Newberry (William Sadler) is a lot more savvy than he lets on, yet there's no explanation of how he figured everything out. A local policeman, Officer Cox (Steve Railsback) is clearly in on everything, but this role could have been beefed up a little more. (Railsback and Sadler, two solid veterans, also end up somewhat wasted, although Sadler is a bit of a hoot.) It's a good point made that once Gavin, the most engaging of the characters, is given a makeover, the movie definitely loses something. Stahl gives what is the most enjoyable performance in the whole thing. Besides that, the story becomes just a little too conventional in its second half, with a less than truly thrilling conclusion. Despite being meant to be shocking, it comes off as too laughable sometimes. The opening scene does work, though, as does the freak out scene with Lorna (Crystal Cass). The supposedly hip and clever dialogue is just annoying a lot of the time. Viewers will recognize a fair amount of the faces; among them is Katharine Isabelle of the Ginger Snaps franchise as Steve's younger sister. This could have been better, overall, but it's not without some entertainment value; location work is good and the music by 'X-Files' composer Mark Snow is reasonably effective. Six out of 10.

Old hand Al Jolson had reinvented his image, Bing Crosby was a fresh-faced newcomer, but most successful of all was the duo of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. This was their second appearance together, and the first where they were the lead players and main attraction.The two of them were rather different in background. Astaire had already been an established star on the stage and having worked with Ziegfeld was very much in touch with that passing generation of theatrical extravaganza, but he was a newcomer to cinema. Rogers on the other hand already had two-dozen movie credits to her name, and had gained a reputation in small roles, often as a catty, antagonistic chorine. But despite their differences they have in common an approach to dancing that, despite professional precision, brings out a lot of personality. And both can act. Ginger would later prove herself to be an excellent dramatic actress, and is steady enough here. Fred just has an easygoing charm that seems as effortless as his dancing. In a non-musical, these two would seem an odd pairing &#x96; it's when they dance we see them click. But these were early days yet, and in The Gay Divorc√©e they lack that sense of familiarity around each other that would make their later romances seem so right.This was also the first time Astaire and Rogers were put before director Mark Sandrich, the man who helmed their most successful features together. Sandrich keeps a sort of gentle rhythm going throughout the picture with some delicate camera moves, such as the opening sweep through the restaurant onto Astaire's dancing fingers. His approach to the musical numbers was always oblique yet effective. For Needle in a Haystack, the song is born out of a dialogue scene, with the camera still in its place, the sofa in the foreground separating us from Astaire, who (very unusually) is framed in profile. After one verse, the angle changes to place us in front of him. The camera then follows him as he gets up and selects a tie from a valet, and the dance just segues out of that movement. Sandrich's ability to make the songs flow seamlessly in and out of the non-music scenes was a key part in the ongoing revolution in how musicals were made.One thing that makes a musical like The Gay Divorc√©e seem somewhat archaic is its plot. It's a comedy of errors that might have been quite good had it been fully developed as one, but the way the narrative twists to fit a song it becomes obviously artificial. It also suffers from an unpleasant quality of many romances of the era, in that the romance basically consists of the man stalking and harassing the woman until, against all probability, she falls for him (and not even the suave Mister Astaire can stop this from appearing creepy). The only thing that saves this from being a handful of noteworthy song-and-dance routines strung together with a limp story is the often witty dialogue and the way it is delivered by a wonderful supporting cast. Just as Fred and Ginger established their screen persona, so too did Edward Everett Horton become the fussy, mother-hen sidekick, Eric Blore the chirpy, intrusive butler and Erik Rhodes the bungling would-be Latin lover. These three are all excellent and, with the romantic interplay between Astaire and Rogers not quite as fizzing as it should be, dare I say they even overshadow the two leads? (Yes, I do dare say).

White supremacists are taking over the formerly-peaceful town, led by the hate-filled preacher Brian (an uncredited Ermey). Just as their evil empire is growing, none other than Tommy Lee (the drummer from Motley Crue) (just kidding, it's Phillip Rhee of course) rolls into town to visit his sister who just happens to live in this town, and her husband Jack (McDonald). Jack also happens to be the sheriff, but is powerless to stop the hate-filled mobs. Lee finds he must use his fists and his feet not only to defeat the stupid racists, but to defend choir director Margo (Gershon). Will Tommy Lee beat the neo-Nazis and ride off into the sunset? To Best of the Best 3's credit, it has an extremely professional look, with very good production values. This was Phillip Rhee's first directorial effort, and it seems like he had been building up to this for a while, because he does a very competent job, with a lot of interesting shots and as mentioned, the technical aspects are very good. Plus, with its themes about racism, it was at least trying not to be the same old dumb meathead movie. It made an effort to make you think, which is more than you can say about some of this movie's competitors (or other entries in the series, for that matter).Like China O'Brien (1990), the rural action movie angle is used, and, like Substitute 4 (2001), the white power angle is used. Interestingly enough, the director of Substitute 4 is Robert Radler, the director of Best of the Best 2 (1993). There's even some Jackie Chan-like martial arts, as evidenced by the scene in which Rhee fights some baddies in a clown outfit. You truly haven't lived until you've seen thugs get kicked by a man with giant shoes.As we've seen in everything from American Ninja (1985) to terrorist training videos, the army of bad guys have their own training camp, complete with, you guessed it, monkey bars. Exactly how these monkey bars would help someone defeat Tommy Lee in a fight is not known. And the head Nazi guy wouldn't even come close to challenging Lee in a fight. He only holds his own for a long time because that's what a lot of final bad guys do. A lot of action movies fall into that clich√© Although the main baddie may have no martial arts or combat training whatsoever, when the hero faces off against him in a fight, after handily defeating hundreds of goons, NOW the final fight is actually a challenge for the hero. It's just silly, but you can't really help it.If you have Netflix streaming, you should view Best of the Best 3 that way, as the quality is excellent and it's in widescreen.

It is one of those that I always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it recently and couldn't remember most of it. That being said I was right in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing. Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down poor jobs and aren't particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and needs Marty's help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc's latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty's shock and amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting thirty years into the past.Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen. Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose, except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing, and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all will on to win. He is a character we can all relate to and all want to be. Right from the offset we want Marty McFly to succeed. Christopher Lloyd is also great, it is as if the role was specifically designed for him. He plays the crazy scientist with ease and he is a lovable character despite his tendencies to do the wrong thing. Marty's parents (Thompson and Glover) are excellent, Glover maybe more so. They both portray the elder parents and the teenage versions of themselves as if they are the age of the role they are playing. In fact they are the same age as Fox and were cast based around the story in the past and made up for the story in the future. Glover is just brilliant as the bumbling nerd and the hair style just works on Glover and Glover alone. We also get a bully in Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is also so pivotal. The acting for Biff is also top drawer and you really do hate him.The film has everything; humour, action, family fun, love, you name it, it has got it even the creepy thunder storm and lightning strike. It will please any sort of movie fan whether it be the typical movie buff or the guy who only tunes in every now and again. It is a film not to be missed.My slight negative about it though is the relationship between Doc and Marty within the past. In the present we really believe they are friends but they don't spend too much screen time together in the past and I didn't quite believe that they were going to 'miss' each other like they said they would. I would possibly have liked to have seen a few more minutes of them two together. Maybe that is just me but it is my only negative with the film.I understand that this will probably make little sense. The referencing to past, present and future within this review is confusing. One thing I have thought about though is this surely if you are watching the film Marty is always in the present? If there is a continuing time line on a constant loop will you ever be in the past or future? Wouldn't you just always be in your present? Just one to think about but do it before or after the film as it is one you just need to kick back with and enjoy.4.5 \/ 5 For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Back To The Future was a film I grew up on. It is one of those that I always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it recently and couldn't remember most of it. That being said I was right in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing. Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down poor jobs and aren't particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and needs Marty's help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc's latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty's shock and amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting thirty years into the past.Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen. Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose, except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing, and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all will on to win.

With its all-star cast, some great performances and an intriguing plot, this movie's engaging right from the start but then becomes even more gripping as its characters are gradually introduced and begin to interact with each other.The small town of Garrison, New Jersey, which is located just across the river from New York City, is popularly referred to Cop Land because it's populated mainly by NYPD officers who find its suburban tranquillity provides a pleasant contrast to the areas in which they work during the day. Garrison, however, is soon revealed to be more than just an idyllic retreat, as it's actually populated by corrupt cops who are routinely paid to operate in accordance with the requirements of important crime bosses who have also rewarded them by putting up the money for their houses.Lieutenant Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel) is the leader of Garrison's rogue cops and effectively runs the town. His nephew Murray Superboy Babitch (Michael Rapaport) is a young cop who gets involved in an incident which ends with him shooting and killing two black teenagers. When it becomes clear that the young men were unarmed and Murray starts panicking about what the repercussions might be, Ray assists by faking his nephew's suicide and this seems to defuse the situation.A short time later, NYPD Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) arrives in Garrison and tries to persuade local Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone) to help him by providing information about Ray's shady activities but Freddy declines out of loyalty to Ray and his associates. This effectively ends Tilden's investigation as Garrison is technically outside of his jurisdiction and also he's been pressured by some of Ray's connections in high places to drop his investigation unless he can provide some hard evidence to support his suspicions.Garrison's Sheriff admires the cops who live in his town and regularly turns a blind eye to their wrongdoings. He's aware of Murray Babitch's presence in the town and remains unconcerned until it becomes evident that Ray's decided to have Murray killed. Ray considers this to be necessary because until his nephew's body is found, the police investigations are likely to continue and they, in turn, could jeopardise his whole business.Freddy Heflin is a well meaning character who avoids conflict and is virtually powerless as he's controlled by Ray. He's rather timid, extremely overweight and given little respect by the men that he admires so much. He's also experienced many disappointments in the past. He's in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra) a woman who he saved from drowning some years ago. It was during this act of courage that he suffered an injury which left him deaf in one ear and this disability prevented him from achieving his ambition to become a cop in the big city.Freddy goes to Tilden to tell him what he wanted to know about Ray and his sidekicks but Tilden is no longer interested. As he's leaving the building, Freddy sees some discarded documents relating to Tilden's investigation and soon learns more about Ray's involvement in a wide range of criminal activities. This motivates Freddy to take on Ray and his gang in what turns out to be an exciting shootout.Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Freddy is incredibly sensitive as he conveys so strongly the despair and sadness of a good natured man whose been left emotionally devastated by his past experiences. The transformation he goes through when he decides to take on Ray and his gang is terrific and made convincing by the sheer quality of Stallone's acting.

While Robin Williams is, simply by default, a lovable character in just about any film, the movie simply relies on him running around jumping and smiling and just being Robin Williams. The character itself has very little substance given to him throughout most of the film, he's just some random painter who loves his wife and is happy he made it to heaven.And then there's the entire conflict of the movie, his wife, and this is where the movie utterly failed for me. I guess the writers, both Richard Matheson (novel) and Ronald Bass (screenplay), assume that the audience wholeheartedly accepts Christian Dogma that anyone who commits suicide deserves to rot in hell for eternity, without any other explanation (or any one that makes sense, more on this later), or at least is willing to play along with it enough to actually care about the heaven and hell presented in this movie. The problem is, for what we actually see of his wife, the movie fails to give make us (or at least me) feel that she actually belongs there, or even understand why she's really there at all other than you kill yourself and you go to hell. When we are first introduced to hell (which, in general, is just a very poor-explained, very confusing segment of this movie), we are presented with the idea that it is full of selfish, greedy individuals, most of whom seem to be too concerned with their own worldly selfishness and greed to even realize that they are in hell. When we come across his wife however, she is simply presented to us as a very frustrated, sad woman who can't even remember that she killed herself, further complicating any hope we have of understanding her character. What little we do see of her character, is a strike contrast to the mass group of individuals we first meet when we arrive in hell. We are told at some point that those who commit suicide go to hell because their nature is anti-fantasy (apparently you can tell everything about somebody's nature by a single action they committed out of desperate loneliness), yet the movie fails to show us that the wife has any such nature.(MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT) I guess all of this is supposed to be made better when the main character decides to live forever with her in hell and this actually sends them both to heaven. The problem is, is that this doesn't make any sense. So she gets to go to heaven because he felt he couldn't be happy without her and he acted on it selflessly. BUT WAIT, isn't that same emotion, a selfless I can't exist without you emotion, the exact same reason his wife killed herself in the first place?!? How is his nature any less anti-fantasy, when their nature and choices are really one in the same, he simply was able to make the choice after his death and therefore did not have to kill himself. And what if someone is not fortunate enough meet such a soul mate on earth, are they not given such an important, eternal second chance? The problem is this movie fails to actually explore any real human morals, emotions, motives, intentions, or natures, and yet attempts to make statements about them solely based on human ACTIONS, rather than, you know, the actual morals, motives, intentions, emotions, and natures. Also, very little actually happens in this movie, yet unfortunately it is not really a short movie. So what we are left with is a pretty movie devoid of any substantial character, action, morals, and therefore any genuine emotion (what this movie tries it's hardest to deliver). But it has a happy ending so.... I guess... that's good?

I guess the writers, both Richard Matheson (novel) and Ronald Bass (screenplay), assume that the audience wholeheartedly accepts Christian Dogma that anyone who commits suicide deserves to rot in hell for eternity, without any other explanation (or any one that makes sense, more on this later), or at least is willing to play along with it enough to actually care about the heaven and hell presented in this movie. The problem is, for what we actually see of his wife, the movie fails to give make us (or at least me) feel that she actually belongs there, or even understand why she's really there at all other than you kill yourself and you go to hell. When we are first introduced to hell (which, in general, is just a very poor-explained, very confusing segment of this movie), we are presented with the idea that it is full of selfish, greedy individuals, most of whom seem to be too concerned with their own worldly selfishness and greed to even realize that they are in hell. When we come across his wife however, she is simply presented to us as a very frustrated, sad woman who can't even remember that she killed herself, further complicating any hope we have of understanding her character. What little we do see of her character, is a strike contrast to the mass group of individuals we first meet when we arrive in hell. We are told at some point that those who commit suicide go to hell because their nature is anti-fantasy (apparently you can tell everything about somebody's nature by a single action they committed out of desperate loneliness), yet the movie fails to show us that the wife has any such nature.(MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT) I guess all of this is supposed to be made better when the main character decides to live forever with her in hell and this actually sends them both to heaven. The problem is, is that this doesn't make any sense. So she gets to go to heaven because he felt he couldn't be happy without her and he acted on it selflessly. BUT WAIT, isn't that same emotion, a selfless I can't exist without you emotion, the exact same reason his wife killed herself in the first place?!? How is his nature any less anti-fantasy, when their nature and choices are really one in the same, he simply was able to make the choice after his death and therefore did not have to kill himself. And what if someone is not fortunate enough meet such a soul mate on earth, are they not given such an important, eternal second chance? The problem is this movie fails to actually explore any real human morals, emotions, motives, intentions, or natures, and yet attempts to make statements about them solely based on human ACTIONS, rather than, you know, the actual morals, motives, intentions, emotions, and natures. Also, very little actually happens in this movie, yet unfortunately it is not really a short movie. So what we are left with is a pretty movie devoid of any substantial character, action, morals, and therefore any genuine emotion (what this movie tries it's hardest to deliver).

Mrs. Voorhees was a rather lame and unrealistic reveal in the climax of the first, and although he is yet to don his iconic hockey mask (here he wears a flour bag with an eye hole), he makes for a much more effective and physically intimidating killer.But the film doesn't really have any effective or memorable murders, which, let's face it, is why you watch a Friday the 13th film.

The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior.The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu√±uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu√±uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu√±uel places the audience in this same spell.Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature.

Some are coherently shown, and sometimes, others serve as just set pieces. The film lacks the suspense of films like Joy Ride and Speed, although it does bring a considerable amount of talent to the table. Black Dog isn't bad, but it's thin and ordinary.

He always has some very thought provoking subjects to write and ultimately film about. Crimes and Misdemeanors in a lot of ways, in my opinion, is his most thought provoking film to date. What really brings the movie together is the ending where Martin Landau's character is talking to Woody Allen's character. I won't get into the whole movie here, but what Landau's character talks about to Allen's character is the fact that if you kill someone or had someone killed, you feel bad at first about it, but you ultimately move on with your life, and as time goes by, the killing becomes further away in your thoughts, like the phrase, 'This too shall pass.' Allen's character talks about how if a person kills someone and\/or had someone killed that they would ultimately confess to the police from feeling to guilty about it. Landau's character says, to the likes of, 'at first you feel guilty, but that's movie stuff confessing, no you get through it and move on with your life.'(again he didn't say this verbatim, but to the likes of he did). Very interesting thoughts come at the movie viewer like fireworks bursting into the sky at this point such as- Is it truly only about survival and do we move on and adapt no matter what? Do we get through the lulls of life and learn to adapt, live and survive in this world the that way we like to no matter what? Do we learn to live with life, as it was, whether it be Crimes(something horrible as in we killed someone) and\/or Misdemeanors(Cheating on your girlfriend or wife or both-for the polyamorous)? Another thought provoking subject that comes up is of what's 'real'(that has concretely happened, been seen in the world) and what 'isn't real or what hasn't and\/or can't be seen'(God; Faith; all of this according to what the movie is stating). Allen really makes you think in this film, and he's one of the best for this kind of writing. The answer is really simple since there isn't a solid black or white answer, which there never is anyway(And I believe ultimately, that's Woody Allen's point), it's pretty much to the individual. The funny thing is both Landau's character and Allen's character are both right. There are some people in this world that would think like Landau and go on living their lives after killing someone and then there are some people in this world that make Allen's argument right, where they would breakdown and confess about their crime of killing someone, and that's real life, not a movie, it goes both ways, depending on the person. It comes down to 'What is Truth?' as Pontius Pilate said(Pronounced Pawnchuss Pilot). Truth is to the eye of the beholder, it's different for everyone. Some people's truth would be on the side of Landau's character and some on the side of Allen's character. Some people are realists and see the truth as only what they can see and only what has happened, and some people's truth is what you can see but also what you can't see too, God and Faith in particular. What can't be seen is sometimes as real as what can be seen. There are things that happen in life through events of faith and worship and other ordeals that come to a fruition in the here and the now, and the realists wouldn't have believed it when it wasn't seen, but when it became seen, then they believed it. A very crafty movie by an absolute brilliant man in Woody Allen. It's a must see for the deep thinkers.

After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up.The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

I read and listened to review after review about how this is a top 10 horror film...how? To me this film was more art film than horror. The classification should be Mystery and not horror. The last scene of the film I think is what gave this film the Horror tag. Without it, it would just be a basic\/generic sorta mystery. One that Agatha Christie coulda wrote.Set in Italy where a couple who have lost their child to a drowning back in England, the husband works in Venice to restore an old Church. The wife is bored and meets these 2 little old ladies in a restaurant. One of them tells her she's a Psychic....or she has Second sight. From their we go from scene to scene waiting to see what these 2 little old ladies have said is ever gonna come true. Well, be prepared...because it's a long wait for the action to happen...and there ain't much of it.Slow and plodding this is certainly not one of the best horror films ever. It's not really horror but as it is, it has a lot of good points so it's worth a watch. Just don't expect to erase 1 out of your top 10 list and place this one it's place.

When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, The Bridges of Madison County  and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. The Bridges of Madison County is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma.  I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone. Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.
