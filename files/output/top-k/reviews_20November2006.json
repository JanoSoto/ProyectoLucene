I suspect the formerly Oscar-winning director should also take less blame than the public assigns to him, for this filmic atrocity.Even though I only bought a (used) DVD of this film so I could study a number of films on IMDb's Bottom 100 list, to see what I could learn from films that tens of thousands of people hate ... I still want my two hours back. Stunningly, unbelievably, mouth hanging open in shock bad! This is the sort of film that you have to watch two really good films immediately afterwards, to counter the emotional assault. And it still leaves a bad taste in your mind, after that.The sheer beginning-to-end consistency of the film lets many of those who have taken the blame in other reviews -- actors, director, etc. -- off of the hook, in my opinion. Here's what I mean take 100 people off of the street, totally at random. One at a time, give them some lines of bad dialogue to read, out loud. Tape the results, and study how each of those persons delivers those bad lines. What are the odds that all 100 random people would give the exact same STYLE of line reading? Same speed of delivery; same tone; same, same, same, every time. What are the odds they'd all sound stupid, in the exact same way? The odds are probably better that you'll win the Lottery (without buying any tickets) and get hit by part of a visiting comet, in the same day. The fact that all the actors in this thing look and sound like perfect clones of one another is beyond highly suspicious, in my opinion. It tells me to look elsewhere, to assign due blame properly.Take that thought experiment a step farther. Take a quality actor like Forest Whitaker, and recalculate the odds. Here's a person whose past body of work clearly shows that they are more than capable of a wealth of fine, subtly nuanced, always entertaining, sometimes simply wonderful performances. A person who gave decades to study and practice, so that you completely buy into the illusion that this actor is who he or she is pretending to be, within the context of a given story. Or Barry Pepper &#150; Saving Private Ryan alone, in my mind, shows that he can act very well; and hold a viewer's attention; and make that viewer care about the character that he's portraying.What are the realistic odds that several trained actors with excellent prior credits, would all act in the EXACT same way? Specifically, that they would all look and sound like a parody of a mentally challenged person who was told to make fun of really, really bad actors. No way! It's beyond any statistical probability. It's simply not possible.Someone with a lot of power -- more power than any director, I'd suspect -- had to be treating this group of actors like mere puppets telling them what to do; when to do it; and exactly how to do it. A classic case of micro-management, followed by blaming the victims -- who always knew better, but were not allowed to disobey their orders.This person or persons had to be pulling everyone's strings, from just outside of the camera's field of view. I say that because I've been on over fifty sets, as an Extra -- the ideal fly on the wall situation, for seeing what REALLY happens on movie sets. What I saw, in a lot more cases than the bulk of the public would ever think was possible or likely, was the director or producer simply over-ruling an actor's acting decisions. In too many cases, quite rudely telling them No, no; that's wrong do it this way and then demonstrating. I'm talking big stars here, as well as highly respected character actors. It happens.Having seen directors do that, as if it were their sole prerogative, I have to wonder how much influence the financiers had, here?

I don't know, this movie is weird, funny, interesting, sad, it has a criticism for society and people in general, etc. The movie isn't all about the Pumpkin character; it focuses on the selfish Caroline and how she believes the world is at her feet. She has the perfect life friends, money, a family, beauty, she's popular, she has a handsome boyfriend, etc. She's perfect. But her perfect life makes her imperfect. I mean, she believes she can change things in other people's life just because it's her. At some point in the movie she believe she's Cupid , then she believes she can understand REAL pain (not her kind of pain which consists of not getting what she wants in life), and also she believes Pumpkin is suffering a lot while he is happy even with his condition. But the then movie takes a twist and demonstrates how Caroline has changed and finally has understood about people's feelings. Tragic events were necessary for her to become mature. But also, people had to experience terrible situations in order for her to be finally on her two feet (Kent's accident, having sex with Pumpkin, etc.).Her true feelings are really weird... at first she has repulsion for Pumpkin, but then she has symphaty for them which she confuses with compassion. Then she falls in love with him and finally, she has sex with him. What was that all about? I mean, I understand she was confused but changing drastically your feelings and preferences is not normal...something that leads me to believe that she had some kind of sickness that consists of being attracted physically and emotionally for people with special capacities (such as Pumpkin).So in the ending the things get more confusing... she still gets what she wants at other people's cost. Now Kent is invalid, Pumpkin is depressed because of her absence, the sorority house bitches lost their competition, etc. So maybe I didn't get the whole point of the move but that's what it makes it a great viewing experience. The movie throws you many situations for you to make your own conclusion. It also displays some socially incorrect behaviors and also shows displays of humanity and kindness. At some points I thought this was cheap exploitation and mockery for people like Pumpkin. Then I changed my mind and thought this was a dark comedy for teens. Then I believed it was a movie to display how disturbed a rich girl can be... The truth is that I enjoyed the whole movie and after it's ending, I came to the conclusion that you just have to make your interpretation of the movie. So I can say that Pumpkin is a movie that makes a critic against society and how it treats people like Pumpkin, but also demonstrates how this people are happy even with their situation. Also I came up with the conclusion that the movie tries to exploit the Caroline character. It's all about her and her development. Which I believe it's a very interesting, dark character.Christina Ricci's performance is simply great, she's at her best in this one. She can be tender, naive, bitchy, but also can demonstrate she is in pain, or that she can be blinded by love or confusion. Pumpkin was a great character and the actor who portrayed him was also at his best. The rest of the cast is okay. The direction is simple but fast paced. Pumpkin is a visually stunning and attractive movie. The soundtrack is perfect for the events. You can't get a better soundtrack in my opinion. The technical aspects of the movie should be treated apart as this movie focuses on the plot development instead.

The stereotypes that make this slapstick humor creates a great way for Uys to show the cultural differences between the Kalahari !Kung and Europeans.The premise of this movie is following of Xi in his adventure to rid his people of the evil thing (a coke bottle). Throughout his journey, Xi runs into the characters of the other sub-stories, a clumsy scientist, a school teacher, and a terrorist. Jamie Uys shows several different stereotypes using these characters and their interactions. These stereotypes included the damsel in distress, the unsuspecting hero, and the failing bad guy. Seeing Xi's reactions to different scenarios is absolutely hilarious. His reactions to seeing the school teacher dressing, and his first encounter with a car a great example of the stereotypes that Uys uses to show these cultural differences.The events that Jamie Uys has Xi go through seem to be ridiculous if not ignorant. Since most Europeans don't know much about Africa and its culture, one can only assume what this movie portrays is accurate. Uys adds to these stereotypes be having an Englishman voice over the !Kung language rather than subtitles giving a feel that !Kung are less superior than Europeans. I don't find this movie to be racist at all but rather an accurate portrayal of different cultures interactions with each other through different points of view.

They kill for reason! They kill because they know this is the right thing to do! They kill because they haven't got another choice!2) Story An interesting story of 1-11 heroes is shown in this movie!

Not only that but it's also distributed chaotically, so you have to decide from where it all starts and where it ends!

The movie was technically racist. However, despite the racism, the movie expressed it through many different views, and equally, seeming to make the racism in it okay simply because it was well rounded as if the director did it intentionally for satire. The comedy in the film also made the racism in the movie less serious, and rightfully so if the viewer is well informed.This film has its good points, and bad points, just like any other. However, I feel it's good points outweighed its bad points by far. The movie was technically racist. The director displayed the !Kung people as completely clueless, stupid, and unaware of the world around them. The white male was clueless and stupid as well, except he was aware of the world around him, which is worse. The woman was portrayed as the stereotypical female, that had to be catered to by males, but thought it was funny because she wasn't stupid and clueless but realized the stupidity of the males around her. It was also no surprise that the white main female character, white main male character, and lovable innocent !Kung character (Xi) ended up being the heroes. Everything about just about every character was in some way racist or stereotypical, but the director clearly pointed these things out, which made it hilarious.As a person in the modern world that wakes up at eight zero zero, I was not offended by the commentary. As a person who knows a little about Africa, I was not offended by the !Kung people being innocent and stupid simply because the director over did it so much so that a person almost cannot possibly think this is true of the world today. The only bizarre thing about the movie was the National Geographic style voice-over. However, I actually liked this simply because I hate subtitles because it gives me less time to notice the scene and actions of the characters.I recommend this movie for people with a sense of humor that actually do know about Africa. Having taking the Survey of World Literature course explicitly discussing Africa for 10 weeks, you learn a lot about it, so I knew when the director was being expressing stereotypes made towards Africa when I saw it. Those who are unaware of what really goes on in Africa will only let their ignorance be reinforced by false ideas. People who are aware of Africa and see the stereotypes, but have no sense of humor, will be easily angered. This is definitely a movie where a person needs to approach it with a laid-back attitude and those who don't will be told by those who do to lighten up.

We had to do a big project involving a time line, and when I was doing research for this project, it didn't really mean anything to me. It was all names, dates, and places. I can be a very visual learner, and every time I came upon a new event or person I'd try and find a picture of it\/them, as it helped me get a better idea of what happened. Still, what I read and learned truly didn't evoke any emotion in me.After we had finished and taken our big test, we got to watch this movie (after of course getting permission from all our parents seeing as it's rated R and we're in 8th grade). I cried at the end as did many people in my class, because the movie was so real, and what I (and I'm sure many people) felt for Col. Shaw and those soldiers was far deeper than anything else I'd felt when I was researching. Once I watched this, I looked back on my time line and I saw that I didn't include Ft. Wagner on it, I'm sure I'd read about it, but I didn't think it was important enough compared to Emancipation Proclimation, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, the Gettysburg Address, and all the other big events of 1863. When I looked it up in my book, I saw only a measly 2 paragraphs had been written about it. I figure that I would probably have never learned about or remembered this battle if it hadn't been for this movie.This movie has a different quality to it than most war movies have nowadays. Mostly, they're all gore and all-out violence, but this movie developed the characters so much that, in a sense, we felt we knew them. Even though everything about it wasn't explained, I learned so much from this movie. It was more effective than any lecture my teacher could've given or any book I could've read.I recommend this movie to any teacher looking to SHOW not TELL their students about the Civil War or any student interested in history, or really anyone looking for a good movie in general.

The ways the characters interact with each other are naturally. I feel like I am witnessing everything is going on in every single scene. Therefore, My mind reached the catharsis moment that the film produced. 3. I love the acting of both actors, Franka Potente (Sissi) and Benno Furmann (Bodo). Sissi has a great heart. She believes in what she feels. She is determined with what she believes that is the truth. Most of all, she can stand up for love. Benno is excellent for his acting as Bodo. I like the look of the character Bodo constructed. The masculinity of the character Bodo is reinforced by Benno acting and the directing of Tykwer.

Imagine it a brand new set of characters (less money to pay in salary after Schieder turned down a part), a major endorsement from a well-known attraction (Sea World), the idea of one shark in a confined space with lots of sea life and people and the gimmick of 3-D. What could be better?Let's start, albeit briefly, with the 3-D gimmick. That's all it is, a gimmick. Let's face it when you shoot in 3-D, any future viewing in anything but 3-D is going to look pretty bad. It's obvious no one stopped to think about that in 1983.

The point is viewing a 3-D movie in 2-D doesn't work.As if those weren't enough, anyone remotely familiar with the Jaws franchise would be ill to see what it has become. Mike Brody, in the course of five years, has gone from teenager to the buff Dennis Quaid. In the same time frame, young Sean has grown from a lad to a rather strapping college man. How that happens in the space of a couple years is beyond me. And then there's the obligatory mention of why Sean doesn't like the water. Apparently, his adventure in the last film coupled with his father's exploits have made the guy a little paranoid. Wonderful, great, completely reasonable. But, think about it Mike was with Sean in Jaws 2. Why does he take the job at Sea World instead of staying on solid ground? (Funnily enough, in the next film, Sean will wind up being a cop in Amity, only to meet his fate at the hands&#133;er, teeth, of another shark on the water.)Then there's the little fact of these shark's seeking out the Brody clan after the events in the first film. At one point, I had which shark in the family died in which movie all worked out. That was back when I had more time on my hands than I care to remember. This movie revolves around the 10-foot-long kid shark and the 35-foot-long mother. Extrapolating just a little bit, if the first movie's villain was the father, and the second was a son\/daughter, then who, exactly, is after Mama Brody in the fourth? The flipping grandparents? You've got to be joking me. A family of shark's following around a family of people no matter where they go is insanely insipid. I'm not even going to point out the folly of diving into the water where you know there's a shark in the middle of the night, putting the shark on attraction, having an undersea control center and the absurd idea a shark can swim backward&#133;wait a second, I think I just did.

Her goal is to create a work that melds tenderness with horror. I feel a great deal of sympathy for the lead character. To be perfectly honest, this film is a perfect depiction of childhood. The world of the adolescent is not some hallmark teen flick. It is banal, seedy, desperate, violent and senseless with a few fleeting moments of tenderness. The filmmaker wants to show what others block out of their youth. She wants to shine an un-blinking gaze on the tragedy of failed sex and communication in our society. In her interviews she discusses how lovemaking should be simple, normal and healthy between two people that love each other; but the reality is that it's not. It's fraught with complexities, revulsion, need, identity, pushing, pulling, definition. This act we are so quick to hide from the public eye, is what defines our most intense flaws and hopes.That is why the deflowering scene is the set piece. The length of it is meant to underscore the simple, ineffable horror of a girl forced to watch her sister giving up her virginity and her personality to an act of degradation.

He goes to Kaplan's hotel room in which he finds a photograph. Thornhill gets a taxi and goes to the General Assembly building. Townsend is supposed to give a speech there. Thornhill asks to speak to Townsend the man who comes is not the man at the house. Thornhill shows Townsend the photograph that he had gotten. At that same moment one of the fake Townsend's accomplices throws a knife into Townsend's back. He dies. Thornhill takes the knife out of his back, which means people think he killed the real Townsend. He runs for his life. Thornhill gets on a train heading to Chicago. There he meets Eve Kendall.

Throughout the whole film I found myself laughing at the slapstick situation and the mocking the lack of coordination between Western culture and traditional African culture. I felt that the documentary style commentary was a highlight. I didn't see it as an offensive slam against the !Kung culture, but instead a highlight on the satire of how the West views Africans, like uncivilized people. Through out the film, the !Kung people were portrayed as naive and primitive and some aspects of the film didn't add up to the reality of how the !Kung people live, which took away from the overall credibility. The huts and lack of social interactions, for instance, were inconsistent compared to reality.Overall I didn't find this movie to be extremely racist. Although it pokes fun at both Whites and Africans, it does it in a manner that is light hearted and playful. The true !Kung language is used and the people are able to sustain themselves throughout the film. On the other hand, the Western whites are seen as goofy and uptight. The language of the !Kung people, although was not subtitled, was still an authentic language, not just clicks and noise, which added to my thinking it was not a racist movie. I think that both of the downfalls of each society of overplayed and emphasized for comedic sake. Because of it's goofy and slapstick humor, this film is accessible to almost anyone, whether or not they are familiar with African culture or not. It would be helpful, however, to be aware of what was going on in the world during this time period. Understanding the time period would be key in explaining why the terrorist was a Russian. Overall, I was enjoyed this film and would suggest it to others.

Jackson's haunting is open to a plethora of explanations, some of them not supernatural. This may be fine for literature but doesn't work in a horror flick.The Legend of Hell House has much going for it -- the best of which is its superb cast. Only seven characters appear, and all are filled with solid secondary players. In three blink-and-you'll-miss-'em roles are Roland Culver (Dead of Night, The Pallisers), Peter Bowles (To the Manor Born, The Irish R.M.), and in a very thankless part, Michael Gough (Man in the White Suit, Batman). Culver's character gets the ball rolling by offering to pay each of the members of this expedition one hundred thousand pounds to get to the bottom of the hauntings of the Belasco mansion, which has recently become one of his assets.The meat of the movie is carried by an fine four-piece ensemble. Lionel Barrett (Clive Revill) is the scientist who has long examined paranormal phenomena and has never seen a supernatural explanation proved. He believes in some sort of natural residual human energy. To suck the energy out of the atmosphere he lugs along an enormous machine (whose workings are never quite explained), and his wife (Gayle Hunnicutt). Two psychics accompany the Barretts. Miss Tanner (lovely Pamela Franklin, who had an impressive movie career until she dropped utterly from sight around 1980) channels spirits of the dead. Ben Fischer (Roddy McDowall) is a medium who manifests physical phenomena. All the actors approach their roles earnestly. Whatever nonsense they rattle off, there's nary a twinkle in their eyes.The movie is pervaded by a wonderful sense of paranoia. Fischer, the sole survivor of the previous expedition twenty years earlier, believes Hell House is evil and he shuts himself off (apparently being a medium is like being a water tap). He'll sign off on any suitable explanation that will get him out of the house alive to collect the loot. Miss Tanner is all empathetic goodness, hoping to lay the spirits peacefully to rest. All the spirits want, she believes, is understanding (even when the spirits seem to be trying to rip her apart piece by piece). The scientist remains grumpily skeptical while plates and fireplaces explode all around him. He dismisses the dropping of occasional chandeliers (the house is as hung with handy chandeliers as an apple tree is with fruit) by suspecting one medium or the other of making it happen via their energy fields. And the scientist's wife is utterly frustrated as her husband caresses his machine more affectionately than her.The script is thick with veiled comments. Everyone seems to mean more than they're saying. And they're all lousy with distrust -- except gullible Miss Tanner, who will apparently believe any line any spirit feeds her (but won't believe any of the warnings the others give her to leave the house pronto). There are homicidal cats, empty sheets that adopt human forms, disembodied voices, mummified bodies in chains, possessions, ghost sex. The only thing lacking is an old servant making cryptic comments as he\/she ladles out the soup, but McDowall's character provides cryptic comments about things that happened twenty years earlier (he makes the previous expedition sound like it would make an even better movie).The often wacky photography (such as two people talking in profile in extreme close-up on opposite ends of the wide-screen) heightens a mood of claustrophobia in the enormous Belasco mansion, which is only slightly smaller than Citizen Kane's. The ending, when it's discovered which of old Mister Belasco's shortcomings leads to a haunting that slays just about anyone who crosses the threshold, seems a bit silly, but don't take it as a disappointment. It's like the end of a roller-coaster ride when the cars have to go along a flat stretch to pull into the station. Everything before that is a lot of fun. Merry Christmas.

The truth about this film is that it is not just the tired old vampire story that so many movies seem to be following these days. BLADE not only goes where no other vampire movie has before but does it with style. This film even dares to change the background of vampires in some ways, making it more believable and gripping.In this film you may expect some guy hunting vampires in ancient tombs or supernatural worlds. Personally, I think that the best thing about this film is that it brings the story closer to home. The story includes night clubs, even outdoor parks and places we visit sometimes regularly. That is probably the best thing that the creators could have done to the story, again, making it more believable. The action in this film also is not anything like what most people would expect. The fight scenes are extremely well done and planned out perfectly while keeping it so that it doesn't go too far.When watching this movie, I can't stress enough watching it with an open mind. While it is a vampire story, it doesn't follow the guidelines of one. So if you are going to watch it and compare it to every other vampire movie that you may like, you won't enjoy it as much.But all in all, its brilliant.
