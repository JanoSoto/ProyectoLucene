[{"date":"24 June 2006","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Election really works. It's not often a comedy comes out that presents us with both really good acting, good directing, but also a decent script and intelligent humor. Matthew Broderck and Reese Witherspoon shine with such humor and insight into their characters, it's almost as though they were born to play those roles. The story is very unique and makes no attempt at being pretentious, and just tells it the way it's meant to be told. Witherspoon's character, Tracy Flick, remains one of the most memorable characters in the history of comedy, as well as her own performance, which was snubbed at the Oscars for a nomination.The movie is about Jim McAllister, told from his perspective, as he takes us through both his life and the school's most vicious students. McAllister is a respected high school teacher who partakes in many extra curricular activities including student council. As his own life slowly falls apart, Jim McAllister becomes obsessed with ruining Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) and her reputation as the smartest girl in the school by making her lose the upcoming election for school president. Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell co-star as Paul and Tammy Metzler who both run for president, ruining Flick's chances of winning.Acclaimed director Alexander Payne creates a subtle work that communicates a highly typical and hysterical idea about jealousy, lust and betrayal. There's much more to the story than a simple back-and-forth feud between the teacher and student. The deep psychology of the characters often becomes the motive of a much bigger problem. McAllister's lack of luck is a result of his own clumsy behavior, proving that revenge is not always the best choice. Tracy Flick's troubled past comes into play to fully produce a character who's stuck-up and perfect in every way. And although Election is a satire, the goofy antics of almost each scene makes you scream in laughter. Truly, a movie to watch to uplift the mood.The unique style of Election makes it one of the best movies of 1999. The simple, yet sophisticated screenplay and Reese Witherspoon's career-best performance keeps the movie really high on the list of Best Movies. Each second of the movie is entertaining and it never seems to be too much. Avoiding clichés, Alexander Payne found a way to tell a typical story and intertwine some pretty funny ideas about society, as well as hilarious characters that we just love to hate. An amazing movie. Audience-friendly for everyone and anyone who enjoys a good flick.
