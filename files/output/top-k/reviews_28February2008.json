Ahh, Ryan. I don't know anything about Ryan, I don't care. The man means nothing to me; he's just a name. But if, you know, if going to finding him so he can go home, if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, well then, then that's my missionI am sure other reviewers who have reviewed 'Saving Private Ryan' (SPR) have rated it as the Best War Movie Ever Made and I agree. To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg used all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Greatest things about SPR are first of all the sensational, highly awarded and celebrated camera work that actually gives audience the feeling of being in the battlefield too. That's what makes the film such a thrilling, vivid and incredible experience.It puts the the viewer from the comfortable living room chair to out there and puts him\/her go through this hell and every nightmarish detail that's part of it. Other marvelous thing is a good story, little extraordinary and different from what the usual war films normally have. That's what keeps the movie interesting all the way.SPR is just outstanding. Spielberg thrusts the viewer into the Normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this. The film's opening scene has been billed as the best D-Day scene of all time and it rightly deserves that. The attack on Dog Green Sector, Omaha Beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle (notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours). Also one of the things that stand out most in this film is the effects.You experience the sound of bullet whizzes,explosions,and the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town. A brilliant innovation is the color reduction (over 50%) which makes you really believe it is 1944. Music is used to great effect in moments of calm. The brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life, yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of Hitler and Nazi ideology.The storyline is a real strength and the characters & acting are superb. Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife; only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command. He is well supported by Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), who maintains discipline within the squad. But some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one life. Though every man has a mother, you cannot help feel that Ryan (Matt Damon) must be saved out of decency. Ryan himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered brothers in spite of the disaster to befall his family. Finally, Steamboat Willie humanizes the Germans when pleading for his life. Befriended by Upham, he is released, yet returns to battle. His death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in war.Only a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of SPR. Often outnumbered, the Germans conquered most of Europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle, something missing in their clumsy attack on Ramelle. And tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports, so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily. A role for the British was lacking; sadly a Hawker Typhoon could not be used to bomb the Tiger tank. Another historical inaccuracy people have noticed is the Church tower in Ramelle which, according to German tactics,would of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy but I don't think it will detract from the film. In fact, a good knowledge of WW2 history is important in order to place this film in context. Overall, this tactical and human story within the carnage of WW2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies. And don't miss the message in Captain Miller's last words James... earn this. Earn it. The question this film poses is Is it truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person???? This is the same question which Private Reiben asks to Hanks. The whole dialog go like this Pvt.Reiben You want to explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?Capt.Miller Anyone wanna answer that?Medic Wade Hey, Reiben think about the poor bas***d's mother. Pvt.

Interesting even more, then that upon discovering this was a remake shortly after I had seen it, and genuinely disliked it myself, that I would have new ammunition to use against this picture. If a film is made in the contemporary era of post 1960, why bother to remake it unless the idea was so brilliant and the initial execution was so poor. I haven't seen the original but from my own mind and other people's writing, it seems it was good idea, executed well; so why redo it? In 1980s Hollywood, the buddy genre it would seem enjoyed a strong series of successions. In 1999, are we still entertained by wise-cracking buddy formulas? The Rush Hour films say 'no, we are not'. But Gloria goes ahead anyway and by the time the credits have begun to run, what could have been set up, presented and told in about forty minutes has taken an hour and a half. Such is the nature of the film, Gloria (Stone) runs around the city with kid Nicky (Figueroa), for just about the entire runtime; getting into mis-adventures; scraps and situations oh, and the kid does a whole load of annoying moaning in-between. Gloria is a film that outstays its welcome pretty sharpish; the idea for the film is pair together a gangster's moll and a kid whose family was on the wrong end of the gangster's she's connected to and have them ride around the city for a day or two as we watch them; that's it.It seems strange Gloria and Nicky would even hang around for as long as they do. Gloria has to be in Miami for a parole hearing in a couple of days but they stick around anyway despite being able to go whenever they please after Gloria cashes in some stolen jewellery. During the course of the film, Gloria and Nicky should've learnt a few harsh lessons about life; they should've been able to know a new something or two about themselves Gloria merely picks up on the importance of friends; something she's probably never had before given her role in society and the life she had chosen. Likewise; Nicky is only seven and is thus too young to learn any serious, valuable lessons about life &#150; all he comes away with is a deceased family and a new mother figure. But that's all he needs; that's all he cares about someone to help him along; someone to cook and clean for him; someone to tuck him in at night hence why the scenes where they share beds and talk about love are just disturbing since Gloria has adopted that motherly role.But the harshest lessons in life occur for Gloria in the film's set up; ironically the films best part. The idea of a seven year old and a gangster's moll trying to survive the gangsters gets old after about ten minutes so everything before then is quite fun. There's a good shootout at an apartment after a Hispanic family fall foul of the gangsters and that taboo of child killings is toyed with somewhat (albeit off screen) but the scene emphasises Hollywood's inability to branch out of course the victims are Hispanic; they couldn't be white, American, could they? Also, there are extensive readings into the 80s buddy movie and how the formula of white guy\/black guy works and revolves around one another. There is Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, 48 Hrs. and the rest here, Gloria (white) adopts the 'white' role and the seven year old is the binary opposite non-white, male, a child, etc. But Gloria learns in the elevator coming down that she has wasted her life; she has just paid the price for being a submissive bimbo\/moll the instance after she is thrown out of her own apartment by the man who 'loves' her. She has been in jail for too long and now what was once hers is now someone else's.Initially, Gloria might have saved the child just to antagonise the guy who has taken everything from her. There is that fear of harm coming to the child but initially, I feel that is vacant. And so, what follows is a series of pranks and situations that are not interesting; not scripted well and are just rather bland. The kid moans a lot I'm hungry; I'm thirsty; I'm tired; I need the toilet. and that gets very repetitive &#150; was it done for laughs? I hope not. Secondly, the film's buddy partnership however quaint does not work either bad acting, bad script and too many scenes that feel they should be heart warming but are just duds. Especially disappointing considering the 'motherly' role that is very much present. In between all this, Gloria gets the chance to dish out some bad advice for the scamp. After receiving good advice from his own father, Gloria fills up Nicky's head with things like Life is a dream, it only lasts a minute and When you grow up, you're gonna make lots of love, drink and gamble. Has that elevator ride down in the first fifteen minutes not taught her anything? How sad.Gloria's best bit is a car chase but that is disappointing in its own right in the sense it is a complete rip-off of 1954's Seven Samurai; the Kurosawa classic. The editing and pacing of the two cars involved is like-for-like meaning Gloria's best bit is actually a copy of something else; again, how sad. By the time Gloria has made up and changed her mind in the penultimate scene and you see them walk off into the sunset (so to speak), you may have your head in your hands &#150; anti-climatic and too dull to be anything special, Gloria is one to avoid.

After receiving good advice from his own father, Gloria fills up Nicky's head with things like Life is a dream, it only lasts a minute and When you grow up, you're gonna make lots of love, drink and gamble. Has that elevator ride down in the first fifteen minutes not taught her anything? How sad.Gloria's best bit is a car chase but that is disappointing in its own right in the sense it is a complete rip-off of 1954's Seven Samurai; the Kurosawa classic. The editing and pacing of the two cars involved is like-for-like meaning Gloria's best bit is actually a copy of something else; again, how sad. By the time Gloria has made up and changed her mind in the penultimate scene and you see them walk off into the sunset (so to speak), you may have your head in your hands &#150; anti-climatic and too dull to be anything special, Gloria is one to avoid.

The most noticeable feature is the better than average script and acting. The script, by indie film making hero to be John Sayles is quality and the acting fine too, with Robert Forster making a charismatic lead and the bad folk suitably hissable. There's lots of wry humour, as well as quality alligator carnage. It is a ferocious beast, and the effects work is excellent, making the film a real treat whenever it gets down to business. Unfortunately the film is pretty predictable and though the script is fun, I feel that the film could have used a little more mayhem. Still, its entertaining stuff, and far superior to its sequel. The sequels pretty much only there for bad movie lovers.

Ephron based the script on her own semi-factual book, an account of her failed second marriage to writer Carl Bernstein, and she employs a world-weary comedic approach to life's upsets that will strike many viewers as natural and funny. Unfortunately, Streep doesn't seem invested in playing this ordinary character, and she's all too cogent and condescending towards everyone involved (her comic timing is heavy-handed as well, though this may be Nichols' fault). Nicholson is typically appealing--he energizes the material--although his shambling about could be indicative of his feelings toward this project he ducks out of sight whenever the momentum drags. **1\/2 from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"28 February 2008","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Screenwriter Nora Ephron and director Mike Nichols make an easy--if unsurprising--cinematic match with this dryly-wrought comedy-drama about a sensible lady (typecast Meryl Streep) marrying a known womanizer (typecast Jack Nicholson) who is unable to change his wandering ways after the ceremony.
