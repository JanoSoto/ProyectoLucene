[{"date":"11 August 2000","score":"","review":"  Election is a film which seems to be trying to do many things, and unfortunetly, I'm sorry to say, it fails to achieve any of them. The film portrays itself as a comedy. However it also seems to be tackling some deeper issues such as lesbianism and coping when everything you love has been stripped away from you. I therefore couldn't find anything particularly amusing about it. All this would be fine though if the film tackled these issues well. Unfortunetly it doesn't. These things are just glossed over, nothing is gone into in any great depth and at no point do you feel that the film makers have taken an issue as far as they could have done. Also we are left in some doubt as to how we are supposed to feel about the various characters. I assumed that I was suppose to like and empathise with at least one of them. It was a real shame that I couldn't do that because they are all characters who you grow to hate or find annoying as the film progresses. Ultimately Election is a film which tries it's hardest to be funny while at the same time dealing with some issues and giving a message. It fails to do any of these things and would have been perhaps better to have adopted the old adage of 'less is more', one to avoid.
