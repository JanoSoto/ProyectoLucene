","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"29 September 2014","score":"","review":" Rumble in the Bronx is a pretty fun Hong Kong martial arts action comedy. Directed by Stanley Tong, the movie is about Ma Hon Keung (Jackie Chan), a Hong Kong native whom comes to New York to help his Uncle (Bill Tung) sell his supermarket business to new owner, Elaine (Anita Mui). While, helping out, Keung found himself in a rivalry with the local street gang, leaded by Tony (Marc Akerstream) that leaded to a series of street brawls. Before the plot could get tiresome. The plot takes a left turn by having one of the member of the street gang, Angelo (Garvin Cross) gets involved in an illegal diamond deal gone bad forcing the small-time gangsters and Keung to team up against the much larger and more effective criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord). I have mixed feelings about how the plot turn into another diamond heist movie. The first part of the movie really fits the title card. The second part, remind me of another movie series starring Jackie Chan, the Police Stories franchise. I was just really disappointment that the gang and Keung would end up, being friendly with each other, after nearly killing each other in the first half. After all, Tony nearly kill Keung with broken glass. Even today, that scene alone, is pretty damn brutal. The action scenes are really awesome to watch. Jackie Chan is famous for always doing his own stunts and you see his best, here. Great fight choreography, it really look like they honestly hit each other hard. Great use of normal household props. I always think that Jackie Chan is the best of irregular weapons. It was fun, watching him beat people up with skis, shopping carts, and other materials. I love the big building to building jump. I just wish, they didn't show the same shot, three times through four different cameras angles. It just took me out of the film. The hovercraft scenes were crazy to watch. Can't believe that, Jackie Chan was hurt the whole time and wearing a cast. Jackie Chan's right foot lands at a bad angle after jumping onto the hovercraft in the first scene, causing a serious injury that would not heal for the remainder of filming. The shot still made it into the finished movie. Like most Jackie Chan movies, the outtakes show how dangerous these stunts were. The lead actress and several stunt doubles were also injured during the shooting of a motorcycle stunt, with several people suffering broken limbs and ankles. The movie wasn't all action. It did have some funny moments that hit the funny bone for me. I love the two way mirror gag. Jackie Chan's high spirits and infectious personality made the movie character likable and not bland. You can tell that Jackie Chan was indeed, having fun, making the movie. I have to say, the supporting cast were pretty good. Francise Yip as Nancy was very attractive and had some kickass moments. I love the scene where she's dancing in bra & panties lingerie in a tiger cage. She had more depth than most martial artist movies, female leads. I don't know why Anita Mui was in the film, but her premise didn't hurt the film. Still, her character could had been cut from the film. Morgan Lam as Danny is questionable. I didn't hate his performance, but he was really given some awful lines to say. I also found it, funny that the filmmakers had his character play a video game console without a game in it. Add that to the blooper reel with the baby dummy. I do like how much work, they put in, to make the movie seem like it was set in the Bronx, even if in reality, the movie was filmed in Vancouver, B.C. Most scenes, it does look like it could be set in New York City, but in other scenes, the whole mountains and beach fronts are clear giveaways that it isn't. The gang doesn't look realistic as well. In reality, all those people of different races wouldn't be in the same gang. Most of them look like badly dress 1990s pirates. Another odd thing about the movie is the English dubbing. The original spoken dialog consisted of all of the actors speaking their native language most of the time. In the completely undubbed soundtrack, Jackie Chan actually speaks his native Cantonese while Françoise Yip and Morgan Lam speak English. All of the original dialog was intended to be dubbed over in the international and Hong Kong film markets, and New Line cinema overdubbed and slightly changed the original English dialog. While, the English version is workable; it's a bit off-keyed. The US version does have a few differs than the Hong Kong version as 17 minutes of scenes were cut. Most of them were add on scenes of already establish shots. There were a few entire scenes cut that help explain why Keung was often attack by the street gang. The English version also replaced the song that Jackie Chan had over the closing credits with the song Kung Fu by the band Ash, the lyrics of which mention Jackie Chan, as well as other Asian figures and characters ubiquitous in the west. Overall The movie was very successful, and help bring its star, Jackie Chan into the American mainstream. It's a must watch for any Martial Artist action movie fan.

The movie is hardly comfy, though. The last act gets nasty, and a climactic fight between Gibson (who gets the worst of it) and some high-kicking villain is ugly. The chemistry between its leads, make this a playful, entertaining sequel.Sequel Includes a smashed car full of Krugerrands, a hillside house blown off its stilts and a bomb set under a toilet, the point of Lethal Weapon 2 is that Mel Gibson and Danny Glover get to race around in all that chaos, acting crazy.If you liked Lethal Weapon, you'll like Lethal Weapon 2; it's almost as simple as that.Worse than the first, but better than the rest. it's nice to have a big-audience action movie attacking apartheid and the slaughter of sea mammals, instead of acting as an enlistment poster for the Army Air Corps, local vigilante groups or the reopening of the Vietnam War, the sentiments don't really transcend the car crashes.Pesci's terrific comic performance really gooses the proceedings, but the film also works because of its exciting action content, the presence of Patsy Kensit as Riggs' love interest, and the series-best interplay between the two lead characters. Despite the film's anti-South African stance, it was passed uncut by the South African censors and became a major financial success in that country. .The films' writer, Shane Black, walked away from this sequel after he decided to kill off the character of Martin Riggs. Warner Brothers disagreed with that decision, and he left the project.The body count is 33, the highest of the 'Lethal Weapon' series. During production, Richard Donner was shocked when Mel Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast. Despite his alcohol problems, Gibson was known for his professionalism and punctuality. In the original script, the South Africans were even more vicious. At one point, they even torture Riggs in much the same manner as Mr. Joshua in the original. Its a Strong and funny sequel but if went with original ending would be even more classic.Still its one of the finest examples of the genre its a Kick ass sequel by concentrating on the often frustrating, funny relationship between the three men, the film gains in humour but loses some of the momentum and panache which distinguished the original.Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Richard Donner have all stated that this is their favourite film of the Lethal Weapon series.
