Mox (James Van Deer Beek) is excellent as the second string quarterback who emerges from the bench to give the team win after win. And Tweeder (Scott Caan) was so funny he was great as the team rebel (he is also actor James Caan's son so you know great acting is in his blood.) And Billy Bob (Ron Lester) who is the over weight slow kinda guy in the film but as usual he is made fum of by the announcers and the coaches. But he is a wonderful person and a fantastic football player as it shows in the film. Although i haven't had the chance play highschool football since i am only 13 but this film really made me think about sports and how no matter how could you are, it can all end with one accident and be over like that. But anyways this is a must see movie for anybody and a must have movie for the jocks or the average guy.

I agree with the disparaging comments re Jar Jar Binks (a bit overdone), however the whole movie is excellent.As Lucas states, SW4 was brown, SW5 was black and white, SW6 was green (Endor)....I suppose SW1 is gold.   Many chinese and european themes in the main palace.   Superb rendition of politics and visuals in Coruscant.Differences from other Star Wars movies?  This one was more land and city and underwater-based, where the first three episodes had a lot of space battles.   The interpretation of a massed battlefield was excellent, as were the palace shots.Remember, this episode chronicles the old Republic, and does a remarkably good job.  The only thing missing was a patriarch figure; the one provided in Jar Jar's king wasn't adequate. The pod race was excellent, including the story surrounding it, the crowds, the announcer, and the results.I have no idea why people said this was the worst of the Star Wars films; I have seen the original 3 movies over 30 times each and find this one a deserving addition to the Star Wars universe.   I am disappointed that I let the negative reviews keep me away from the movie until July.Liam Neeson was the strongest part of the film; he carried it with a quiet, powerful dignity that helped.   The boy Anakin was a great piece of casting; he was terrific.   Especially appealing was his success in spacefighting.To improve?  I would have preferred an older queen figure; the marketing boys were at it trying to sell to a young audience, and the lack of older powerful figures did not help convey the regal importance of the era being chronicled in this first episode.   And 70% less Jar Jar would have helped. He was at his best in the battle scene.

However, there really should be no comparison. For me, Ryan was a formulaic forgettable piece of Spielberg product - a kind of Raiders of the Lost Ark for grownups where the Germans get killed for real and we're all expected to stand up and cheer and reach for our hankies when directed. If John Wayne were alive, it would've been tailor-made for him. I never was much of a John Wayne fan.Line is a completely different ball of wax, and one that confounds many viewers and reviewers alike. You either love it or hate it. Count me squarely in the former category. I've seen a lot of movies about war and wartime, and this now goes to the top of my list. While some find it instantly forgettable, others (myself included) find it impossible to dislodge from our memories.This is not to say it's perfect on all levels, but for me it worked perfectly as a whole in what (at least I think) set out to do. I found Malick's direction to be flawless, marveling in, and applauding, his choices at virtually every turn.The cinematography is stunning, and contribute to a number of scenes that bear comparisons to classic moments in film history. My favorite, and one that will linger in my memory along with the ice battle from Nevsky is the sun emerging from the clouds and illuminating a hill where the Americans are searching for a hidden Japanese bunker. I am in awe of this thirty-second clip - not only is it gorgeous, but the film deals with this in a sublimely understated manner - there is a brief pause while the sides wonder in, and reflect on, the significance of the event perhaps both in terms of it's meaning for the task at hand and in a larger context. This is emblematic of the rest of the movie, nothing is going to hit you over the head - Malick offers no definitive answers, but rather poses the questions in a fascinating and thought-provoking manner.There are many, many more unforgettable scenes along these lines - the opening and closing shots, three men hiding behind a tree while hundreds of Japanese draw closer - reminds me of the final shot from Aguirre; the battle scenes were on par with those from Ran. The depictions of battle are highly stylized, unlike those from Ryan, but I think were appropriate to the dream-like context of the rest of the movie.For me, it was more a movie about the fundamental questions of being, set during wartime, than a strictly literal snapshot from Guadalcanal. Viewed in the former light it is a movie to treasure. In the latter, I can understand how it can seem to be a confusing and disappointing mess.My only complaints were a few casting problems - Travolta simply did not work in what would've been a bizarre choice under the best of circumstances, and the cameos at every turn do get a bit distracting, such as Clooney's two minutes near the end (although I'm always thankful when Clooney is limited to two minutes ;-)). My viewing companion remarked that it's too bad Kevin Bacon wasn't in the cast, or the 'Bacon game' could've moved to the next level.Still, across the board the rest of the cast is excellent, with Penn, Nolte and Caviezel standing out. Much has been said about the characters not being fully developed, and I agree. I disagree at this serving to the film's detriment, however, as we are given glimpses of lives forever altered by this battle, and consistent with the voiceover ruminations about all men sharing one soul. In this respect it breaks from conventional wisdom concerning war movies, and I think is all the more remarkable for it.It does also seem, to some degree, to overlay a Vietnam sensibility on a WWII setting. I've seen criticism that the general mood at the time was more patriotic and sacrificing - that the this is futile remarks weren't appropriate. Yet, when viewed in their intended context, I can imagine that sending row upon row of men as machine gun fodder to take a piece of dirt must have evoked the same feeling among soldiers at Guadalcanal as it did in Vietnam.That said, it is not strictly an antiwar movie, nor is it a movie glorifying war - for this you must draw your own conclusions.

Most people will likely be put off the film because of some of the subject matter - a shame, because in doing so they fail to realize a daring and disturbing plot, excellent acting, and genuinely fine direction.  Exactly how does a director make a pedophile into a sympathetic character?  Not very easily, especially since most people prefer to see such people as one-dimensional monsters.  By adding depth to such a heinous character, showing that people are more than their actions, however disgusting, Solondz shakes the very fabric of our happy society, exposing an underbelly that is not one-dimensional, but one which is frighteningly like our own.  It is only when our demons are fleshed out, made realistic, that we become uncomfortable with them, when they no longer maintain their safe, cartoonish\/thrill-ride quality.  This film takes such huge risks, I can only hope that audiences, who have been spoon-fed such trite rubbish as Armageddon and The Phantom Menace, can appreciate its dark genius.  Pacing becomes problematic at times, especially when the story follows the sister's parents.  Some of the imagery is quite disturbing, and the moovie will definitely not appeal to everyone.  And contrary to other reviews, this film does not promote pedophilia, any more than sex education promotes teen sex.  This film challenges its audience in ways very few films can.

Exactly how does a director make a pedophile into a sympathetic character?  Not very easily, especially since most people prefer to see such people as one-dimensional monsters.  By adding depth to such a heinous character, showing that people are more than their actions, however disgusting, Solondz shakes the very fabric of our happy society, exposing an underbelly that is not one-dimensional, but one which is frighteningly like our own.  It is only when our demons are fleshed out, made realistic, that we become uncomfortable with them, when they no longer maintain their safe, cartoonish\/thrill-ride quality.  This film takes such huge risks, I can only hope that audiences, who have been spoon-fed such trite rubbish as Armageddon and The Phantom Menace, can appreciate its dark genius.  Pacing becomes problematic at times, especially when the story follows the sister's parents.  Some of the imagery is quite disturbing, and the moovie will definitely not appeal to everyone.

But, of course, the biggest detraction is, ironically, the praise. For, when you're about to watch a movie that has five-star reviews in every publication, and has entered the IMDb top 20, then actually seeing it is bound to be an anti-climax. Even Citizen Kane didn't grab me the first time round due to this effect. Yet having said all that, The Matrix IS a good movie - I gave it seven out of ten. Maybe I'm weird, but the film contained no concept or twist that I haven't already thought of, no surprise twist, nothing I didn't expect. Why do all Hollywood films need to contain at least one scene where characters do a humourous double-take? Lastly, the moral at the end was forcing it down the viewer's throat and a slight to the intelligence, but these were the only truly jarring points. The characters were refreshing three, or at least two-dimensional, with only a couple of the cast there as the destined to be cannon fodder variety. Direction and lighting is excellent throughout, if a little showy, and the structure is maintained well. For a film that is roughly one hour exposition, one hour pure action, it holds together very well.
