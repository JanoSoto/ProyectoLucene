It will appeal to teenagers and a few college kids, but not many adults would get anything out of this film. That is fine as far as I see it.  There are enough Julia Roberts and Sylvester Stallone flicks out there to keep the over 30 crowd happy.The major problem I have with this film, is that the girl who is supposed to be a geek would never have a problem dating in the first place.  Lets see...., she is pretty, she has a good body, great skin and hair, and she can't find a date.  C'mon now. Just because she wears glasses, and enjoys painting she is an outcast?  This premise would have made more sense, if an overweight girl was picked.  Everyone knows that the overweight kids are always the ones who are picked on.  Otherwise, this is a decent movie.  The Real World tie-in was rather funny (I guess I am a sucker for anything that makes fun of MTV's shows).If you are a high school student looking for a good date movie, check this flick out. If you are an adult I don't advise checking this out, especially if you are looking for Gone with the Wind.

The man responsible for such definitive and great teen films such as this one and PRETTY IN PINK, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB is still possessed by the HOME ALONE formula. I mean after HOME ALONE hit it big, he made HOME ALONE 2 LOST IN NEW YORK which was the same slapstick formula but set against the background of NEW YORK, DENNIS THE MENACE the same slapstick formula set against the background of a Hank Ketcham comic strip, BABY's DAY OUT the same slapstick formula only with a BABY!!! 101 DALMATIONS, the same slapstick formula only this time with Glenn Close and a bunch of dogs tagged on, FLUBBER the same slapstick formula only this time it has Robin Williams to make funny faces and green snot. The list goes on. Back in the 80's, John Hughes was an icon. He truly complemented the teenage experience with his terrific movies with Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. But his greatest movie is FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF! This is the movie everyone remembers to the fullest and can fully quote scenes. Its just such a feel good teen movie, unlike the crap we see today with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Matthew Broderick is awesome and charismatic as the title character. He gives us inspiration  to take things easy and not treat life too seriously. I loved Jeffrey Jones' portrayal of Mr.Rooney. The scenes with him in it are pure comic gold.  He's perfect as the evil principal who'd do anything to see Ferris fail. Jennifer Grey is terrific as the sister who hates Ferris' existence because he gets away with everything. She's hilarious. She should have never got that nose job.   There are so many memorable scenes in this movie. John Hughes knows how to direct. I liked the scene that focused on the faces of the students in the classroom as they hear a boring lecture from none other than Ben Stein. I liked the riotously scenes with Mr.Rooney and his assistant Grace. The parade sequence where Ferris Bueller lip syncs is a classic. I rewind that part at least 15 times every time I see it. And I love the dance those people do on the steps. MY FAVORITE SCENE OF ALL TIME IN THAT MOVIE the kicking scene. Every Ferris Bueller fan should know what I'm talking about. It's just so hilarious and the perfect comic timing is so there. It's just hysterical. FERRIS BUELLER is a movie that defined our generation and I'll never forget it. Thank you John Hughes for such a great movie Quit the Disney movie remakes do something GREAT like you used to.

Kevin Spacey was in his best form, I really think this is the perfect role for him. Annette Bening was great, and her hair was even better.

He created such a great feel and vision it's hard to not want to see it again just for the images. I think schools should consider showing this movie to film students to show them how to completely create a mood with such few gimmicks.

The plot is rather simple, and it makes you wonder how come nobody had thought of it before. Meet Dr Richard Walker a successful   surgeon (?), who's in Paris, with his wife, to attend at an doctors convention. The problems already begin at the airport when Dr Walkers wife, Sondra, takes the wrong suitcase. When they arrive at the hotel Dr Walker heads for the shower and his wife unpacks the suitcases. When Walker walks out of the shower he notices that his wife is gone but and after a nap he realizes that something's not right here. Later, he's struck by terror when, after some searching, a man tells him that he has seen some men forcing his wife into a car with violence, and he realizes that she has been kidnapped...and for what simple reason? A misunderstanding.From what i can tell, Polanski makes his movie's with passion. He doesn't do it because he has to. He doesn't do it just to keep in shape. He does it beacuse it's what he likes to do. And he does it good. REALLY GOOD. The musical score is intensifying and sets the right atmosphere.

Two good friends, Jerry (Jack Lemmon) and Joe (Tony Curtis), witness a murder by one of the biggest gangsters but manage to escape but instead of running to the police, they decide to hide from the gangsters by dressing up as two women who play in a band (I forgot to mention that their job is to play in a band). It's on the trip with that band that they meet Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and they naturally both fall in love with her.  The rest of the movie is pure comedy and I don't want to spoil the fun for anybody so I guess you'll just have to see it.  The movie also has some great scenes like the one where Curtis imitates Cary Grant.  It's worth at least two good watches if not three.

It should probably have focused more on his writing than on his personal life, but beyond that choice, the film is almost perfect.When it isn't completely perfect, it has to do with the plot, which has some rather weak points. The love between Wilde and Bosie is somewhat difficult to understand. They are completely different. Maybe opposites attract, but not when two people live in two completely different worlds, like Wilde and Bosie seem to do. Of course, one could look at it from a cynical point of view, and say that they both have what the other one want; Wilde has money and Bosie looks, but one can also look at it in a romantic way, give them the benefit of the doubt, and think that they really are in love. That makes the story nicer (for a while), and much, MUCH more interesting!Beyond that, I have only positive things to say about Wilde. The script is fabulous, and adding a double story by putting in one of his nursery stories, was a great move! One of the most best parts of the film, is Wilde's speech in court. Really touching! The ending could easily have become extremely sentimental, but that is cleverly avoided.Stephen Fry shines as Oscar Wilde. He is so credible, and does his job so well that if I didn't know better, I'd actually think that it really WAS Wilde I saw on the screen. Law and Redgrave also put in top notch performances.Everyone will probably not appreciate this film as much as I did (it is a matter of whether you can deal with gay sex or not, and like dramas of course), but give it a try! It deserves two hours of your time, and much much more!
