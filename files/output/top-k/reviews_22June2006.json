He immediately thinks of a plan so cunning, so genius, so brilliant...no wait, my bad, it's the worst plan ever.Willis apparently found out where Julie lives and where she goes to school. Immediately, he goes to get his son out of nowhere and gets him to go to the same school and make friends with Julie. Then he fakes a radio show (I think) and lets Julie and her roommate, played by Brandy of all people, win it by guessing the capital of Brazil (to win a trip to the Bahamas, is this still making sense to you?). Meanwhile, Julie's old boyfriend who now has the promising career of ah, fish gutter or something, has to be eliminated so Willis throws a dummy in front of his car and then doesn't kill him, making room for his son who got the weird pseudonym Will Benson (wouldn't it be safer to give him a name that doesn't contain Will, Ben or son? He should have given him a name that's harder to figure out, like John Killer)and they all head to the Bahamas. So Ben is now paying for their holidays or something? Yeah, that'll teach them.When they arrive, turns out it's the rain season. Why would a radio station give people tickets to the Bahamas in the rain season? Can't they just like, call the station and try to change the date or something? Freddie Prinze Jr.(he has a name,but unlike Ben, I don't still know) also heads for the Bahamas right after waking up from a coma or something to save the day and he kills Ben once and for all, after Ben killed his own son by accident, cos he apparently never watched pro-wrestling.So the happy bunch returns and then Ben attacks Julie in her apartment. I hate to be a wise-ass, but why didn't he do that all along? Why putting in the whole Bahama-thing, which actually complicated everything? On the other hand, I didn't go to psychopatic weirdo-university. My parents were all like,we think it's too expensive for learning so little. This movie is utterly insane, but amazingly, I still don't like it. It's just hard to enjoy a movie about Jennifer Love Hewitt not being killed I guess.

Superman IV is a complete disaster on almost every level, a silly, cheesy and downright cheap looking poor excuse for a film that manages to rank among the worst comic book adaptation films of all time, bested only by such winners as The Return of Swamp Thing and the direct-to-video Captain America.Superman IV finds our hero, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve), selling off his family farm after his mother has died between performing his normal super duties. He returns to Metropolis to discover that the Daily Planet has been taken over by tabloid king David Warfield (Sam Wanamaker) and his daughter Lacy (Mariel Hemmingway) and are turning it into a salacious rag sheet. Shortly after the takeover, a young boy writes Superman a letter, via the Daily Planet, and asks him for assistance in solving the arms crisis by removing all nuclear weapons from the Earth. Superman initially refuses, taking the stance that he cannot interfere in human affairs (although how this relates to his other helping of humanity is a puzzler). Eventually, Superman changes his mind and begins ridding the world of all nuclear weapons by tossing them into the sun.Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) has escaped from prison with the assistance of his nephew Lenny (Jon Cryer), and hatched a devious scheme to create a new super villain to defeat Superman by taking a sample of Superman's DNA recovered from a museum exhibit featuring a single hair from Superman's head and attaching it and a computer to the side of one of the missiles that are hurled into the sun by Superman and thus creating Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow, voiced by Gene Hackman), a being with the power of Superman, the voice of Lex Luthor, plus more abilities, powered by the sun. The two match off, but has Superman finally met his rival? It's not really surprising that Superman IV is terrible movie, considering it was produced by The Canon Group, who may never have released what you could label a good movie when they existed in the '80s. And Superman IV is not a good movie. It has an intriguing concept at it's heart, Superman ridding the world of nuclear devices, but everything around that central idea is just a complete mess. The script by Laurence Konner and Mark Rosenthal is borderline insipid, featuring some extreme gaps in logic that cause the audience to have to accept some absolutely ridiculous contrivances and just asinine ideas. Superman tosses a missile containing Nuclear Man's basic building blocks into the sun. And how is that not all fried by the sun? Okay, maybe the Superman genetic material may not be (although I don't know if it was ever stated he is able to withstand even the sun), but the computer that will supposedly give Nuclear Man form, along with the barest shreds of material that suddenly grow into clothes to cover his body? Please. And how does he get Lex's voice? Late in the film, a human character is carried into space by Nuclear Man with no oxygen or protective suit, and survives. The complete contempt for the audience the script shows is inexcusable.With Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) still pulling a mostly supporting role, the writers attempt to inject Lacy as a new love interest, with her eye on Clark instead of Superman. They also try to generate a triangle between them, but none of it works. There is no chemistry between Lacy and Clark, and much of what was there between Superman and Lois seems to be gone or on life support. Yeah, Lex Luthor is back, but he is nowhere near as engaging as he was in Superman and Superman II. Hackman does the best he can with his questionable material, but there is no saving it.Many of the outstanding aspects of the previous films are just shoddy this time around. The special effects are abysmal, with many generic elements of Superman flying reused over and over again and almost none of it is believable. The action sequences, what few there are, are unspectacular and barely raise your pulse. The film, on the whole, has a rushed and half-complete feeling to it, and you get the impression you are watching a movie made on the cheap, not the latest sequel to a successful, multi-million dollar grossing franchise.So, after close to ten years and three sequels, Supeman IV is able to do what Lex Luthor could never accomplish it brought the Man of Steel down, and left him tattered. It would take almost two decades for Superman to fly again, and we can only hope that the next entry is worth your time, because this one wasn't.
