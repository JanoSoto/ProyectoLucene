The film switches tone about half hour in and then ends up becoming a cross between Jaws and The Poseidon Adventure.The problem with this film is that the whole Alzheimer's research with the sharks seemed to merely be a plot device to create what was to follow. I believe that the only reason that the writers set the narrative up in this way was to stop people claiming that it's a shameful rip-off of Jaws and The Poseidon Adventure.

There's no problem with this per se, but I felt that the writers should have either made a serious film focusing on finding a cure for Alzheimer's for humans by experimenting on sharks or just do a shameless B Movie style knock off of Jaws or The Poseidon Adventure. As it is this film tries to do both and that's what gave it a really pretentious feel to it.I also thought that the start of the film was quite stupid; what was the point of showing the red wine spill into the water and then show it as if it were blood? Was that supposed to be a parody of some sort? It certainly wouldn't have attracted the shark to the boat? Unless perhaps it was an alcoholic. Then the shark managed to smash through the underneath of the boat. Now I'm no boat expert, but surely the underside of the boat would be the strongest part of the boat so it's hard to believe that it could break through the underside of the boat. Yes they've got advanced intelligence, but where did they get their advanced strength from? There are other lapses in logic such as when the team conduct tests on one of the shark's brain and secure it with 2 pathetic looking harnesses whilst they drill into it's skull. Predictability shortly after the experiment has been completed successfully, the shark breaks free and kills one of the crew. It made me laugh that they would conduct this experiment when the shark was conscious. Surely it would have made more sense to tranquilise the shark and then carry out the test as drilling into the shark's skull would clearly antagonise it. Absolutely moronic.The sharks are billed as being super intelligent with super advanced brains yet the only smart thing that I saw any of the sharks do was to push one of the crew into the glass screen in order to break into Aquatica. The rest of the time the sharks just seem to catch the crew by chance and at every opportunity the sharks are killed easily. Where's the tension? Where's the suspense? The sharks were meant to be intelligent, but I didn't see much evidence of this.The sharks were also laughable and I'm unsure whether they were computer generated or animatronic, but either way they were awful. They didn't move like sharks - they twist and turn ridiculously quick and whilst I wouldn't go as far as to say that I laughed when they attacked anyone, these attacks certainly caused me to raise my eyebrows once or twice. The ending of the film was ridiculous and obvious and only made me even more angry and disappointed with this film.This film really should have either stuck with being a serious film exploring how to find a cure for Alzheimer's or it should have just been a Jaws\/Poseidon Adventure knock off (had it been the latter it still wouldn't have been great, but at least it would have been honest).

The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director\/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the role of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the inside was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set- up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended flashback segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call J.K. Rowling Syndrome. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.

It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call J.K. Rowling Syndrome. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the dénouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"27 February 2015","score":"","review":" The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director\/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the role of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the inside was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set- up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended flashback segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story.

This movie does both of these with style.Tango & Cash is the story of when the two best cops in L.A. (the titular characters) are framed for committing murder and are forced to go on the run. These cops are very different in the ways they go about their work and will have to work together if they are going to find and attain their unknown enemy.This movie was made in the 80s and you can definitely tell that just by watching the opening scene where Tango (Sylvester Stallone) stops an oncoming truck by shooting it and then saying a quick punchline to the situation. This is continued into the future of the movie with the corny dialog and situations getting better at times and then being absolutely cringe worthy. Although the movie is extremely cheesy something that sticks out in this movie is that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously with the situations that they get in being crazy and the characters often being sarcastic and seemingly aware of how ridiculous what they're doing really is. The sort of comedic and almost parodic way a lot of the film is shot just levels up the quality of this movie rather than lowers it because it was done very well. This is better than if it was a completely serious slug fest that had these crazy actions sequences that just didn't make sense trying to make you think it was a realistic.Speaking of the action, well it's great. The action in this movie is great from the start to finish because it's unrealistic but a whole lot of fun. There's a great feel to the action because you obviously know they're not going to get killed but you ride through the bumps and turns as they go through them and you enjoy them immensely. The stunts and the shoot outs are really quite awesome and if you enjoy a good old 80s action movie you will assuredly like this movie.The acting in this movie isn't exactly a work of art with the movie more focusing on action and comedy rather than how the actors delivered their corny lines. Stallone does an OK job but at times it slightly felt like he drifted in and out of character with him during the action sequences not being the character that was set up early in the movie. Kurt Russel as Cash does a good job and is the highlight of the acting in this movie with the portrayal of his character both being entertaining and bad ass. The two lead's chemistry is just about first rate with the two of them playing off each other and together spewing out classic puns and punchlines. The acting by lead actress Teri Hatcher who plays Kiki however, is in one word awful. She delivers her lines in a monotone voice and doesn't do a good job in anyway shape or form.Overall Tango & Cash is a 'good leave your brain at the candy bar film' with good comedic scenes and fabulous action but corny dialog and bad acting. If you do forget to put on your smarty pants and enjoy it for what it is you will have a much better time with it. I recommend this movie to people that love action films that aren't too serious and can have a laugh at themselves. If you want a serious cop drama you may be looking in the wrong place with this movie.I rate this movie a 6\/10.

He sat there the whole time, laughed hysterically at Jar Jar Binx, cried when Qui Gonn bought the farm and cheered while little Anakin saved the day. It occurred to me that his reaction was the same as I had watching Han, Luke, Leia and Chewie for the first time.While this unquestionably is the bastard son of the star wars series, it introduced the magic to a new generation and there is enough in it so far as characterisations and stunning visuals to hold it up under the weight of midichlorians, Jedi mysticism Jar Jar Binx and little orphan Anny.

But, the facts about who was there and their purposes are clear, public record, and not refuted. The Internet has sources readily available about Air America. It actually started as far back as 1950. That was in the Truman Administration, so the reviewer who criticized this movie for its implication that Richard Nixon was behind it and tried to cover it up was correct in his assessment. All administrations tried to keep a lid on U.S. activities in Southeast Asia outside of Vietnam. Of course, the information and activities would eventually become known and details made available. Again, Web sites on Air America provide lots of information, some quite fascinating. . That's enough about the background of the subject of this film. The movie itself is based on a book by Christopher Robbins. The characters are fictitious. But, the presence of the civilian pilots that flew a variety of aircraft for Air America was a fact. They did many things, as this movie shows. They flew food and made drops at remote villages. They helped the native Laotian forces against North Vietnamese incursions into their country. They did other clandestine operations ordered by the Air Force or CIA. And, they flew rescue missions for downed American pilots. The movie doesn't show this latter, but it was a very real function for the Air America pilots in Laos. This movie is billed as an action comedy, and it does have some comedy. It's mostly light stuff, or situational scenes. It isn't laced with witty dialog. The humor serves to reduce some of the anxiety and tension there was in real life, and that we might otherwise feel in watching the film. On the other hand, this film has a great deal of action. It's loaded with good scenery shots and some fantastic scenes of flying. The plot is OK, but not particularly strong. The cast are all very good. So, the thin plot and direction and editing aside, Air America is a good film of action that shows a variety of aircraft. And, it does one other thing. It gives us a picture of a real event and time in history that otherwise we would not have. So, it has some added historical value as well. The movie pokes fun at the CIA, the Air Force supervisors, and the Laotian general whose troops were the main buffer against the North Vietnamese entering Laos. The Laotians also were in the drug business. And, it shows a little of the U.S. AID operations to help refugees and the poor people of remote areas. All of that is find and good &#x96; it helps make the movie more interesting and entertaining. Unless someone has no interest in any of these things, cares nothing about aviation or flying, and wants to know nothing about that period of history, I can't imagine one rating this film fewer than five stars.

As a director of Modern age, it is as tough to make a film like silent ages, and as a king of silent age, it was also very tough to make a film like Limelight. He was a king in music, and so was his theme. And one can feel what a true artist should be. Remember the very last scene, The king was dying, and then camera was slightly tracking back, then the close shot of his beloved...she was still dancing, seeing her king of heart dying...yet, as a artist her 1st preference was her art..Brilliant..not a clown..but the greatest Artist..Yes remembering all field..THE GREATEST ARTIST OF ALL TIME.

I was familiar with most of the actors and expected great performances, yet, (apparently) unlike so many other reviewers here, I was never able to believe the characters long enough to immerse myself in the film. There seemed to be a lack of character development on-screen, which led to several points of disconnect that ripped me right out of the plot each time.There were some decent scenes, like the restaurant scene between father and daughter, and overall I can't complain about the performances of either Lahti or Hirsch. But there were way too many other scenes that had me wondering why the actors chose to portray the characters as lacking any genuine feeling. River Phoenix, who was otherwise an impressive young actor, really fell flat for me several times in this way. I was never convinced that he even remotely cared for Plimpton's character. Worse, Plimpton went from sulky and distracted to histrionic so quickly, it had me wondering if the scenes that were supposed to show the evolution of her romantic feelings had accidentally been left on the cutting room floor. I mean, I know teenagers are supposed to be sullen and flighty, but I'm pretty sure most of them warm up a bit before they declare their undying need for the other person (amid sobs) while they are being dumped. Character progression for both Phoenix and Plimpton was stilted, to say the least.I can't imagine what was going on here with these otherwise fine actors, so I can only assume the direction failed them. That, and a plot with gaps too big to ask the viewers' imaginations to fill. For example, what were we expected to believe about the thought process behind Hirsch's character's sudden decision to set his son free? The death of Gus (heard on the radio) seemed hardly relevant. If it was supposed to be relevant, it was less than profound.One more thing that was distracting was that, while the piano playing was decent for someone who played as a hobby, it was nowhere near the level required for entry into Julliard. The violinist who auditioned right before Danny was clearly in a different league, and it was hard to believe the adjudicators would not have been jarred by the difference. Authenticity should matter in a film, but this director was asleep at the wheel.I am usually a huge fan of slow-paced films, but I just wanted this one to be over. Has visual storytelling come so far in the last 27 years that even mediocre TV dramas outclass this performance? Very disappointing.
