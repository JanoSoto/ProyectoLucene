Amélie is of course the French film that was very well received when it first appeared in the early 2000's and not just from the audiences of France, no Amélie seemed to take the hearts of people from around the world and managed or still manages it should be said to capture the hearts of many who view it. Although some claim this to be a masterpiece I don't think it is quite at that calibre, nevertheless it is still a great movie and one that is highly recommendable, even to those who wouldn't think they would like it.The story centres around well Amélie of course, Amélie Poulain is just a seemingly normal woman working in a Parisian café and lives by herself, but of course we as the viewer get to see what she is truly like. She is not weird really but she is definitely odd, but Amélie is awesome in this film because she is extremely hard to really dislike or the performance of the lady playing her, Audrey Tautou. The plot see's Amélie do a lot of things actually, she becomes a friend of sorts with a fragile old man, tries to find a young man who caught her eye and messes with her dad, sounds like a very random plot and to be fair, it is.The pacing of the film is frantic and speedy, the lines sometimes come out extremely fast and all credit to the cast for really getting the dialogue out in a way which in funny and entertaining. Jean-Pierre Jeunet directs the movie and really tells quite a little story at the helm, he makes this super strange but really entertaining and although the decision to colour the movie in terms of lenses is quite a peculiar choice, it actually pretty much works in the end. Guillaume Laurant who thought up the story alongside Jeunet then also writes the film and gives Jeunet a great little script to work with, the movie moves along without stopping for too long and that I feel really makes this keep going until the very end.I mentioned Tautou as Amélie and she is very good in the role, she very much makes you feel for the character and she is fun to be around as well. Serge Merlin as the frail man Amélie befriends is good and works well at the beginning of the story because most other characters take a little while to get used to with the random stuff they say and do. Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is pretty good too, when he is in the film the story is usually at quite a fast part and so Kassovitz does a good job of keeping the pace going so that the movie really does flow very nicely indeed.I feel Amélie demands a second watch, I watched this the first time and felt it was pretty basic, but on the second watch I truly opened my eyes and saw this for the great film it is. I couldn't recommend this more to those who haven't already seen it, it's fun, oddly thrilling and just generally very different indeed. So Amélie, a film that showcases how quirky can be done so well but also shows just how good French cinema can be, oh and this movie is stunning to look at by the way.

I coulda been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am. Ah, the earnest dialogue spoken by Marlon Brando in one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Brando sitting in the taxi with his brother, Charley (Rod Steiger) trying to explain his reasoning why he opposes Johnny Friendly, Hoboken's most powerful man with a gun pointed to his face. This scene is so earnest, so powerful, delivered perfectly by Brando, who does fantastic by showing a sweet, gentle side to his nature despite performing the tough-guy act. As the great critic Roger Ebert quotes, What other actor, when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful, would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress? Before we get too much ahead of ourselves, I should at least point out this movie I'm reviewing is On the Waterfront, arguably one of the greatest movies ever made. It is special in many ways, but it is unanimously praised in how it changed the landscape of acting. The casting of Marlon Brando helped dearly. He changed how things were in a film. He made acting less predictable and did things never done before in cinema. He provided such texture to his role and in each scene he is in, you can see how he manages the line between gentleness and tough-guy act. Director Elias Kazan made a point not only Brando's acting was better than most, it was also more influential than most. He brought such a tenderness to his character and he won Best Actor at the Academy Awards in 1954, which he wholeheartedly deserved.I really found the plot interesting, and there is actually truth behind the plot. Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando) is a young man who tends to his pigeons and works on the docks for a corrupt boss of the unions, Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), while he dreams to be a boxer. One day, he witnesses a murder committed by some thugs of Friendly's. Terry becomes close with the sister of the victim, Edie Boyle (Eve Marie Saint) because he feels responsible for her brother's death. She introduces him to Father Barry (Karl Malden) who attempts to have Malloy take a stand against Friendly in order to smash the racketeering.As I mentioned in the above paragraph, this film is based off some truth. The film has an obvious political agenda, based off the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Commission) hearings. The director, Elia Kazan was called to the committee, and he named names. Names who were affiliated with the Communist Party. Critics have commented in the past that this film may have hidden, political motives, because of what he did at those HUAC meetings. I actually believe the film is based off that, but I applaud him in making the film. No one should be afraid to state what they believe in. Another part of history is the longshoremen of the Hoboken docks. Hoboken had trouble in all its racketeering, so that all plays an influential part in the movie.The main role of any director is to get the best performances he can out of his actors. Well, Kazan was certainly up for the task in this film. Everyone churned in amazing performances. I already gave my love letter to Brando, who previously worked with Kazan in 1951's A Streetcar for Desire. The film could have turned out to be very different. Frank Sinatra was originally cast as Terry, but the producers went ahead to cast Brando instead. The best move they could have done. This is Eve Marie Saint's first film role, and she eagerly rises for the challenge. A perfect foil for Brando. Her scene with Brando in the bar as they talked about feelings for each other is another priceless cinematic scene. Another important role was Rod Steiger, who played Terry's brother, also mixed up with Friendly. That taxi scene was incredible, as Brando and Steiger had amazing chemistry. Despite opposite views, the brothers very much love each other. Karl Malden as Father Barry does a wonderful job, although it feels like his acting is overshadowed by the heavyweights. Finally, Lee J. Cobb as the union boss, Friendly does an excellent job. I loved his final scenes of the movie. His fate is very deserving, and without spoiling much, I was laughing in the face of Friendly's as the movie came to a close.Overall, this is just one incredible film. If you were to say that this is the best film of all time, I would have no issue with that. This is one of my favorites , and it's one of those few films I can find no fault with. From the masterful direction to the skilled direction to the expert cinematography, there is much to love about the film. This was nominated for twelve Oscars and won eight of them. Brando and Saint took home awards and so did Kazan as director. Cobb, Malden, and Steiger were all nominated. This gripping crime thriller should be a showcase for film professors everywhere. This film changed the perspective of acting and it changed American acting for the better. The film and the muckraking articles that inspired it brought light to crime in the Hoboken streets and perhaps those streets became cleaner in the immediate aftermath. If you love movies, check this film out. ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2015","score":"","review":" You don't understand! I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"11 December 2015","score":"","review":" If you are looking for a well-crafted thriller to enjoy, look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, Dial M for Murder. On the outside, nothing much seems to happen with the film, but once you see it, well you are in for a surprise. As Hitchcock films goes, this one is more off-beat. However, you can classify the film as one of best films of the legendary director's career.If you look at the film from the outside, you are wondering how on earth is this film even good. For starters, most of the film is located in a single apartment room save for exterior shots and a scene at a theater. You need a well-crafted screenplay for single-location movies to work. Also outside of one rather fantastic murder scene, most of the film is talk, talk, and more talk. But this film does work because everyone plays their cards right. The screenplay is well-crafted and despite all the talk, it creates an aura of tension and mystery which builds up over the course of the film, before we reach the shocking ending. The build-up is excellent and it is very much worth it when the end is revealed. I also like that despite the movie being located in one room 98% of the time, you never get that feel of unintentional claustrophobia. So thanks to the excellent screenplay by Frederick Knott and masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, you never really think about that one location.Now it's time to describe the plot of the movie, which takes place in London. The wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with an American author named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Her husband, Tony (Ray Milland), a professional tennis player, was away from home at the time on a tour. However, he quits tennis because he wants to spend more time with Margot, and help a marriage that is crumbling apart. One day, Mark decides to visit the couple from America. During the affair, Mark had written letters to Margot. She insists she destroyed them all, but one letter was stolen. She claimed she was blackmailed, but she never really thought much about that letter. When Tony arrives home, he insists Mark and Margot go to the theater, and he will arrive shortly thereafter. However, he ends up calling an old colleague, Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson). Together, they plot the murder of his wife so he can gain her fortune. But complications arise in the form of failed opportunities, the police led by Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), and Tony trying to constantly cover his footsteps so he will not be implicated in any wrongdoing.Here is a film that is a masterpiece when it comes to delivering acting skills. Ray Milland injects his character with an incredible amount of charm, and his character is often likable even if his motives are not. His simple charm was enough to win me and many, many people over, enough to believe how he would do nothing wrong. Grace Kelly is absolutely magnificent in her role as Margot. During the murder scene, her performance was enough for me to wish she was nominated for an Oscar, which sadly enough she wasn't. These were the two main attractions of the movies, but there was another great performance to point out. John Williams (no, not the legendary composer), has been a staple of Hitchcock movies, so it is no surprise for him to show up here. I really loved his finesse role as the police detective who figures out this case, piece-by-piece with a remarkable eye.Hitchcock is one of Hollywood's most famous auteurs. When one think of his works, usually The Birds, Vertigo, Rear Window, or, Psycho comes to mind. But never count out this underrated film. During the first phase of 3-D phase in the 40's and 50's, many films were subjected to 3D treatment. However the faze begin to die out in the mid 1950's, and this is the last film to use 3D during that phase. I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie in 3D, but it could have been cool. For those who watch Hitchcock films, you should be familiar with him appearing in his movies somehow, someway. In Dial M for Murder, you'll really have to search to find him and it's a genius move to see where you'll find him.Overall, Dial M for Murder is just pure, classic Hitchcock. It's one of his underrated films, but there is no denying it is a masterpiece. The premise is a simple one, but Hitchcock turned into a twisting tale that pierces the heart with a load of dread and thrills. It's a very captivating movie, not only from the direction, but also from charming performances from Milland and Kelly, whom characters are likable. The film is good at talking, but you should be good at watching. I highly recommend this fine thriller that has Hitchcock in top form.My Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2015","score":"","review":" If you are looking for a well-crafted thriller to enjoy, look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, Dial M for Murder.

Ray Milland injects his character with an incredible amount of charm, and his character is often likable even if his motives are not. His simple charm was enough to win me and many, many people over, enough to believe how he would do nothing wrong. Grace Kelly is absolutely magnificent in her role as Margot. During the murder scene, her performance was enough for me to wish she was nominated for an Oscar, which sadly enough she wasn't.

During the first phase of 3-D phase in the 40's and 50's, many films were subjected to 3D treatment. However the faze begin to die out in the mid 1950's, and this is the last film to use 3D during that phase. I did not have the opportunity to watch the movie in 3D, but it could have been cool. For those who watch Hitchcock films, you should be familiar with him appearing in his movies somehow, someway. In Dial M for Murder, you'll really have to search to find him and it's a genius move to see where you'll find him.Overall, Dial M for Murder is just pure, classic Hitchcock. It's one of his underrated films, but there is no denying it is a masterpiece. The premise is a simple one, but Hitchcock turned into a twisting tale that pierces the heart with a load of dread and thrills. It's a very captivating movie, not only from the direction, but also from charming performances from Milland and Kelly, whom characters are likable.

I highly recommend this fine thriller that has Hitchcock in top form.My Grade A ","genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller"},{"date":"11 December 2015","score":"","review":" If you are looking for a well-crafted thriller to enjoy, look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 masterpiece, Dial M for Murder. On the outside, nothing much seems to happen with the film, but once you see it, well you are in for a surprise. As Hitchcock films goes, this one is more off-beat. However, you can classify the film as one of best films of the legendary director's career.If you look at the film from the outside, you are wondering how on earth is this film even good. For starters, most of the film is located in a single apartment room save for exterior shots and a scene at a theater. You need a well-crafted screenplay for single-location movies to work. Also outside of one rather fantastic murder scene, most of the film is talk, talk, and more talk. But this film does work because everyone plays their cards right. The screenplay is well-crafted and despite all the talk, it creates an aura of tension and mystery which builds up over the course of the film, before we reach the shocking ending. The build-up is excellent and it is very much worth it when the end is revealed. I also like that despite the movie being located in one room 98% of the time, you never get that feel of unintentional claustrophobia. So thanks to the excellent screenplay by Frederick Knott and masterful direction by Alfred Hitchcock, you never really think about that one location.Now it's time to describe the plot of the movie, which takes place in London. The wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with an American author named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Her husband, Tony (Ray Milland), a professional tennis player, was away from home at the time on a tour. However, he quits tennis because he wants to spend more time with Margot, and help a marriage that is crumbling apart. One day, Mark decides to visit the couple from America. During the affair, Mark had written letters to Margot. She insists she destroyed them all, but one letter was stolen. She claimed she was blackmailed, but she never really thought much about that letter. When Tony arrives home, he insists Mark and Margot go to the theater, and he will arrive shortly thereafter. However, he ends up calling an old colleague, Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson). Together, they plot the murder of his wife so he can gain her fortune. But complications arise in the form of failed opportunities, the police led by Chief Inspector Hubbard (John Williams), and Tony trying to constantly cover his footsteps so he will not be implicated in any wrongdoing.Here is a film that is a masterpiece when it comes to delivering acting skills.

That perfectly encapsulates the brilliance of this film. The Holocaust was the most horrific event man ever caused, nothing comes close. Somehow, Spielberg found a story of hope in the pitch black evil. That is not to say this movie is for the faint of heart. Nothing about Schindler's List is easy, it will break you but in the end the tears you shed--and you will cry--are not elicited by horror but by beauty. It is the story of a man, by no means a saint, who finds it in himself to stand up against the horrors of his day. I could write on about the acting, writing or directing, and it is all superb, but to do so would miss the point. Schindler's List excels because it has the all important fourth factor, the right stuff. I am too young to have seen it in theaters and I envy those who shared this experiences with strangers, but every time I watch this film I am left speechless. I do feel the need to right about the ending. Realizing that the evil presented in this film is of a degree we cannot fathom, Spielberg brilliantly reconnected us to reality. It was on my third viewing when it occurred to me that the little boy, the grandson of a Schindler Jew, was no more then eight years old. This would mean that he was born after Schindler died yet owes his entire existence to the man. This is the beautiful part of the story, this is what brings me to tears every damn time. Schindler's influence stretches beyond the grave. This movie was over twenty years ago, that boy is now a man, probably married, maybe with children. Schindler gave the girl a husband, the boy a father, and they never shared time on earth.

The extra- terrestrial life they find is by no mean friendly and brings horror into the ship.It's more of a horror film than a science fiction one. I am sure you have seen those horror films in which some people are stuck in a hut in jungle and there is some nasty creature lurking to hunt them one by one. Well, now make the hut full of small rooms and send it to space. This, has provided director with a lot of close-ups which sends a shiver to your spine.

We get the sense of a confused mind when we are able to see the maze on the hotel grounds and have a parallel view of Jack as he stares over the maze. This scene shows Jack's obsession with control and foreshadows into an evil plot. Each of the individual scenes takes you into a whole new depth of perception regarding the work as a whole.

No this is actually none of that when you watch it now that the once exciting technological aspects of it are both outdated and cliché. I have heard that this picture is a remake of a film made in 1948, If that is the case it would a lot more sense in my opinion. Although some then impressive tech is featured , It is basically a string of human errors on the part of the conspirators that exposes them. And the mistress being at the inaugural ball would have been less of a issue when there was less of a focus on affairs like these form the press , and less ways it could be recorded. But in 1987 the usage of limousines to pick up your mistress seems tenfolds more decadent than it would have done in 1948 . I suggest you watch that version , because this film's depiction of Washington intrigues was outdated even then. It also perfectly explains why Sean Young's character doesn't seem to have much of a professional career ahead and moves around the Washington social circuit without being involved in politics or government. This would make sense in the forties , it does not in the late eighties ( or at least it's painful to watch now ).Costner's Naval officer is a characterless Mary Stu in every single way h doesn't have much to play with , but when he does get to be angry or something his acting style often doesn't match the style of other actors in the scene. Gene Hackman in the same year he reprises his role as Lex Luthor in the now infamous superman IV once again plays a supposed genius ( they out right have people call him that actually ) but comes across more as a emotionally unstable autistic man at times, and frankly the character just turns into a big child towards the end. It's just pathetic to watch ; his character makes such weird mistakes and takes such ridiculous risks you can't take him seriously anymore.The chemistry between Costner and Young reminds me of twilight a lot. The script was apparently filled with looks that are supposed to convey 'a silent understanding' or something like that , but it never works!Hackman is seemingly over compensating for basically every poor delivery and stale look of all scenes he isn't in and he just turns into a caricature of a good actor near the end. Also the blatantly homosexual women fearing adviser having a clear crush on Hackman's character is incredibly sickening to watch as the character progresses. You know how in Django Unchained you are intrigued by the complicated relationship between Mr.Candy and Stephen ? well its nothing like that. It's just really sad.

There is a reason it is the first thing that comes to people's minds when they think of Westerns. There a reason that its theme is instantly recognizable.It is the best Western movie ever made, plain and simple.Every angle is perfect. Every line contributes something. Every event both captures your imagination and sets up what is to come. It does not involve me as much as Skyfall does, but it is just so inhumanly great without sacrificing its very human grit and style. Even people who are not film critics or analysts of any kind or even frequenters of high art can look at this movie and say, That's a really good film. Of course, this movie is not watched by as many people as it should be. I'm willing to bet that for every twenty people who have heard of this film, maybe one or two have actually seen it. Again, I get it. If you're not a major film buff or film buff wannabe or die-hard lover of Westerns, it is hard to convince yourself to take a full three hours out of your busy schedule to watch a slower paced film that was made fifty years ago. But if you ever have a chance, check it out.There is everything to be said about this movie. About how it subverted many traditional western tropes while laying the groundwork for far more. About how it catapulted Clint Eastwood into stardom, stardom that he has fostered and still basks in fifty years later. About how it took what worked in the first two Sergio Leone Westerns and made some additions of its own. And so much else that I could likely think of if only I rewatched it. From what I remember, it is so dense despite being so sprawling.There is also nothing to be said about this movie. It is like the American West itself (ignore for a moment the fact that this film was shot in Spain by a team of Italians). I've been fortunate enough to explore the West myself, and let me tell you, no words can capture the open freedom that you feel out there. This movie is something similar. Just like any journey, everyone will have a separate experience. But like any journey to a beautiful place, it will be worth it.There is something about the movie that makes you wish, at least for a second, that you could be in that world. Not the Old West, though that would be interesting. No, I'm talking about this film's version of the Old West. There is pain and danger and adventure and action and risk; but also those long pauses that allows everything to sink in. Combine that with the fact that they are going off of a real place, and you can both see yourself there and legitimately want to go.The main, is, of course, played by Clint Eastwood. He is subdued but fierce and sly. Whether or not you consider the 'Dollars Films' a trilogy- I don't- there is no doubt that his character here could easily be the same man from the other movies. This doesn't mean he hasn't changed; he is more visibly weary here, something that both helps this film stand out from and tie together to the other two films.But of course, he is only 'The Good.' The other two, Lee Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' and Eli Wallach's Tuco... Ramirez, make up 'The Bad' and 'The Ugly,' respectively. The three of them are searching for some hidden Confederate gold, and yes, it is an epic quest that takes them across the West. This is one of those movies where it's less about what sets the story in motion and more what it does when it's there. So much happens. It builds up and up, so high up that if the climax isn't spectacular, you would be disappointed and let down.But of course, that's fantastic as well. I'm not going to spoil what happens (though I don't think I'd be hurting anyone if I did; this film came out over fifty years ago) but I will say that you are in for a treat. On the surface, it's simple, if cleaver and well-written and smart. But the way they shoot it and direct it and score it and act it gives it so much depth and atmosphere. Ennio Morricone has composed many, many great pieces in this film alone, a few of which even people who have never seen this movie would recognize, so often are they repeated and parodied. But for my fist full of dollars (couldn't resist), none tops the piece that plays hear, simply called 'The Trio.' This scene is famous for what people who went to film school might call 'super tight shots.' The camera zooms in right on the character's eyes. This, like any artistic technique, can be used masterfully or horribly, depending on the production (check out the Dutch angles on Battlefield Earth; I shudder every time I see clips of it.) For this film, of course, it is the former. It is the crowning cherry on the top of three hours of conscious, radiant camera-work.In fact, now that I think about it, this scene perfectly captures the essence of the movie. The drama, the emotion, the art, the pure statement of excellence it's all there. Catch the clip and see what the film's about. Just don't forget to watch the rest of the flick too.

While this film could have been a total fiasco, much like other remakes we've been seeing in the '90s, the one saving grace is the presence of director Abel Ferrara, who, along with Stuart Gordon and Larry Cohen lifts the average material to more than it might have been. However, it might not be enough...The trouble with horror films of the 1990s is that even when they do get something right, they do just about everything else wrong. WISHMASTER had great gory ideas, but a tepid plot. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, well... that didn't really have anything did it? Anyhow I digress. BODY SNATCHERS is full of atmospheric imagery and bursting with style, but sadly the plot and script are turgid, relentlessly chewed up hundreds of times before in other films, and therefore lacking any real sense of menace.Ferrara gets carried away with the Raimi-like diagonal camera angles, filling every scene with haunting shadows. Which is great, you know, but somewhat...pretentious? Unfortunately the cast is populated with dense, unlikable characters, and even the little boy turns out to be a stereotyped whining American brat. The females are bland, the actor playing the father is expressionless, with the only believable character being Forest Whitaker (ironically his character is almost an exact replica of Kevin McCarthy's hero in the original classic). This really drags down the attention level. Plot wise, the idea of setting the story in a military base is quite effective, but once you realise that it's just a one-note idea which is never fully explored, then you feel that it's quite a letdown.The film is in two halves. In the first half, there are vague shadows and sounds but nothing much really happens. After an effects-laden scene in the middle of the film, it becomes one elongated chase movie, all set at night and involving people running in a variety of settings. Does this sound like your idea of fun? Not really. The film does benefit from some good special effects in the form of the alien pods, although they're almost exact replicas of the pods from 1978's sublime INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.There is some nudity put in to spice things up which seems quite desperate, and two great scenes which make the film worth watching. However apart from these key moments and an ambiguous ending, the film never really goes anywhere. If it was original I would give it a higher mark but the trouble is that we've seen it all before, twice before, and it was better both of those times so the third outing just appears to be a tired rerun of the earlier events.

Or if the movie surprised us at the end? Happy Gilmore isn't an exception. Happy Gilmore is about this guy who is kind of struggling with living and his grandma gets kicked out of her house which really upsets him. During the process of moving his grandma out he comes to find that he is really good at golf, but not in the normal way he isn't necessarily, professional he just runs and hits the ball and it just soars through the air. This guys name is Happy Gilmore, Happy ends up going to the big tournament where he must face off with the best golfers in the world, here he faces many challenges and has to learn to be a better golfer to win the tournament and use that money to buy back his mothers home. This movie is just like any other cliché movie that the main person overcomes the challenge, or the hero wins the war, etc. The biggest struggle Happy has to overcome in this film is his biggest competition, a guy named Shooter McGavin who is a real professional golfer who has been doing it a whole lot longer than Gilmore. Happy Gilmore isn't completely taken by surprise with golf because he has been playing hockey is whole life which basically involves the same swing technique and everything that golfing does. But Happy realizes that he won't ever have the chance to win the tournament unless he seeks help from someone who knows what exactly they are doing. The person that Gilmore goes to and seeks out is a guy he knows as Chubbs, who has a fake arm because it got bitten off during a golf tournament by an alligator. This movie is definitely one of those, dirty secret comedies where the humor is just kind of dumb comedy but that doesn't mean it isn't funny, it definitely is a funny movie! This movie is attracted for its simplistic representation and I would concur, because you already know what basically is going to happen before the movie even ends. The main part of this movie is that Happy has to beat Shooter McGavin in a tournament in order to pay for his Grandmas house so she doesn't have to move out. Whenever there is a plot like this in a movie, you know that the main character or hero is going to come through with the challenge and everyone is going to live happily-ever-after.The tournament starts out fair and they keep playing through it, eventually everyone is eliminated except the two that face off in the end. It comes down to the last hole and Shooter swings an impressive hit that puts him ahead a little bit, as long as Happy doesn't get it in in less amount of hits. Unfortunately, an accident happens with a bystander and a big tower falls down blocking the course, Happy wants people to move it and go again when its clear, but Shooter says the rules say that once you start a hole you have to finish it. Gilmore takes this and has a flashback to when he went mini-golfing with Chubbs and how he had taught him to be the ball and to just relax and take a breath. Gilmore does just that and he ends up using the fallen over tower to his advantage to hit the ball like you would hit it if you were playing mini-golf, the ball bounces all over the place and eventually finds its way into the hole. This scene is very dramatic as you can imagine and when it goes in everyone goes crazy and starts cheering and celebrating. Gilmore gets a prize jacket and a trophy, but more importantly he gets money that he later uses to save his grandmas house.This is why I am not super impressed with this movie; it is funny but very predictable. But to come from the other side, it is just a comedy, a dumb comedy more specifically so it doesn't necessarily need to have some super in depth plot or some big surprise that happens. That's the whole point of this movie, it's just like a dumb comedy that makes you laugh even though it might seem un-intelligent or looked down upon. Even thought this movie might have a normal plot and is nothing special, it is still a good movie and it definitely made us laugh. I think the characters were chosen very wisely, the actual actors that played the characters and the actual characters themselves. They really complement each other and they build on each other, the main character wouldn't be the main character without his supporting characters and those characters really did help Adam Sandler in this case. For example, when Gilmore goes to the mini-golf course with Chubbs (Carl Weathers) they really improve Gilmores skills and help him basically win the tournament in the end and this is a key point in the movie. I think the casting director really hit it on the head. In conclusion I would say that to criticize this movie for having a cliché plot would be unfair and if that is the only thing I got out of this movie that would be a lie. Because this movie is a first of its time it is a classic. This movie is a knee slapper and I would say a classic, lots of people know what this movie is and have probably seen it. In the end this is still a very funny movie and I would recommend to anyone.

For this reason, the audience can sort of identify with him, as they feel overwhelmed by things like the first party scene at Golightly's apartment, full of people and movement(of props, people, and camera alike), something of a social Rube Goldberg machine.Seeing Golightly through Varjak's eyes continues in scenes like the Moon River number, when Varjak leans out his window and the film cuts to a high-angle shot of Golightly singing on the fire escape, one of the only times she appears to have slowed down and been vulnerable.This use of camera work, paired with beautiful settings and shots (see any scene involving Tiffany's) make the movie visually unforgettable.

The night shots of the city streets, bathed in different colored traffic or marquee lights, is both visually appealing for the audience and a way to show how Robert De Niro's character, Travis, sees the people who occupy the city.As a cabbie, Travis sees the seedier versions of people, which, when added to his restlessness, turns him to violence, noble or not.The lighting is everything I've been told to expect from footage of the 70s, and it serves the movie incredibly well. Colorful, but not too bright, and often even fluorescent, keeps the movie looking more like the sleazy New York that Travis sees, rather than a professional set.Travis is caught somewhere between the uber-professional and normal world of Betsy(Cybill Shepherd)(shown primarily in daytime shots of normal buildings and people, and the seedy underbelly occupied by Iris(Jodie Foster)(shown in the nighttime, blurred by colorful lights, deep shadows, and violence). His ties to both are through wanting, he wants to occupy Betsy's world, and he wants to save Iris, so the combination of these two worlds is strange visually.

The first one shall be Home Alone, the classic comedy for all family that made Macaulay Culkin a superstar in the age of 10. The movie even got two Oscar nominations (music song and score) as well as two golden globes nominations (best comedy movie and best performance by Macaulay Culkin). As probably everyone already knows this movie is about an 8-year old who must protect his home from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left home alone by his family during Christmas vacation. The fact that he manages to bring terror to the burglars is of course completely unrealistic but no one cares since this is an absolutely hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one). There are some classic scenes that will have you rolling on the floor laughing even if you remember them, so it's strongly suggested as it's a classic Christmas comedy indeed.
