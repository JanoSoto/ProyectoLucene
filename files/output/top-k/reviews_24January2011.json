My top movies are 2001 Space Odyssey, The Matrix, Shawshank Redemption, City of God. Among theses movies, I set Requiem for a Dream.There's to much to say, but the movie shows it prominence on its own.There's no flaws, no second views, no subtle information, no blurred plot. Everything is clear and precise. The movie doesn't lay over the pseudo intellectualism. No other movie depict the human mind fragility so well. We are addict to television, drugs, medicines, status, and others values of modern society.The union, synchronization, marriage between frames and sound is perfect. Yes, PERFECT. The music is a masterpiece.Arronofski had such control of his picture that he knew that audience were gone destroyed (in good sense) at the end, so the credits rolling in silence (almost)... like a time to recover the breath.This picture is a life changing.Among the 5 best movie of all time. Simple like that.
