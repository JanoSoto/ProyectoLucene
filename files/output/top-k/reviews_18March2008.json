First of all I am an Eastwood fanatic...I love the man...he's amazing. I am also a Kennedy fanatic so the content of the film made it even more interesting to me because they did an incredible job of using The Kennedy Assassination as a back story to this one. Still the film is really well done and technically speaking done on a relatively low budget considering some of the shots they create. But if you watch the special features on the film you'll see that they used a lot of computer graphics to simulate casts of thousands, and used old Bill Clinton speech crowds for their President speech crowds. It's flawlessly done and you'd never know it unless you were really looking. The film is not about the backdrop, it's a character study from two very different perspectives. You have an aging Secret Service agent, divorced, left alone, alcoholic, constantly haunted by the fact that he was too slow to save President Kennedy in 1963. He doesn't whip himself into shape...he's old...and he looks old and acts tired and that is exactly what he is. Then you have the flip side of the coin where you have an angry, driven, assassin trained by the United States who wants nothing more than to give his life to end the President's life. It's cat and mouse, and it's psychological and just really interesting to watch.Clint Eastwood is a god. I mean the man never changes his performances much...his performance in In The Line of Fire as secret service agent Frank Horrigan is a more tired and broody version of Dirty Harry but somehow he does something with his characters. You see something in his eyes where he just draws you into his character and makes you believe it and become a part of it and that's exactly what he does here. He has unparalleled screen presence! John Malkovich, who I am rarely a fan of, is incredible as the creepy and disturbed killer Mitch Leary. He is a master of disguise and that is no figure of speech because he has to change his appearance so drastically and so many times and does it realistically and amazingly!! On top of that so much of his performance is done over the phone or just his voice and he creates this incredible character that you almost feel compassion for at times. Best of all his character and Eastwood's character have incredible chemistry and are the perfect adversaries. A statement commonly made but I could have done without Rene Russo. Her character didn't have a lot of depth or reason other than as a rather ridiculous love interest for Eastwood's Horrigan and the two of them didn't really go very well together anyways. Russo had this habit in the nineties of showing up with every leading man you could possibly think of. This is one performance that was unnecessary.Director Wolfgang Petersen definitely has a talent for combining action with a really good story that draws you in. I think he is probably one of the more intelligent action directors given films like Air Force One, this one, and Troy...I was NOT a fan of his Poseidon remake but every great artist stumbles sometime. In the Line of Fire is just simply a great cat and mouse mystery, thriller with a little bit of action and other than the love interest they don't try to force Eastwood to be younger than he is because his character calls for a world weary character and that is what he is. Some definite edge of your seat moments mixed with a really good story and if you haven't seen it you'll wanna check it out because it is definitely worthwhile!! 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I admit I have a biased opinion on this film.

And many attribute Sir Sean Connery's performance as the staunch and proper Dr. Henry Jones Sr. as the turning point in the series and really makes it terrific. I have a slightly different take on both of those aspects. The Last Crusade is still a worthy part of the series and definitely is not worse than any of the others. I just don't believe it's any better either. In fact for me it kind of steered away from the core idea of Indiana Jones bring a gritty action adventure. Yes the film has action and adventure but also feels a little Hollywood with some smart comedy, one liners, bigger cast, bigger budget, and less historical viewpoint despite the idea behind the film. A lot of the film is Indiana rescuing his father from the Nazi's which is a completely different take on the series and a classic moment is Hitler himself signing Indy's book in Berlin. While I do think Sean Connery being added to the cast was a great decision I also think his character and therefore him was overused. It was like they were trying really hard to breath new life into the series and I don't think it needed it. It seemed to leave behind the homage to the 40's serials, and the campiness in exchange for big budget spectacles.Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones and as always is terrific as the hero to end all heroes. I think in The Last Crusade his portrayal is a little more sarcastic and humorous and doesn't really get as much opportunity to show off that rugged side that we have came to know and love. But the film had a different tone and Ford adapted Indy to fit that and still created the amazing character. Sir Sean Connery joins the cast as Indy's father and really did a terrific job. He was the polar opposite to Ford's Indiana Jones and yet they had this similar quality that made their roles believable. They have terrific chemistry together and Connery just fit into the cast perfectly. Alison Doody is the latest in Jones' love interests and she also kind of doubles as a villain but a sympathetic villain. She's also far more sultry and seductive than previous heroines from the series. River Phoenix also deserves honorable mention as he portrays the Young Indy and gives us a bit of history on the character in the beginning of the film which is one of the great moments in The Last Crusade. Phoenix is brilliant as young Indy and when grabs that cross and reaches for the ladder and flashes a smirk at the camera...it is a pinpoint accurate smirk that Harrison Ford is renowned for. That alone makes Phoenix a great performer in the film.The Last Crusade is a terrific installment in the series. I mean you have some really key moments like the history of Indy in the opening, and meeting Hitler and the entire creation of his father as a character played by Connery, the tank battle towards the cliff...I mean the film is still a classic and important part of the Indiana Jones series but I still didn't feel like it quite felt the same as the previous two Indiana Jones films. Steven Spielberg returned to the helm for this third film and you can still see his style and amazing directing skills but the film was still different and maybe they were aiming for something a little different. If anything Indiana Jones could be described as resilient and adaptive and this shows a different kind of adventure story set against the back drop of World War II and Nazi occupation but still has this medieval ancient story close behind. Regardless you have to see the film...many consider it the best, I consider it my least favorite but that's like saying I prefer Chocolate cake to Apple Pie or brownies...they are all delicious!! 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Many consider The Last Crusade to be the best in the series.

The once great genre had consumed itself with sub par sequels and extremely low budget cheesy movies that had no real plot at all. The movies that were coming out during this time were basically this a big breasted girl and her friends (who love to get naked) decide to hang out somewhere away from civilization. While there they are stalked by some random killer, killing for some non-developed reason (if a reason at all). So, needless to say, the slasher film was dying and dying hard by 1984. But, a man by the name of Wes Craven changed that. And with his little film that no one had any faith in, he breathed life into the slasher film and kept it alive for a couple more years. Wes Craven had all ready established himself in the horror genre by 1984. He had made the classics The Last House on the Left in 1972 and The Hills Have Eyes in 1977. As well as some other films that weren't as successful. He had written a film about a killer who is killing people in their dreams. But, the twist was, if he killed you in your dream, you died for real. This idea hadn't really been done before, at least not in a slasher film. As creative as it may have been, no one wanted to make the film. He finally found New Line Cinema, a small film company on the verge of bankruptcy, that was willing to produce the film. Robert Shaye, the co-CEO of New Line had enough faith in the script and in Craven to make the film, hoping it would save his dying company.The story was about a group of teenagers, all having the same nightmare about the same unknown man. The only things they know are that he is horribly burned, wears a red and green sweater and has a brown hat, oh and that he has knives for fingers! As each one of them is killed off Nancy (Langenkamp) is the only one willing to stand up to him. Oh, and did I mention the adults in the film don't pay any attention to what she is saying. That's classic slasher film rules right there! Although Craven and Shaye butted heads over the ending of the film, that didn't do anything to ruin this film. With a great cast including John Saxon playing a police officer again and Robert Englund, a virtual no one at the time, he gained major success and a huge fan following after this film hit it big at the box office. Also along for the ride was Johnny Depp in his very first film. The film was extremely ingenious at the time, not only for the storyline of the film but also for some of the camera techniques used. Including a very interesting special effects shot of Freddy Krueger jumping through a mirror. And a very nice shot of Nancy waking up from her nightmare having parts of the roses from her nightmare with her, but when the camera pulls back they are gone. A very cool shot, that you should probably check out!Wes Craven did not want nor did he intend this film to be the beginning of a franchise. Robert Shaye had different ideas. A Nightmare on Elm Street hit it big at the box office grossing over $25 million domestically, just enough to save New Line Cinema. A sequel was immediately planned. The film spawned six sequels, a TV series and an eventual face off with the other 1980s slasher Jason Voorhees. Though none of the other films ever lived up to this one, as a whole the series was phenomenal. Heather Langenkamp said it best in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Everyone knows who Freddy Krueger is. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong!.

Also along for the ride was Johnny Depp in his very first film. The film was extremely ingenious at the time, not only for the storyline of the film but also for some of the camera techniques used. Including a very interesting special effects shot of Freddy Krueger jumping through a mirror. And a very nice shot of Nancy waking up from her nightmare having parts of the roses from her nightmare with her, but when the camera pulls back they are gone. A very cool shot, that you should probably check out!Wes Craven did not want nor did he intend this film to be the beginning of a franchise. Robert Shaye had different ideas. A Nightmare on Elm Street hit it big at the box office grossing over $25 million domestically, just enough to save New Line Cinema. A sequel was immediately planned. The film spawned six sequels, a TV series and an eventual face off with the other 1980s slasher Jason Voorhees. Though none of the other films ever lived up to this one, as a whole the series was phenomenal. Heather Langenkamp said it best in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Everyone knows who Freddy Krueger is. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong!. ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"18 March 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter &#133; priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously Star Wars, but when you put them together, in this order, the words Empire Strikes Back will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, I can give it a try &#150; we all know, by heart, what will follow next.The Empire Strikes Back is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine &#133; get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. Empire Strikes Back gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, Empire Strikes Back could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in Return of the Jedi, and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, Empire stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous Who shot J.R.? moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; Star Wars is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the new chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form. Without sounding repetitive, watch this series. Introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2008","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Hoth.

While Raiders started the amazing series, and Last Crusade wrapped it up and took it to different heights...Temple of Doom IS Indiana Jones, it's everything the character stands for an gives people in entertainment. Terrific adventure, jaw dropping action, brilliant sets and exotic locales, larger than life characters, violence, darkness, romance, and wicked villains all balled up into this mysterious history lesson not based on reality. Many people that grew up in the eighties will fondly remember Temple of Doom as their favorite film and it's easy to see why. This film is the pinnacle of adventure...unparalleled by anything else right up to this day. Spielberg and Lucas have said that they longed to make Indiana Jones as an homage to the 1930's and 1940's serials and again Temple of Doom really does fit that bill. Indiana Jones in general and even more so Temple of Doom almost has this campy feel to it but you never once think of it as campy because it is incredible adventure. Steven Spielberg returns as director and George Lucas returned as writer for the story and the two of them know these characters and Spielberg just seems to have this innate knowledge of how to entertain and Temple of Doom turns in one of the greatest performance in an adventure film let alone a sequel which blows away it's predecessor.This series would have died dead in the water had Harrison Ford not returned. Ford IS Indiana Jones, everything about him just completely embodies the character. His rugged, tough talking, intelligent portrayal is mind blowing and if he got comfortable with the character in Raiders of The Lost Ark, he completely honed the character in Temple of Doom (which technically takes place before Raiders.) He is awesome, and one of my favorite actors but also gives us one of the greatest characters in movie history. Kate Capshaw is Indy's love interest and she is the complete opposite of previous love interest and his later ones and that is what they wanted. As lounge singer 'Willie' she is completely out of her element, whiny almost but it works for the story. I almost find her overused and overplayed but not quite as her character just jives with the story. Jonathan Ke Quan...what can I say...one of my favorite sidekicks in movie history as Indy's little partner Short Round. They give him a tiny bit of background but still leave his past kind of a mystery but still gives Indy this softer side and the two of them are terrific together. Ke Quan is awesome and just a really good addition to the story and gets some great lines. Amrish Puri is one of the film villain greats as the evil Priest type character Mola Ram.So many Indiana Jones fans have listed Temple of Doom as their least favorite in the series and that stuns me. I mean the film starts in a Chinese lounge with a musical number that makes you wonder if you're watching the right film...next thing you know you're in a high speed car chase across China, on to a plan that is going down, into a raft on a high speed river, into a village pillaged by evil, into a temple of the strangest religious practices...the film is brilliant. I could watch it a million times over and it will be my favorite Indiana film. If you only force yourself to watch one Indiana Jones film...well you're crazy...but if you do, make it Temple of Doom because this film is what Indiana Jones is all about...adventure. Granted there are some key elements I think missing from the series that the other two have but being a technical prequel it's understandable...first of all you have no Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliott), and Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies who are small but pertinent characters to the Jones films. Also the supporting characters like Willie and Short Round are a little more used than most supporting characters but Temple of Doom is just fun and by the far the darkest in the series.

(just compare the Mercedes cobra to a new E class.. cobra's simply wouldn't break down - Mercedes almost got bankrupted - new cars, in 5-8 years u have to change em) but lets get back to the movie. Another user wrote WHY IS THIS BETTER THAN THE MATRIX? MATRIX IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER.. well i don't know what to say.. simply no comment. How old are you kid? 13? Matrix.. good movie, but Goodfellas is 1000x better. You will find action, good story, betray, love and all in this movie. Tommy would kill you if he would read that matrix is better lol. and the most important thing is, that it is TRUE STORY. Geee... i wish i could live in the 50-60's. real life, true friends. Watch this movie, and feel it. I just love the old mafia. So brutal, yet so catching. always together.. in good and bad..

(What competition it did have came principally from Heaven's Gate, Silverado and Young Guns). The plot is that familiar one- familiar from films like Shane and Clint Eastwood's own High Plains Drifter- about the mysterious stranger in town who helps the locals fight off a gang of bandits. (Eastwood was a brave man to make a film on this theme in the eighties, as this was the plot satirised by Mel Brooks in Blazing Saddles, his brilliant spoof Western from 1975. Club, the character played by Richard Kiel, even has something in common with Brooks' Mongo).The film is set in a small gold-mining village (references to Sacramento suggest that it is in California) in the late nineteenth century. Coy LaHood, the wealthy boss of a powerful mining company, is desperate to drive the prospectors (whom he sneeringly calls tin-pans) off their claims, and has hired a gang of ruffians to achieve this end. The tin-pans are on the verge of giving up; only one man, Hull Barrett, wants to stand firm. When Barrett travels into the nearest town to buy supplies he is cornered by the ruffians who threaten him with a vicious beating, but he is saved by a mysterious stranger, who later reveals himself to be a preacher. (We never find out his name; he is simply referred to as the Preacher throughout. The character played by Eastwood in High Plains Drifter remained similarly anonymous). Despite his clerical calling, he clearly knows how to fight with both a gun and a club, and his arrival gives the tin-pans hope to make a stand against LaHood and his bullies. Realising that his tactics are not succeeding, LaHood calls in the corrupt Marshal Stockburn and his team of six deputies, who have a reputation as lethal gunslingers.This may be a familiar story, but Eastwood is able to inject some fresh elements into it. Firstly, in line with eighties thinking about the environment, there is an ecological viewpoint lacking in most earlier Westerns; the tin-pans' method of prospecting for gold is far less environmentally damaging than the methods used by LaHood's men, which involve blasting the rocks with high-pressure jets of water. (The film also has an anti-capitalist slant, favouring the little man against the big corporation). Secondly, there is a sub-plot involving Sarah, Barrett's widowed fiancée, and Megan her teenage daughter from her earlier marriage, both of whom fall in love with the Preacher. Although in both cases their love is unrequited, this gives the film an element of sexual tension not normally found in films of this type.Thirdly, there is a strong religious or mystical current running through the picture, and not merely because the main character is a clergyman. The film's title has a literal meaning, in that the Preacher rides a pale grey horse, but there is also a quite deliberate Biblical reference. At one point Megan reads the following words from Chapter 6 of the Book of Revelation- Behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death. Stockburn and his deputies are together seven in number, a number which is often regarded (particularly in Revelations) as having a mystical significance. (It has also been suggested that they are an evil version of the seven gunfighters in The Magnificent Seven).Eastwood gives a fine performance as the Preacher, calm rational and authoritative, a performance which leaves open the possibility that there may be something supernatural about the character. When he is washing we see that his back bears the scars of a number of gunshot wounds which, I would have thought, would under normal circumstances have proved fatal. When LaHood and Stockburn are discussing him, Stockburn says that he reminds him of a man he once knew, only to correct himself a moment later. Can't be. The man I'm thinking of is dead. The implication is that the Preacher may be a vengeful ghost returned from the dead. Certainly, his ability in the final shootout to appear and disappear at will suggests that he may have powers beyond those of a mortal man.The film has a distinctive visual style, with strong contrasts of light and dark. The interior scenes are mostly dimly lit, the outdoor ones of some magnificent mountain scenery are shot in bright sunlight. This contrast may in itself have significance as symbolising the film's central theme of a clash of good and evil.The film has had a mixed reception from the critics; Halliwell's Film Guide, for example, rather superciliously calls it a violent, pretentious movie with little to be pretentious about, although others, such as Roger Ebert, have defended it. In my opinion, however, it is a good example of the western tradition, made at a time when that tradition was out of favour. It does not quite have the depth of Unforgiven, Eastwood's masterpiece from a few years later, but by most other standards it is a very fine film. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 March 2008","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Pale Rider is sometimes cited as the greatest Western of the eighties, although it had so little competition that that accolade does not seem much more than the cinematic equivalent of being the proverbial big fish in a small pond.

After the immensely popular Dream Warriors, Freddy had reached his peak of pop culture. This movie brashly illustrates the pop culture, with Freddy being less scary, and more of an icon. I admit once again of seeing all the horror franchises at a (very) young age and I don't think I was alone as by this point in the franchise as there was a wave of Freddy toys, sheets, lunch boxes, posters, etc. Basically the statistics were rolled in, and marketing knew its age group. So yes, before I start this review, I'll say that Freddy isn't scary, the movie doesn't even try to scare you, but alas, it wants to entertain, and boy does it ever. The movie continues on from 3, with the survivors trying to get on with their lives (Kristen, Joe, Kincaid) and the beginning has Kristen (now played by the less competent Tuesday Knight) having the dream at the Elm street house (which is EVEN more pimping then 3). She gets frightened and pulls the other two in, but they get angry and don't believe her (after everything they went through together you'd think they wouldn't give it a second thought, but never mind). We then go into the now familiar territory of the introduction of our new batch of teens since the Elm street children are near extinct. Alice is the only one we should really invest in since she eventually is going to take the lead as Freddie's new opponent. Anyways, Freddy indeed does resurrect (in one kick ass surreal regeneration scene which is started by flaming dog urine!?!) and continues to dispatch our reaming survivors. The mythology for this sequel indeed makes sense and tries to expand off 3. It seems if Freddy kills all the final Elm street children he will forever be trapped in the dream world with no more victims so he now must find someone he can use to bring new victims, and he finds that in the very shy and insecure Alice, who inherits Kristen's gift (after her grisly furnace death). One thing Freddy didn't count on is that every time he kills someone, she inherits their special power, and gets stronger and stronger, but when Freddy kills a very close family member, Alice must use everything she's got in a final kick ass showdown. Although many people feel this movie is a cheat and that the series should have ended after 3, I beg to differ and felt that the closure for 3 was to poorly done, making the ending very underwhelming, I WANTED MORE! So the sequel is a somewhat decent companion piece to 3. Bringing back the warriors was genius, and I enjoyed the continuity. Sure, I can make a stink about them getting killed, but personally since I cared so much about them from 3, their deaths upped the stakes for me. Also the new characters, although noting that layered, the actors portraying them were competent and very likable none the less, like three, I cared about the kids. Also Lisa Wilcox is a revelation, making the most interesting Elm Street character ever. I was rooting for her all the way.Another pro for this sequel is Renny Harlin in the directing seat. Not only did he create the most visually appealing sequel of the entire series, he made the movie and extremely effortless watch as well. This movie ahs flaws, but boring us is not one of the them. It's so fast paced, you feel like you need to stop for a breath of air. The camera is very fluid and I loved the style. The colors are also very vibrant, lot's of green and red lighting. Thank you Mr. Harlin, you certainly can punch a wallop with your scenes. As with 3, there is so much scenes that stand out in my mind with picture clarity, the Junkyard scene, the watered scene, the beach scene, the classroom scene, the elevator scene, the movie theater, Freddy eating the Pizza, Alice and Dan spinning through the tunnel, Roach motel scene, Freddy's death, all classic scenes and after watching them you can see why the movie made the most money in the entire series (ex Freddy Vs Jason). Some flaws I have with the movie are 1) Although the deaths had good SFX, the gore and mean streak so prominent in previous sequels was seriously lacking, Should have made Freddy mean like 3 did, 2) the movie's narrative gets a little shaky in places, making some dream sequences not following up with logic, comes off as a tad distracting, and 3) the movie does get a little heavy handed making some scenes very cheesy (you'll probably groan) like Alice gearing up to go into hand and hand combat. To much man, I ended up laughing at it. Overall though, this is the last decent hurrah for Freddy. The movie sells his soul but at least it's still quite fun watching it go down, swinging. It only gets lesser and lesser after this one, and Robert Englund has even admitted he felt strongly about this movie ending the series, as Freddy's death certainly makes sense and is a fitting touch. What a kick ass scene too. This is where Elm street ends for me, even though I still watch 5, I consider this to be Freddy's final adventure. Of course, commercialism and the mighty buck thought otherwise, but you can still consider this the final Freddy, and should wisely do so.

Not only did he create the most visually appealing sequel of the entire series, he made the movie and extremely effortless watch as well. This movie ahs flaws, but boring us is not one of the them. It's so fast paced, you feel like you need to stop for a breath of air. The camera is very fluid and I loved the style. The colors are also very vibrant, lot's of green and red lighting. Thank you Mr. Harlin, you certainly can punch a wallop with your scenes. As with 3, there is so much scenes that stand out in my mind with picture clarity, the Junkyard scene, the watered scene, the beach scene, the classroom scene, the elevator scene, the movie theater, Freddy eating the Pizza, Alice and Dan spinning through the tunnel, Roach motel scene, Freddy's death, all classic scenes and after watching them you can see why the movie made the most money in the entire series (ex Freddy Vs Jason). Some flaws I have with the movie are 1) Although the deaths had good SFX, the gore and mean streak so prominent in previous sequels was seriously lacking, Should have made Freddy mean like 3 did, 2) the movie's narrative gets a little shaky in places, making some dream sequences not following up with logic, comes off as a tad distracting, and 3) the movie does get a little heavy handed making some scenes very cheesy (you'll probably groan) like Alice gearing up to go into hand and hand combat. To much man, I ended up laughing at it. Overall though, this is the last decent hurrah for Freddy. The movie sells his soul but at least it's still quite fun watching it go down, swinging. It only gets lesser and lesser after this one, and Robert Englund has even admitted he felt strongly about this movie ending the series, as Freddy's death certainly makes sense and is a fitting touch. What a kick ass scene too. This is where Elm street ends for me, even though I still watch 5, I consider this to be Freddy's final adventure. Of course, commercialism and the mighty buck thought otherwise, but you can still consider this the final Freddy, and should wisely do so.

After the immensely popular Dream Warriors, Freddy had reached his peak of pop culture. This movie brashly illustrates the pop culture, with Freddy being less scary, and more of an icon. I admit once again of seeing all the horror franchises at a (very) young age and I don't think I was alone as by this point in the franchise as there was a wave of Freddy toys, sheets, lunch boxes, posters, etc. Basically the statistics were rolled in, and marketing knew its age group. So yes, before I start this review, I'll say that Freddy isn't scary, the movie doesn't even try to scare you, but alas, it wants to entertain, and boy does it ever. The movie continues on from 3, with the survivors trying to get on with their lives (Kristen, Joe, Kincaid) and the beginning has Kristen (now played by the less competent Tuesday Knight) having the dream at the Elm street house (which is EVEN more pimping then 3). She gets frightened and pulls the other two in, but they get angry and don't believe her (after everything they went through together you'd think they wouldn't give it a second thought, but never mind). We then go into the now familiar territory of the introduction of our new batch of teens since the Elm street children are near extinct. Alice is the only one we should really invest in since she eventually is going to take the lead as Freddie's new opponent. Anyways, Freddy indeed does resurrect (in one kick ass surreal regeneration scene which is started by flaming dog urine!?!) and continues to dispatch our reaming survivors. The mythology for this sequel indeed makes sense and tries to expand off 3. It seems if Freddy kills all the final Elm street children he will forever be trapped in the dream world with no more victims so he now must find someone he can use to bring new victims, and he finds that in the very shy and insecure Alice, who inherits Kristen's gift (after her grisly furnace death). One thing Freddy didn't count on is that every time he kills someone, she inherits their special power, and gets stronger and stronger, but when Freddy kills a very close family member, Alice must use everything she's got in a final kick ass showdown. Although many people feel this movie is a cheat and that the series should have ended after 3, I beg to differ and felt that the closure for 3 was to poorly done, making the ending very underwhelming, I WANTED MORE! So the sequel is a somewhat decent companion piece to 3. Bringing back the warriors was genius, and I enjoyed the continuity. Sure, I can make a stink about them getting killed, but personally since I cared so much about them from 3, their deaths upped the stakes for me. Also the new characters, although noting that layered, the actors portraying them were competent and very likable none the less, like three, I cared about the kids. Also Lisa Wilcox is a revelation, making the most interesting Elm Street character ever. I was rooting for her all the way.Another pro for this sequel is Renny Harlin in the directing seat.

Well, to me it means a lot of things but if you want to explore what choose life doesn't mean to some people, you should experience Danny Boyle's cult classic Trainspotting. In a way, all these characters seem to have chosen a way of life, but apparently see it as something closer to death. Not with those exact words Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) explains the commitment of being an addict, but somehow he manages to expose his philosophy to the viewer while introducing us to his friends; some who support the philosophy, some who don't and some who don't even care. But I don't think that's Trainspotting's main point showing how drugs can affect people. For instance, there's one character, Begbie (Robert Carlyle), who doesn't consume at all but has (maybe) a bigger problem an obsession with violence. He enjoys kicking people around and making them bleed. That's another point, another issue that affects Renton and the rest of his friends; the silly Spud (Ewen Bremmer), the unpredictable Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the lost Tommy (Kevin McKidd). The real star of the film is John Hodge's screenplay, based on Irvine Welsh's novel. It contains a heavy dose of character development that can be spotted clearly among the heroin injections and delusions of his creatures. It reminded me a lot of Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (with the exception of character development) because, like that film that also focused on drugs, Trainspotting has no defined plot line it's like a roller-coaster ride that finishes and starts again without you being able to get off your seat. There are two times where you clearly sense the movie's coming to an end, but suddenly Hodge and Boyle bring something new to the table. Like in Fear&#133;, Trainspotting has a heavy load of narration (by Renton) that helps and confuses the viewer at the same time. It helps to understand the inner feelings of someone so consumed by an addiction like Renton. There are two beautiful scenes that leave no doubt of Boyle's inventive visual style one follows Renton to a hospital after hi faints with a dose of heroin, another shows him in his own room recovering from his problem (this meaning not having a 'hit'-an injection-for weeks). Both scenes are visually stunning in a way that I would like to detail but don't want you to miss; so I'll just say they almost border surrealism.Some time before these scenes, something occurs that provokes a major change in the film. At that point, if you have gotten used to the fact that the plot is not defined and lies beyond confusion (Renton's narration is confusing because it has some contradictions and sometimes doesn't let the viewer to think by itself), you might appreciate the final moments of the movie, like when Renton goes to London and Boyle creates a ten-second take of the city's most iconic places and it looks like a tourism commercial that doesn't fit with the tone the movie is employing at the time&#133;But it works; because it's funny and original. Unlike Ewan McGregor's performance, for example. His Renton is the kind of role that gets a Scottish actor out of Scotland and catapults him to Hollywood. It involves being 'too Scottish', fairly good-looking and very charismatic. I'm not saying it's a bad performance, I'm just saying it's not difficult to achieve, and it helped McGregor's career greatly. The rest of the guys basically have to do the same, which is something I adore in a way. I adore how British writers\/directors\/actors or whatever deal with friendship. It's a more disinterested way; you feel like no matter what happens, they'll always be there at the end of the day.

It reminded me a lot of Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (with the exception of character development) because, like that film that also focused on drugs, Trainspotting has no defined plot line it's like a roller-coaster ride that finishes and starts again without you being able to get off your seat. There are two times where you clearly sense the movie's coming to an end, but suddenly Hodge and Boyle bring something new to the table. Like in Fear&#133;, Trainspotting has a heavy load of narration (by Renton) that helps and confuses the viewer at the same time. It helps to understand the inner feelings of someone so consumed by an addiction like Renton. There are two beautiful scenes that leave no doubt of Boyle's inventive visual style one follows Renton to a hospital after hi faints with a dose of heroin, another shows him in his own room recovering from his problem (this meaning not having a 'hit'-an injection-for weeks). Both scenes are visually stunning in a way that I would like to detail but don't want you to miss; so I'll just say they almost border surrealism.Some time before these scenes, something occurs that provokes a major change in the film. At that point, if you have gotten used to the fact that the plot is not defined and lies beyond confusion (Renton's narration is confusing because it has some contradictions and sometimes doesn't let the viewer to think by itself), you might appreciate the final moments of the movie, like when Renton goes to London and Boyle creates a ten-second take of the city's most iconic places and it looks like a tourism commercial that doesn't fit with the tone the movie is employing at the time&#133;But it works; because it's funny and original. Unlike Ewan McGregor's performance, for example. His Renton is the kind of role that gets a Scottish actor out of Scotland and catapults him to Hollywood. It involves being 'too Scottish', fairly good-looking and very charismatic. I'm not saying it's a bad performance, I'm just saying it's not difficult to achieve, and it helped McGregor's career greatly. The rest of the guys basically have to do the same, which is something I adore in a way. I adore how British writers\/directors\/actors or whatever deal with friendship. It's a more disinterested way; you feel like no matter what happens, they'll always be there at the end of the day. It's just a true feeling, and I'm not telling you to expect it in this film, but if that were the case; it shouldn't matter whether you choose life or any other thing.

This could be good or bad depending on your state of mind. This is definitely a stoners-only movie, and even then there are some scenes that are appalling. So, basically, don't watch this movie if you don't like marijuana. Because you will hate it even more after watching Next Movie.I say this because, despite of the (initial) PC message in relation to hard drugs, the movie continuously portray C&C causing havoc and chaos in the 'square' society and not giving a damn. In fact, everyone in the movie except for Cheech and Chong is pretty much non-existent. Regular laws do not apply. This reminded me of my favorite stoner movie of all time, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in some ways - but not the good ones. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate this movie, and there ARE some laugh-out-loud moments indeed. But throughout it all I just got the feeling that instead of being funny stoners, they were being anarchist troublemakers. I don't think that's a good image for stoners at all. So, since most of the movie is based on gags that revolve around this, I didn't find much of it funny. And I usually like stoner movies.Now believe me when I say, you have to be completely blasted to sit through this. Because the whole movie itself seems like a dream. There are some very cringeworthy moments in the movie, and most of them courtesy of Cheech. Actually his portrayal of his cousin was much funnier than as himself, so that helped a bit. And mad propz to him for making that saxophone sound! Chong is a bit more interesting, civilized and leveled character, and the best scenes all involve him. Pee-Wee Herman makes an appearance, and well, he's Pee-Wee. And the ending... let's just say it sucked. A lot. Except if you're 12, then it's a real cool ending. So it all depends on your point of view really.I guess this is a movie to be enjoyed really really wasted, when you don't want to think at all, and with stoned friends who might have seen it before a couple of times. A good day to see this would be when you're hungover from the night before. The only problem is, your night will probably have been more fun than this movie.Up in Smoke is a lot better, this is for C&C aficionados only. 5\/10, and I'm being nice.

This film pulls at the heartstrings constantly and is emotionally draining in a positive way. A lovely and tender rendition of what Love is all about. Dakota Fanning as the little 7 year old is endearing and Sean Penn as the retarded father who has only the mental capacity of a 7 year old is brilliant in his portrayal. My hat goes off to Sean Penn not only for his fine performance but also for his willingness to do such a role. This is a film for big hearts and for Daddys who love their daughters. The injection of all those dogs in the latter part of the film is a fine bit of emotional manoeuvering that is cleverly timed. Michelle Pfeiffer gives a good performance as Sean Penn's lawyer. Her emotional breakdown puts us all on a level with Sam Dawson so that we can, as a collective whole, identify with and understand his plight in life. There are several references to Kramer vs Kramer which are appropriate. The state interferes in their lives by stealing away Sam's daughter for her best interests because he cannot take care of her the way the state sees fit. The harshness of the state (government) interfering in and controlling our lives is bluntly put on screen. We are all worn down by life but Love is the sustaining power that saves us all from depression and ultimate extinction. This is a story about the triumph of love against all odds that will linger on in your memory long after this film is over.

The ending angered me greatly...here we have this wonderful character Percy who begins to grow on the residents and is finally being accepted,except for one mouthy,jealous bigot,- real-estate agent Nahum Goddard,who will not accept Percy into their midst.This misshapen belief finally leads to a grave misunderstanding by the citizenry who hunt Percy down, which ends in her drowning in a rushing stream. At the end Nahum admits he was wrong to judge Percy so harshly but darn it all the harm has been done. I was angry at director Lee David Zlotoff who had the power to make this a happy ending. He wrote the script!!! Let's say for example that Nahum Goddard had drowned saving Percy in that stream. The man would have gone to his death via an act of redemption (isn't that a religious quality held dear by a tight Christian community) and our heroine would have gone on living happily ever after in a comfortable setting. I saw this film when it came out, and I even have 2-3 copies of it on DVD and VHS but I can just not watch it again. I know how sad the ending will be. I still give the film a 9 1\/2 though,it was still a great production.(I need to express my ratings in fractions). If Percy had not been killed off I would have given it a 10 for perfection, no question. I'm sorry, but if a beloved character is killed off unnecssarily, then I can not give the film a 10. Too bad I had not been in one of the advance screenings to express my views. If film companies and the Director\/Producer want a 10 from me they had better try for a happy,or at least satisfying ending if at all possible. So much of life is a tragedy and that's why in part we go to the movies to get away from reality, to get a quick shot of hope and to see some element of happiness, even in dramatic circumstances.Percy did not deserve to die after all of us had fallen so much in love with her persona. Could we stand a Spitfire Grill 2 where she miraculously appears one day alive and well? Probably not...Darn it all Lee David Zlotoff, what were you thinking? ","genre":"Drama"}]
