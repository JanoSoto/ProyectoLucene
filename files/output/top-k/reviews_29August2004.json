It was refreshing to see someone love someone for who they are and not for their boobs or legs. It was sweet. The thing that I thought was disgusting was the fact that Lester (Spacey) fell in love with Angela, who is his daughter's age. It's just aggravating to keep seeing movies where the father falls for some younger chick and the mother has an affair with some rich dude. It's not new, it's not different, it just shows how twisted life has become, how no one really takes anything seriously anymore unless it ends up with sex. For instant, Lester only works out and changes because his desire is to be buff enough to have Angela asking to have sex with him. To me, it was a disturbing movie. The plot was different and the camera shots were good. But I'm getting sick of movies were the old man wants to have sex with a twelve year old.

It does a good job of conveying the grief of losing a loved one to disease or illness(having dealt with a cancer victim, and my grandmother's death due to a stroke, that emotion was spot on). The character tie-ins work very well, and do a good job of keeping things moving. Problem is, that I ended up not caring a whit about all of them, with the exception of the John C. Reilly\/Malora Walters relationship; their awkward nature I found compelling. And the overuse of the F-word for dramatic effect was simply boring, and added nothing to the film. Other pointless elements included, but not limited to gratuitous frog suicide, that stupid, completely unbelievable Julianna Moore scene in the drugstore(no pharmacist would act like that, I have to obtain many prescriptions and I get no looks nor frantic calls on the phone), Julianna Moore's OTT acting I don't believe for a moment, that some trophy wife screwing around on a husband that she married for $$ would suddenly get a change of heart and love him cuz he's dying(incessant crying and dropping F-bomb's ain't grief), the black rapper who I couldn't understand a word he was saying, that insipid, Aimee Mann soundtrack, and having all the characters at the same time sing her song at the same time was a throwaway element that made no sense.

That is VERY hard to accept after we went on a long ride hoping he succeeded...it's just very hard to swallow as a fan.

If he had a couple more fights and then had to bow out gracefully for fear of greater injury and retire is one thing.  Close out the series with him on top.  But Sly and Co. somehow found it would be cool to strip away everything the Rocky character built in the previous 4 films, and this is what's most uncomfortable about Rocky V.  Like Terminator 3, I just refuse to acknowledge Rocky V's existence in my mind.  The most unnecessary sequel of all time along with T3 & Godfather III.* out of **** stars.

It is a world devoid of color and comfort where nobody is truly happy, a world where a full belly and good shoes are unobtainable luxuries and what few pleasures he is able to steal are heavily peppered with Catholic guilt.His life isn't marred by any one great tragedy, but rather dozens of small tragedies that erode away his hopes and resolve. He watches his younger siblings die one at a time thru a malady of diseases, he watches his unemployed father shamelessly drink away job after job and all their money, he's ejected from his squalid home and his mother is forced to prostitute herself to a loathsome drunk for a spare room, he has Catholicism rammed down his throat by cruel teachers and his own relatives, and through it all he's never allowed to forget that he's Northern Irish, the lowest form of life on earth.I watched this movie for some time waiting for the plot to manifest itself. And then I realized that, as in real life, there is no plot, just a series of 'events' all strung together that are sometimes unjust and often make no sense. Alcohol, poverty, the Church and hatred of England seem to influence and define everything.

So right away you know this is not going to be an ordinary movie.A few months earlier, as she explains to the authorities, Martha was at her sister Annie's wedding.  Her parents think Martha will be next to get married, as do about 30 other people.  But Martha isn't seeing anyone.Martha works for the KSDG-TV program 'Daybreak San Diego', co-hosted by Dick and Nancy.  Walter, one of her co-workers, Walter, is a possible romantic partner.  But Martha meets Whitman when he selects the same song she wants on a jukebox.  They fall for each other, and he meets her normal parents, and she meets his quirky mother and her maid Consuela.  Whitman's family appears to have money, and he doesn't have to work but can afford all sorts of expensive gifts, even though all he does is write poetry. After a while, it becomes clear Whitman has a fun side that Martha is too uptight to appreciate.  And things go downhill from there.  Not only that, but Whitman's former girlfriend Inga is mentally unbalanced and very jealous.  And she has a very large but friendly sidekick named Bob.  Things get so bad Martha has to hire private detective Jack Tramonte.During the first half, I thought this was just going to be a standard romantic comedy.  But the second half turned out to be anything but normal.  Let's just say Martha appears to be the only sane person left, but not for long.  Everyone else thinks she's crazy.  And what happens would be quite unlikely in real life.I'm not crazy about Ellen DeGeneres, but let's face it.  She has this irresistible perky quality about her that works very well here.  Not Olsen twins perky, but pleasant.  I can't stand Joan Cusack, but I think people might enjoy her demented portrayal of Inga.Most of the music was good.  A lot of it came from the 40s and 50s or at least sounded like it (I know Queen recorded 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' around 1980).  And Martha went to the opera.  There was also Mexican-flavored music in some scenes.  And a boys' choir sang 'I Want To Know What Love Is' by Foreigner, which sounds much better here than in the original version.

While it's an innocent enough film, I suppose, or maybe simply a naïve film, I can't think of many other movies that have made me feel such genuine discomfort.The problem is not that 20-year old Harold falls in love with 79-year old Maude. The problem is that Maude is not sexy, not endearing, and not real. Harold may have been written as an asexual, but I somehow doubt that screenwriter Colin Higgins (whose career has not been an impressive one, having since yielded movies like '9 to 5' and 'Silver Streak') considered that. Harold has no interest in girls his own age and thwarts each of his mother's matchmaking attempts with grotesquely faked suicides.Harold, as played by Bud Cort, is nevertheless the only character in the film who takes on the dimensions of an actual human being. Everyone else is written as a caricature, and that's one of the film's major flaws. Harold's mother, for instance, is an obnoxious, classist heiress who asks her son questions and then answers on his behalf. The character is written in one key and is played in one key by Vivian Pickles. The filmmakers' attitude toward this character is so obvious that by simply placing poor Harold as her son, in her company, a certain angelic aura is given to him in contrast. Harold is laconic and glum, wears mourner's attire and drives a hearse, and his economy of verbal expression elicits the viewer's sympathy almost by default, since every other character in the film may as well be using a megaphone.Then there's Maude. Ruth Gordon is a fine actress, and it's heartwarming to see a woman of her age exhibit as much verve and energy as she does here. But her character of Maude is yet another caricature, and her every line drips with saccharine forever-young sunniness that sounds like flower-child parody. She brings some joy, some sunshine, into Harold's life, and some excitement; it's supposed to be ironic and funny when Maude steals a car and speeds away from the police.The movie is entirely too precious about Harold, about Maude, and about Harold and Maude. Even Harold's suicide forgeries are framed with a glow of Gothic tragedy, which just prevents them from being funny (although one prank, where Harold pretends to chop off a hand in order to scare off another arranged date, is funny). Making matters worse is the musical score by Cat Stevens, which is now painfully dated and sugar-coats whatever remaining black comedy could have been salvaged from this material. All of these touches are intended to make the film feel-good and liberating, I would presume, but it's ultimately just depressing and made me feel pretty queasy.Watching this movie, nothing about it screams 'classic.'

Even Harold's suicide forgeries are framed with a glow of Gothic tragedy, which just prevents them from being funny (although one prank, where Harold pretends to chop off a hand in order to scare off another arranged date, is funny). Making matters worse is the musical score by Cat Stevens, which is now painfully dated and sugar-coats whatever remaining black comedy could have been salvaged from this material. All of these touches are intended to make the film feel-good and liberating, I would presume, but it's ultimately just depressing and made me feel pretty queasy.Watching this movie, nothing about it screams 'classic.' It looks like it should have remained some forgotten and embarrassing relic of the early '70s.

It's a story about a young motherless girl (Amy) who rescues some wild goose eggs and basically becomes their mother. The story evolves as the goslings grow into young adult birds ready to fly south. Since they never had parents the geese haven't learned to fly. The girl's dad thinks he can get them to fly by following him in his ultra-light. But they will only follow Amy. So dad teaches her to fly. Soon the geese are flying. Next, dad and Amy hatch a plot to fly south and have the geese follow them. We know this actually happened when 2 scientists did something similar. One of the reasons I was sucked into this wonderful family movie was the photography. It is National Geographic quality. In fact I was so impressed with the cinematography that I had to look up who did it Caleb Deschanel. The setting, a farm in Southern Ontario, allowed him to become intimate with the geese and the natural setting. Another reason I couldn't stop watching the movie was the stunning performance by Anna Paquin, the 16-year old girl who played Amy. I remembered her from the movie, 'Piano.' She played Flora, the daughter of Holly Hunter. I'm sure they picked Paquin to do that part because of her speaking ability. Holly Hunter played the part of Ada, a woman who couldn't talk. She communicated with sign language through her daughter. Paquin was so good in her part that she won the Oscar, quite a feat for an 11-year old.The story, 'Fly Away Home' is touching because she's not the kind of Hollywood-trained child actor you find in most movies. A surprising thing happened as I watched Amy and her geese. I could sense a startling serenity from her as the bond had developed between them. I wondered how she could manage that. She was only a 16-year old actress then but she conveyed a mothering instinct that goes back to the ageless beginnings of life on this planet. When the goslings were following her around, much of the photography was from ground level. Later when they were all flying, the photography was right there in the flying formation. You were seeing the birds, in flight, right next to you. The beauty of motion was unbelievable. I thought, 'How could anyone shoot these creatures?' There is beauty in seeing them fly. There is beauty in seeing them in their habitat. But the overwhelming beauty is in their living. They deserved that life. It made me think of this sad planet and the billions of creatures that have died because of the human race. Here was a story that went against the slaughter. When Amy and her birds arrived at their destination in Chesapeake Bay I had misty eyes.So I'm a soft touch.
