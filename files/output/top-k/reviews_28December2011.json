[{"date":"28 December 2011","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I wasn't planning on this. I liked Bottle Rocket plenty, but was aware that Wes Anderson was a divisive director and that Rushmore would represent a very possible peak for his style. I was also aware that if I liked this movie, or, gasp, loved it, I would never escape the cloud of hipster-ism that would surely pop out of nowhere and provide woeful narration for the duration of my life. And yet... I loved it. Yup, I'm pretty sure that I loved Rushmore.Now, I'm pretty sure I didn't like Max Fischer much at all. I mean, he's a little endearing, but also remarkably sinister, and oddly dark for a comedy. But then, Rushmore isn't like most comedies. I've been working on a rather far-fetched theory that the most enduring comedies all stem from an inner darkness, or depression (see Louie, Burn After Reading, etc.), and Rushmore certainly works that angle. Although Max and Herman's antics create a lot of comedy, they're rooted in an obsession (or is it devotion?) for love--Rosemary. She calls them children, I'll call them innocent--Herman obviously identifies with Max for his idealism and his spark, his imagination and his wit, and above all he identifies with Max's courage. Herman's cannonball is laugh-inducing, but also some form of suicide, some form of drowning. He's feeling a little lonely, and he wants to escape. Max's attempts to impress Rosemary are less depressed, but they reveal a manic and willful distortion of expectations and human interaction--he's a deeply disturbed little person, redeemed by a wild imagination and a frightening ability to love. Think of his obsessions before Rosemary Rushmore, and his plays. And think of his explanation for going to Rushmore my mother saw my play and thought I should go to Rushmore. That must be grief, right? Max's infatuation with Rosemary is a deeply uncomfortable plot device for a movie like this to carry on with, but it works because it all contributes to catharsis. Like the part in the play where the train zooms by, many significant moments in the movie are drenched in sound and represent a release--Anderson loves his songs, but they're also background noise to disguise the intensity of the movie, rather than to simply amplify it. Max's love of Rosemary also sets into motion him finally getting over his mother's death, and accepting his father's identity--Rosemary is similarly afflicted with a devotion to a dead person. And when Max identifies a dead fingernail, he's come to terms with something inside him as well. One of my favorite interactions in the movie is when Margaret Yang interrupts him, and she reveals that she fudged her experiment results It didn't work. I thought it would, but it didn't, so I faked the results. Or something of that nature. In the end, Rushmore is about fakery, and about spectacle, and about how real life doesn't operate that way. But it's also about embracing that honesty (even in fakery) and allowing it to guide a person to maturity and acceptance. For a movie often derided as all style, Rushmore carries so much substance it kinda hurts.

And to bring salvation for all mankind, no one endured a greater pain than Jesus of Nazareth.His body was flogged; his head carried the infamous crown of thorns and his body, naked as when he came out of his mother's womb, was sweating thin streams of blood and to the pain's atrocity was tied the humiliation of stones, spits, insults from an angry but unconscious mob, the betrayal from his own. One would imagine that the Son of God, the divine Icon immortalized in churches, would undergo the ultimate pain of crucifixion with a holy majesty, but in The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus is all flesh and blood, extraordinarily played by Willem Dafoe, he's human in the most painful meaning of the word, and at the crucial moment, as if he stopped incarnating God on Earth, he embodied our miserable vulnerability.My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? cries out Jesus of Nazareth on his cross. This is the agony of a soul unjustly abandoned by his father, and as a capricious reaction, abandons his divine power to succumb to the last temptation of being a human. Jesus' weakness works as a double-edged sword, feeling both the weight of his responsibility, and renouncing to it, or being strong enough to resist the temptation, then transcending the organic sensation of pain into the necessary sacrifice that would lead to mankind's redemption. Martin Scorsese' controversial film chronicles the insupportable duality that tortured Jesus' heart, with a combination of iconoclast intelligence and thought-provoking direction, with a genius emotional core hidden behind its heretic surface.No other director than Martin Scorsese has acquired such talent to depict the ravaged effects of guilt on a tortured soul, starting with what I consider his first masterpiece Mean Streets. Charlie (Harvey Keitel) believed that no one could make up for his sins in church; it had to be done on the streets. I guess Marty was a man of action who despised bigotry and redemption, like sins could only be made of actions, no passive introspections or deep meditations. In The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus' prayers are never detached from the reality of his world; he also is a man of action, plenty aware that God has plans for him. The roots of his torment are that he ignores about the plan, he's a shepherd without a stick, he's a guide lost between two worlds, Earth and Heaven, sins and temptations, grace and divinity.Scorsese direction manages captures the essence of these two realities' coexisting in the soul of a revolutionary man. Jesus is also a leader, followed with a zealous enthusiasm by his disciples, and his most devoted supporter and closest companion happens to be Judas Iscariot, played by Harvey Keitel. Judas represents the dubious side of humanity his mission was to kill Jesus as a traitor of the Jews, but he's eventually convinced that he's the Messiah. The tragedy of Jesus' divinity is that it ignites more passion than it extinguish, starting with his ferocious desire to show the light, to fight the evil and the moral corruption that contaminated the world. But when carrying an ax and about to succumb to violence, his hands bleed communicating the uselessness of violence. Jesus cannot fight like men and only his sacrifice would consecrate his divinity and bring the salvation.This acceptance of death is our both Scorsese and our inspiration. Jesus becomes is a man of life, who feels, shouts, drinks, loves and dances, the ambiguity of his relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) progressively draws a line of uncertainty between passion and compassion. Jesus' passion is what both drives his desire to save mankind and what deprives his soul from the divine detachment. Jesus' duality is something that is not taken for granted; it's experienced when Jesus and Judah debates the importance of the soul and the body, and when Jesus' own faith wavers as to depict faith as a malleable, a living form that can rely on monolithic and impenetrable dogmas, the same that attacked the film and literally killed its success.Jesus' soul is often lured by Satan, through the form of a lion, a cobra and ultimately, a little girl who'll convince him to renounce the crucifixion and the film' genius is reached during the alternate reality sequence featuring a Jesus who rejected his duty and surrendered to Satan by choosing to live normally, have children and wives and die peacefully. It's the climactic pay-off of an outstanding beginning, and it works as an inconvenient reality. When Paul preaches the crucifixion's message because and Jesus objects that one can't build anything on lies, it doesn't matter for Paul as long as people listen. But the point is that no salvation can be based on abstractions, one must experience it, and the ultimate punishment comes from the mouth of an older Judas who shouts to Jesus that he betrayed them when he stopped acting like the Messiah, an intolerable reality. Then Jesus implores God to take him back on the cross, his fate and the price for men's salvation and the accomplished miracle leaves a heartbreaking smile in Jesus' ecstatic face, and the rest is history &#x85;The Last Temptation of Christ echoes the cathartic effect of necessary pains in our quest for redemption, the quest of lifetimes, but one could never have the courage to renounce temptations and experience redemption through self-punishment, self as God did to Jesus. Martin Scorsese highlights the purity of Jesus' soul reached after a painful struggle between his body and his soul, while all of us, including Scorsese, would forever live a life paved by temptations we'd always wish to be the last.

Well this classic movie from 1985 is somewhere on the same basis as that feeling of wanting to be a martial artist. The movie revolves around the main character 'Bruce' Leroy Green, a young man who trains to become a master much like his idol Bruce Lee. The story for this movie is pretty much non-existent there are plot areas in which you'll find yourself wondering what the hell just happened but you'll soon forget and realize that you really don't care that there isn't much of a story to be told with this movie. The plot of the movie is the main antagonist of the movie Eddie Arcadian wants to get rid of Leroy for ruining his ultimate plan of having his girlfriends video to be played on the Teen\/Adult video dance show at 7th Heaven. 7th Heaven is the spot where the Video Jockey Ms Laura Charles (future Leroy love interest) works and hosts a show. After her refusal to play the video, Eddie Arcadian decides to get rough and kidnap the VJ. Leroy sees the damsel in distress and proceeds to kick everyones ass, then he disappears. This would go on to happen once more and again he kicks their asses. From here furiously Eddie decides to hire fighters, murderers, just all out bad people to get rid of Leroy. After hiring the only person capable of beating Leroy in Sho'nuff the rival so to speak of Leroy, as they are the two baddest dudes in Harlem. Sho'nuff wants to fight Leroy based on the fact that he is the only threat to him running the town and feels that he's a weakling due to his non-violent nature. Eddie now kidnaps Laura once again this time with Leroy's brother Ritchie, this infuriates Leroy and he accepts the challenge from Eddie and fights all of his hired henchmen before becoming overwhelmed when his students come to his rescue allowing him to give chase to Eddie and meeting Sho'nuff for the final battle.This is a nostalgic movie as it's pretty much the 80s as best I can remember it. Bright colors, weird outfits, cheesy acting, good music, and martial arts. This movie would never be considered one of the greatest movies or stories ever told but for someone like me who was born in the 80s this movie is pretty damn good. I would recommend watching the movie if you're just watching for a laugh, something to keep you entertained or if you're just a big fan. As you're watching just remember when you were a kid and watching either Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung or whomever from your younger years and those memories of wanting to be those guys translates perfectly into this movie.

They are just there, following an apparently preordained path of evil--does that alone makes them interesting? We never get much insight into their motivations beyond Kit's being rejected by Holly's father because he was a garbage man and not good enough for his daughter. A lot of suitors are rejected for a lot of reasons, but they don't go on protracted killing sprees. If this film is meant to be a condemnation of a society that could produce and even romanticize a sociopath such as Kit, then I think it is not totally successful, since I believe such aberrant behavior is more the result of some genetic predisposition rather than provoked by society.

Is the emptiness in the lives of Kit and Holly meant to represent the emptiness of 1950s America? A bit heavy handed that.

These are all David Lean films, and so I decided to start my David Lean unit with the first of those films, the 7- Oscar winning Bridge on the River Kwai. And oh my, what a start it was.'Kwai' is a World War II film made 12 years after the war concluded. The film centers around the titular Bridge, and how British POWs build it under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, and how a small group of Allied commandos try to destroy it. It's a grand idea for a plot, about the conflict of ideas and lack of communication.The film is loosely broken into three acts. The first act follows Nicholson's standoff with the Japanese commanding officer in the POW camp about the rules of war, and the subsequent building of the bridge under two different leaderships. The second act is about a small group of Allies who venture into the jungle to destroy the bridge, and their encounters in the wild. The final act concludes the story of the two camps in a magnificent way.An interesting angle of the film is that despite being a war film, there is little violence, and no swearing. All of the action that does happen is necessary, something that has influenced even modern films like 'Drive'. Both plots could have inserted extra action but didn't, and this restraint makes good movies into great movies. The Bridge on the River Kwai is about the people of war as much as their actions.A product of this decision is that the first act could be considered slow. There is lots of standing, lots of talking, and lots of stubbornness. But by the end a viewer realizes how necessary it is. In 'The Good, the Bad & the Ugly', there is an extended sequence where the bad guy forces Clint Eastwood to walk through the desert, and for a while, very little happens. This scene could've been over quicker, but that would have defeated the point that Clint breaks down. That is an idea from 'Kwai'. A month goes by as the leaders verbally, and silently, duke it out with their ideals. The slow first act is necessary to emotionally invest in the scenario, and the film just gets better from there.My summary of the film is 'a beautiful bridge'. The first half of this statement is beautiful, and it perfectly describes the visual aspect of the film. The cinematography is sublime. Sweeping jungle vistas, fauna, rushing rivers and more make simply seeing 'Kwai' a treat. I was lucky enough to get it on Blu Ray, and for an old film it looks fantastic. The bats in a certain river scene are absolutely breathtaking. You can simulate a lot in Hollywood, but this is an outstanding example of shooting on location in the jungles of what is now Sri Lanka.But there's more than just looking at the film, the substance is even greater, starting with the actors. They are excellent. Alec Guinness, in his award winning performance, is the British general who we are so conflicted about. His decisions are both completely correct and absolutely wrong. He is an idealist, valuing discipline and honour above his duty as an Allied leader. His decisions beg to ask the question, What would you do? Nicholson is a layered character performed perfectly.Colonel Saito is the commander of the Japanese at the camp, and is the primary... antagonist. His stance is portrayed ruthlessly and effectively. He and Nicholson butt heads, but are two sides of the same coin. They have an excellent dynamic, and their relationship is worth studying for its complexity.Away from the clash of leaders is Shears, an American played by William Holden. In this film where ego reigns supreme, Shears is the realistic, reasonable, and wiseass one. He's the character who says, What's the matter with all of you guys? He's is well played and has the best line in the film You... The casting is just excellent overall.The second part of my summary is 'bridge'. Despite the obvious reason, 'Kwai' is a bridge between the old era of film and the new. Scenes with lots of talking, like the discussion about escape, are old fashioned, very 50's. But others, like the trek through the jungle and the ending, are far ahead of their time. The stealthy hunt for the Japanese soldier and the whole visual aspect of that scene is certainly influential on another war epic, Apocalypse Now. In general, The Bridge on the River Kwai is ahead of its time.As I've said, the film gets better and better, culminating in the extraordinary ending. It is one of the best scenes in film and leaves much to discuss. A common statement from the Warden, the explosives-happy commando is to expect the unexpected. The event that makes the last scene unexpected is so obviously a factor but so easily overlooked, you'll gasp. Words to describe the climatic scene include explosive, awesome, shaking, and epic. And then you'll think. What did Warden mean? What did Shears mean? What did Nicholson mean? Did he do what he did on purpose? You can have a great discussion about those actions. And then to end it all, the realistic doctor saying Madness! Madness! And then zooming out, to admire the jungle... an amazing shot.'Kwai' is a thinking film. You can wonder how you would do in that situation. The film also touches on the waste of war, honour and pride, and also the role of the young in battle. It's stupendous, a landmark film. 9.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 December 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 83 I found myself in the possession of three films after Christmas this year The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago.

They have an excellent dynamic, and their relationship is worth studying for its complexity.Away from the clash of leaders is Shears, an American played by William Holden. In this film where ego reigns supreme, Shears is the realistic, reasonable, and wiseass one. He's the character who says, What's the matter with all of you guys? He's is well played and has the best line in the film You... The casting is just excellent overall.The second part of my summary is 'bridge'. Despite the obvious reason, 'Kwai' is a bridge between the old era of film and the new. Scenes with lots of talking, like the discussion about escape, are old fashioned, very 50's. But others, like the trek through the jungle and the ending, are far ahead of their time. The stealthy hunt for the Japanese soldier and the whole visual aspect of that scene is certainly influential on another war epic, Apocalypse Now. In general, The Bridge on the River Kwai is ahead of its time.As I've said, the film gets better and better, culminating in the extraordinary ending. It is one of the best scenes in film and leaves much to discuss. A common statement from the Warden, the explosives-happy commando is to expect the unexpected. The event that makes the last scene unexpected is so obviously a factor but so easily overlooked, you'll gasp. Words to describe the climatic scene include explosive, awesome, shaking, and epic. And then you'll think. What did Warden mean? What did Shears mean? What did Nicholson mean? Did he do what he did on purpose? You can have a great discussion about those actions. And then to end it all, the realistic doctor saying Madness! Madness! And then zooming out, to admire the jungle... an amazing shot.'Kwai' is a thinking film. You can wonder how you would do in that situation. The film also touches on the waste of war, honour and pride, and also the role of the young in battle. It's stupendous, a landmark film. 9.4\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, War"},{"date":"28 December 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 83 I found myself in the possession of three films after Christmas this year The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago. These are all David Lean films, and so I decided to start my David Lean unit with the first of those films, the 7- Oscar winning Bridge on the River Kwai. And oh my, what a start it was.'Kwai' is a World War II film made 12 years after the war concluded. The film centers around the titular Bridge, and how British POWs build it under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson, and how a small group of Allied commandos try to destroy it. It's a grand idea for a plot, about the conflict of ideas and lack of communication.The film is loosely broken into three acts. The first act follows Nicholson's standoff with the Japanese commanding officer in the POW camp about the rules of war, and the subsequent building of the bridge under two different leaderships. The second act is about a small group of Allies who venture into the jungle to destroy the bridge, and their encounters in the wild. The final act concludes the story of the two camps in a magnificent way.An interesting angle of the film is that despite being a war film, there is little violence, and no swearing. All of the action that does happen is necessary, something that has influenced even modern films like 'Drive'. Both plots could have inserted extra action but didn't, and this restraint makes good movies into great movies. The Bridge on the River Kwai is about the people of war as much as their actions.A product of this decision is that the first act could be considered slow. There is lots of standing, lots of talking, and lots of stubbornness. But by the end a viewer realizes how necessary it is. In 'The Good, the Bad & the Ugly', there is an extended sequence where the bad guy forces Clint Eastwood to walk through the desert, and for a while, very little happens. This scene could've been over quicker, but that would have defeated the point that Clint breaks down. That is an idea from 'Kwai'. A month goes by as the leaders verbally, and silently, duke it out with their ideals. The slow first act is necessary to emotionally invest in the scenario, and the film just gets better from there.My summary of the film is 'a beautiful bridge'. The first half of this statement is beautiful, and it perfectly describes the visual aspect of the film. The cinematography is sublime. Sweeping jungle vistas, fauna, rushing rivers and more make simply seeing 'Kwai' a treat. I was lucky enough to get it on Blu Ray, and for an old film it looks fantastic. The bats in a certain river scene are absolutely breathtaking. You can simulate a lot in Hollywood, but this is an outstanding example of shooting on location in the jungles of what is now Sri Lanka.But there's more than just looking at the film, the substance is even greater, starting with the actors. They are excellent. Alec Guinness, in his award winning performance, is the British general who we are so conflicted about. His decisions are both completely correct and absolutely wrong. He is an idealist, valuing discipline and honour above his duty as an Allied leader. His decisions beg to ask the question, What would you do?

I give Bulletproof some credit for some slickly shot shoot-out sequences, but other than that everything else feels wrong to me. When I think of a good buddy movie, I think of likable characters, juicy dialogue to savour and some dynamicism in the action sequences. Some people watching Bulletproof may find these things, and I do respect that, however for me what I found here was the complete opposite on all counts. I really didn't care for any of the characters, finding them clichéd and annoying, especially Sandler's character. In fact, I found myself rooting more for the villains, but wished there was more to them. Bulletproof just wasn't funny to me either, I love action movies with comedy when it is good, but apart from one or two mildly amusing parts the dialogue was corny and the jokes rather tasteless. There is nothing dynamic about the action sequences, they may be slickly shot but the way they are choreographed at times is inept and the complete lack of subtlety in the violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth afterwards. The story is predictable with very little coming across as truly thrilling, while all the performances fall flat. Sandler has definitely done worse and more irritating performances, but his performance consists of near-unintelligible mumbling and I found myself annoyed by his character right from the start. Damon Wayans fares better, having more charisma, but the dialogue is so lame, the chemistry between him and Sandler so forced and the character so clichéd, it comes across as a wasted effort. James Caan is a great actor, but the first thought that came into my head after finishing Bulletproof was, what on earth was he doing here? He tried, but deserved so much better.

If so, then I stand proudly convicted. Cyborg is one of action icon's Jean-Claude Van Damme's earliest efforts, but takes him out of the martial arts arenas of Kickboxer and Bloodsport and into the apocalyptic future. Set in a wasteland where a plague has reduced America to near-barbarism, the last hope for a cure waits in Atlanta. The cyborg of our title is headed there, but is captured en route by the evil Fender, a nomadic warlord who likes the savage place the world has become and wants the cure for himself. Van Damme is a mercenary with an old score to settle with Fender, and it's up to him to rescue the cyborg and make sure the cure stays out of Fender's hands.Often coldly maligned by critics and even Van Damme fans, Cyborg is actually highly enjoyable. True, it is very much a b-movie, but that's not always a bad thing. The film's budget was obviously minuscule, but director Albert Pyun does a good job with what he has and creates an interesting world of chaos and mayhem for our story to unfold within. Some of his directorial touches are also rather creative, and the action choreography, if unsophisticated, is very well done and frequently hard-hitting. Van Damme is still a bit raw as an actor at this point in his career, but even so he has the charisma that has made him one of the biggest action stars in movie history and has no trouble capturing viewer interest as the enigmatic Gibson. Deborah Richter is attractive and appealing as Gibson's female sidekick, and Dayle Haddon is a suitable semi-damsel in distress as the titular cyborg who falls into Fender's diabolical clutches. Vincent Klyn really seems to enjoy playing Fender, and chews the scenery with gusto every chance he gets. Klyn's Fender is a psychotic escapee from Mad Max, rotten to the core and a one of those villains you really love to hate. His showdown with Gibson is brutal and highly satisfying.Low-budget as it may be, Cyborg is highly enjoyable. It's never boring, with lots of visceral action and an interesting setting. While I admit it's no action classic, it's certainly more entertaining than many big-budget productions that have been generally better received. Fans of dystopian action will probably find a lot to like in Cyborg, as will fans of Van Damme or director Pyn. If not a masterpiece, Cyborg is at least a satisfying b-movie adventure that holds up to multiple viewings.

I swear, when I saw him in the middle of a hockey team p*ss up, I gaped in horror. This chap clearly had a long way to go before The Matrix. The story is simple, and indeed, very predictable.

He makes the team - the Mustangs, but not after being decked by the caveman Racki (George J. Finn - where did he disappear to? he was never in anything after it). Racki ends up on another team, and later on, when the Mustangs play Racki's team, Youngblood and the rest of the team are harassed by the psychopathic Racki, and the cock-of-the-walk Sutton (Patrick Swayze), the Mustang's top goal-scorer, ends up nearly in a coma after an off-the-puck challenge.

I first came across Rob Lowe in the film Bad Influence, which is a superb film, and Lowe, being the older and mature actor he is by this stage, is immense in it. Here, he is very young and as stale and plain as a statue. He is clearly just getting through this on his good looks, and then bring in Patrick Swayze, who believe it or not, actually acts in this. A decent performance from the Dirty Dancing star, it has to be said. Ed Lauter is in top form as the tough, hard to please Mustang coach, and his daughter - same as Lowe, she has nothing else to offer other than eye candy - is played by Cynthia Gibb. I quite liked Jim Youngs's performance as Kelly; Youngblood's older brother who shows him how to stop being a wuss and start sticking up for himself on the ice rig.

Nick's swordsmanship is more flourish and flair than intricate highly skilled moves, but the action scenes move quickly enough to ignore the lack of quick hands, and before you can dissect the previous scene someone is cracking the next joke to bring you back to the film.Blind Fury runs a neat 80 minutes, most of which is spent padding time until the next action sequence, so the bad guys are straight up redneck caricatures.

The strength of the film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously, leading the charge here is Hauer himself. Being the 'blind guy' means all the visually impaired jokes are at his expense, and even when he has the upper hand and gets to spit a put-down or one liner it is done totally straight faced and without relish or theatrics, often the funniest lines are delivered deadpan. And where the action is concerned like many of the best B flicks it is reminiscent of a classic A Team episode, only with more violence and swearing.It is cheesy, far fetched and the one scene where they unleash the special effects has aged about as well as Sharon Stone, but I wouldn't have it any other way.Final Rating &#x96; 8 \/ 10.

Instead we get cartoonish characters, none more so than the pipsqueak Elisha Cook as Greenstreet's muscle. whom he allegedly regards as like his own son or so he says.In my opinion a movie about the stuff dreams are made of and the obsessions of those chasing those dreams shouldn't be pausing every so often for a chuckle or two. I don't think TMF ever made up its mind whether the characters should be taken seriously and tried too often to have it both ways.In sum, I feel like TMF is being graded on the curve. It's good compared to what came before it, but it's nowhere close to being in the same league as Chinatown, where John Huston, TMF's director, conveys the menace that Lorre and Greenstreet don't.

Viggo Mortensen who is a terrific actor actually proves he can also be a supporting actor as well and he is great as the fearless adventurer.

The act of simplifying the plot down to the most direct and necessary elements I like, the fact that much of the 100 minutes remaining could best be described as filler a less welcome by-product.Da Silva (pre-roids Sly Stallone) and Fox (Billy Dee Williams) are partners in New York City. The kind that are willing to see past the usual red tape to get the job done. Who knows maybe in 1981 this wasn't yet a cliché? Da Silva is a bearded ex Vietnam vet with an ex-wife that he pines for and a hatred of unnecessary violence due to his war service.Fox has a beard too, but apparently not much other backstory worth relaying during the film.Gee I wonder if the ex-wife will somehow become involved and if Da Silva might be forced to choose between pacifism or a loved one? Into their standard beating down bad guys existence comes a German terrorist named Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer), who has recently set off bombs in the UK and has fled to the US to continue wreaking havoc. The powers that be decide they need more men on the street to track down Wolfie and so Da Silva, Fox and some others are dragged off the beat and summarily given training on anti-terrorist tactics; tactics a battle scarred Da Silva finds exceptionally uncool.The duo are initially reluctant to continue their anti-terrorist participation but soon Da Silva starts to learn how Wulfgar's mind works, and as he nears the prey things get personal and Wulfgar decides to teach Da Silva a lesson, as well as causing untold horror and mass confusion at the death of many innocent civilians.Of course this leads to various chase scenes and a standoff at the end of the film where many lives are at stake and there can be only one survivor.Nighthawks (terrible title) is actually pretty OK seeing as it is now in its 4th decade of existence. There is a very worthwhile footchase through the streets and subway tunnels of NYC that lasts a good 5 or so minutes and never gets boring. As mentioned it is the classic 80s technique of having two or three showcase scenes, with everything else merely building up to the next one, so don't expect wall to wall action. Perhaps as overcompensation for this when someone gets shot they manage to get knocked back about 40 feet, this is especially obvious in the latter scenes.Sly hadn't yet honed his 'yeah I'm dumb but I don't take myself too seriously' shtick &#x96; he even tries acting for a while &#x96; Billy Dee is surprisingly low key and basically window dressing here, aside from one scene where he is allowed to vent in full mother-f*cking glory. But it is Rutger Hauer as Wulfgar who practically demands you remember him. In the early scenes he plays things relatively straight but as the film progresses he becomes more and more hammy and over the top in his portrayal of what is admittedly a reasonably cartoony character.Nighthawks has precious little that will remain with you after you've seen it, but it remains a solid film with a couple of decent scenes and is a worthy early introduction to one Mr R.

Beyond all of that is the more troubling realization that, as far as protagonists go, RoboCop is a dead end with no room to grow. Although he is capable of making decisions based on emotions, he is basically a zombie with no personality &#x96; not exactly someone you want to spend a whole lot of time with.OCP (the fascist corporation that has been trying to take over Detroit) still hasn't gotten anywhere. You'd think by the third film OCP would be in the midst of building their dystopian Delta City. It certainly would have made for a more interesting setting than boring old downtown Detroit. They've formed a Nazi-like regime (led by a snooty Englishman) to forcibly evict people.We're soon introduced to Nico, one of the film's more annoying characters. Of course, she's a kid genius who can hack into robots and computers using her laptop computer. After being separated from her parents, she befriends a group of libertarian revolutionaries that are trying to resist OCP by hiding in the sewers. When RoboCop sees the plight of the people he decides to join their cause. The audience, on the other hand, will find it hard to identify with the rebels. Why are they willing to give up their lives for such deplorable living conditions? In a lame reference to Detroit's failing auto industry, OCP has been taken over by a Japanese rival. To make matters even more stupid, the Japanese company sends over a Terminator-like ninja robot to fight RoboCop, even though RoboCop and the police force are owned and operated by OCP. Don't get excited; the inevitable duel between RoboCop and the ninja is (and I say this without hyperbole) one of the worst fight scenes ever put on film.The story is also painfully predictable. In one scene, a nameless officer approaches Murphy's old partner and asks, Hey, want this body armor? which she declines because she's off-duty. You guessed it, she gets shot and killed in the next scene. When the rebels steal a futuristic jetpack from the police armory, you know that somewhere down the line RoboCop's going to be flying around like a jackass, which he does in the grand finale.

Among The Band's classics are Up on Cripple Creek, Stagefright, The Shape I'm In, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down and a studio version of The Weight. Strictly speaking of the music, it's clearly wonderful with everyone giving it their all and clearly they all know that they're involved in something extremely special. Some of the highlights include Young's Helpless, Muddy Water's Mannish Boy and of course the finale with Bob Dylan who had used The Band (known as The Hawks) as his backup band and also used them for the album Planet Waves. The second aspect of the film are the interviews that Scorsese does with the group, which covers the start of their career, the girls on the road, their influences and even some moments which are clearly dark times for the group including why this was going to be the final show. I've heard many people talk about how depressing the film is because you are actually seeing their last show but while it's true it sucks the group never got back together, I think it's a little unfair to blame the movie. The movie is technically brilliant on all levels and you really have to give Scorsese and company credit for being able to pull it off.

The team are inadvertently stuck in the middle of a huge rush to escape with the spirits encroaching ominously and the clock ticking down on the giant cannon being fired.The ending is fairly hippy-ish, as is the underlying message that we must be good to Mother Earth (Note I didn't say it wasn't an accurate or false message, just the way it was related here was hippy-ish and a little heavy-handed.) Final Fantasy boasts an all star-voice cast including all the above plus Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames and Keith David. The visuals are often incredibly well-rendered, it's hard to believe this was made 10 years ago.Final Fantasy The Spirits Within is like a Brazilian supermodel with no command of the English language, whilst it looks absolutely amazing once the dialogue starts it is easy to get a little confused at times, but for the most part you still don't mind.Final Rating &#x96; 5.5 \/ 10.

As most of you are aware we all have a tiny bug inside us that grows when we are scared, the only way to stop it from killing us is to scream. Screaming reduces its size. This is the wonderfully bonkers plot of The Tingler. Produced and directed by William Castle, this is a film that was made with gimmicks in mind. Castle was the kind of man to send skeletons on zip-wires and pay people to scream. It's evidenced here by an introduction by Castle. So this doesn't have the effect of the cinema, though I'm sure that was hardly terrifying itself. The film has some nice twists I didn't see coming, and Price's performance is very serious and believable. He isn't camping it up here.It takes a while to get going, but the freak-out scene had some bizarre creepy moments like a beasts arm throwing an axe. It's more interesting than it had to be, considering the gimmicks it was created for. ","genre":null},{"date":"28 December 2011","score":"","review":" Scientifically sound stuff here.
