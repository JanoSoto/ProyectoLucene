[{"date":"1 September 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Professor Ethan Powell is returned to America by Ugandan police &#150; for years he has been living wild in the mountains and was captured after killing several men.  He is brought to America for trial but first must undergo a psychological evaluation.  Smelling a best seller and a career boost, Theo Caulder takes the case and enters the prison.  However his journey into Powell's mind is not as easy or as straightforward an experience as he had imagined.I can't remember last when I watched a film that tried to be so many things at the same time.  Instinct is one of those films to me &#150; it does psychological drama, thriller, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Gorilla's in the Mist.  The major failing of this aim is that it doesn't manage to do very well with any of these and ends up feeling like a hotchpotch of half ideas.  The plot is stretched from the very start &#150; Powell opens up to Caulder with alarming ease (and out of nowhere) and things become increasingly half-explained from then on.  The central part of the story that is meant to keep us hooked (why did Powell kill those men?) is clear from the opening 5 minutes (or even from a brief plot summary!) so that drama is all but absent.Backing this up is the subplot that sees Powell caring for and liberating the brutalised inmates in the prison in a series of scenes that seeming arise from nothing to the extent that I was left wondering where all that came from!  Likewise the interview scenes lack any real tension of their own.  The main (or at least I think it was) strand of Powell living among the gorillas for years is probably the most interesting but again is a little silly.  He never looks like he has slept rough or had anything other than a full nutritious diet the whole time &#150; it certainly doesn't fit with his early description as a wild man!  Having said that, the final scene in the jungle flashback is very moving and intense and is worth seeing despite the rest of the film.Anyone who thinks that the film isn't lazily written and poorly delivered will only need to see the final shot of the film to agree that clearly something's weren't thought through and that this story needed more focus and strength.  With Sir Hopkins in the lead I had hoped he would bring more to the role, and, in fairness, he tries hard, but his interview scenes are a little too hammy and his `wild man' is too civilised and polite after an initial opening.  Gooding Jr's character has to cover several of the genres and he struggles as a result of this.  He never really convinced me in his role and is overshadowed by even a poor Hopkins.  The support cast is not great -&#150;the prisoners are nothing more than clichés who fill out the film and do nothing to add to the credibility (or lack thereof) of the plot.Overall this film has moments that work and moments that don't.  It isn't that it is a bad film, it simply doesn't work together as one story.  The sad fact is that the central story is not dramatic or detailed enough to fill the running time, so lots of clutter has been added which fills it out but also drags it down unnecessarily.

Antisocial behavior need not be a concomitant of genius, as other recent films about gifted but more or less detached characters seem to take for granted (as does this one).  Neither are saccharine catharses inevitable.  And the usually fine actor Stellan Skarsgard as the American professor with a French name and a Swedish accent seems miscast.
