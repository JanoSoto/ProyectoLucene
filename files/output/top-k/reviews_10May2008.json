I think that Nurse Ratched is the Manager with the sun glasses in this film just like her hat showing power and both Newman and Nicholson don't like authority heads. I feel that they are both really just rebellious unlike what they are made out to be which are a whack job and a very bad criminal that have really done minimal damages apart from the under age sex ordeal with Nicholson. With the scene with the eating of the eggs the scene with the voting to watch the game is when they really are both accepted and both scenes are equal bringing all of the characters together.The main scene that stood out to me was the escape scenes as you really wanted him to get away and for the film to end for his safety. But my favourite scene was the egg scene. He ate 50 of them, I liked the scene as it was when he was accepted into the group, it also had some humour not only eating 50 eggs he was bloated with an over-sized stomach, this also made me feel sick just the thought of an eggs makes me feel sick, I literally start gagging, yuck. I think the ending was very when he was shot, although was killed but also escaped from the enclosure but not the way he wanted to. With his smirk on his face maybe also realising.There are stars and then there are actors like Paul Newman who is iconic for this role and many others like Butch Cassidy. The cocky motion of Cool Hand Luke may wobble from time to time but Newman's magnetic personality lends the film some weight. I love that is shot in widescreen. The story is quite straightforward with a anti-authoritarian story to a macho tall tale and winds up ultimately as somewhat of a curious and incomplete Christ tale. Luke represents man's journey from Genesis to Jesus' death. He was living in a perfect world, or eden, where everything was free and such, but Luke decides to leave by doing a very stupid act in retrospect. When Dragline questions Luke about this, Luke replies, 'Well you can't stay in Eden for too long.' Luke doesn't feel too bad about being sent to camp until he realises that it is unlivable once his mother dies; the only way out? to escape, but in the bible, the way for individuals to escape the restrained world was for Jesus to die, just like Luke. Also, Luke is able to motivate a great number of people to finish tarring the road quite easily. Dragline represents Judas, turning Luke in. But all the same stay very engaging. The film is filled with quotable lines such as 'What we've got here is a failure to communicate.' and memorable scenes. It is light in meaning but is full of cultural significance. A great deal of Cool Hand Lukes greatness is the supporting roles from Dennis Hopper and George Kennedy as Newmans Rival turned right hand man. But Luke doesn't clarify his motives, he seems as if he was put there for a challenge, inviting a conflict with the system to see if he can win. It isn't till the conclusion that the rebellion seems to be more free-spirited. The thing that makes one certain character quite dominant is the use of the sun glasses by the manager hiding his eyes; eyes are the doors to the soul.Unlike the other prisoners Luke rejects the prison conformity's that come with the enclosure and his unco-operative stand leads to tradegy. If Cool hand Luke is about how far one man can push the system, it's also about what happens when the system pushes back.

In fact, the first few minutes established all that coupled with a very edgy score, but Grindhouse this is not, instead, it has all the trappings of a solid drama, and deals with very mature adult themes and of family.This is a very different New Zealand that someone from the outside will take to. Gone are the picturesque postcard scenes, and in are the gritty, grimy neighbourhoods where families at the poverty line struggle to make a living. The story, based upon a novel by Alan Duff, centers on the Heke family, who are of Maori descent. And things are rosy at home as Mom Beth (Rena Owen) has 5 kids to take care of, in which Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) is going to be sentenced in juvenile court, and eldest Nig (Julian Arahanga) seeking a home away from home with gangs. The only and possibly sensible one is with Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), who assists her mom in shepherding her youngest siblings from the explosive behavior of father Jake (Temuera Morrison) who has a penchant for violence when he has too much to drink.Sounds like a typical family melodrama all set up, and it is, except that this was delivered with such realism that you'll cringe at the sight of unflinching violence. It's hard to sit through it, leaving you seething with rage as the victims find it difficult to leave and make changes to their lives. Once Were Warriors chronicles this struggle, and your emotions go on a roller coaster as you root for various characters to break out of their zone of discomfort, and to challenge the norms in order to stand up for themselves. The first time Jake rages in the movie undoubtedly sets the tone for the rest of the story, because slivers of hope get evaporated by the time you see how the make up artists work on Beth to bring to you the sheer madness.The character of Jake is peculiarly intriguing, as for someone who got laid off and without a job, he's satisfied to just be on welfare, and what more, to spend those money on drink and gambling, though drawing the line on women. After hours late night parties at his home with his pals also seem the norm to sooth his ego as being the all round nice guy. And when things don't go his way, the only way he knows how to deal with it, is by his fists, where he takes pride in dispatching trouble makers in bars, unknowing that he too is trouble for his own family. Quite a tragic character really, for his clueless behaviour in not knowing how to take care of his family properly, being constantly disengaged from his wife and children, which naturally awaited for some tragedy to happen. On the other hand, one can only imagine the amount of abuse that wife Beth can put up with, if not only for the sake of the children.It's interesting to see where the leads have gone off to after this 1994 movie. Temuera Morrison looked familiar, and a quick check on IMDb showed that he had portrayed Jango Fett and Commander Cody in the fairly recent Star Wars prequels. In fact, co-lead Rena Owen too had starred in the prequels as well. Director Lee Tamahori doesn't lag behind too, having helmed the James Bond installment Die Another Day, and xXx2.Once Were Warriors had a sequel as well called What Becomes of The Broken Hearted? which was also made into a movie, though was less well received.

This early movie already moves in that direction. If Hitchcock ever believed in an objective moral order, which I believe he did, it's a very complex one, especially when the human element is involved.Brief synopsis of plot-- Alice lives with her father and mother in their tobacco shop. She has a cop boyfriend, but one night she jilts him to take up with a handsome artist who inveigles her into his room where he tries to rape her. She stabs him in the process, but is overcome with guilt afterward. Later, she's accosted by a blackmailer who knows she's the killer. Her cop boyfriend knows too, but protects her from the blackmailer who is killed in a police chase. The ending is a surprising one.As the story develops, a number of interesting conflicts emerge. There's the one centering on Alice, between her guilt over having violated both civil law and moral law, on one hand, and her sense that it was in self-defense, on the other. Still, the situation becomes more ambiguous when considering that she did trick her boyfriend and did take up with the artist whom she also enticed with coy behavior. How blameless is she. Then there's the cop boyfriend who shirks his duty by protecting her from both the blackmailer and the police. He loves her as presumably she does him (or is she merely being an opportunist). But how much blame can true love excuse. Now, Hitchcock being the master manipulator, gets us to side with Alice and her cop boyfriend even though we know they've broken a number of laws. Thus, we're invited to think about this reaction and how it fits in with conventional morality and respect for law. Then there's the question of what would have been an appropriate ending given the factors involved.The movie itself generally holds interest throughout, though the first part highlighting impersonal police procedure appears not to fit with the personalized remainder. But maybe that's the point. The cops (and the law) are shown to be unfeeling and ill-equipped to deal with the sort of subtleties raised in the movie's remainder. Less explicable is the overextended business with the blackmailer and the cigar, which appears rather pointless. But then maybe I'm missing something. The dramatic high point is the exciting chase through the monolithic British Museum. Already Hitchcock shows a fascination with national landmarks as climactic backdrops, used here to grand effect. And surely the great stone face staring blindly from a wall as the blackmailer flees down a hanging rope survives is one of the most arresting images of any Hitchcock film. The acting strikes me at times as an unfortunate hold-over from the silent era with its exaggerated movements and facial expressions, particularly Donald Cathrop as the blackmailer. His relentless mugging almost comes across as a caricature.

This early movie already moves in that direction. If Hitchcock ever believed in an objective moral order, which I believe he did, it's a very complex one, especially when the human element is involved.Brief synopsis of plot-- Alice lives with her father and mother in their tobacco shop. She has a cop boyfriend, but one night she jilts him to take up with a handsome artist who inveigles her into his room where he tries to rape her. She stabs him in the process, but is overcome with guilt afterward. Later, she's accosted by a blackmailer who knows she's the killer. Her cop boyfriend knows too, but protects her from the blackmailer who is killed in a police chase. The ending is a surprising one.As the story develops, a number of interesting conflicts emerge. There's the one centering on Alice, between her guilt over having violated both civil law and moral law, on one hand, and her sense that it was in self-defense, on the other. Still, the situation becomes more ambiguous when considering that she did trick her boyfriend and did take up with the artist whom she also enticed with coy behavior. How blameless is she. Then there's the cop boyfriend who shirks his duty by protecting her from both the blackmailer and the police. He loves her as presumably she does him (or is she merely being an opportunist). But how much blame can true love excuse. Now, Hitchcock being the master manipulator, gets us to side with Alice and her cop boyfriend even though we know they've broken a number of laws. Thus, we're invited to think about this reaction and how it fits in with conventional morality and respect for law. Then there's the question of what would have been an appropriate ending given the factors involved.The movie itself generally holds interest throughout, though the first part highlighting impersonal police procedure appears not to fit with the personalized remainder. But maybe that's the point. The cops (and the law) are shown to be unfeeling and ill-equipped to deal with the sort of subtleties raised in the movie's remainder. Less explicable is the overextended business with the blackmailer and the cigar, which appears rather pointless. But then maybe I'm missing something. The dramatic high point is the exciting chase through the monolithic British Museum. Already Hitchcock shows a fascination with national landmarks as climactic backdrops, used here to grand effect. And surely the great stone face staring blindly from a wall as the blackmailer flees down a hanging rope survives is one of the most arresting images of any Hitchcock film. The acting strikes me at times as an unfortunate hold-over from the silent era with its exaggerated movements and facial expressions, particularly Donald Cathrop as the blackmailer. His relentless mugging almost comes across as a caricature.

It remains a deeply unsettling and unnerving experience despite a gentle, serene start to proceedings and when I first saw it a few years ago I was still moved and disturbed by the powerful final scenes.The story concerns one Sergeant Howie (played by Edward Woodward), a Scottish mainland officer, and devout Christian, who takes himself to the island of Summerisle after receiving a photograph and anonymous letter explaining that a local girl named Rowan Morrison has been missing for the better part of a year. When he arrives he finds unco-operative locals, a number of clues to the whereabouts of Rowan (but is she dead or alive?) and some decidedly un-Christian behaviour as people openly enjoy their sexuality and appease their own particular gods as they try to help boost the island's harvest of apples. All of this activity is overseen and governed by Lord Summerisle (played by Christopher Lee, in one of the best roles of his career).While staying on the island, Sergeant Howie takes a room at the local tavern and finds even more to be displeased with as he raises his eyebrows at the behaviour of the patrons and has to put up with sleeping next door to the very beautiful landlord's daughter, Willow (played by Britt Ekland). One strong scene in particular features Willow's Song juxtaposed with Sergeant Howie in the next room, fighting his repressed urges and longing with all his might, and this hits home the difference between the happy, outgoing heathens and the tightly wound lone Christian in their midst.To say too much more would ruin a damn fine movie experience because this film deserves to remain just that for anyone yet to view it. The sergeant remains determined to find the missing girl but at what cost will his answers come? Watch and find out. And get ready for one of the greatest endings ever put on screen.I believe that someone once said the worst thing religion can do is get organised and this really sums up what The Wicker Man gets at with it's overall storyline and it's individual, barbed scenes of thinly-veiled blasphemy and\/or madness. Taken individually, the faiths of people are their own business and help them to live better lives but when collected into a large enough group they can become . . . . something else, perhaps even, yes, something dangerous. So it's no surprise that this movie has caused many debates over the years. I know that it got me thinking with almost every other line, and who can't stop to admire such gems from the script as the reply given by Lord Summerisle when asked if he doesn't believe in Jesus Christ Himself the son of a virgin, impregnated, I believe, by a ghost.... It really highlights the pointlessness of ridiculing anyone else's beliefs if you are holding on to your own particular mythology. And this is even more important when everyone on opposing sides believes that THEY are in the right.Robin Hardy assured himself a place in British cinema history when he gave us this classic film but it must be said that he doesn't have to do too much. The acting is okay and there are some nicely shot scenes but it feels like all Hardy had to do was get some decent set design around the actors, stick to the fantastic script and point and shoot. Perhaps I am selling him short but The Wicker Man is a movie I could just as easily listen to for the exchanges and one-liners. Yes, the imagery excels, especially in the latter half of the film, but it would excel no matter who was filming it. It's also worth mentioning that while the Director's Cut fills in some gaps and is definitely the one to watch it's also dragged down slightly by the inclusion of even more unnecessary folk songs and can make the viewer yearn a bit more for some normality.I never tire of this movie and, hopefully, others feel the same way once they have met The Wicker Man. It is also helped by the fact that the islanders are already quite old-fashioned and not interested in keeping up with the times so that, rather than being badly dated, the film does indeed look it's age but feels much more like a period movie than anything that has already been left behind while everyone else moved on. It does have a few minor flaws (the extra folk tunes mentioned above along with a few actors not measuring up to the leads or even coming close) but the whole is so much more than the pieces that it still gets a 10\/10 from me.See this if you like The Exorcist, Cowboys Of Christ (novel), Shock Corridor.

If you have one of those kids who does not like older movies because of the lack of fancy computerized special effects, then simply let them know they have no idea what they are missing. I miss the days where they used real actors, with real explosions, and real danger, just more realism. I look at movies today and see great special effects, great editing, wonderful music, but barely a heart. It is movies like Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark that make me wish I was teenager when my mom was, because her times have seen more great movies then I will ever dream of. I can only pray that my kids, and my grandkids will look back at this and love it as much if not more than my mom, and I do.

My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent type-casting, and while he does a good job in his role (as does just about everyone involved), the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.Comparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable, and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English, but it doesn't lose credibility the way K-19 does, probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent, while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson, well, Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.Nevertheless, as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K-19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war, which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return, and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine, and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull, but it bounces off unbroken. We're cursed, one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.There is an immediate rivalry between Polenin, who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission, and Vostrikov, who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.One of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension, even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air, but there wasn't a war going on. This is why there is not a lot of concern shown when an American destroyer is sighted near the submarine, because one of the goals of the mission is for the Americans to see what they're doing.Instead, a small leak aboard the nuclear sub becomes a problem big enough to potentially start a war. Incidentally, one of the crewmen noticed something wrong with one of the dials at least twice before the leak was discovered (once before the ship left port). Had he reported that problem when he first noticed it, he could have saved the lives of everyone who died because of the radiation and prevented the entire thing. At any rate, once the leak is discovered, the options are to abandon ship and surrender the crucial technology to the Americans (a single concession which could dramatically alter the futures of the two nations, and thus rendering it unacceptable), try to repair the reactor without sufficient protection against the radiation, or scuttle the ship (also unacceptable because of the boat's importance).There is a tense scene where Vostikov orders the ship to dive to almost crush depth, one of the obligatory scenes in submarine movies where the hull creaks and groans and everyone stares at the ceiling, like there's something to see there, and then he orders the ship to ascend at breakneck speed, surfacing through a layer of ice. Vostrikov intends to push the boat and the men to the limit so that they all know what the limit is, but unfortunately it culminates in a hugely disappointing display of digital effects as the ship breaks through the ice in something that looks more like it belongs in a cartoon than a serious film like this (I was reminded of the unfortunate Scrat's efforts to save an acorn from a splitting glacier in Ice Age).The film requires an extra bit of suspension of disbelief to accept a story about a Russian submarine but without any Russian actors. I'm curious to know how it was received in Russia. I imagine it was a hit, despite the lack of Russian presence in the film, because it illustrates their courage and dedication to their country in the most difficult of times. But nonetheless, it is hugely effective and never lets up once it gets going. The ending strikes me as the part where the most creative liberties were taken with the original true story, leaving you with the feeling of a Hollywood ending imposed on a true story from Russian and American history. But if nothing else, the movie is a fascinating look at how close we came to widespread destruction during one of the most tense times in modern history.

So what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are bad ideas aplenty, along with a few good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'The Final Frontier' the same way you would a so-so episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best 'guest star' performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen, ranking right up there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too frequently. Charles Cooper is good too as the fat old Klingon General Korrd; too bad his role isn't as large as he is. If the story about Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology, because I was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet. The reason is I've always felt that, of all the Trek regulars, Shatner was the least 'tuned-in' to everything that makes Star Trek work and what makes it special to its fans. Having read his Trek memoirs, it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting. He preferred the vision of Gene Coon over that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular western series, 'The Wild Wild West.' Shatner also mentioned that a favorite Star Trek episode of his was 'A Piece of the Action,' a silly second-season episode co-written by Coon. So, finally given an opportunity to direct a Star Trek feature film, would not Shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? Well somebody did, because that's what 'The Final Frontier' ended up being. Shatner himself definitely returns to form as The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'the cutes.' In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue. Running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the Enterprise have run all the way from 'Wrath of Khan' and by this, the fifth Trek movie, have run themselves into the ground. So has the idea of a 'skeleton crew'. One new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two. It's a pointless subplot and adds nothing. The climactic scene where 'God' is encountered doesn't add much either; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (The 'God' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) Roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'The Search for Spock.' Leonard Nimoy manages to salvage Spock's integrity, even while spouting such un-Spock-like lines as Get a grip on yourself, Doctor. And DeForest Kelley, as usual, outperforms both Shatner and Nimoy; he really came on as an actor in the final Trek films. So this Trek outing isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. There was to be one more original cast Trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation,' and it was far better suited to the task than 'Star Trek V The Final Frontier.'

The opening sequence has a man diced into cubes as he attempts to cross a room. I thought this part was very cool. Unfortunately, that was easily the sweetest thing in the movie. The only other death caused by the rooms was a spurt of acid that miraculously landed right on the guys face. Sadly, the sweetness of the room effects was overshadowed by the atrocious acting and even more pathetic dialogue. Perhaps the saddest part of the movie was its attempt to incorporate mathematics. This could've been one of the best parts of the film if they'd decided to have even a single mathematician proofread the script. Using the words 'prime' 'factor' and 'cartesian' doesn't make it mathematically profound or philosophical, or correct. Nor does mentioning Descartes' name.

Connie Doyle is thrown out by her boyfriend when she becomes pregnant, and she ends up on a train with the Winterbournes, a wealthy young couple on their way to Boston. The train derails, and both Winterbournes are killed. However, as Connie was trying on Mrs. Winterbourne's ring at the time of the accident, she is mistaken for her, and her baby for the Winterbourne grandchild. What follows is what always happens in romantic comedies, Connie is taken in by the Winterbourne family and falls in love with the dead Winterbourne's twin brother, who is initially suspicious of her, but then grows to love her. Complications arise, but everything works out in the end.Shirley MacLaine is quite winning at Grace Winterbourne, and Miguel Sandoval steals most of his scenes. The problem is that neither Ricki Lake or Brendan Fraser have much chemistry with each other, and Ricki Lake seems miscast in general.

I feel like I'm inside, inhabiting the characters when I watch Fearless. The defining event the movie revolves around--a plane crash--seems inspired by an actual plane crash (I think it was in Sioux City) in which the plane rolled over in a corn field several times. Aside from the horrific manner in which it crashed, the accident was noteworthy because so many passengers survived, in some cases literally walking away.I read that Peter Weir got involved in this project by asking the studio to let him see any properties that they felt could not be made into a movie (this would seem to fit the bill). After seeing the movie I was moved to read the book, but I believe the film is better. No matter how many times I watch it, the result of this material in Peter Weir's hands never loses its power for me.The post-crash impact on Max's relationship with his wife&#151;and the formation of relationships with other survivors--is an important aspect of the movie The survivors bond through this shared experience, while their families feel shut out and don't (or won't) understand the power this connection has for their loved ones. This plot element is the only bit that seems off to me, as if it's both too much and too little to effectively advance the film (perhaps due to editing\/time constraints?) Jeff Bridges is always worth watching, though his acting is so subtle and natural that I always forget I'm watching him, and that he's acting. But Rosie Perez's performance is a real standout; she should have won the Oscar she was nominated for. While I identified with her role as a mother of a small child (my own son was the same age as Bubbles when I first saw the film), her performance itself seemed fearless, as if she stripped her soul and emotions naked in this role.

Previously having made his mark as a director of deep and often psychological dramas, Lean's easy transition into bigger pictures reflects the change that was taking place in the genre itself, moving from the grandiose spectacle of De Mille et al, towards the intimate epic of the late 50s and early 60s.We are also here seeing the development of the war, or rather, the anti-war picture. Prior to this most anti-war or anti-military pictures were small-scale dramas, whereas all the big war films were rousing flag wavers. Bridge on the River Kwai ticks both boxes, and is all the more effective for it. It is an anti-war film which prevents itself from becoming static or preachy, and an action film with a humanist edge.The problem presented to David Lean, aside from the fact that he had never done anything on this scale before, is that Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman's multi-layered screenplay contains many different strands, with stories told from multiple points of view. Lean fortunately had dealt with such fragmentary narratives before &#x96; 1952's The Sound Barrier for example &#x96; and here he actually uses the trappings of the epic to keep the narrative focused. This was the first time he had used the cinemascope aspect ratio, but rather than employing it purely to show off the stunning landscapes (although he does do a fair bit of that too, and why not?) he also uses the width of the screen to cram varying elements into the frame. For example, in the scene where Nicholson (Alec Guinness) surveys the railway construction with his fellow officers, the figure of Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) can be seen on a hill in the background. This reminds us of his presence, and subtly keeps his story arc going.Lean's use of colour is also remarkable. Of course, when your film is set in a PoW camp in the middle of a jungle, you have a fairly limited colour palette anyway, but Lean's crafty choice of camera angle and positioning is calculated to show off different tones at different times. In the opening moments, highly reminiscent of The African Queen (which, like Kwai, was produced by Sam Spiegel) he begins with the greens of the jungle &#x96; a fairly cold colour. As we descend through the trees, Lean gradually turns up the heat with those dusty yellows and browns. For the middle section of the film, he cools things off again with more lush greens and even some vibrant shades, before returning to the stark hot tones for the tense finale. Again, this is all very subtle director's work, but these touches do create little shifts in mood and influence the way we view each scene.Lean's handling of the larger canvas was however not yet quite up to best showing off his actors upon it. That's a shame with such a good cast, although Alec Guinness in one of his earliest non-comedic roles shone through enough to garner an Oscar. William Holden was also deserving of at least a nomination, but didn't get one. To my mind though the best performance of the picture was that of Sessue Hayakawa. Hayakawa was an incredibly powerful silent film actor &#x96; check him out in De Mille's The Cheat (1915) &#x96; and it's great to see him at the top of his game again here.Bombarded with awards, Bridge on the River Kwai is typical Oscar-winning fare, particularly for the conflicted political climate of the 1950s. It can be read as a damning critique of war, but also enjoyed as a gripping action film. This broad appeal, the depth of the screenplay and Lean's assured direction made it a hit in its day and allowed its popularity to endure in the generations since.

Arnold Schwarzenegger may be the only man ever to be crucified twice. The first time was in CONAN THE BARBARIAN. He lived, now he goes through this ordeal once more in END OF DAYS, Schwarzenegger's first film after a two year absence. Starring in the millennium-end movie of 1999 is perhaps the great place for Arny to restart up his action movie career, left behind by his roles in comedies like JUNIOR and TWINS. Like other of Arny's one man army B-actioners, END OF DAYS has a helicopter chase, fist-with-fist fights, gun-play and a massive dosage of explosions. But it also includes stuff you've never seen before in Arny's films (or in any film put together). We have Arnold getting his ass kicked by an old woman, a crucifixion, his emotional side(!), and his fight in what seems to be the only foe Arnold has never fought before, The Devil himself.Of course, all this is very silly (Ayee! his emotional side!), but that's just one of the shameless guilty pleasures of this Apocalyptic thriller spearheaded with DIE HARD. The plot concerns Satan's return to Earth, seeking a bride to be the mother of the Antichrist to bring about the title event, something that the film's pseudo-religious mysticism says that he does every hundred years or so. Crazy ain't it not, but that's just one of the few pseudo-religious myths this film introduces (666 as 999, with a 1?). But accepting it exactly as what it is may help. It's a dark, and often very silly, thriller, which doesn't mean it ain't fun. Both action-packed and potentially silly, summing it up into one cheesy yet crazily fun night at the movies. It isn't in the tongue-in-cheek comedy form like Kevin Smith's DOGMA, which takes these religion hokum for jokes, END OF DAYS doesn't take the audiences will not take it seriously, and it does know how to make fun of itself.Arny plays a Chicago ex-cop Jericho Cane (take a look at those initials!), who's still in guilt of the loss of his wife and daughter, wishing that his new job, preventing assassinations, would do finish him off. If you don't buy an alcoholic New Yorker as the sole savior, then you'd better stop right here. This is not the movie for you. But Arny does get his chance at saving the world, as he is thrust to protect the 21-year old Christine York (Robin Tunney), the next broad chosen to be Satan's mistress. Satan here, first appears as a translucent floating, uh, thing which later takes the bodily form of a Wall Street Banker (Gabriel Byrne). At this time, I was asking myself why a wall street banker? Then again, why not? Kevin Pollack, Rod Steiger and Miriam Margolyes offer supporting performances.END OF DAYS is not brilliant, original or the least bit intellectual in any way. The plot gets into a derivative approach, taking a little of THE OMEN here, a bit of THE EXORCIST there, with a few dashes of ROSEMARY'S BABY and DIE HARD thrown in. Of the acting, Byrne isn't the only good actor in the film, but still the only one that doesn't give the impression of sleepwalking his role of the Devil. Director Peter Hyams, also serving as cinematographer, shakes and moves the camera off and on focus. Sometimes it's stylish, often its dizzy. Rookie screenwriter Andrew W. Marlowe, who penned what may just be the best action film in long time, AIR FORCE ONE, plays with his pen and paper this time around, making what is one crazy hybrid of religion and pure Schwarzenegger-ed action fare. Silliness come at an abundance. This not the place to forage any brain food, but as is any movie of the summer. Judging as a brainless summer fodder, END OF DAYS is decent summer affair, camp and class in a package. It's fun once you know it doesn't take itself seriously.

The plot concerns Satan's return to Earth, seeking a bride to be the mother of the Antichrist to bring about the title event, something that the film's pseudo-religious mysticism says that he does every hundred years or so.

Maybe, but not, I think, by amateur film enthusiasts or any but a few professional critics, and only then if they can tame their professional enthusiasms, can write well and know when to stop. That leaves out, among us amateurs, nearly all of us. As for the professionals, I've read only two or three commentaries by professional film critics that I think do justice to Raise the Red Lantern. Partly, this is due to the utterly foreign, cloistered culture we're observing. Partly, it's due to the intense but withheld emotions and motivations we gradually become aware of. Mainly, I think, it's due to the fact that deep sadness simply can't be adequately described, and the more we try, the less we convey. Songlian (Gong Li), a 19-year-old student in 1920 China, must leave college when her father dies. Her stepmother arranges for her to marry a rich man as a fourth wife. From then, Songlian's life, everything, depends on the attention she will receive from this man we scarcely see. The first mistress is middle-aged, serene and cool. The second is attractive and appears sympathetic and friendly. The third is young, beautiful and intensely jealous that Songlian may replace her as the most favored by Master Chen. Each has a maid. The servants reflect the attitudes of those they serve, but above all else, they reflect their roles in the Master's house. Again and again we return to an overhead shot that shows us where the universe begins and ends for Songlian...a stone courtyard with stone buildings on either side and the entrance at the end of the courtyard leading up low stairs to where Songlian now will live. When the Master intends to visit one of the wives for the night, it is the custom that the servants ceremoniously raise red lanterns outside the apartment of the favored wife. And this is all that their lives...and now, Songlian's life...consists of. There is no outside world, only their duty to serve the Master and to follow the customs of the Chen family, which goes back generations. If the red lantern is raised frequently outside Songlian's doorway, a servant tells her, she will soon be running the establishment. The other wives know this. Songlian is educated, sullen and resentful. She may realize that she must establish herself in the favor of the Master and find her place in the world of the wives, but we realize she may not have the guile needed. The intensity of establishing and maintaining place means resentments and betrayals. There can be no friendships. Songlian does not play this game well. Songlian's life eventually becomes as desolate as the cold snow that drifts down into the courtyard. Raise the Red Lantern is a gorgeous movie, as are most of Yimou Zhang's films. The seasons change from spring to summer to fall and to winter. We keep returning to Songlian and to the view of the courtyard, but we also see out over what seems the endless tile roofs of the Master's mansion. High on the roof is a small stone shed that is kept locked and which, it is whispered, had something to do with a former wife. At first the stone exteriors seem small and the interiors seem to go on and on. We see Songlian dressed lavishly to await the Master's visits. We see ornate furniture, wall scrolls, braziers against the chill and the red lanterns. We seldom see tears. Raise the Red Lantern is no tragedy, but it is a kind of slow-playing, hopeless melodrama. It is a reserved world where for these four women and their servants, everything depends on the Master. For Songlian, everything depends on her willingness to bend completely to this life from which she cannot leave, and to accept that there can be no relief from the need to scheme and plot to maintain a position against the other wives. To befriend can lead to betrayal. To sympathize can lead to rejection. To let slip a secret can lead to death. The customs of the ancient Chen family must be honored and followed, and can be cruel. To serve the Master whenever he wishes, with skill and charm, and to bear him a son, is what life has become, and there is no escape. The Master's life goes on. Our last view of Songlian is in the courtyard, in winter, wandering. Anyone who reads this should shake their head and wonder what all the fuss is about. Get the movie and watch it, then you try to describe it. You'll feel inadequate.
