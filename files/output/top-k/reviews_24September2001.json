So naturally, I was quite excited when I got the chance to see the sequel when it premiered on Cinemax in 90 or 91. Although I was satisfied with Bride of Re-Animator when I initially viewed, I some how managed to avoid seeing it again for the next decade. I am not quite sure why that is, especially considering I have been enjoying the original on dvd for quite some time now. Looking back I think it's because I had the realization that, as I have grown older and my tastes have matured, things that were great when I was kid are often terrible these days, rendering films that were merely oky even worse. In other words, I was afraid of watching Bride and just hating, thereby tarnishing the legacy created by the still fabulous original. To get to the point, I recently decided to take a chance and I broke down and bought Bride on dvd. Going into it with my expectations totally lowered (since I couldn't remember much from watching it 10 years prior), I was pleasantly surprised by this worthy sequel to one of my all time favorite horror flicks. Sure, Bride still somewhat pales by comparison, but it would be safe to say that it compares to the original the same way that the competent Halloween 2 stands up to it's classic predecessor. In other words, this isn't a great flick, but much of the magic that made the original work is still here, and the film has a few surprises of it's own. I won't go into the plot because everybody else on here has already explained it, and besides, I find the plot to be one of the areas where Bride is most lacking. I will instead try to concentrate on the things I like about this film, namely, some snappy (and extremely DRY) one-liners, hilariously over-the-top gore effects and another great turn by Jeffrey Combs as the titular re-animator. Bride relies on the mix of outrageous horror and dark comedy that defined the original, this time leaning just a little more towards the comedy side without becoming a parody of the first one. With stronger direction and more a more fleshed-out screenplay, I believe this one could have had the potential to be as good as the original-but who wants to see classic overshadowed? Bride of Re-Animator stands well on it's own and as a nice afterthought to the original it should please most fans. I also highly recommend the feature-loaded dvd release, and although some would argue this film  gets a slightly grander dvd treatment than it deserves, who can really complain about a plethora of special features?

There is a great story behind this movie but it does not develop well. It jumps around so viewers are left hanging. Emily Harris' performance was not as awe inspiring as some believe. I saw Jacqueline du Pre perform several times and I knew her. I have a number of recordings made by her. Emily Harris is not my choice to play her and there was no resemblance between Jackie and Emily Harris.For one thing she did a poor job faking as cellist. Obviously she did not understand the fingering of a cello or the bow work. One would have thought that for an actor whose main role was that of a cellist would have spent more time learning just the fundamentals so that she could do a realistic fake.Perhaps a better director would never have shown an inept actress playing the cello. Better yet, show close ups of hands (a real cellist) and the bow work but never show Ms. Harris herself playing the cello.The film was unreal in that it really compressed the time period that Jackie du Pre was ill because she suffered at least 12 years from the disease. Personally the movie would have been better off not showing the more agonizing scenes of her illness. It was enough just to show that she had it and how it affected her career rather than deal with the morbid scenes.But if one knew nothing about Jackie du Pre, the movie is worthwhile watching for no other reason than the viewer learns about Jackie who was a marvelous person as well as a cellist. Too bad Harris does a bad job of portraying her.

For the first 100 minutes we are delivered an intriguing and complex story to which there seems no easy answer. When the final piece of the puzzle seems to be in place the entire film is turned on its head.

The truth is that the more you try to make sense of it, the more confusing it becomes. It's probably best not to try to look for any concrete answers and just accept that we fell for the filmmaker's tricks.

I think that people love the idea of a story when you're not sure who you can really trust, along with the realisation that the film's most shady characters are the filmmakers themselves.Aside from the twist the film is also unique in the way the narrative is presented. The majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks by crippled con artist Verbal Kint (a performance which deservedly won Kevin Spacey his first Oscar). The film's other Oscar went to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed 'The Way of the Gun' (2000)) for his brilliantly constructed screenplay.

So I see every movie that comes out, what's so wrong with that?  Everyone needs a hobby ... right?  Okay well the point that I am trying to make is that I've seen so many movies that I really thought I was desensitized to movie scariness.  I thought nothing could scare me anymore.  I was wrong.  Jeepers Creepers actually had me closing my eyes in scenes.  I haven't done that since I was six years old! Jeepers Creepers starts out innocently enough.  Darry (Justin Long) and his sister Trish (Gina Philips) are driving home from college for spring break. They are terrorized on the road by a big, nasty old truck it eventually passes them by and they continue the trek home.  They later see the same truck parked outside an old church and its driver dumping what appear to be bloody bodies down a pipe in the yard.  They of course have to investigate and the real scariness begins.  Now I'm not going to give away anymore than that because I don't want to ruin any of the scares for you.  Up to this point I was counting and timing the scares.  'There was the fake scare... now here comes the real one in 3...2...1, right on schedule, next please', It was all pretty routine.  It wasn't long though until I realized that I wa s actually a little scared.  It all snowballed from there.  Before I knew it I was actually looking away from the screen, considering going for a refill on my drink and asking myself if I really liked being scared by a movie after all, why didn't I pick a harmless little comedy to see?  The thing was that it wasn't like most movies where the scares pop up every now and then, it had this pervading sense of dread.  I was tense and even afraid for a good 45 minutes.  Things got a little less scary towards the end but still...it was almost a relief. Now don't get me wrong this is obviously not an academy award winning movie, but it was very effective.  The acting is solid, the dialogue descent and the effects pull things off.  What I really liked about Jeepers Creepers was that it did what it set out to do, scare the pants off me.  I also have to give kudos to the script for not falling completely into horror movie routine and sticking to it's guns on some rarely seen plot points.  You'll know them when you see them.  It was also nice to see the leads as a brother sister team, you don't see that so much, it kept the story from falling into the tired and useless sexual tension or flat out sex scenes.  I'm going to go off on a tangent here for just a second so bear with me.  What is it with moviemakers thinking that every movie needs to have a sex scene.  Does every human activity really lead to sex?  'We are being chased by a man \/ monster who wants nothing more than to kill us, lets stop off at this motel for a quick s**g and then be on our way'.  Honestly, it's useless.  Okay sorry about that, back to Jeepers Creepers, which had no sex if you were wondering.  So to wrap things up, if you want to be scared, go see this movie, it'll be worth your money.  I'll never be able to hear the song Jeepers Creepers again (not that I heard it much before this movie but you get the idea) without a little chill running up my spine.

Why this film was forgotten by critics in a matter of weeks you've got me!  Why this film didn't win the Oscar for best cinematography I give up!  But what I do know is that after seeing `Snow Falling on Cedars' for the first time last night, I couldn't have expected it to be so intensely sweeping.  I knew it was made by Scott Hicks, the acclaimed director of `Shine.' I knew it was shot by Robert Richardson, the A-class DP who shoots most of Oliver Stone's films.  I knew that it was adapted from a best selling novel that won praise all over the world, but for some reason I had never been driven to see it.  The film is on so many levels a masterpiece. \t        One of the things that I liked most about the film was the backdrop in which it was set a small little fishing community in Washington State, set during the time period of post WWII.  This backdrop was what aided the lust cinematography and remarkable set designs.  The viewer was able to establish a clear picture of what it must have been like to live in a small little west coast marine town full of Japanese inhabitants during a racially clouded time period.  The sequence which best fulfills this, is when all of the Japanese families are taken to concentration camps.  One of the moments which tore into me was when the officers came to Hatsue's house and took all of their Japanese influenced belongings and arrested her father.  As the officers are leaving the house, one of them stops on the porch and takes down a Japanese chime.  It is truly disheartening to see their culture disappear in the blink of an eye.  The scene played out beautifully, and it most importantly summed up the Japanese position in America at that time.  One could easily make an entire film on the subject of not how the Japanese treated us during Pearl Harbor, but instead on how we treated them in our own country.           Near flawless, and full of some of the richest and purist images to have ever been put on film, Scott Hicks has crafted simply one of the best-looking films ever made.  Virtually every shot in the picture is filmed with precision and style, yet never dulling the viewers attention, not even for a moment.  I had never realized how good an eye Scott Hicks has had before.  I personally hope that his collaboration with Richardson will remain constant for years to come.  The first fifteen minutes of the film is an example of the amazing beauty which the two achieve together through the lens of the camera, as are the flashback sequences with Ethan Hawke and his lover Youki Kudoh as children.\tOne of the things that didn't work for me was Ethan Hawke's character.  For the first hour of the film, his character kind of hovers above the storyline as it unravels and the plot begins to thicken.  He only has about ten lines throughout the first act, and I consider this to be the film's main flaw.  Ishmael's character is supposed to be one of the central drives of the film, and it is he who is in love with the defendants wife and he who should be who the audience sympathizes with.  However the audience simply doesn't know anything about him for them to care.  His past is hardly mentioned, except for the scenes between him and Hatsue.  We don't know exactly where he stands in his field is he a good newspaperman or a lousy one.  Pretty much all we know about his character, is that he has to live in the shadow of his father, and he is madly in love with a woman who doesn't love him back.  Also the supporting players do a good job especially that of James Rebhorn and Rick Yune.  I recommend this film to others and especially people who like good movies.

There are so many things wrong with this movie, and it would take up far too much space to list them all, but I'll list a few.1)Batgirl's origin. What the heck were they doing by making her Alfred's niece? Surely the movie makers knew that this would just annoy the hell out of every Batfan out there. I also think casting Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl was a big mistake too. She was fine in Clueless but terrible here. Maybe that's because of the bad script but even so...I think they should've got an unknown to play her.2)Too many villains. We had the Joker on his own in the first flick (which was great and worked really, really well), Catwoman and Penguin in the second (okay), and Riddler and Two Face for the third (again, okay). However in this one you get not one, not two, but THREE villains. Poison Ivy, Mr Freeze and Bane. Too many. The teaming up of Freeze and Ivy didn't work, at least not for me.3)Too much neon. It seems the director of this movie is obessed with the stuff. It was bad enough in Batman Forever but was even worse here. Horrible.4)The script. Almost every single line in the movie was lously. In the charity ball scene, Batman (under the influence of magic 'love dust') is bidding on Poison Ivy, trying to win a date with her. Batman whipping out a credit card (with the Batman logo on it, I might add) from his belt and saying Never leave the cave without it was too much. Batman using one liners may have worked in the sixties series but it didn't in the movie. Also every line that Mr Freeze said was dumb. Freeze in Hell, Batman has got to be one of the worst, silliest lines I have ever heard in ANY film. Urgh.I could go on and on forever about how bad this movie is and how much I hate it but I won't.

Robert Shaw makes a very eerie henchman. He looks surpirsingly like Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, and his final train battle one of Cinema's greatest is an absolute knockout. My personal favourite is Pedro Armandariz as Kerim Bay.

Action and Acting, help to make this a more Bondian movie than Doctor No. But the script in places leaves alot to be desired. It is far better to watch an exciting Bond movie than a Dramatic one. Luckily for Bond fans, fun was just around the corner.............................................. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"24 September 2001","score":"","review":"   From Russia With Love is an improvement on Dr No, in the fact that more fun is had with this movie, and the feel of it is more Bondian than the predescessor. But am i alone in finding it awfully Dull in places?True, the action scenes are fantastic.  There is the boat chase, with Sean Connery looking a little like Tony Curtis doing Cary Grant in Some Like it Hot. then there is Bond being chased by an helicopter looking strangely like Grant himself in North By North West. The gadgets are up to scratch,with the cashier case being one of the finest Bond Gadgets of all time especially  since it was the first but not because of. The case emits deadly talcum powder, bullets and stun gas and a dagger that proves very usefull to Bond later on in the film. As for Q, well the least said about Desmonde Lywellyn's debut the better, because he represents more a Carry On straight man than the good old Q we know.The cast is up to the mark. Sean Connery is hitting his stride as Bond. His performance in FRWL is perhaps the best of his tenure, he is more the Flemming Playboy this time around than the cold Blooded Killer of Dr No. He carries the film again. Robert Shaw makes a very eerie henchman. He looks surpirsingly like Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, and his final train battle one of Cinema's greatest is an absolute knockout.
