[{"date":"4 February 2005","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" The story takes place in Berlin. Manni, one of the two main characters of the movie is in dire straits. Indeed, he works for a dealer and has forgotten a substantial amount of money in the subway (100 000 marks!). If he hasn't given this amount to his boss before midday, he is dead. So you can imagine his state. But his girlfriend, Lola is well decided not to give him up and to get him out of this tight spot. And fortunately, she has an idea to find 100 000 marks. But she must be quick. She has only 20 minutes in front of her to get the money and to save her man.Someone who didn't see Lola rennt (1998) and reads the basic topic might think that he deals with a movie with a hackneyed subject. However, if he is told that the treatment is drastically different, then we may incite him to watch this movie and he probably won't regret it. Indeed, following the starting point, the movie puts forward 3 solutions to solve Manni's trouble. Either, Lola's father refuses to lend her money, either Lola holds up the bank, either, she can't get through to her father. So, this will give birth to 3 different stories which will lead to 3 different conclusions. Inside these stories, a detail, a little moment is sufficient to change Lola's running in the street and it can also modify the course of things. For example, when Lola leaves her flat, there's a young man with a dog in the corridor. Will he trip Lola up? Will she hesitate a moment because of the dog? Will she jump over it? If she chooses one of these three solutions, it can lead to dramatic consequences for others characters (her father's colleague in the car).By adopting a clip side à la MTV in the making, by using all the possibilities offered by a camera (succession of pictures filmed in a fast way or scenes in slow motion), by including wild extracts of animation film, through precise camera angles à la David Fincher and with a sharp sense of detail, the director Tom Tykwer makes us really share her heroin's state of stress and the fact of knowing that to save her boyfriend is a matter of life and death strikes right at the heart. Lola's uneasiness is heightened by the fact that every time she meets someone in the street, odd sometimes spooky thoughts come thick and fast. Rarely has a director has so well combined anxiety and excitation to the spectator. We allow ourselves to be led astray by Lola's unrestrained running with frenzy while bearing in mind, the fear of time which inexorably passes. It is also relevant to note down that Tykwer's camera nearly never stands still and finds moments of break between the three stories when Lola and Manni are lying side by side.Franka Potente with her loud red hair (which I interpret as a symbol of hope mingled with fear) in the wind, wearing a tank top spends most of her time to run in the film, hounded by the camera which continually follows her everywhere she goes, either it is a little street, an avenue or a building site but she also capable of emotion (when her father refuses to give her financial help, she starts to cry). Let's just regret heavy effects (when she screams, she can break glass.A movie with such a treatment was to be destined to make a beautiful career abroad. Lola had run with enormous success on numerous German screens, she had to run on plenty others foreign screens a bit all over the world to satisfy a lot of viewers.The clip side of the whole, the sustained use of the techno music will probably fail to please certain film enthusiasts but will surely perceive Lola rennt as a lively and a really great exercise of style. An exciting experience which is worth the trip and after the projection, Lola keeps on running in the mind of the ecstatic spectator.

In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. You're darn tootin', they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW. It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he? Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it ought to be really cold tomorrow. Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a blank white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are. (A perfect day!) There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.Fargo is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD.

The Baron falls hopelessly in love with Grusinskaya, but is unable to follow her to Vienna. Lionel Barrymore plays Otto Kringelein, a dying man who has come to the hotel as a final treat for himself.

He led his viewers see that a deviant behavior CAN be a product of society's injustice. Loss of response to death and killing other people can be a survival mode of a deeply hidden broken heart.

It was also disheartening on others. Allen, a fairly prolific clarinetist, travels the major cities in Europe with his band, a tour that is an extension of their regular Monday night gigs at Michael's, a jazz club in New York. Presumably, this is his first tour, and Woody is his regular angsty self, fretting over whether people are there for the music or to see him. While the musicians really stand up in terms of quality, Allen included, it is pretty clear that the majority of the concert attendees are there for Allen the Icon, whose films are immensely more popular overseas than they are here.The film is not outstanding in terms of production, but more importantly, the camera acts as a fly on the wall perspective on someone who is not particularly comfortable in the public eye. His amazement at the scores of people who attend his concerts, wait for him at the concert hall and outside his hotel is almost comical, and the paparazzi are insatiable, particularly since the film was made a short time after the whole Mia-Woody-Soon-Yi scandal. The scene I found most intriguing of all actually occurs during the last ten minutes of the film, and that is when he returns home after the tour and goes to visit his parents with Soon-Yi and his sister, who accompanied him on the tour. The fact that his parents still feel that he would have been better off as a pharmacist, and that his acting thing isn't all that great, yet get defensive when he seems to take sole credit for his creativity was very interesting.When the Woody Allen scandal broke during the 1990's, I was one of his most ardent supporters, an opinion that was extremely popular, regardless of any reasoning. Throughout it all, I couldn't help but wonder what he saw in this woman, but I never questioned his morals in choosing her to be his companion. I just assumed that, being as intelligent as he is, she must be his intellectual and spiritual match. Unfortunately, that image was shattered for me with this film, because she came across not only as completely vapid, but ignorant and not personable at all. She was obviously acting for the camera, and really ended up being a hindrance to the film, in my opinion.As a documentary, however, Kopple provides us with a good piece of film-making, though it is certainly a niche piece; only fans of Allen or those curious about him will make it through the film, much less appreciate it. 6\/10 --Shelly ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2005","score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Wild Man Blues, Barbara Kopple's 1997 documentary about Woody Allen's tour of Europe with his New Orleans jazz band is both rare and interesting on some levels.

Betty Field, Daisy Buchanan in the original Great Gatsby, gives a masterful performance without uttering a word that may reveal what she's actually feeling, until the end of course.

During dates, men have to go witness these bantering, young (and a lot of the time anorexic) woman who cheer for whatever the hell there are cheering for in the movie. Even some of the time, some men have the free time to view these enigmatic acts voluntarily as they explore the unknown attitudes and motives of these women who are classed as girly. Girl Power however has become a thing of the past and is dyeing fast seeing that the Spice Girls revolution ended years ago.Still to this day, we see these movies being made and headed by the teenyboppers who have taken many MINUTES of attention away from Hollywood (i.e. Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan). However, when it comes to chick flicks, there can be substantial surprises.Well substantial is a bit of an overstatement however Legally Blonde was a slightly pleasant surprise. When my sister picked up a copy of Legally Blonde, I wasn't that interested. Typical Chick Flick. I said to myself. However when the film ended, it actually was pretty good.Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a sorority queen from Beverly Hills. She is the typical dumb blonde, I mean if there were any example of a girl of this category, Elle Woods would be it (and Reese Witherspoon nailed the performance). She has everything, friends, make-up, and all that girly crap. However when her perfect boyfriend (Matthew Davis) dumps her after she originally thought he'd purpose to her, she falls apart. The news spreads so fast in her girl club it's not even funny. The thing that is sad is this kind of thing is true in real life as there truly is some kind of girl system that spreads vital and shocking info within minutes. *Shudder* *Shudder*.So her ex-boyfriend moves to Boston to continue his family legacy of law as he's accepted to go to Harvard and become a lawyer. As a desperate attempt to win his heart back, Elle takes the qualifying exams to get accepted as a lawyer and drops her dreams of becoming a fashion specialist. When she gets accepted, she moves to Boston and sticks out like a sore thumb as she dresses for school like a fashion model. However, her attention attracts friends and she learns the law ropes. When a case of an exercise expert is accused of killing her husband, Elle's professor and his best students get to use this real life case as a final test. The students include Elle, her ex-boyfriend Warner, and Vivian Kensington (Selma Blair). Luke Wilson plays the older law student named Emmett Richmond who helps the class and starts becoming good friends with Elle. Finally, Jennifer Coolidge plays Paulette Bonafonté, a beauty shop employee who becomes fast friends with Elle when she needs her weekly dose of nail polish and whatever.The thing about Legally Blonde is that it isn't a stereotypical film as it avoids most of those elements. It has some solid comedy and good performances, especially from Luke Wilson's charm brought. One of the film's last scenes shows the cleverness Elle learned as her fashion skills pay off with her newly acquired law skills.Overall, Legally Blonde isn't just a stereotyped chick flick, as many would assume. It's also a good comedy for men too as it combines a good law film with a film for many women to enjoy. The film lacks and drags but it is pleasantly surprising with its appeal to men as well. It's not even guilty pleasure material; it's just surprisingly watchable.

She seems to exude so much emotion one minute, then so much raunchy humor the other. I just loved the fact that the concert\/performance was introduced the way it was. And her hairdo has never quite been the same again, has it? Though myself, ultimate 80s girl-fashion victim went to the altar of sacrifice in that respect, too - just because on top of everything she did so damned well, she just looked so gorgeous.Perfect intro to her many talents!

The complex plots and the CGI are just 2 great reasons to stay tuned to them. One of the latest and greatest sci-fi films to come along is I, Robot. With its intriguing plot and its amazing CGI, there's no way you can't love this film. However back in 2002, Clockstoppers came along. Unfortunately, Clockstoppers is a severely missed opportunity for a great sci-fi film. The creators had to keep it appropriate for a PG rating in the U.S so the kids would get a loving sci-fi film that they could actually enjoy. They had to tone down the possibly great plot and turned down all content away from making any movie good. It's too bad really.Zack Gibbs (Jesse Bradford) is a busy high school kid as he desperately sells everything he can find for a quick buck. The guy is saving his money for a car. While looking in the basement where his father (Robin Thomas) works, he finds a cool wristwatch. However his father is a top-secret scientist who works for an evil corporation. Back to his daily routine, him and his best friend, Meeker (Garikayi Mutambirwa), are at the paintball shop where he works and they meet a new Spanish girl named Francesca (Paula Garcés; yeah I know a lot of no-names). Zack hits on her and volunteers to go to her house to do chores so he can get to know her better. During the chores, Zack accidentally toggles his watch and it freezes all of time as everything and everybody have come to a stop. Zack has discovered how to use the device as the special time is called Hypertime. But when Zack realizes he wasn't supposed to take the watch from his dad, agents fro the corporation come after him. Now him, Francesca, and Meeker have to escape the evil bad guys.French Stewart probably is one of the main reasons to look forward to this film. He's a great comedian and he does a nice job on-screen as Earl Dopler, a scientist who works for the same corporation as Dr. Gibbs. The head of the evil corporation is Henry Gates (Michael Biehn; GATES! Microsoft should sue!) as he hardly is a good villain.The opening sequence is probably one of the best scenes in the movie.

You could do so many things not demonstrated in a PG film. Instead, the film shows what could happen if this were in the hands of a desperate teenager. This is particularly noted in one scene when they pull minor pranks on the town. Oh, big man now! If French Stewart would have had more screen time, he could have made the film more enjoyable and he'd seem more in place if this were PG-13. All the characters talk as if they don't know English. The action violence is revolved around a lot of biking or running and the running concept only worked for Minority Report. Honestly put, Clockstoppers is a major miss for the sci-fi genre.Overall, Clockstoppers is a good family sci-fi film. If you pause and take 10 minutes to realize that this film is PG, you might enjoy it more. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film but it was lacking from my particular audience.

I was born 1980 and could never relate to the feelings that surrounded this film (screaming Attica and the references to Vietnam) except for the universal feel of greed and desperation.Al Pacino played a perfect bank robber and over-the-top salesman to the detectives who started to surround the bank that he was taking over with his partner in crime, Sal. From the first move, everything about their operations goes haywire. First, their wingman flees, saying he can't go through with it and crying. Just great. Then the tellers sound the silent alarm, and everything after wards is almost comical at what an amateur bank robber he is. Sal is basically the silent type and hardly has anything to add to anything during the heist. The rest of movie follows this formula, including a wife that gets on Pacino's back, a crazy talkative mother, and cons who keep trying to throw Pacino's character off the subject to getting a plane for him and his hostages (and Sal) to go to Algeria. (Why Algeria?) The story was great and the screenplay was even better. The grainy look of the 70's film showed through, but it works because it's based on a story back in 1972.

From the first move, everything about their operations goes haywire. First, their wingman flees, saying he can't go through with it and crying. Just great.

Sal is basically the silent type and hardly has anything to add to anything during the heist.

At least Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne know how to have a good time while the ship is sinking.A young empress rules over a magic land. She looks for a wand that will help her rule the red dragons, this in turn would let her bring justice and equality to all lands. But an evil man is also looking for the scepter to use it to enforce his own tyrannical rule. Two thieves join forces with the empress and the hunt is on.Well, the above summary was taken in part from a summary here on IMDb and on the back of the DVD jewel case. Why? Well because the movie makes no sense whatsoever, so had i to look what the movie was SUPPOSED to be about! This is a jumbled mess if ever i have seen one. Everything is just so unbelievably bad here. The acting is laughable (even the otherwise talented Thora Birch manages to take a plunge), the special effects are pathetic, the story is a mess, the directing is abominable... I stated above that there are only two redeeming features here. And they are Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne. I like Jeremy Irons, at his best he is an excellent actor. And say what you will, but he always TRIES to lift even crap like this to decent levels. All his effort was for naught though, but still he tried and that is worth something. Bruce Payne on the other hand is his usual over-acting self, and offers the only laughs available.This movie clocks in at 107 minutes, but it feels like five hours. This is a crap-marathon that offers virtually nothing in the way of entertainment. How this movie could be made is beyond me. And i actually remember some HYPE about it before it came out. If there is any justice in the world though, that hype went right down the drain along with the directors career. This is truly a 1\/10.

I had never seen this classic film before. Gloria Swanson made the most of this comeback role by delivering a great performance as silent film legend Norma Desmond. Creepy and self-delusional, Norma has basically imprisoned herself and her manservant Max in a run-down Hollywood mansion. Life at the mansion is disturbed when young script writer Joe Gillis (played by the always excellent William Holden) uses the garage as a hideout running away from his car's repo men.Events begin to unfold which leave Joe questioning his own morality and standards. I won't get any further into the plot details just in case there are any other people out there like myself who haven't seen this film.A few interesting details I have learned about this movie which might interest some folks out there. Both Mae West and Mary Pickford were offered the Norma Desmond role before Gloria Swanson. Mae West didn't get it because she wanted to rewrite much of Norma's dialog. That was not acceptable to director Billy Wilder, who didn't allow any deviation from the script. Mary Pickford always retained ownership rights to her silent films. That wasn't going to happen with Sunset Boulevard so Pickford was out. Montgomery Clift was first offered the pivotal role of writer Joe Gillis and actually accepted the part. Thinking about the role while on vacation in Europe Clift came to the conclusion that the kept man  aspect of Joe Gillis' relationship with Norma Desmond too closely mirrored his real life relationship with a wealthy New York socialite. Clift turned the role down upon his return to America.Hollywood had very mixed reactions to this film. Famous MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer stormed out after an early screening of Sunset Boulevard and engaged Billy Wilder in a very profane tirade accusing Wilder of stabbing the film industry in the back. Wilder gave as good as he got to the red-faced Mayer. If you haven't seen Sunset Boulevard do yourself a favor and check out this classic. It will stick with you for a while.

The writer cleverly mixes the rare attachment of two individuals, a sailor's son turned boat-maker and a beautiful, sensitive artist an attachment of the boat-maker that that does not diminish after the death of the artist. Such strong feelings have been the core of great cinema in the past (Truffaut's Story of Adele H, Polanski's adaptation of Hardy's Tess, etc.). The film may pale in comparison to Truffaut and Polanski, yet the subject matter, the performances (Newman, Penn, Kostner, and Coltraine), and photography make it noteworthy.Mexico-born director Luis Mandoki loves to film stories with strong attractions and unusual bonding (Angel Eyes is an example) and attract the viewer to the cinematic work by providing all-round positive connotations to the material. If you examine the film closely all characters are positive and uplifting--the varied personalities in the newspaper office, a supportive father (a well-defined father-son relationship), a strong bonding among the family of the dead artist that gradually transforms from the negative to the positive, a male child who accepts a strange new father figure without a whimper...The only negative characters shown almost as a cameo is the journalist's ex-husband who cheated on her. Mandoki seems to make a habit of picking up uplifting, candy-floss subjects. Is he playing safe or is it a Catholic upbringing (reference to Angel Eyes) at work? As a director's decision, the storm sequence filmed entirely with music and no words raised the film above the usual films.Mandoki as a director has potential to make great works but is evidently not a director who works to get his details right. He has filmed at locations that do not resemble the Carolinas. Yet Mandoki has a rare ability he always picks top-notch cinematographers (Oscar nominated Caleb Deschanel here and late Piotr Sobocinsky in Angel Eyes). Most viewers would love the picture-postcard locations captured in the film. But I was captivated by the indoor camera-work playing intelligently with light and shadows reminding one of works like Godfather II. For some quaint reason Mandoki's films seem to attract Razzie awards for bad acting (Jennifer Lopez in Angel Eyes and Kevin Kostner in this one). In both cases, I feel Mandoki did extract fabulous performances from other actors (Jim Caviezel in Angel Eyes and Paul Newman in this one). Perhaps the bad performances have something to do with whether an actor controls the production rather than Mandoki abilities as the director.On the whole, the film will be remembered not merely as a great love story well told but for Paul Newman's fine performance and the intelligent indoor photography.

Pristine without being precious, intelligently beautiful without being french, funny, funny, funny, bitter, provoking and sad. You can mix all of that and quite simply call it Ashby. What a delight! Elizabeth Bergner was suppose to play the part, marvelously written by Colin Higgins. Hal Ashby flew to London for a meeting with her, she didn't quite get it, she said aloud she couldn't work with a director who looked like Jesus Christ. Well sorry for her, but lucky for Ruth Gordon and lucky for us. As I saw the film after Rosemary's Baby I was kind of worried for Bud Cort for a little while. Ruth Gordon made her name as Dolly Levy in Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker got an Oscar for Rosemary's Baby, wrote Adam's Rib with husband Garson Kanin. She was a woman for the ages and Harold and Maude is her present, her own tribute to an extraordinary life. I've shown the film to kids, 10, 12 years old and they fall in love with her. Bud Cort is the perfect foil for her designs.

However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s. After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name\/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.And lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.

His eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) immediately signs up to go to war, however, he is later captured by Colonal William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), a British soldier notorious for his brutal tactics and sentenced to hang. When Benjamin's second eldest son, Thomas (Gregory Smith) goes to help his brother, he is shot down and killed by Tavington in cold blood.Taking his younger children to live with their aunt (Joely Richardson), Benjamin sets out to avenge his sons death.The Patriot is a very entertaining movie and unlike most war movies, doesn't last for about four hours. It runs just over two hours. Mel Gibson as always, is very watchable as he is blessed with a lot of screen presence and electricity on screen. Jason Isaacs captures Tavington's cold heart perfectly and is enjoyable to watch. However, the scene stealer is the young actress who plays Benjamin's youngest daughter Susan, Skye McCole Bartusiak. Just eight years old at the time of filming, she has delivered a performance that could put to shame some of the greats. The depth and emotion she brings to her character is unbelievable and their is one scene involving her that will have you crying your eyes out.If you're an American, you will particularly enjoy it as it is very patriotic (as the title may suggest), but even so, it is a very enjoyable movie.
