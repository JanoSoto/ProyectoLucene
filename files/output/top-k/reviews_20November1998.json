I agree that it's overhyped and did not deserve either Best Picture or Best Actress. The love story was cliched and lame. Dicaprio's acting has seen better days (check out Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape for a true picture of his talents) though this wasn't really his fault, but Cameron's rather badly written script. And the script? Well--what can I say? It's really an action picture, after all. Some important details leading to the sinking were glossed over or totally ignored, such as the wireless operator's role in the tragedy, the Californian ignoring pleas for help, etc. However, the movie  is already quite long and in order to fit the love story in and develop the characters enough for us to care, much needed to be left on the cutting-room floor. Personally I don't have a problem with this. Documentaries and more historically realistic films about the Titanic have already been made. This is meant to be a Hollywood *movie*, not a documentary or even good art. Cameron never leads us to believe that he's trying to make it anything more than it is, and for what it is, Cameron's Titanic is an excellent movie. The only real problems I had was the under-development of certain characters, namely Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews. Both these characters were far more interesting in their small roles than the two leads, and it's too bad Cameron chose not to expand their roles even if it meant a *four-hour* movie. I would have gladly sat the extra hour. The other problem is the two leads. As I already said, Dicaprio may have been miscast, but his character was so inherently uninteresting and perfect that I doubt *anyone* could have done a better job. He did look weird next to the voluptuous Winslet, however. Someone with a bit more meat on their bones, perhaps, who looked slightly older? I don't know... As for Winslet, well, she's a good actress but Oscar material? Hmmmm. She seemed just a tad too, um, cheap and klutzy to pull off the role of a first-class young woman with any believability. A more refined and ethereal actress such as Claire Danes would have been a better choice. Also, these characters's speech seemed too modern for 1912...but I could be wrong here. As for the SFX, absolutely stunning and totally believable. I really felt what it must feel like to be on a sinking ship. The sequence with the band playing on as people either race about panicking or calmly succumb to their fate is extremely moving and made me cry more than anything Winslet or Dicaprio did. This, and the scene where the camera pulls back to show us thousands of people thrashing about in the freezing water (chilling in more ways than one!) are perhaps the best in the movie. Horner's soundtrack is moving and perfect, though I could have done without the dumb and overplayed Celine Dion song during the closing credits. Best of 1997? Maybe not, but definitely up there with my favorites.

Ever since I was ten (and since the show began back in 1991), I have always loved the show. And let me tell you, Klasy-Cuspo did not let me down. A fun, up-beat movie that kids and growned-ups will enjoy from start to finish. I attended a 705pm showing of the film, the majority of the sold-out crowd were mainly tykes. Due to the fact that I'm 17-years old, it really set me down that I didn't see any other people close to my age other than Adults. At least I'm a kid at heart, and I can see whatever I please.The story picks off where The Family Tree left us. It begins with a sharp-looking Indiana Jones spoof, putting our main man Tommy Pickles in his shoes ready to snatch a prized possesion. Funny how imagination goes with these kids, as the huge rolling ball that chases them happens to be a very Pregnant Didi-Tommy's mom.Shortly after, Didi gives birth to Dil Pickles, which becomes a total bane to all the main Rugrats-Even Phil and Lil. Dil seems to be somewhat a very fussy little babe. During most of the film, Dil loves to take batting practice on Tommy's head (hitting), be it from a rattle or a bottle.After some discussion from twins Phil and Lil, they decide to take Dil back to the hopsickle. They do attempt to return him via a new Stu Invention-The Reptar Wagon. However, they get lost along the way, ending up in a forest, scary with monkeys and more troubles. This ain't the playpen folks.And what does that little imp Angelica (My favorite Rugrat) has to do with all of this? Since Dil loves to grab items, yelling mine!, her doll Cynthia is grabbed from the hands of the feisty younging. Angelica goes out under Shirley-Lock Holmes-donning roller-blades and all in order to retain her dolly. However I was disappointed with what they did to her. Angelica does not get a lot of screen time compared to her other counterparts. And Unlike the T.V. show, Angelica is much less of a brat, but she is more like it in the early moments of the film.Of course, the adults in the film are just as entertaining as the Rugrats. The reporter Rex Pester is really a pest. And Grandpa, Stu and Drew bring it on.The animation is really on another level. Really cool use during the birth scene. They really made some scenes 3-D like in appearance. And to be real with you, it looks like the animators took a shot of speed, as most of the movie speeds on by. It's not slow like most Disney films. It really has a small amount of sugar-sweet moments. Also the songs aren't at all chessy for an animated film.This being the first G-rated movie I attended in a thearte in almost 8 years, I wonder how did Nick and K-C get away with some of the potty jokes. They must've been borderline on PG. There are a good amount of them in the movie, especially during the newborn song number in which involves a shower of peeing, creating a rainbow. Now that's something that Disney will NEVER touch. Dil also uses his fire hose as well. And Tommy's buttocks are exposed.The botton line kids, parents, those in between, and diehard Rugrats fans like me will love this film. Animation knacks may get a kick out of it also.But those that don't like cute cartoons and those older kids may wanna stay out of this. Of course it's up to you.Although the animation is NOT A Bug's Life level, it is 1,000 times better than the T.V. show. And it doesn't play like an episode either as many mislead souls have said before the movie even came out. The action is mostly non-stop. Certainly on a faster pace than any episode.

Yes, the plot was predictable, the characters one-dimensional, and the love story cheesy. No, the acting was not first-rate (though this was the fault of the script not the actors), but I have seen worse in other action movies (check out the god-awful Godzilla if you can stand it). Come on, people, this is an *action* movie! It's not *supposed* to be good art! It's a disaster movie that promises thrills and great SFX, and does more than delivers. The tornado sequences are believable, terrifying--and beautiful. If you want a great love story, see The English Patient. If you want a social commentary, see The Last Days of Disco. If you want well-developed characters, *don't* see an action picture! The main character, of course, is the tornado. The various plot devices are there as a backdrop. I think people are taking it all too seriously. Lighten up and just try to enjoy it. At least  Twister isn't gory or steeped in gratuitous violence, like Independence Day, a movie I totally despised. It's just a good adventure movie with above-average SFX.

Ray is just a man trying to survive and be left alone.  Though he finds that to be nearly impossible. An all too quick to develop romance develops and Ray has to figure out how to deal with finding a new love in the very brief time between his being bailed out and the beginning of his sentence.It is a fascinating story with excellent performances.  The major criticism I have with it is when it tries to stretch itself out to become a non-violence message to all black people instead of sticking with its strength which is the poetry, the romance, and the utter desperation felt by Ray.  It is in Ray's utter desperation that the film's manic energy is truly felt.

His life changes when a tragic event occurs right in front of him and he is caught with a packet of marijuana.

An exploration to a brand-new horizon of my mental-vision.Just like SAM in Brazil, he is desperately seeking and knowing JILL as if it was his only lifetime mission\/destiny.  He sacrifices his training, promotion, career, family, future and even his life in achieving Jill's trust for his amourous heart.  I think everyone should have some in-born dreams\/insight for life.  The only difference is those fortunate ones can realize them in time and trace for the right track.
