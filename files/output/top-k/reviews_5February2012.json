John Trent, Sam Neill, is an Insurance Investigator, who is assigned to investigate the disappearance of horror author Sutter Cane. He does some investigating of his own before taking on the assignment. He starts by reading most of Sutter Cane's novels. While reading them he thinks he knows where he might have gone. He rips up the front covers of each book and discover's it a puzzle of the state of New Hampshire and the star is Hobb's End. He goes back to Cane's publisher, Charlton Heston, and shows him and Linda Stilles this. It's a done deal, Trent takes along Linda and they are on there way to Hobb's End.Anlong their journey the both of them find and enter the strange town of Hobb's End. In Hobb's End people are turning into creatures and things are not what they seem. While there Trent discovers that Cane's disappearance was a publicity stunt; but according to Stilles he never reached his destination. This is were the movie can become confusing and where reality and fiction mix.While in Hobb's End, Trent thinks he is still apart of some stunt.

It is up to Trent to find out what is going on, discover the truth; and find Sutter Cane before Trent cracks up.The reason why I liked this film is because it has that Stephen King vibe in it. To me it's like a story within a story, plus it has that creep factor in it from the beginning to the ending. In The Mouth of Madness is no Halloween, it's not Carpenter's best; but it's far from being his worst. It deserves an 8\/10 stars, great story, but the movie is not for those under 13 due to the some violence. Kris L.

If it was based on just the Space portion, I would give it a perfect ten stars. The acting, lighting, tension, effects, and story are completely perfect in my eye. But it carries on its shoulders two OTHER films- one would be quite good on its own as a short, and one would be an artsy disaster. the first part, origin of humanity (ooh for short from now on), is obviously the former. The photography is nice,the costumes are fantastic even by today's very high ape-costume standards (lol wut), and the space ship landing is very beautiful. It actually manages to build very high amounts of anticipation of its monolith explanation. The worst part of this section is worrying that Kubrick could possibly handle the explanation badly. And then....he doesn't explain it. The space portion masterfully meanders its way by. Again no explanation. Then, we come upon the nonsense section. Initially its not so bad.

But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of Star Wars was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.Now, these films have been discussed to death, but I feel like I'd like to give my own two cents on the subject, and my thoughts could easily be summed up in five words Star Wars is absolutely amazing. Everything about it, from the acting, the effects, the story, the mythos, the music, the incredible intrigue that has keep this series alive for so long, it all started here, and it's great. I don't feel like I need to go too in-depth with a plot summary, because this is one of the most iconic films in history, but basically, Star Wars follows a simple farm boy living on a desert planet named Luke Skywalker, who yearns to fight with the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Before he knows it, he's thrust into an intergalactic adventure, along with an inventive cast of characters, as he tries to help rescue a princess and destroy the Empire's newest weapon a space station with the power to destroy planets, called the Death Star.As I said, this movie is awesome. The acting is fantastic all around, each one giving a perfect performance in these incredibly iconic, and unforgettable roles. The inventive special effects are some of the best of their time, and the action sequences are gripping and fantastic, never allowing a dull moment to come through. The story is incredibly fascinating, managing to blend science fiction through the space travel, droids, and aliens, with fantasy through the mystical Force, a defining trait of the Jedi Knights. The intrigue levels are really high here, and it's that intriguing quality that allows viewers to really get invested and really talk in depth about this movie.This film defined a generation. To this day, people still talk about it, and I doubt that it will ever stop being discussed.

CRASH was highly controversial when it was first released and many people thought it was a hilariously bad movie.

There are certain lines that are usually not crossed in movies and this one here crosses quite a few.

It is about a young and brilliant lawyer Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise) who is just graduated with honours out of Havard University and has many opportunities before him, so he takes the one that looks the best -- and that one was a mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot give too much away about the movie because if I do I would spoil it. I will try to examine the movie as well as possible without saying anything.Throughout the movie we know as much as Mitch knows, and no more. There are some things that are revealed to us but Mitch realises this already. We are told a couple of things just so that we understand, but I feel that it could have been done with out this knowledge being revealed. When we first enter the firm we see it as a friendly place where everybody is close and like a family, but when we begin to look deeper we notice that it is not all that it seems. The first hint is when they say that the Firm is like a family; though one would consider any firm saying that they are like a family.Mitch McDeere is the main character in the firm.

Mitch wants to be free when asked why he became a lawyer he tells us it is because when he was young, he watched the pizza shop that he worked for go under because the owner mucked up on his tax return.

Mitch is a very self-centred man; we learn that he has a mother whom he never sees and he only goes and sees his brother when he needs help. What does seem to change is that when he realises that he is trapped and it looks like he has lost anything, his brother seems to be the only body that he cares about. Yet it looks that he did care somewhat for his brother, but not until he had nowhere else to turn.

I wanted to but that awful Batman & Robin franchise which was ruined by Joel Schumacher was not my favorite anymore. Despite the certain changes and lame dialoge in it. But when i had a chance. I saw Batman Forever with my sister and it was awesome.Batman Forever is a completely different Batman film not because of the way it's made or designed. But because of the way there is no jokes involved and of course how good it really is. But the way Joel Schumacher did this movie is great. I give him praise and respect for being a great director. Plus the script as i would say would count at least for this film too.But most importantly we have both new villains here and one is The Riddler played by (Jim Carrey) and the other is Two-Face played by (Tommy Lee Jones) and next we have Batman played by (Val Kilmer) and of course Robin played by (Chris O' Donnell) Of course Val Kilmer is better then George Clooney was in Batman & Robin. And who could forget that actor anyways. Trying to be better then Val Kilmer. Well i have 2 words for George Clooney, He is not better, Nor does his performance entertain. It's horrible and because Val Kilmer is better then him I'm not gonna talk about George Clooney anymore or Batgirl for that matter.The Riddler and Two-Face are loose in Gotham City. Batman and his sidekick Robin must stop them before they escape. However The Riddler is obsessed with riddles and Two-Face must exact his revenge on the city. With their plans and challenges for the heroes Batman and Robin. Nothing is gonna stop them and they will make both heroes pay.This film's special effects are awesome, A lot of times we don't get to see what actually happens. But then there is something going on. And the CGI was awesome too like in the fight scenes which totally makes this film a great film in my case. So apparently nothing is missing from the effects so it's all good. Because i like it that way.Two-Face played by Tommy Lee Jones in this film is scary, Yet violent, In this film he deals with both justice and revenge against the boy wonder and in a way. Robin the boy wonder wants his revenge on Two-Face but yet confusing here is that Two-Face has henchmen at his side who wear the same red and black Two-Face masks. I don't get it. Does it simply mean that they were burned or did they really have to wear them. Also why do they use guns that look like lazers. I don't get this either, Is it like they could zap someone with them like Batman or the boy wonder Robin. Because that is some evil henchmen that Two-Face has got.Also The Riddler played by Jim Carrey is indeed among funny. He has starred in movies like Ace Ventura Pet Detective, The Truman Show, And many more of his films. He recently did a good job in Batman Returns because he would always give people riddles and questions about how evil he is and what he's thinking. So he is smart and he does want to get rid of Batman in order to become evil. But what will it take him and why. That's only up to someone to decide weather his plan will be put into action or not. But still it's amazing too.Also this film has funny scenes all throughout it. Like some where Batman is taking out the bad guys and also hurting the henchman is amazing and is something to laugh at.Also if you are a fan then get Batman Forever, A great film for the Budget! Yet this is the best Batman film out there from Joel Schumacher and better then Batman & Robin. A great storyline, Plot, And concept makes this the ultimate film to see of all time.

All I am going to say before I continue is that you should go and see it because it is brilliant. DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER BEFORE SEEING IT! I will be giving away so much of this movie, that by reading any further will seriously spoil it for you.The movie is about a guy who at first does not seem to have a name. It is not something we really notice, but it is important to note that we are never formally introduced to him. The name is purposefully kept hidden from us because of his basic nature. He suffers from insomnia and narcolepsy (sudden fits of sleep) and starts to go to support groups. There is the thing of seeing people who are more pathetic than you that gives you the strength to continue, and in fact he begins to feel good about himself. This happens until he finds another leech, a woman who is doing exactly the same thing as he is. As such he becomes stressed again, and the final thing occurs when his apartment explodes leaving him without all his possessions and a place to stay.So what he does is he calls Tyler Durden, a man whom he met on the plane, and asks if he can stay with him. Durden lives in an abandoned and rotting house where there is very little in the way of luxury. Beforehand, they have a fight, and end up fighting everyday and through this create a fight club where all those who are stressed and angry with society come to let off their steam. Soon Durden uses this to create a secret revolutionary army to overthrow the current order.We learn that Tyler Durden is the narrator, though it is the name of his alter ego. So then who is this guy that Durden keeps on seeing that claims to be him if he is him. Well, Durden is not only his alternate personality, but more so his dark side. What this movie has is two conflicts the conflict against the material world, and the conflict within Durden himself. Durden does not realise that he is speaking to his alternate self, and we do not even realise it (though there are clues, such as Marla Singer and Durden never being in the same room together), but there are numerous clues thrown throughout the movie to suggest that this is the case. When we look back through the movie we understand how this is so.On the other hand, the dark Durden is not all that bad. Okay, he does want to destroy the fabric of material society, but he does a lot to help the narrator out. In fact he drags him out of his endless material society and gives him something to focus on. We see at the beginning how he lusts over the new gadgets and stuff but as Durden works through him he slowly begins to shun the material world and the capitalist pursuit of more money and stuff. In the end, even though he objects to his dark side's plan to wipe out all credit companies, he passively watches the buildings explode.This is the second conflict in the movie, namely between the workers and the managers. The narrator himself is in a managerial position but really comes to shun this existence because his pursuit of wealth is really doing him no good. It is very interesting to see that how he accumulates all of this wealth, but no amount of money can help him sleep. In fact it is quite possibly the cause of his lack of sleep, and the dark side is just a reaction against the materialistic society that drove him to this point.The members of the fight club are interesting as they are comprised of the workers. The slave that must go to work as they are enslaved to the credit that gives them their luxuries. Along with them are those that are cut out of society because they look strange or are simply social outcasts. Now that I consider it, I guess the big problem with Durden is that he did not have any friends. Through out the first part of the movie, he had all of this stuff, but he did not have any friends. He goes to the support groups and they help him because there are people there that generally want to care.This now leads me to discuss the whole thing about relationships and materialism. It is not surprising that the narrator is frustrated and stressed, even though he has all of these goodies. The most important thing humans need is a relationship. We see this with the girl because she is crying out simply for somebody to notice her. Durden literally shoves her off, thinking her a freak yet knowing full well that she is actually quite like him. It is only at the end that he simply holds her.That is what we need as humans we need to be held. We are very relational beings and by shunning the relationship of others we literally deprive ourselves of what we need to most to survive. You see, we were created to have a relationship with God and the relationships we have with each other mimic that relationship we have with God. The relationship with God is the most important relationship we need because without it we are doomed. It should be so fundamental that it forms the core of our existence.

In regards to story and effects this movie has nothing new. The story is basically about saving the world and the effects are standard for a science fiction movie these days. Other than a comment on war, which ends with okay we fight but we also love, this movie does not raise any issues. In fact that comment is really stupid because its like saying, okay, I did kill somebody but that's okay because I helped an old lady cross the road. Stupid I reckon. What made this movie unique were numerous little oddities that set it apart from the standard Hollywood movie.The Fifth Element is a Hollywood movie, the line about war is a clear indication of the Americanism of it. The movie also uses American actors, such as Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman, but all of the production crew are French, especially Luc Besson, the director and writer of the movie. As such there seems to be lots of oddities that come across, though I would not label that as being strictly French considering Les Visiteurs is a purely French film, yet it appears to be something from Hollywood (not that it is a bad movie), thus I put down all of the oddities in the Fifth Element to Luc Besson's style, which is something I enjoy tremendously.The characters are very non-standard. Corbin Dallas (Bruce Willis) is probably the only stereotypical character in the movie, though he has his own little quirks as well. It is the minor characters that really stick in my mind. Luke Perry plays a young assistant to an Egyptologist who counts the number of times the Egyptologist cries out Aziz Light!. Characters' reactions to the famous personalities are very memorable. The timidness really stands out. It is not a slight stammering but a really noticeable unease. The radio announcer is really weird, being a lover caught in the middle of a violent gun battle and commentating on it, and Zorg (Gary Oldman) the bad guy (though he is not really because the Shadow is the bad guy, Zorg is just one of his agents), is an incredibly memorable bad guy just by his unique characteristics. It is also noticeable that the hero, Corbin Dallas, and Zorg never actually meet.The movie is also very colourful, and much imagination has gone into the uniforms.

Boy, was I so very wrong. Hoskins himself more than exceeded my expectations, but the real surprise was how powerful the film itself was. Like a lot of my favorite films, the premise is simple; George (Hoskins) is fresh out of prison and gets a job as a driver for Simone (Cathy Tyson), a high-class call girl. It's an easy setup for a crime thriller, when George inevitably takes a fancy to Simone and will do anything she asks, but it's what they do beyond that which takes the film to another level. As a crime thriller, it works brilliantly. I wish Neil Jordan would operate more in this genre, because with this and the phenomenal Crying Game, which came out six years later, he has proved twice over his massive capability for making crime thrillers that are unique and wickedly intense.As George is driven down this dark path into the new underworld, a place darker and more twisted than it was when he went away, Jordan paces everything with a slow burn that gets downright diabolical in it's final act. Michael Caine shows up as the sinister crime boss and he practically tears through the screen with his malice, along with a solid supporting turn by The Wire's Clarke Peters. There's an elevator scene near the end that just about made me sweat it was so intense and unexpected. Hoskins portrays George as an intimidating man with a rage inside of him, but when he's on screen with Caine he looks like a chubby boy being picked on at the playground.The relationship between George and Simone is built in a refreshingly honest way, played with genuine sincerity by Hoskins and Tyson, and all of this leads to a practically flawless crime thriller. However that's not where the film stops, as there is so much more going on beneath the surface. One could take it all at face value and still manage to be amazed, I know I sure would have been, but I found that the themes resonated far deeper than that. It's unspoken, but I feel that the change of the world is really displayed in focus here by Jordan and in particular by Hoskins' portrayal of George. He came out of prison expecting to get right back into the crime game, but the world has changed and grown far too menacing for someone as simple and good-natured as him. George has a mean streak to him and is capable of great violence when necessary, but at his heart he is a man who believes in the old ways.He went down for another man and when he comes out of prison he buys that man a rabbit to let him know that he's back. It's not done as a message of anything sinister, but as a kind gesture, to buy a fluffy rabbit with long floppy ears. Just take notice at how the tone of the film has shifted by the time the rabbit comes back at the end and we've come full circle, and you can feel how the weight of this theme pours through the picture. Another subtle way they display it all is through how George dresses himself. When he first gets money for a new wardrobe, he buys tacky and unsuitable clothing, making a fool of himself but he finds it hilarious. As he takes his job more seriously, he buys a finer wardrobe and the people that serve these wicked men take notice and respect him more as a result; they treat him as if he's anyone else. It's when George begins to revolt back against this changed world that he once again goes back to his more flamboyant clothing and embraces the good man that he always was.There's so much going on in Hoskins' performance that isn't laid out for the audience, but he makes it impossible not to see. That whole theme of coming out of prison to a much different and more frightening world is heartbreakingly portrayed through his expressions, he carries the whole thing almost on his own. The guy falling for a prostitute routine has been done dozens of times in cinema over the years, but there's an added weight to it here when Hoskins portrays the haunting loneliness of this character and how desperate he is just to have a companion. He's fresh out of prison in a world that doesn't want him anymore and all he wants is someone to treat him like he matters. This all comes through in the remarkably complex and detailed performance from Hoskins, which commands this rich film all the way through. As a crime thriller it's aces, but if you pay enough attention it is so much more.

The movie started off slowly and seemed to end in a whimper. The main characters came out on top, and the men that they were trying to manipulate were successfully manipulated. This is not an original movie as I had seen it all before in She-Devil. The only difference was that it dealt with three women instead of one.The basic premise is that four women graduated from college together full of idealism. Later in life their idealism is destroyed as their respective husbands walk out on them - and each of them handle it in a different way. One destroys herself with alcohol, another constantly complains and tries to hang onto her son, while another remains oblivious to the fact that anything is wrong. The forth one throws herself off of a building and it is this event that draws them all back together. They realise that they had given their respective husbands the best years of their life, and this has been discarded by them, so they decide to get back at their husbands and destroy them. Basically it becomes a similar plot to that of She-Devil.There is nothing that really stands out in this movie that I really wish to discuss. It looks at the frustration that women face in divorce, and though this may be a rare case, women can be just as vicious in divorce proceedings as can men. If we look at Liar Liar, we see a woman milking the man for all that she can get - while here the men have used the women and thrown them away. I agree that men can be bastards, but so can everybody.I guess the purpose of this movie was to try and bring us into the women's point of view - but the theme can be gender-neutral, with the exception that men (or men that I have known) will simply wallow in their misery, while women will carry on. Even then that statement is not entirely true as everybody reacts to a divorce situation differently. I was going to make a comment that it was based on a book written by a female, while the screenwriters and directors were male, meaning that the female psyche is not portrayed as well as say a film by Amy Heckerling. But this film does no such thing and is really a movie about people being thrown away and then climbing back up to the top.In conclusion, I will say that this is not an outstanding or impressive movie, and though entertaining after the first few minutes, it is nothing that I will really talk about that much.

The story is a flashback; a story related by Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) to Evelyn (Kathy Bates) who befriends Ninny in a local nursing home. So right off the top you can see that there's a pretty decent cast. Also almost from the start you realize that Ninny is a bit of an enigmatic character. Is she or is she not Idgie relating her own story? The movie seems to lead in that direction but never actually makes it explicit, so in the end it's left to the viewer to decide. Basically, this ends up as a murder mystery from the past. Ruth's abusive husband is murdered, and the question is who killed him. Idgie is put on trial for the crime, but the charges are dismissed. The mystery is held pretty well until the end of the movie.The movie begins with Idgie as a child, and with Ruth as her older brother Buddy's love interest. After Buddy's tragic death, Idgie and Ruth develop a very close friendship - the movie bobs and weaves around the issue of what the nature of their relationship was. Was it just a close friendship? Was it more? My feeling from the movie is that Idgie wanted more than a friendship; Ruth's interests were less clear. I haven't read the book, but I understand that the novel is quite clear in making the point that there was a lesbian romance between the two. Perhaps Hollywood in 1991 was still too nervous about such an issue to make it front and centre; ambiguity was as much as the studios could stomach apparently. We follow both of them through the ups and downs of life as they open a cafe together, whose menu specialty is - you guessed it - fried green tomatoes.Kathy Bates provided some comedy to the movie as the modern day housewife who goes through a rebirth after meeting Ninny - a rebirth that totally confuses her husband Ed (Gailard Sartain), who doesn't have a clue why Evelyn is changing so much and upsetting their comfortable existence. While she provided comedy, I wasn't really taken in by Bates' character in this. I thought the constant switching between present and past was overdone and not particularly well done to be honest; in a lot of ways the two parts of the stories didn't mesh that well. Aside from Bates, there were a lot of very likable characters from the past, such as Big George (Stan Shaw) and Smokey Lonesome (Timothy Scott.) The identity of Ruth's husband's killer in the end took me by surprise, so that was well done.My final reaction to this was that it was a basically well made and well acted movie, and at times even an interesting movie as the story unfolded - but that it also seemed like a movie that was anything but overpowering.

We follow both of them through the ups and downs of life as they open a cafe together, whose menu specialty is - you guessed it - fried green tomatoes.Kathy Bates provided some comedy to the movie as the modern day housewife who goes through a rebirth after meeting Ninny - a rebirth that totally confuses her husband Ed (Gailard Sartain), who doesn't have a clue why Evelyn is changing so much and upsetting their comfortable existence. While she provided comedy, I wasn't really taken in by Bates' character in this. I thought the constant switching between present and past was overdone and not particularly well done to be honest; in a lot of ways the two parts of the stories didn't mesh that well. Aside from Bates, there were a lot of very likable characters from the past, such as Big George (Stan Shaw) and Smokey Lonesome (Timothy Scott.) The identity of Ruth's husband's killer in the end took me by surprise, so that was well done.My final reaction to this was that it was a basically well made and well acted movie, and at times even an interesting movie as the story unfolded - but that it also seemed like a movie that was anything but overpowering. It didn't leave me awestruck.

The thing that sort of put me off the movie is that it was about the affair that Lancelot has with Guinevere, and that is something that I never really appreciated. I was expecting there to be a justified affair, which it is not, but this movie did turn out quite differently. In fact I ended up enjoying it.The first thing that I must say is that the cinematography and the sets were quite good. They created an impression of a real place of legend. The realm of Camelot came across as a legendary place which has been lost in the midsts of time. Unfortunately the screenwriters adapted the background of the story a lot - though the main push was that of the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur, and Guinevere.The changes were immense. In the original story (not that I have read it, but I am going by the movie Excalibur and the mini-series Merlin) Guinevere was a lady that Arthur met at a party and asked Merlin to set them up. In fact Merlin did not even appear in this film, but then it was not his film. Even so, Merlin is an important character as he is Arthur's adviser. In this film, Guinevere was a lady in a realm bordering hostile territory and she was going to marry Arthur for love and political protection. The enemy was Prince Malagant, who was once Arthur's First Knight. He rebelled and is now wanting to destroy Arthur.Malagant is a constant threat, but the thrust is the love between Lancelot and Guinevere. They first meet when Lancelot saves her from Malagant's thugs, and then leads her back to the road. His character is of a roaming knight who charms ladies and does good for no reason, except that he wants to protect the weak. This is because in his past he watched his family be slaughtered in a burning church, and he now seeks to prevent that from happening to others. After they rescue Guinevere's province a boy approaches Lancelot and asks if he can go home. This is a direct reflection of Lancelot's pain as he no longer has a home to go to.His greatest struggle is the love he has for Guinevere, and his service to Arthur. He never wanted to join Arthur because he knew that he would betray him, but Arthur insisted that he do it. He is never far away though because he knows that Malagant wants to force Arthur into an uncompromising situation. But Malagant is only a supporting character, the real struggles comes in the conversations between Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot.These occur where the characters struggle to understand their emotions and how they feel for each other. Arthur is not too sure, he has never married and is not interested in marriage, unless the right woman comes along, and he wants this woman to be Guinevere. Yet he is not sure, and while talking with her, he is trying to convince himself that this is the right choice to make. He is afraid of being hurt, and unfortunately this is what happens. He wants love and when he catches Lancelot and Guinevere kissing, he realises that this is not what he has. Guinevere says that she loves him, but he is not convinced, show me the look you gave him. It is all about love, and he wants the love in the heart, but not in the head.Yet Arthur is a very level headed man. Most men, especially in those days, would have removed Lancelot's head without a second thought. Instead, he arrests Lancelot and puts him on trial in front of the entire land. This is probably was not the best idea because he is bringing a personal matter and exposing it to the people. He is putting Lancelot and Guinevere to shame with such a thing - something that Lancelot does not want. Of course, the threat of Malagant is always present.

This film carried a strong cast, including Katharine Hepburn as Christina Drayton, Sidney Poitier as John Prentice, Katharine Houghton as Joey Drayton, and Spencer Tracy as Matt Drayton. This was the last film that Spencer Tracy made. Stanley Kramer served as director and producer along with George Glass, the screenplay was written by William Rose, and the film was edited by Robert C. Jones. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars, and won two for Best actress in a leading role, and for best written screenplay.The plot While on vacation in Hawaii Joey Drayton meets, and falls in love with John Prentice. John is an Africa American doctor who is at the top of his field. Joey Drayton is a white female whose liberal father (Tracy) owns a newspaper company in San Francisco. The couple fell for each other so quickly and strongly that they decide to get married. Following the engagement Joey brings John to her parent's house for dinner, and to deliver the news of the engagement. This is when the drama begins.This film's theme challenges the social taboo of interracial marriages. During production, it was illegal for people of different races to get married in fourteen states. While not as relevant today, it was a controversial issue in the 1960's. Joey has brought John home, and with each person she introduces him to, we see how people react to the engagement, some bad and some good. The film represents how some people are stuck in the past, how some people envision a better future, and how some people are flat out racist. The film takes a beautiful twist, when a love conquers all theme becomes present. It reminds us of when we first fell in love with our spouses, how we started out with nothing, faced adversity, stuck together through the hard times, and finished with a love that was just as strong as it was in the beginning.Father you see yourself as a colored man, and I see myself as a man, is one of the most powerful quotes from the film. John is confronted by his father on why he is marrying a white girl. His father believes in the ways of the past, that each race should stay within its own race. However John visions a better future. He knows that acting in the ways of the past will do no good towards the struggle for equality in the future.This film received a loose remake in 2005 with Guess Who. This film featured Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana. In this film the roles were switched, with Zoe Saldana an African American bringing home her white boyfriend Ashton Kutcher. With the racial theme not as relevant as it was in the 1960s, the film took a comical spin, and lost it's since of drama.I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The acting was superb.

It takes place during a very confusing time in United States History and it shows that life goes on as it is demonstrated at the end of this film. Life doesn't stop for anyone or anything, 'the show must go on' is one of the many themes that Nashville talks about and in a way Nashville is a brilliant movie in that it is one of the first films that uses the 'documentary style' filmmaking that Robert Altman has gotten very known for, with the overlapping of people talking, getting as authentic as possible with everyday life and conversations. When there are laughs, they are big laughs because they are so true to life such as the scene where the young son of Henry Gibson's character is pouring out his heart and soul, by singing the one and only song he's ever written, to a female reporter who kept persuading him to sing it to her, and so he finally does, it's a very touching moment, but being the ding-dong that she is, in the middle of him singing this song that means everything to him, the flaky reporter sees Elliot Gould and interrupts him and says That's Elliot Gould as she then leaves to go talk to Elliot Gould. Very funny situations like this(and they're funny because most of us can relate to them) and there are some of these situations throughout the whole movie, and in a way, I'm glad those kinds of situations aren't overdone in Nashville because as in life, they don't come around too incredibly often. And without this movie, we probably wouldn't have any of the Christopher Guest films that we have today, which I'm a huge Christopher Guest fan, so I'm thankful for Nashville in that sense as well. However, Nashville is a good film, but it's not a great film, there's no solid connection at any given point, and I always believe there has to be some kind of real connection and if there's not that solid connection, then the movie better be very significant in a historical or cinematic way, which one could argue that Nashville is very significant with what's going on, and how it deals with what's going on.And even though Nashville is a pioneering film in the 'documentary style' way, in my opinion, I don't think that pioneering aspect is of extremely great importance, not extreme significant importance like the films like The Best Years of Our Lives, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, just to name a few(Also The Best Years of Our Lives really deals with what's going on in the most significant way and in more ways than one, which Nashville doesn't do). Also, Nashville is a very long and a very boring film. It's almost 3 hours long and it drags a lot of the time throughout the film. The Razor's Edge with Bill Murray is a good movie in the same way of Nashville in that it has some great moments, some great comedic moments as well as some very great dramatic moments, just like Nashville. But, overall Nashville and Bill Murray's The Razor's Edge(even with those great moments) don't come together and connect in the way that you hoped they might have, to make them great films. Now I will say, and I can say this subjectively, I like country music, but I'm not a huge die-hard Country Music fan. Now for any die-hard country music fans, those types of viewers will probably love this film as there are a lot(a lot) of songs sung in this film(from there very beginning to there very end). There are a few of the songs that I really enjoyed, especially 'I'm Easy' that was written and sung in the film by Keith Carradine, a fantastic song, and one of the best scenes in the film for that matter, but other than that song and a few others, I would find myself getting to the point of 'how long is this song and when is it going to end for crying out loud?' Not a film for everyone, but perhaps worth a glance. Better Altman films in my opinion are M*A*S*H and The Player.

The Razor's Edge with Bill Murray is a good movie in the same way of Nashville in that it has some great moments, some great comedic moments as well as some very great dramatic moments, just like Nashville. But, overall Nashville and Bill Murray's The Razor's Edge(even with those great moments) don't come together and connect in the way that you hoped they might have, to make them great films. Now I will say, and I can say this subjectively, I like country music, but I'm not a huge die-hard Country Music fan. Now for any die-hard country music fans, those types of viewers will probably love this film as there are a lot(a lot) of songs sung in this film(from there very beginning to there very end). There are a few of the songs that I really enjoyed, especially 'I'm Easy' that was written and sung in the film by Keith Carradine, a fantastic song, and one of the best scenes in the film for that matter, but other than that song and a few others, I would find myself getting to the point of 'how long is this song and when is it going to end for crying out loud?' Not a film for everyone, but perhaps worth a glance. Better Altman films in my opinion are M*A*S*H and The Player.

It takes place during a very confusing time in United States History and it shows that life goes on as it is demonstrated at the end of this film. Life doesn't stop for anyone or anything, 'the show must go on' is one of the many themes that Nashville talks about and in a way Nashville is a brilliant movie in that it is one of the first films that uses the 'documentary style' filmmaking that Robert Altman has gotten very known for, with the overlapping of people talking, getting as authentic as possible with everyday life and conversations. When there are laughs, they are big laughs because they are so true to life such as the scene where the young son of Henry Gibson's character is pouring out his heart and soul, by singing the one and only song he's ever written, to a female reporter who kept persuading him to sing it to her, and so he finally does, it's a very touching moment, but being the ding-dong that she is, in the middle of him singing this song that means everything to him, the flaky reporter sees Elliot Gould and interrupts him and says That's Elliot Gould as she then leaves to go talk to Elliot Gould. Very funny situations like this(and they're funny because most of us can relate to them) and there are some of these situations throughout the whole movie, and in a way, I'm glad those kinds of situations aren't overdone in Nashville because as in life, they don't come around too incredibly often. And without this movie, we probably wouldn't have any of the Christopher Guest films that we have today, which I'm a huge Christopher Guest fan, so I'm thankful for Nashville in that sense as well. However, Nashville is a good film, but it's not a great film, there's no solid connection at any given point, and I always believe there has to be some kind of real connection and if there's not that solid connection, then the movie better be very significant in a historical or cinematic way, which one could argue that Nashville is very significant with what's going on, and how it deals with what's going on.And even though Nashville is a pioneering film in the 'documentary style' way, in my opinion, I don't think that pioneering aspect is of extremely great importance, not extreme significant importance like the films like The Best Years of Our Lives, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, just to name a few(Also The Best Years of Our Lives really deals with what's going on in the most significant way and in more ways than one, which Nashville doesn't do).

His good friend includes Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) an unknown pianist who lives in an apartment nearby. Adam introduces Jerry to Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary) a popular local crooner, who is to marry a 'vivacious, modern, enchanting, fascinating, exciting, sweet, shy and scholarly' dancer Lise ( Jerry does not know about this, however). Jerry puts his landscape paintings on display along the brick walls in the streets of Paris, and makes a paltry living out of it. His character is somewhat nasty, but many struggling street artists whom I have met are actually nasty with their take-it-or-leave attitude. He meets Milo (Nina Foch) a middle-aged rich woman who takes fancy to his paintings and agrees to buy two of his works. However, it can be observed here how Milo is actually trying to woo Jerry, as she tells Jerry that she does not have enough money and invites him to her hotel room. Madonna of the 50s, I say! Jerry does not respond well to her advances and starts flirting unabashedly with a young girl at the pub aka Lise. Jerry gets her number and almost prowls her to fall in love with him, which she eventually does. Conversely, Lise sets out more traps for Jerry. The rest is well&#x85;. obvious. The Oscar and Golden Globes Associations have infamously awarded lesser deserving films, actors, actresses, supporting actors, supporting actresses, documentaries, music, screenplay&#x85;. For example, Sandra Bullock's tough white compassionate mother act that paled even in comparison to a similar tough mom act by Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich. Or take the complete failure of recognition of 1952s 'Singin' in The Rain', a definitive musical masterpiece also starring Gene Kelly, and my personal choice for the greatest film of the 20th century. But to see 'An American in Paris' win Best Picture and Best Screenplay (!!!) is an unexpected and somewhat sour surprise. Why? Because An American in Paris is an incomplete film, lacking a thorough script, thin of memorable songs and dance sequences, short of convincing performances and devoid of a proper conclusion. How can this be rewarded the best script when the last twenty minutes did not receive enough momentum from the first ninety minutes, thus making the entire attempt somewhat flat?Gene Kelly's larger-than-life, showy persona proved an advantage in 'SITR' but here, where he has to downplay his character, it militates his likability. Also, his treatment of Jean Hagen's Lena Lamont in SITR was correct because of Lena's demanding diva personality. But to behave in the same way with Milo in AAIP made him a bit of a cad, especially when he drops her like a brick in the end without even considering her feelings for once, that too when he was acting in the same fashion albeit to woo Lise. He also has this slightly putting off habit of acting and moving in an affected way that is paradoxical to his role. Watch the first scene where he gets up fully aware that there is a camera in front of him, and then performs various movements in a rehearsed fashion. Works well at times, especially during the sing and dance numbers but lacks trueness otherwise. Hard to blame him though, since many actors 'act' this way.Leslie Caron does not live up to all the qualities mentioned about her by Henri. She seems shy, somewhat traditional and even reticent, like Talia Shire's character in Rocky. It is only when she dances that there comes some personality in her. But she still does not have the desired screen presence during the numbers, and cannot stand out when performing in a group. Also her chemistry with Gene is often bland and one-sided; Gene at least manages to show some fondness towards her while Leslie looks as if she is just playing along with him. Henri can sing well and act charmingly, but his character too is poorly given the chauffeur\/dad-who-opposes-then-concedes treatment. They could have had some dialog between Henri and Lise, since love can't be so easily given up. And don't get me started on the ridiculous superhero-like costumes both Gene and Henri were wearing in the otherwise serious scene before the final performance!Oscar Levant was utterly wasted; he had a promising back-story or whatever you call it. They could have especially done more after his daydreaming concert act to draw attention upon his unfulfilled desires of becoming famous before the party scene. Oscar Levant, like many other actors, just parrots his lines without adding any gravity to it. Nina Foch was the only actor truly worth mentioning here; she conveys her dry charm, furtiveness and ultimately disappointment well. All of the songs are melodious but not catchy. However, they have the French charm that gives fervor to the movie. Even 'My Fair Lady' had fabulous numbers but I cannot remember any; it is because unlike Singing in the Rain or Marry Poppins or Sound of Music, they don't carry indelible hooks. So it isn't a fault, just a lacking. But the fault was to place all these numbers in this film; they failed to add up and boost the finale. Conversely, SITR placed its numbers so well that the 12 minute Broadway Melody spectacle at the end was just dazzling.I have to commend the unique filming techniques in the film Lise could not be described more wonderfully, the one-man band was clever and the theatrical finishing was ingenious.

However, I must say that the story is lacking because the moral gets lost in it and because it has certain logical points that are worth exploring.The one major flaw is that the entire journey that Dorothy, herself goes on is entirely unnecessary; Glinda the good witch could have flew to the Scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion and told them the things that they went on a life threatening journey to the wizard to find out. She could have told the Scarecrow that he didn't need a brain if he had intelligence. She could have told Tin Man that he didn't need to actually have a heart to have compassion (otherwise he probably wouldn't want the heart to begin with --although I'd also like to point out that the tin man should have asked for a normal body that doesn't rust--.) And she could have told the cowardly lion that courage is about not letting fear get to you, instead of about not being afraid. Most importantly of all, Glinda could have told Dorothy that all she had to do is clapped her heels together and say, there's no place like home instead of again sending her on a life threatening journey in which she's being chased by a witch who commands an army of flying monkeys and throws fireballs. And from all of that, the moral is supposed to be, don't run away from home.I think I have a better moral, don't be ignorant, don't withhold crucial information from people, and above all else, don't write books when you're stoned.

Basically Det. Tom Hardy (Bruce Willis) comes from a generation of cops, and he is devastated when his father Vince (John Mahoney) dies during the chase of a serial killer, and after he gets himself in an argument with his partner and cousin Det. Jimmy Detillo (Robert Pastorelli). Two years later Tom is working as part of the river rescue police, but is pulled back into action with new partner Jo Christman (Sarah Jessica Parker) when possibly the same killer, nicknamed the Polish Hill strangler, is on the loose again. The victims seem to be women that Tom knew, making him a prime suspect, and no-one apart from maybe Jo believes it is the same killer from the past, and he will have to find the right clues to prove his innocence. Keeping an eye on him is Capt. Nick Detillo (Dennis Farina), an acquaintance from two years ago, and Tom and Jo and do come across some small clues, it is obvious that they are slowly falling for each other. Eventually when trapped, Tom finally gets the truth from Nick, that Jimmy was the killer, he has been copycatting the crimes, and he was the one who killed his father, but in the end of course the guilty are caught and the good guys go back to the better life. Also starring Tom Sizemore as Det. Danny Detillo, Brion James as Det. Eddie Eiler, Timothy Busfield as Tony Sacco and Poseidon's Andre Braugher as Dist. Atty. Frank Morris. The acting was a little flat in parts, and they could have been a few more explosive and gun filled chase and action sequences, I will admit as well I didn't exactly pay the fullest attention while watching, but I guess as a cop looking for a serial killer story is is okay, an alright crime thriller. Worth watching!
