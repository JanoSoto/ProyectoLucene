It's a real treat for horror fans & remains one of my top ten favourite horror movies! Unlike a lot of horror films, HELLRAISER wastes no time in getting to the action! It manages to grab the viewers attention almost immediately, as we see a man (FRANK COTTON) buying what looks to be a harmless musical puzzle box from an Asian Man at a small store, upon opening it, Frank is literally torn to shreds & the room he is in, is suddenly transformed into a torture chamber, full of chains & body parts strewn about! (A word of caution, don't watch this movie, before, during or after eating!) Unlike the latter sequels that followed this, Pinhead (Here dubbed Lead Cenobite) & his cenobite followers barely have any screen time, in fact they are mere window dressing to the films real story. The special effects by BOB KEEN are really fantastic here & some of the best to ever grace a horror movie, including the Frank monster, who is seen is several stages, first as a dry husk of a corpse & then a half bloody one & then a bloody, skinless monster, his resurrection from under the floor boards is a real fantastic piece of work!. The gore is good & plenty but never gratuitous believe it or not, since it actually serves the films story. We see rats twitching in a death spasm, as they have been nailed to the wall by Frank, who at one point even skins a dead rat! various victims are bludgeoned with a hammer, a nail ripping through a hand, a head is ripped in half along with the rest of the body that is torn into by hooks & chains, a person literally pulled apart by hooks & left strewn all over a room, a steaming bloody corpse, maggot infused rotting corpses also lie about. The cenobites themselves are very well done & articulated, a really colourful cavalcade of monsters, who are adorned in black leather, with sewn up wounds, nails encrusted into their flesh & their bodies pierced, they spend the early half in the shadows, before coming to light in the latter half of the film. What I really liked about HELLRAISER, is that at a time when the otherworldly monsters were considered the main villains & their human counterparts the good guys, HELLRAISER does a radical shift in tone, by making the human characters, (in this films case FRANK & JULIA) the real monsters of the piece & not the cenobites! Unlike a lot of horror films of it's period, HELLRAISER has a very fresh & original plot for a horror movie. It's main story is not about monsters, but rather infidelity, murder, hedonism, excess & temptation & back stabbing the ones a person loves or pretends to love, in order to fulfil their own desires, no matter how much it may hurt others or manipulate them. The character of Frank really stands out, he's a rather disturbing character, who's lust for sex is never quenched or satisfied to his fulfilment, & shares a very sickening attraction to his niece Kirsty, that is quiet disturbing. The acting is very well done here & the score by CHRISTOPHER YOUNG is absolutely fantastic! CLIVE BARKER making his feature film directorial debut, really amazes one with his fantastic knack for directing (Written from his own novel, THE HELLBOUND HEART). his vision is fierce & unrelenting. What's worth noting is how some element of Barker's novel was changed for the film version, Larry was originally called Rory & Kirsty was a co-worker of his, the Wall Crawler demon seen in the film, was known as the Engineer & Frank's opening the portals of hell at the beginning, sees him get sexually massaged by some faceless female cenobites, what's notable here, is how the engineer name, the faceless white designs of the cenobites, seen on the cover art & described in the novel, all turned up in HELLRAISER INFERNO. The film is almost unbearably suspenseful at times, such as scenes where Kirsty investigates the house while no one else is there & then winds up being caught in a room by the skinless Frank, the scene where she is visited by the cenobites in a hospital, being chased down a long dark labyrinth by a wall crawling demon, trying to escape the sadistic Frank in a twisted game of cat & mouse, after she has murdered her dad & step mother & the cenobites attempting to take Kirsty back to their world at the end & her final fight with the Wall Crawler, that wants the box that is in her possession. HELLRAISER also sports some creepy moments, more particularly a dirty bum that seemingly follows Kirsty around & is revealed at the end to be a terrifying demon. Indeed HELLRAISER is a near perfect horror film, that barely has any downsides to it, which is a rarity with a lot of horror films especially in all my years of reviewing horror films, in fact in my eyes the only downside this film has is (presumably at the behest of the studio) a potential love interest is introduced for Larry's teenage daughter Kirsty, in that of Steve, this character adds nothing to the film, feels forced in, is not interesting & thankfully Barker doesn't seem to like this idea either & spends very little time on it. To me it's nothing more than a forced & watered down love story that could so easily have been written around.All in all, I highly recommend HELLRAISER to any horror fan who hasn't seen it yet! It's a very worthwhile horror movie, that is never boring & always manages to keep one watching, as it engrosses them into it's well written & captivating story.

I saw it in Moscow in the middle of 80s, and when our friends brought the tape to watch I thought it was a screen adaptation of Irwin Shaw's novel Nightwork which is a completely different story (both were translated to Russian as The Night Porter - hence the confusion). As you can see, the film had a triple-shocking value for me - first, I expected to see a different movie; second and third, for its dark and disturbing subject matter and for the breaking all kinds of taboos in the way Cavani had explored it. I remember that I was very impressed by Cavani's use of flashbacks, music, and her classy cinematography. Both leads were very good as two people who had met at the most horrifying circumstances but according to the writer-director were not able to forget the disturbing relationship and were willing to give anything just to be able to carry on with it. It was a first time I saw Charlotte Rampling and she became one of my favorite actresses. I saw it again couple of weeks ago and I have to admit that without its original shock value it did not impress me at all. The plot does not seem that shocking, the story does not make much sense. Some of the dialog is just ridiculous. For example, Max confesses to his old friend, Countess Stein ( who knows everything about his past) after Lucia had entered his hotel and his life Max I found her. I found my little girl. Countess Such a romantic story. Max It is not a romantic story, it is a biblical story. The second part of the movie when the couple try to hide in Max's apartment and the other Nazi wait outside for days for them to come out is just bad, IMO. The final scene is plausible and makes sense - (***possible spoiler***) there could be never a happy ending to the story like that but, alas, it took too long for the ending to come - I actually could not wait for somebody to finally take the unfortunate couple out of their misery (***end of spoiler***) and I was grateful when it happened - not a good sign for the movie where you should sympathize with the main characters. I am not sure if the movie is one of Nazi chic flicks or a serious and honest even if flawed exploration of the very dark depths of human soul.

He is, for him, subdued for most of the film, although towards the end he punctuates his performance with silent screams. He's pretty good as the survivor of Auschwitz, consumed by survivor guilt, and denying himself any pleasures except the money taken in his pawn shop.Various figures come and go in his life, although he shows no particular interest in any of them, and aversion towards many. The characters are rather sketchily done, as they might be in a play. There is the ambitious assistant, the whore, the gangster, the lonely man who wants to talk about Herbert Spencer, Reni Santoni as a quivering junkie, the pregnant young girl who wants to sell her engagement ring. (Not a wedding ring, mind you, this is an illegitimate pregnancy and in 1964 you were still in trouble if you had no husband and no opportunity for an abortion.) That diamond is glass, he tells the stricken girl brusquely. Steiger's Sol Nazerman is a pretty cold fish.His relationship with his Latino assistant is key to Steiger's evolution. Steiger teaches him that nothing matters but money, so Ortiz very sensibly decides to help the local gangsters hold up Nazerman's shop. But the assistant, instead, teaches Nazerman something. Killed in the robbery, he teaches Nazerman to feel pain, which Nazerman then reaffirms by impaling his palm on one of those spikey receipt holders, a kind of stigma to go along with his concentration camp tattoos.The movie was pretty much a shocker on its release. Partly because the audience got to see some naked breasts. Amusing now, isn't it? It was also knocked because of the way Latinos and blacks were treated. I don't know why. It would be surprising if the owner of a pawn shop on 116th street didn't have a lot of customers who were people of color -- good and bad.The jazz score is loud and at times almost overwhelming.

Partly because the audience got to see some naked breasts. Amusing now, isn't it? It was also knocked because of the way Latinos and blacks were treated. I don't know why. It would be surprising if the owner of a pawn shop on 116th street didn't have a lot of customers who were people of color -- good and bad.The jazz score is loud and at times almost overwhelming. The photography makes 1964 New York grimy, smoggy, and dangerous.If you haven't seen it, catch it if you have the chance. You're not likely to forget it in a hurry.

It is not his best work, but I would definitely recommend it to Chaplin fans. I feel that Charlie Chaplin was at his most powerful in his silent films. Here, he seems a little unsure of himself, in terms of balancing acts that he could pantomime with verbal jokes. Don't get me wrong, there is some hilarious dialog in this movie. It is not short on laughs by any means, but Chaplin's best films had a brilliant sense of balance to them, a balance between drama and comedy that few have ever been able to match. It is a very good movie, but, unfortunately I don't feel it matches up against Chaplin's best, although, I can't think of many films that do! What this film does have going for it, and it has quite a bit going for it, is another brilliant performance from Charles Chaplin. Only this time, aside from his spectacular physical comedy, Chaplin proves he also knows how to deliver his lines with a comedic timing that is every-bit as precise as his pantomime. The highlights are the brilliant dance with the globe and the powerful, moving speech that Chaplin gives at the end of the film. His performance as Adenoid Hynkel, a biting satire of Adolf Hitler, is so off-the-wall, so silly that it accomplishes exactly what Chaplin sought out to do - to make the world laugh at Hitler, to rob him of his power. Mel Brooks would do a fine job of defaming Hitler twenty-eight years later in his hilarious debut film, The Producers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this movie (that isn't expressed in the speech at the end), it's that laughter can sometimes be the best medicine. While no one can ever undo the atrocities that Hitler exposed the world to, we can survive, as long as we have our ideals and our sense of humor.

While talking to his mother about the problem, she mentions all of the ghosts of the castle. That sparks an idea--to market Castle Plunkett to tourists as a hotel that's the most haunted destination in the world, or the western hemisphere, or some such. When the first group of tourists arrives, Plunkett's crew puts forward a slapdash effort to feign hauntings, but it turns out that the castle may be really haunted after all.Yowza, what a mess this film is! I had a quick sinking feeling during the credits when writer\/director Neil Jordan's name came up. Although I've only seen four of his films so far, I can only remember liking one of them, We're No Angels--and this is coming from a reviewer who likes the great majority of films that he sees. Still I was prepared to give it a generous chance. After all, I love horror comedies from Ghostbusters to Young Frankenstein, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Cannibal--The Musical.There are a host of problems with High Spirits * The film isn't very funny. Granted, comedies need not make you laugh out loud to succeed. At it's best, High Spirits can be cute, and I did smile a bit. But a lot of the film was an almost embarrassing attempt at humor.* Jordan apparently directed the actors to amp it up as if this were a stage performance. Everyone severely overacts, turning into super-hams and frequently yelling their lines. It's even worse when a whole gaggle of actors does this at the same time, which happens frequently here. I know I've complained elsewhere about mumbling and whispering in recent films, but I'll take that any day over this kind of overacting. This flaw is especially strange given that many members of the cast have been great in other films.* Even though it should be fairly straightforward, the plot frequently confused me. Why the family would still be making payments on the castle was never clear to me. I didn't get where the tourists came from all of a sudden. It didn't seem to be the case that this small group of tourists would help the hotel\/castle raise the money it needed within a few weeks. Also, a large number of events seemed random. I didn't know why they were happening, and I didn't really care. Which brings me to the next problem * There didn't seem to be any ground rules laid down for the film's world, and any that were laid down seemed to be frequently contradicted. At times, the film plays like there wasn't even a script, but Jordan had access to a nifty old castle in Ireland, so on the fly, they just made up what they thought would be wacky set-pieces.Remarkably, there were also a number of things that the film did right* The first section of the film, featuring the castle's bunch of rag tags trying to pull off a haunted house for the bunch of rag tag tourists, had a lot of potential. Even if it wouldn't have been hilarious, it could have been a charming comedy in the classical literary sense of comedy, if High Spirits would have stuck with this material, toned down the overacting, and made an attempt at a logical script.* Some of the ghost material and haunted house effects were enjoyable. Again, they weren't funny, but there was also potential here to make an effective haunted house film, even if lighter in mood. The crypt zombie-ghosts were great, but only showed up for a minute or two.* The castle and grounds were fantastic. They could have easily provided a setting for a film as good as Roger Corman's Vincent Price films. There were a couple nice bits of cinematography showing off the castle and grounds, as well.* The love stories at the end almost started working for me. Again, this might have been a more effective direction on which to focus the majority of the film. The minor characters dropped out at this point (and really, the cast was too big, because most of them were wasted), the overacting was toned-down, and the non-sequitur plot elements dropped out.My final verdict? The positive elements brought the film up to a 5 out of 10. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. I can't recommend it, but it is perhaps worth watching on cable or renting at least once for die-hard fans of horror comedies.

Everyone severely overacts, turning into super-hams and frequently yelling their lines. It's even worse when a whole gaggle of actors does this at the same time, which happens frequently here. I know I've complained elsewhere about mumbling and whispering in recent films, but I'll take that any day over this kind of overacting. This flaw is especially strange given that many members of the cast have been great in other films.* Even though it should be fairly straightforward, the plot frequently confused me. Why the family would still be making payments on the castle was never clear to me. I didn't get where the tourists came from all of a sudden. It didn't seem to be the case that this small group of tourists would help the hotel\/castle raise the money it needed within a few weeks. Also, a large number of events seemed random. I didn't know why they were happening, and I didn't really care. Which brings me to the next problem * There didn't seem to be any ground rules laid down for the film's world, and any that were laid down seemed to be frequently contradicted. At times, the film plays like there wasn't even a script, but Jordan had access to a nifty old castle in Ireland, so on the fly, they just made up what they thought would be wacky set-pieces.Remarkably, there were also a number of things that the film did right* The first section of the film, featuring the castle's bunch of rag tags trying to pull off a haunted house for the bunch of rag tag tourists, had a lot of potential. Even if it wouldn't have been hilarious, it could have been a charming comedy in the classical literary sense of comedy, if High Spirits would have stuck with this material, toned down the overacting, and made an attempt at a logical script.* Some of the ghost material and haunted house effects were enjoyable. Again, they weren't funny, but there was also potential here to make an effective haunted house film, even if lighter in mood. The crypt zombie-ghosts were great, but only showed up for a minute or two.* The castle and grounds were fantastic. They could have easily provided a setting for a film as good as Roger Corman's Vincent Price films. There were a couple nice bits of cinematography showing off the castle and grounds, as well.* The love stories at the end almost started working for me. Again, this might have been a more effective direction on which to focus the majority of the film. The minor characters dropped out at this point (and really, the cast was too big, because most of them were wasted), the overacting was toned-down, and the non-sequitur plot elements dropped out.My final verdict? The positive elements brought the film up to a 5 out of 10. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. I can't recommend it, but it is perhaps worth watching on cable or renting at least once for die-hard fans of horror comedies.

While talking to his mother about the problem, she mentions all of the ghosts of the castle. That sparks an idea--to market Castle Plunkett to tourists as a hotel that's the most haunted destination in the world, or the western hemisphere, or some such. When the first group of tourists arrives, Plunkett's crew puts forward a slapdash effort to feign hauntings, but it turns out that the castle may be really haunted after all.Yowza, what a mess this film is! I had a quick sinking feeling during the credits when writer\/director Neil Jordan's name came up. Although I've only seen four of his films so far, I can only remember liking one of them, We're No Angels--and this is coming from a reviewer who likes the great majority of films that he sees. Still I was prepared to give it a generous chance. After all, I love horror comedies from Ghostbusters to Young Frankenstein, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Cannibal--The Musical.There are a host of problems with High Spirits * The film isn't very funny.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"21 January 2005","score":"","review":" John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films. Those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987. It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella The Dead. Once long ago, a very wise man called Doc asked me, Doesn't The Dead seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in Dubliners? I tend to think that it is. The story and film both contain some of Joyce's societal comments and criticisms, but for the most part, paint a warm and loving portrait of an Ireland Joyce himself so often railed against and would shortly leave. Huston's handling of protagonist Gabriel Conroy, who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion, is simply remarkable. To claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point. As with any of Joyce's Dubliners, plot--while most certainly present--is not the focus. Plot is merely a tool for the conveyance of the protagonist's epiphany. In addition to a seeming lack in action, there is quite frankly little dialogue in Joyce's short story for the director to lean on. Huston's ability to translate what Joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie's greatest triumph. Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal. To claim that Huston has softened his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark. While The Dead may be painted with a cheerful hue, the complacency and pretense of the film's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale we are the toddling old aunts; the embarrassing drunk; the tenor with the sore throat; the wife with the sad, rain soaked secret; even the self-deluded middle-aged man. But The Dead belies its title. It is not a dark story. Nor is it really that bleak. Forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it; forget the shambles of a life Gabriel awakes to at the film's end it is only with the destruction of the illusions Gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward.

She's Italian? asks Harker. And the way the blood came out was cool, and not very disgusting, and the part when Dracula commands Mina and the maid was very unforgettable. And the running gag when Van Helsing and Dracula keep exchanging the last word. And in the end, he gets killed by Renfield accidentally, and Van Helsing does get the last word.
