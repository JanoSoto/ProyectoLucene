The major stars of the film are Edward Norton who plays the depressed main character without a name and Brad Pitt which plays the character of Tyler Durden. What the theme is in this film is so intricately supplied within the title of the film itself which is that of the fight club. Through the beginning of the film the unnamed character was suffering from insomnia and depression and sought relief, what had happened that instead of any actual remedy for his insomnia from which the attendant at the hospital had recommended was that he should witness what he called real pain and that was from a testicular cancer support group. However odd this was, the unnamed character started going to these down-trodden support groups to seek relief although he didn't suffer from the actual illness from which the group was based upon, which in a sick and twisted way had helped him only temporarily forget about his own problems. This is where another character of the movie comes into play and that is of Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter where she had joined the same groups of which the unnamed had been frequenting. Knowing that Marla was a fake just as he was within these groups all satisfaction and relief had ceased.The point in the film where he meets Tyler Durden was on a business flight from which they introduce themselves to each other. The fight club theme seemed to have evolved from an altercation that had happened after a night of drinking at a local bar. From there the actual fight club just seemed to evolve from other people that would gather around outside of that bar to fight one another. Soon there seemed to exist the fight club that took place in the basement of Lou's bar.With regards to the lighting in the film most of which seems to be produced in very dark conditions with only a few parts in the film that were actually well lit. This seems to me to represent the very nature of people and the human condition as it applies to all the strife and trying times that a person can go through in life. On one side of the picture you have the well lit office atmosphere of an everyday normal life and career and on the other side you have the actual realities of human suffering and all the real emotions that people seem to disregard in their everyday business atmosphere which seems to surface when alone and living life outside of their corporate existence that perpetuates the necessity of everyday life. There is one line in the film that represents this statement and that is from the character Tyler Durden You are not your job, you are not how much money you have in the bank, not the car you drive, your not the contents of your wallet, you are not your f***ing khaki's. No matter what someone does for a living inevitably everyone goes through the same turmoil.The other variation of the film would be the motif and the reoccurring pattern of the unnamed character getting beat up. Whether it's from people in the fight club or whether it's merely himself causing bodily harm this is what ties the film together ultimately reaching the end of the story where the truth is finally revealed and completely undoes everything that you knew up to that point about the unnamed and the story line itself. In my opinion this is what makes this particular film worth watching over again. Just to be able to make sense of the film's story to begin with.

There is a real Adrian Cronauer, and this story is based on him, but the marketers never advertise this as based on a true story, so you know this must be mostly Hollywood at work.Cronauer's style is unique, wild, wacky, crazy, with tons of voice impressions and just off-the-wall stories and personalities streaming out of the head of Williams\/Cronhauer into the ears of the troops. It's a huge departure from the typically monotone, boring, and heavily censored radio entertainment, and the troops love it!Forrest Whitaker also stars as Ed Garlick, a fellow radio Dee-jay and kind of the mentor to Cronauer. Once Cronauer gets settled, the story centers around two themes 1\\ his battle against the uptight stations owners, played beautifully by J.T. Walsh (See Breakdown - great bad guy) as the Sgt Major and Bruno Kirby as Lt. Haulk who desperately wants to be funny, and believes he is, but no, he's just not. And 2\\ his attraction to a young Vietnamese woman he sees passing on the street, Trinh (played by Chintara Sukapatana who went on to become an actress with some credits). Cronauer develops a friendship with Trinh's brother Tranh, and Cronauer slowly realizes that the cultural division between him and Tranh is wide and probably insurmountable. Barry Levinson directs this masterpiece, with excellent taut movement from scene to scene - not much wasted moments here. See Rainman and The Natural from some of his other gems.In the end, what happens is pretty much what you might expect, but it doesn't make it less heartfelt an emotional pull for the viewer. I wouldn't describe this as an anti-war film, but more so, as a film that encourages you to question the status quo as you go through life, which is certainly what Cronauer did, in spades.

This movie shows you how strongly media influences us through showing you the reality of someone whose whole life is built by the entertainment industry. One of my favorite parts about this movie is its use of satire. I would recommend this movie to anyone as it teaches a valuable lesson that everyone stands to gain from learning.Many satirical tools are used in The Truman Show to deepen the meaning of the movie. There is a lot of connotation in the film. For instance, the character Christof has many underlying biblical references. Christof is portrayed as god-like in many ways. First of all, his name has 'Christ' in it. Also, Christof's office is on a very high floor, and people tend to think of god as in the highest of all places. Furthermore, when people talk about Christof they tend to use names that are typically used to describe god. For example, when Truman comments about the beautiful sunset to Marlin, Marlin gives all the credit to Christof by saying that it is the work of 'the big guy up there.' The religious connotation of Christof is used to show how we tend to worship television, celebrities in magazines, and all other forms of media and the people in them. Irony is another tool that is geniously used in The Truman Show to develop the satire. Situational Irony is used to provoke humor in many scenes, such as when Truman goes to the travel agency and sees posters of planes crashing all over the walls. This is to dissuade Truman from leaving Seahaven, however it is also very ironic as posters exposing the dangers of travel are the last thing you would expect to see in a travel agency.This movie's lesson about the way too large role of media in our society is an incredibly valuable piece of knowledge. In fact the importance of this lesson seems to grow with time, as it could almost be considered more relevant nowadays than it was when the movie was originally made; this is because in the last decade, we have only increased the role that media plays in our lives. Overall, this movie is a great and hilarious satirical film that exposes how much media influences our lifestyle choices.

I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade. But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance. It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the d word spoken so casually if only sparingly.However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one.

It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that...

Armstrong's assistant Bruce Cabot falls in love with the leading lady played by Fay Wray in her greatest screen role. the adventure on the island find the group not only in countering the unfriendly natives who reside on the island, but some prehistoric creatures as well, including several variations of dinosaurs.

Luther had pointed Hooker at Gondorf so Redford is instructed by Gondorf and his gang on how to put together a Sting on Lonnigan in retribution.

Meanwhile, Lonnigam sends a far more deadly hit woman, who fools Hooker, posing as a counter woman at the local greasy spoon. I will not spoil it, you can guess the rest. Is the movie perfect? No. The main flaw has always been its idealized depiction of criminality please, how many criminals would not betray Hooker and Gondorf for a grilled cheese sandwich to the rich, powerful and deadly Lonnigan. The amity that is displayed between the criminals, they all know and love each other, is also pure fantasy. Yet, it remains a classic for the cast and the writing which have many twists and turns all realistic and well written. The repartee is gritty with a little very dark humor.

The other flaw is trivial but annoying. Marvin Hamlisch who also wrecked The Spy Who Loved Me felt compelled to play a couple Scott Joplin tunes I loved until he played them 300 times. Shaw steals the movie as the ruthless Lonnigan, like Jaws, even good actors were outshone by him. Do not go into the movie expecting gritty realism; the script is as idealized as the Hollywood sound stage, depression era, that the movie was filled on.

At this point, the Bond formula had been established firmly enough so that Thunderball only has to follow a template full of established tropes and clichés. Many folks will say that it makes this one of the duller movies. I personally always thought it was a blast though. Among the highlights, this film follows Bond on a colorful journey to Nassau, where he has to constantly out-think and outwit the opposition. There's a lot of deceptive mindgames at work, followed by some chasing and some fighting, before a massive all-out battle underwater. It's a long film, but it is consistently thrilling and it has a satisfying payoff. Best of all, the film remains iconic thanks to the classic elements at play Bond's classic charm, a classic villain we love to hate, and an overall sense of class.The premise is pretty simple, generally not much different than a lot of modern action movies revolving around stolen nuclear weapons (like Broken Arrow, The Rock, Mission Impossible, you name it). It follows Ian Flemming's novel practically word for word (which is unsurprising, since it was based on a screenplay to begin with). What makes it so fun is that it's twisty and complex, but not impossible to follow. Each new scene offers something that's either thrilling or alluring. The characters are as endearing as ever.Caught in epic widescreen photography, this film boasts plenty of bright and colorful scenery. Most of it looks great, especially with some steady and well-choreographed underwater photography. Some scenes, especially during the parade scene, are a bit rough around the edges. Editing can be nutty, as some dialogue has been cut, dubbed, and recut for various versions. Scenes usually transit well regardless. Acting is great Sean Connery is still the man, and I always enjoyed the performances of Adolfo Celi, the lovely Claudine Auger, and the lovely Licuana Paluzzi. Writing is okay - the plot unravels well, and the dialogue is usually good, but some of the jokes can be a little goofy. This production uses great-looking locales, and lots of fine-looking sets, props, and costumes. John Barry's music score is as good as ever, and Tom Jones' theme song is hip.To me, Thunderball is one of the most perfect Bond adventures. It has all the right signature elements we know and love, but with tons of thrills and action. It is a long adventure that might strain the patience of many viewers, but I think it's classy, sexy, exciting stuff.4.5\/5 (Experience Perfect | Story Good | Film Very Good) ","genre":null},{"date":"20 September 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After seeing James Bond in action in three big, iconic missions, Thunderball blasts to the scene with the promise of more action, more gadgets, more ladies, bigger stakes, more exotic locations, and so much more!

At this point, the Bond formula had been established firmly enough so that Thunderball only has to follow a template full of established tropes and clichés. Many folks will say that it makes this one of the duller movies. I personally always thought it was a blast though. Among the highlights, this film follows Bond on a colorful journey to Nassau, where he has to constantly out-think and outwit the opposition. There's a lot of deceptive mindgames at work, followed by some chasing and some fighting, before a massive all-out battle underwater. It's a long film, but it is consistently thrilling and it has a satisfying payoff. Best of all, the film remains iconic thanks to the classic elements at play Bond's classic charm, a classic villain we love to hate, and an overall sense of class.The premise is pretty simple, generally not much different than a lot of modern action movies revolving around stolen nuclear weapons (like Broken Arrow, The Rock, Mission Impossible, you name it). It follows Ian Flemming's novel practically word for word (which is unsurprising, since it was based on a screenplay to begin with). What makes it so fun is that it's twisty and complex, but not impossible to follow. Each new scene offers something that's either thrilling or alluring. The characters are as endearing as ever.Caught in epic widescreen photography, this film boasts plenty of bright and colorful scenery. Most of it looks great, especially with some steady and well-choreographed underwater photography. Some scenes, especially during the parade scene, are a bit rough around the edges. Editing can be nutty, as some dialogue has been cut, dubbed, and recut for various versions. Scenes usually transit well regardless.

After watching this movie, based on Christine Crawford's scathing book, the plot of Mildred Pierce will unfold to you. I gave that classic a ten because I hold that a film should be judged on its merits alone. Here the movie opens with Joan's preparation for going to the studio with vanity the level that would be commensurate with an audience with the Deity. It has to be seen to be believed. The movie starts as her career is at zenith and follows the downslope with the exception being her Oscar for Mildred Pierce. Louis Mayer, while calling her 'Hollywood royalty' is gently handing her hat to her and opening the door out of MGM. Her infamous clean obsession is a wonderful depiction of the anal retentive personality. Watch what is was to be her maid or housekeeper, those of you not familiar with Freud, suffice to say it is not the floor that is dirty here. Joan is constantly trying to remove dirt from her surroundings never grasping it is an existential metaphor for her soul. The adopting of the children is delineated as a calculated public relations stunt. When she first proffers it, walking on the beach with Forrest, even he grasps its real purpose. As her career begins to decline, her cruelty to both children increases proportionately. I found this part completely logical and believable.Dunaway was mocked for overacting mainly for the 'no wire hangers' with her face covered with an inch of cold cream looking like an undead fashion model. True, there are scenes where she goes over the top. Yet, remember she is all alone here. Forrest is more of a cameo role; Dunaway has to carry the entire movie upon her shoulders. With the exception of her bush clipping from Hell, Wire Hangers and the tackle and strangle Christina scene in front of Barbara the magazine writer, Dunaway does well. A few bad scenes do not equal a bad performance. The movie follows her later life, the TV career, the slasher pictures of the 50s and her marriage to the Pepsi president. This is my favorite scene where the Pepsi board, after her husband's death, tries to gently but firmly push her out. Watch Dunaway's best scene in film,Wait until I come out publicly against your product, see how much you sell; don't F with me boys!! That was Joan Crawford, she nails her, this scene is her best I have ever seen.As a philosopher, trying to discern true from false here, I tend to believe Christina's version. I do think some of Christina's misbehavior that resulted in expulsion is downplayed and whitewashed over. Yet, think of the plot of Mildred Pierce a saintly mother who slaves and toils for the most evil daughter in the history of cinema, Veda. I find this consanguinity a trifle too coincidental for my taste. It is clear the studio is trying to dispel the plethora of rumors surrounding their star and rehabilitate her by the role. Isn't it fascinating how Mildred's character is an otherworldly saintly paragon of nobility suffering for her Satanic daughter? Think of Christina's version of Joan Crawford when you watch it over. It is clear somebody is doing some damage control with Crawford's ruined image. Mildred Pierce will always be a legendary classic but, trust me, watch this movie and you will watch it with brand new eyes. Dunaway is a gifted actress; she was maligned for a few bad scenes here but on the whole she does an excellent job with an unsympathetic role. I admired her bravery in taking the role.

Is the movie too long, yes. Are there a few scenes that could have been cut, yes. Yet, in my opinion, it has a place in my library for the key scene that is my header. Concannon has just used his superior legal skills to disallow the eyewitness nurse testimony that would have won the case for Galvin. Galvin's case now collapses, realistically, Concannon annihilates Galvin due to his huge staff and frankly his mole inside Galvin's office Rampling. Galvin's closing statement speaks for all the people watching; how tired we are of the minutia of legal rulings being used to protect evil people, in this case, the Archdiocese and their dangerously incompetent doctor. The summation points out what many people forget the law is the bastard child of philosophy. Ethics were the sub discipline of philosophy that laws were drawn from. Here Galvin uses ethical principles to ask the jury to, implicitly, supersede the legalities that shield a crippling, negligent doctor and the powerful Church standing behind him. When you re-watch it listen to his argument Ethics over the Law. How tired we all are of the law being subverted to protect the rich and the powerful. The best part of the movie and frankly, friends, why I am a philosopher and not a lawyer.The movie is one long existential path back for Galvin. When we meet him, he is a drunken ambulance chaser being ejected out of a funeral where he is trying to shake down the grieving family for business. Warden throws him this bone of a case that is sure to be settled out of court. When he thinks he has a good expert doctor witness, the decision point ensues, take the money or fight?

His little brother adores and idolizes him, even after seeing him kill a man and burn him up in an incinerator. He secrets a gun in his drawer, a sign of his wish to become like Roth which gets him quite a beating from the abusive father played brilliantly by Schell. There are no heroes here; the movie is black as pitch. The mother, played by Redgrave, is dying of an inoperable brain tumor. The movie follows Roth's return, reconnecting with little brother and girlfriend. The beatings visited upon Furlong, his little brother, prompt violent retaliation by Roth upon his father building to his near execution out in a winter's field. The movie intimates that the father's brutality produced the monster Roth and his apprentice in training Furlong. It is not a mystery how brutalized youths seek existential compensation for their feelings of deep helplessness and victimization, in youth, by developing into true monsters. They feed upon the power of destroying others for money that fills that chasm inside of themselves.I refer readers to the excellent movie Mad Dog Coll that also depicts his humiliation in childhood with his developing into a sadistic, laughing ghoul in adulthood. I love this movie but it is one painful viewing. The acting is excellent and it is relentless and unyielding. Poor Furlong is drawn into Roth's world with the realistic consequences ensuing. The movie's power is really in its delving into the etiology of existential monsters who destroy others for the feeling of power that they feed upon. Roth is ice here, even towards his little brother there are acts of kindness but no verbal or physical affection. His sex with his girlfriend is also violent and devoid of affection. The scene that contains the essence of the movie is when an old associate spots Roth on the Boardwalk. Roth calmly follows him and as the man is about to drop a dime on him, walks up and shoots him in the head. The action is as automatic and dispassionate as if we were opening our car door. The man has killed so many people that there is no affective content to any of his violence; it is completely robotic. Even Roth's protection of Furlong is never followed by affection towards him, when he confronts Schell it is always vicarious revenge. He is angry about his mistreatment of Furlong because he suffered the same; he often says this as he is pushing or hitting Schell. When Furlong is killed, Roth simply bags him up and takes him to the incinerator. There is no apparent sorrow, he is a machine. If someone asked me why I love this movie it is because it shows you that children who are treated cruelly grow up to be monsters. The film is a great existential biography of a living iceberg who can never kill enough people to remove that deep feeling of powerlessness he suffered as a bruised and battered child. Parents, this movie is not for children. It is dark as midnight and features one of the coldest monsters ever depicted on film. That said, if you would like to understand the psychological pathology of the sociopath there is not a better movie to watch. The acting is excellent, especially Roth, Schell and Redgrave.

Dark As Night But An Excellent Movie. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 September 2015","score":"","review":" Throughout the ages the world has seen many exalted military leaders come and go, but one such individual will forever be distinguishable from the rest. The individual in question is General George S. Patton Jr-the pure warrior. Unashamedly egotistical with a bizarre belief in both Christianity and reincarnation, Patton was a tough military genius as well as a keen historian and poet. A magnificent anachronism, an enigma no doubt. There hasn't been a military commander so brilliant before or since the second world war. Granted, Patton had his flaws. For one his impulsive demeanour bordered on lunacy and secondly he relished combat with a worrying degree of fetishism that seemed almost sexual. Factors such as these make one question the man's sanity, however I think we can overlook his emotional state as his infatuation with war would lead the allies to victory in Europe.Here in Franklin J. Schaffner's profound tribute, General Patton is immortalised by the excellent George C. Scott in what is probably the actor's finest hour. Without a doubt, General Patton was the last of his kind and George C. Scott gives a one-of-a-kind performance. Scott thought he couldn't capture the essence of George Patton but despite being frustrated by this, he seems to be thoroughly enjoying the role and provides us with a superb take on the Patton legend. John Wayne and Robert Mitchum were contenders but neither could have embodied Patton's spirit the way George C. Scott did. He brings George Patton back from the grave and is firing on all cylinders, revelling in his own sharp witted charisma. Scott is truly mesmerising and each time he speaks you as the viewer are duty-bound to pay attention. Take Patton's opening speech shot against a huge U.S flag, masterfully scripted and terrifically executed it's the most compelling call to arms ever filmed. It sets the standard for the rest of the movie which remains consistent throughout. By the end of the speech I wished that I had served under Patton and even though he may have been hated by a lot of his men, I'd say they were ultimately proud to serve under a leader so ingenious. The film ends with an internal monologue from the General which is written and executed with touching sincerity to the point where it becomes philosophical. It struck a chord with me personally as it conveyed fantastically one of the sobering facts of not only war, but life in general and deeply illustrated how one can easily become disillusioned with both. The producer couldn't have hoped for a better script which was penned in part by the great Francis Ford Coppola, who would transform himself into something of a cinema heavyweight as the 70s progressed. Unique dialogue enriches the film, it's probably one of the most quotable films you'll ever see and some lines will give you a chuckle. Patton is a war movie as you already know, but the most intense scene takes place not on the battlefield, but within the confines of a military hospital. That's right, I refer to the infamous slapping incident in which General Patton assaulted a battle fatigued soldier in front of the man's contemporaries and army medical staff. A formidable and quite appalling occurrence in reality that is represented with commendable aplomb by Franklin J. Schaffner, who deserves to be eternally praised for using exemplary tact in bringing to the screen such a sensitive topic. I couldn't fault any of the performances in the film. Karl Malden is always a joy to watch and shares with George C. Scott some of the movie's best scenes. Impressive performances also came from Lawrence Dobkin as Colonel Gaston Bell, Michael Bates as Field Marshal Montgomery, Richard Munch as Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Frank Latimore as Lieutenant Colonel Davenport and Paul Stevens as Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Jack Gwillim is also worthy of note as General Alexander, as is Peter Barkworth as Colonel John Welkin and Seigfried Rauch as Steiger.Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score also compliments the movie's sprawling visuals. For a film that is heavily character driven a considerable amount of effort was put into the stuntwork and special effects, both of which I thought were amazing. The suspense is tightened harshly for a large battle in the desert and a couple of minor skirmishes in Europe, not to mention a German air raid on a North African town. There's also a lot of fine looking armoured machinery on show throughout the film. Cold war M46, M47, M48 Patton tanks and M41 Walker Bulldogs are mocked up to represent second world war U.S Shermans and German Panzers. Historical completests will be pained by this fact, but for me there was nothing better than seeing those armoured beasts dominate the screen.Hollywood's earnest love letter to one of the greatest military commanders in world history deserves to be seen numerous times-not just for George C. Scott's spectacular portray-but for an insight into the obsessively volatile psyche of one extraordinary individual. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 September 2015","score":"","review":" Throughout the ages the world has seen many exalted military leaders come and go, but one such individual will forever be distinguishable from the rest.

The individual in question is General George S. Patton Jr-the pure warrior. Unashamedly egotistical with a bizarre belief in both Christianity and reincarnation, Patton was a tough military genius as well as a keen historian and poet. A magnificent anachronism, an enigma no doubt. There hasn't been a military commander so brilliant before or since the second world war. Granted, Patton had his flaws. For one his impulsive demeanour bordered on lunacy and secondly he relished combat with a worrying degree of fetishism that seemed almost sexual. Factors such as these make one question the man's sanity, however I think we can overlook his emotional state as his infatuation with war would lead the allies to victory in Europe.Here in Franklin J. Schaffner's profound tribute, General Patton is immortalised by the excellent George C. Scott in what is probably the actor's finest hour. Without a doubt, General Patton was the last of his kind and George C. Scott gives a one-of-a-kind performance. Scott thought he couldn't capture the essence of George Patton but despite being frustrated by this, he seems to be thoroughly enjoying the role and provides us with a superb take on the Patton legend. John Wayne and Robert Mitchum were contenders but neither could have embodied Patton's spirit the way George C. Scott did. He brings George Patton back from the grave and is firing on all cylinders, revelling in his own sharp witted charisma. Scott is truly mesmerising and each time he speaks you as the viewer are duty-bound to pay attention. Take Patton's opening speech shot against a huge U.S flag, masterfully scripted and terrifically executed it's the most compelling call to arms ever filmed. It sets the standard for the rest of the movie which remains consistent throughout. By the end of the speech I wished that I had served under Patton and even though he may have been hated by a lot of his men, I'd say they were ultimately proud to serve under a leader so ingenious. The film ends with an internal monologue from the General which is written and executed with touching sincerity to the point where it becomes philosophical. It struck a chord with me personally as it conveyed fantastically one of the sobering facts of not only war, but life in general and deeply illustrated how one can easily become disillusioned with both. The producer couldn't have hoped for a better script which was penned in part by the great Francis Ford Coppola, who would transform himself into something of a cinema heavyweight as the 70s progressed. Unique dialogue enriches the film, it's probably one of the most quotable films you'll ever see and some lines will give you a chuckle. Patton is a war movie as you already know, but the most intense scene takes place not on the battlefield, but within the confines of a military hospital. That's right, I refer to the infamous slapping incident in which General Patton assaulted a battle fatigued soldier in front of the man's contemporaries and army medical staff. A formidable and quite appalling occurrence in reality that is represented with commendable aplomb by Franklin J. Schaffner, who deserves to be eternally praised for using exemplary tact in bringing to the screen such a sensitive topic. I couldn't fault any of the performances in the film. Karl Malden is always a joy to watch and shares with George C. Scott some of the movie's best scenes. Impressive performances also came from Lawrence Dobkin as Colonel Gaston Bell, Michael Bates as Field Marshal Montgomery, Richard Munch as Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Frank Latimore as Lieutenant Colonel Davenport and Paul Stevens as Lieutenant Colonel Codman. Jack Gwillim is also worthy of note as General Alexander, as is Peter Barkworth as Colonel John Welkin and Seigfried Rauch as Steiger.Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score also compliments the movie's sprawling visuals. For a film that is heavily character driven a considerable amount of effort was put into the stuntwork and special effects, both of which I thought were amazing. The suspense is tightened harshly for a large battle in the desert and a couple of minor skirmishes in Europe, not to mention a German air raid on a North African town. There's also a lot of fine looking armoured machinery on show throughout the film.
