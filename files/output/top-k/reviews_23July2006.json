[{"date":"23 July 2006","score":"","review":" Most people are aware that Kevin Costner is an avid baseball fan, as he has made four movies where he was either a rabid fan, active or retired player.He understands baseball and must have been a fairly good amateur player himself, as his movements on the field are realistic, so his baseball movies are believable even without dissecting the plots.In For Love of the game however, the underlying love story between Billy Chapel and Jane Aubry (Costner and Preston), enhances, but does not overshadow the baseball theme. In fact, without the love story, the film might be a flat, plot less story.Some critics say the plot and particularly the ending, where we all know Chapel will pitch a perfect game, detracts from or imparts an artificiality to the film. But I would refer those critics to the 1984 film, The Natural, with Robert Redford. That film was predictable, yet its predictability was the stuff of Saturday morning matinées at the movies, where the good guy in the white hate defeated the bad guy. Same with For Love of the Game. Its predictability, which actually only becomes apparent near the middle of the last game, adds to the overall effect of the film.Costner is superb, not only as a ball player, but as a man who is obviously falling in love with something other than baseball, for the first time in his life.The best surprise of all is Kelly Preston. This is, by far, her best performance. She is totally believable as a vulnerable, insecure single mother, who is afraid of having her heart broken as a sports groupie.As an avid baseball fan, I loved this film for its reality in depicting an aging baseball player's plight.

And key to bringing this mood to life, is the excellent production sets, art direction and costumes. Accurate to the littlest detail of how a 60s Shanghainese community in Hong Kong lived, I couldn't help but smile at the presence of an amah, because I grew up as a toddler with one, kind of. And the language adds that bit of authenticity too. This movie did wonders for the cheong-sam, having Maggie Cheung appearing in different ones in most scenes to highlight time progression.And what is mood without the necessary music to punctuate the visually beautiful shots, by long time cinematographer and collaborator Christopher Doyle, and Lee Pin Bing? It's half the battle won in my opinion, that the musical pieces fill the gaps which lack dialogue and compliments the slow cinematic shots, and I'm addicted to the waltz of the main love theme. But it's one thing to have excellent music, and another when the music, effects and ambient noise are able to carry the entire movie on its own (you can select this audio track option from the Criterion Collection DVD).Now that the obvious statements about music, sets, costumes are out of the way, all these come to naught without a story. I'm glad that most of the scenes which were cut off, were done so, as they were quite cheesy, though humorous, and what remained from the 15 months production, tells a very mature, measured story on forbidden love in society's eyes, friendship and then more.There are plenty of material here which 2046, another movie which I enjoyed, had referenced, adapted and complimented, such as the hotel room, the writer in Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung), and his attitude in the sequel. One of my earlier Wong Kar-wai movies which I watched as a teen in the cinemas is Days of Being WIld, starring an ensemble cast which included Maggie Cheung, here as Mrs Chan, though I'd like to think of her movie's character here, as an extension of Su Li-zhen in Days (actually Wong provided her that character as a reference point when Maggie was asking incessantly questions about her character). And Tony's character in Days, a last moment cameo like appearance supposedly about a gambler in a never-made sequel, I'd liken it to Chow here, so in my own way, these movies form a loose trilogy.For those who have already watched the Korean movie April Snow, you would already realize that it borrows from the same theme of two characters, chancing upon each other by Fate, and learning that their respective spouses were having an affair with each other. While April Snow went for the common jugular in having the cheated upon spouses go head on with each other, In the Mood tackles it way too differently, providing loads of tension, and subtle teases, negating your want of the leads to develop their friendship into something more.And therein lies the strength of the movie. How Chow and Mrs Chan develop an unlikely friendship, which hints strongly at how it all could have been, under a 60s conservative environment, where they have to restrain their feelings for each other under society's judging eyes. Living in a communal environment too doesn't help their cause, even though it is pure to begin with - 2 lonely people, betrayed, and at times, tempted to take that leap of faith to challenge societal norms about love.Thankfully, potentially confusing ideas were not fully developed or made the final cut. There were thoughts to have the respective cheating spouses played by the same actors, but that would truly add to the confusion, The idea was developed separately into the what could have been and played out as various rehearsals as Chow and Mrs Chan try in their earlier quest to find out the whys and the hows their spouses could have gotten together, known each other, and started off the affair, but themselves vowing that they will never go down the same path.So in this vow already laid the foundations of how their friendship would be, and set a line in which their friendship could not cross nor develop into something more. And it's sometimes ironic too, that Mrs Chan, in her job, assists her boss in covering up his affairs. Kinda like a what-goes-around-comes-around.There are plenty of imagery throughout the movie that one could look into and try and interpret. I'd take forever in trying to list down all of mine, perhaps I'll do so one day when I own the DVD (saving to get my copy!), but I particularly liked the one at the restaurant where they finally learnt about their spouse's affair, and that long walk back home, where they walk, from out of step, into tandem. It's a becoming of 2 to 1, where lonely persons find solace in each other's company, especially in the scenes after.Anyway, all said, I love the movie, and it ranks up there with my all time favourites. If you were to watch it, make it none other than the Criterion Collection. (I'm not advertising for them, but I feel that this edition would help the viewer to appreciate the many rich layers more).

From Star Wars to Blade Runner and even to the likes of 1984 and V For Vendetta, the vast cityscapes and nightmarish dystopian vision of the future have set the template for generation after generation of writers and directors. Perhaps only Kubricks 2001 A Space Oddysey can claim to have such a profound influence within the genre. Inspired by Langs first impression of the Manhattan skyline, Metropolis is a seemingly utopian city of immense architectural grandeur and towering skyscrapers. Those who live in this city lead an opulent, almost decadent lifestyle. They are the thinkers of society and they have almost all that they could desire. Yet deep underground below them live the workers; men and women who toil slavishly in unrelenting ten hours shifts in order to sustain the city above. It is a hellish existence that emphasises the two-tier society that has developed through the creation of this futuristic Tower of Babel. The film centres around Freder (Gustav Frolich), the sensitive son of Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel), the all-powerful Master of Metropolis. The young Freder becomes infatuated with a saintly worker woman named Maria (Brigitte Helm) and descends down into the depths to seek her out. However, once down amongst the slaves and oppressive machinery, Freder is appalled by the hardship and suffering that he witnesses. He pleads with his father to do something about the conditions yet is rebuked. So instead he goes down once again and, after taking over a workers agonising shift, he attends a meeting of workers where the raging discontent amongst them is clear. The only person keeping them from revolution is the elusive Maria herself, who speaks of peace and of finding a middle way by using the films lasting mantra... There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator When Freder reveals himself, Maria believes she has found her mediator. Yet political machinations in the utopia above puts them in both in peril. Aware of the workers barely tempered disgruntlement, Joh Fredersen turns to his inventor friend Rotwang (Rudolph Klein-Rogge) to to kidnap Maria and to give a robot (or machine-man) a likeness of her in order to instigate a rising amongst the Workers which he can subsequently crush once and for all. It's a dangerous game to play, especially as Rotwang is quite insane and harbours his own duplicitous desires to bring down Frederson and all he has built. As the revolt begins and the Workers city starts to flood it is left for Freder and Maria to lead the children left there to safety and to ultimately reunite the hands and the head. Obviously the narrative is incredibly overblown and rather contrived, yet the story of the constant battle between the oppressors and the oppressed is a timeless one. This is never more apparent than Langs masterful blending of futuristic landscapes and machinery with surreal biblical, mythical and at times medieval imagery. The toil of the Workers is imaginatively illustrated in a sequence where they transform into slaves of the Pharaohs, whilst the heights of Metropolis itself are like opulent gardens belonging to Greek gods. The zenith of civilisation itself. Metropolis truly is a film, brimming with verve, energy and an abundance of invention and imagination. The acting may clunk a little and the moral may lack subtlety, but Fritz Langs far-reaching vision, be it artistic or philosophical, never once dwindles whilst the the final rampage of the oppressed is as spectacular and as exciting as anything Hollywood has ever produced.

What if they, despite looking exactly like your former loved one, were someone else?The film opens with Dr. Miles Bennell (an excellent Kevin McCarthy) returning to his small home town of Santa Mira after a medical conference. His nurse reports his surgery has been extremely busy while he was away, full of people claiming their close relatives or loved ones are being impersonated by a stranger.Our good Dr. initially thinks it's a curious form of mass hysteria, but he is soon convinced by a mysterious body that turns up at the home of a writer friend, a body that's the exact duplicate of the author...and then attempts to assimilate his mind and his memories while he is asleep.And from there the film's paranoia is given full force. Who can be trusted? Who has already succumbed? Or as Dr. Bennell says, somewhat playfully to his old flame Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) I'd hate to wake up one morning and find that you weren't you. Discovering that alien seed pods, drifting through space, are invading the Earth by assuming the shapes of its inhabitants,Miles and his fellow believers then face a desperate battle to escape the town and inform the authorities.Sequence after sequence utterly hooks the viewer, Director Don Siegel's efficient no-nonsense style adds to the convincingness of the plot. And the actors, especially McCarthy, are wonderful. I won't spoil things too much, but the moment of the kiss, and McCarthy's reaction to it, is one the most genuinely frightening moments in all cinema.Legend has it the film's narrative framing device was added before release; the producers were worried that the downbeat ending would alienate audiences.

Let's give it a go. Halloween is perhaps the best of all the slasher horror films that gives us the unkillable menace. John Carpenter works his magic by using point of view shots, spooky locations, atmosphere, lighting and darkness, a fantastic musical score and panning camera shots to give us the scariest but not goriest of all films of this kind. Halloween is far superior to the Friday the 13th movies which imitated it. Sean Cunningham does not have Carpenter's skill and went the cheap route by using more gore with Friday the 13th instead. This brings me to the point that gore itself does not make a great horror movie but suspense included with the occasional gory scene does.Back in 1963 on Halloween night a young six-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister after she has sex with her boyfriend. Cut to 15 years later on the night before Halloween 1978, Michael Myers escapes from the institution where he has been kept and returns to Haddonfield on Halloween to continue his murderous rampage on three unsuspecting teenagers who are babysitting for the night. One of the babysitters is of course Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Her name in the movie is Laurie Strode.Hot on Michael Myers tail is his doctor Sam Loomis, (Donald Pleasance in his most famous role) who wants to find him and return him to the institution before he kills again. Containing some of Donald Pleasance's most famous lines of dialog, Sam Loomis explains to the police, who are working with him to find Michael Myers, why he has to be found and returned.In this movie, Michael Myers is known as the shape. This of course is the perfect description for what Michael Myers really is, a specter of evil that is unable to be stopped because, as John Carpenter said in one conversation about the movie, you can't destroy evil. This is actually a great explanation because Michael Myers seems to appear out of nowhere like an evil phantom, kills, and then appears elsewhere to create more carnage. He does all of this while wearing a white William Shatner mask that is itself ghostly in appearance.Now to explain some of the technique Carpenter used to make one of the best and most famous slasher movies of all time. Using washed out colors for daylight and deep in-penetrable blackness for night, this adds to the spooky atmosphere of Halloween, making it look like fall even though I believe this movie's setting was done in California in the summertime. Other things used include panning camera shots which have things loom up in front of you almost out of nowhere. Sometimes it is a tree or some other distraction, but than sometimes it is the killer himself, usually the point of view shot when the killer is involved is from the back of his head and over to the left or right. This all adds to making the viewer uncomfortable, and that is the idea. And if all that wasn't enough, who can forget the fantastic musical score which is one of the most famous horror musical scores of all time along with Psycho's.Man I could go on and on about this movie. If anybody is ever a student of film and wants to do a paper on a slasher movie, Halloween would be a great movie to do it on. I'm surprised however that this movie is only rated a 7.8 on IMDP's score. It is a much better film than that. I know that the acting isn''t that great, but is is still better than the acting in the countless imitations that were spawned by it.

The capacity to tell a story visually without the need for words. The Last Laugh is probably the closest he came to achieving this ideal. It is a film of exquisite beauty that tells an incredibly moving story without the use of inter-title cards or dialogue to propel it. Well, there is one which the studio inflicted upon Murnau when it ordered the addition of a rather misplaced happy ending. Something I shall come to later. The tale is a simple but painful one. An ageing, pompous porter at a high class hotel (Emil Jannings) finds his World falling apart when he is demoted to the position of lavatory attendant. Stripped of his grand doorman's uniform and his pride, the porters life disintegrates as the humiliation of his new, lesser position dawns on him. Feeling unable to return to his home in such shame, he steals the uniform which means so much to him (and gives him an inflated sense of his own importance) and then proceeds to live a lie with his family and his neighbours by wearing it to and from work each day. Of course, such secrets can't stay hidden forever and eventually the awful truth is discovered. Returning to his apartment that evening he endures the mockery of those neighbours he once strode proudly amongst and, most heartbreakingly of all, he is coldly rebuked by his family for the shame he has heaped upon them. By this time he is near cataclysmic and he returns to the hotel to finally return his uniform as a broken man. This is where Murnau originally ended his tragic tale. And rightly so. The final images of a harrowed Jannings curled up motionless in a darkened lavatory fittingly capture the bleak reality of mans expendability and downward emotional spiral brought about by (false) pride. Yet the film does not end here. The studio insisted on a happy ending. As it is, the final fifteen minutes of the film completely jar with everything before. We learn through the films sole inter-title that the porter is left a vast inheritance by an eccentric millionaire who died in his arms and what follows is a sequence of opulent decadence as the now gentleman porter dines and entertains at the very hotel where he was previously employed. It's an unfortunate way to close the film and completely unnecessary. For what Murnau presents us with in those crucial seventy minutes of the porters tragedy is up there amongst his best work. Of course Jannings is massive in the central role. The non-use of dialogue meant that he had to convey every thought and every emotion with sensitivity and clarity. His transformation over the course of the film from a wide shouldered, straight-backed almost militaristic figure to a decrepit, shuffling, wild eyed old man is a testament to his talents as well as the make up department. Yet, it is the stunning expressionist camera-work which dominates this film. Beautifully designed and lit sets are seeming haunted by the use of moving cameras that roll through the shadows and windows and across apartment blocks whilst cameraman Karl Freund strapped his camera to his chest in order to achieve the films revolutionary POV shots. Similarly, the use of multiple and smeared lenses add a wonderful sense of of distortion to the films innovative dream sequence as well as an ingenious hangover sequence also. All in all, this is another fine achievement by one of the very few genuine geniuses of cinema. The studio imposed ending may jar more than slightly and some might find the story at worst a little weak or insignificant, but The Last Laugh is a film designed as an expression of Murnau's belief in imagery as a storytelling form. Something he achieves with undeniable success. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2006","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" F.W.

Murnau often spoke of his belief in pure cinema. The capacity to tell a story visually without the need for words. The Last Laugh is probably the closest he came to achieving this ideal. It is a film of exquisite beauty that tells an incredibly moving story without the use of inter-title cards or dialogue to propel it. Well, there is one which the studio inflicted upon Murnau when it ordered the addition of a rather misplaced happy ending. Something I shall come to later. The tale is a simple but painful one. An ageing, pompous porter at a high class hotel (Emil Jannings) finds his World falling apart when he is demoted to the position of lavatory attendant. Stripped of his grand doorman's uniform and his pride, the porters life disintegrates as the humiliation of his new, lesser position dawns on him. Feeling unable to return to his home in such shame, he steals the uniform which means so much to him (and gives him an inflated sense of his own importance) and then proceeds to live a lie with his family and his neighbours by wearing it to and from work each day. Of course, such secrets can't stay hidden forever and eventually the awful truth is discovered. Returning to his apartment that evening he endures the mockery of those neighbours he once strode proudly amongst and, most heartbreakingly of all, he is coldly rebuked by his family for the shame he has heaped upon them. By this time he is near cataclysmic and he returns to the hotel to finally return his uniform as a broken man. This is where Murnau originally ended his tragic tale. And rightly so. The final images of a harrowed Jannings curled up motionless in a darkened lavatory fittingly capture the bleak reality of mans expendability and downward emotional spiral brought about by (false) pride.

It's unfortunate too few films designed to thrill and excite follow the pattern.This very lean urban western tells the tale of several Los Angelinos of various colors trapped in a police station under siege by a faceless, ethnically mixed street gang that practices, I think, a form of nihilism. Except that isn't the whole story, which is precisely why this film is terrific. The actual siege doesn't begin until at least halfway through the movie, and, up until that point, Carpenter spends his time establishing his characters and building suspense. Until, as I said, the halfway point, Carpenter tells three separate stories--Bishop and Leigh babysit a vacant precinct; Wilson and Wells are being transported; and a man and his daughter are trying to find grandma. Ultimately, of course, these tales merge into the siege, but it is a wonder to watch it all come together. As I said, Carpenter is taking quite a bit from Rio Bravo, but the editing--the way in which he mixes the stories together--is incredible and leaves you breathless from start to finish. It is an incredibly paced film--one to which others should look for inspiration. Aside from the actual story telling, the framing and photography of the film is really superb. John Carpenter does not get the credit he deserves, I think, in these areas. He receives praise from all corners for his atmosphere and thrill-inducing direction, but no one comments on how amazing his films look (watch Escape from New York and tell me it's not gorgeously shot). Take, for instance, this film's shots of the gang members standing guard between two Do Not Enter signs or the framing of the scenes inside the precinct--they're so tight you cannot help but feel claustrophobic. Most importantly, Assault on Precinct 13 shows Carpenter at his most Romero-esquire. This means that, though dealing with a very conventional genre, he infuses it with social criticism and concern. Like Romero's first two Living Dead flicks, the protagonists from the start are black and female and the most sympathetic white characters are either a sniveling wreck of a man who not only lost his daughter but became a murderer or a hardened criminal. There is definitely an us versus them theme going on in this film as well,but, notably, it's not black versus white or good versus bad. The good guys have a criminal among their ranks, for instance, and they're busy protecting a man, who, though justified, committed a crime. Given the post-Watergate\/Vietnam era in which Carpenter filmed Assault, the moral ambiguity should not surprise anyone. Furthermore, that he doesn't proselytize and explain what's right and wrong--that he acknowledges that right and wrong can sometimes appear to be the same thing simultaneously--is to Carpenter's credit. Very few films are willing to reside, thematically, in such a grey area. It's a pleasure to see one that does. Assault on Precinct 13--intelligent and exciting--is a high watermark for American adventure film-making. Find it, watch it, and behold its brilliance.

Normally, film reviews discuss the basic plot of the movie and then the reviewer gives his (or her) opinion of it all, but this film requires so much more. ****SPOILERS ALERT**** It is clear that Jacob is in a struggle to hold on to his life and as Louis puts it so simply devils are tearing his life away. The film is filled with religious overtones that can be related to the biblical names of its characters. There is the constant tug of war between the angels and demons. For example, when Gabe says to Jacob don't go (after he tucks him in bed), this symbolizes Gabe's reluctance to let go of him and succumb to the demons. Other scenes give further insight to this and most involve the angel like figures such as Gabe, Sarah and Louis. But even the demon like figures such as Jessie (notice how she only wears black throughout the movie) is reluctant to let Jacob go. They want him stuck in this purgatory until he is able to make his peace. This explains some of the religious aspects but why the hallucinogenic theme? In my opinion, there may have been a case in the past when these types of experiments were ACTUALLY conducted on military personnel.

It's not really a 'great' film, or one that should be seen by all serious genre fans like Leon- The Professional was for crime films. But it's probably one of the most watchable science fiction adventures put to the screen in the late 90s, a kind of techno-punk version of Star Wars meant more for the late teens crowd than for everyone. It's story is simple enough- trying to retrieve some missing stones that will help save the world from a meteor or other about to collide and destroy everything, and the group of people who can stop it- that its the colorful, strange supporting performances and imaginative visuals can steal the show. Milla Jovovich, more than anyone, makes her mark as a real kind of 'breakthrough' role (i.e. I never really heard of her before the movie and for a while I thought of her as the '5th element' chick in high school). Her role doesn't require too much dialog- as she barely speaks English throughout most of the film. She's got the sexy look (PG-13 with nudity for the boys), lots of power in the fight scenes, and she can even work the emotional scenes to. I would probably take her work in this film over her other Besson collaboration in Joan of Arc, as here she takes herself seriously for what she is, and it still ranks as one of her very best performances so far in her decade long career playing roles like this.The rest of the cast, however, is a bit more hit or miss, though a little more hit than miss. Bruce Willis is his usually cynical, hard-edged self with remnants of John McClaine kicking around as an ex-officer turned cab driver who's recruited to take the '5th element' (Jovovoich) to get the stones and to the temple. Gary Oldman is very bizarre (see the 'blood' or 'sweat' or whatever trickle down his forehead during a tense phone conversation) as a villain who is a kind of pawn for the enemy, while also supplying weapon for a bunch of ugly creatures. Some of his scenes are the funniest, while being very creepy the whole while. Others like Tony Lister and Ian Holm are dependable as always in uncomplicated 2-dimensional roles. Only Chris Tucker gets pestering in his most flamboyant role to date (if that's possible) as the 'comic relief' in the form of a celeb host. I don't know if whether the character is really the problem or Tucker's interpretation, but I still feel those scenes are kind of distracting and below Tucker's comic skills.But as a pure action spectacle, you could do worse than the 5th Element, where it's a kind of future world with weird gadgets and items, all in a more Earth-bound perspective. The main battle scene in the opera is also on par with some of the better sequences in The Professional. Sometimes the themes are hit a little too often, repetitive if you will, like with Jovovich getting over-emotional (though her little lesson on the history of the world via computer is amazing). So it's not really as fantastic as Besson might think it is, yet every time it was on I didn't change the channel much; it's got that comic-book appeal where you know what will happen- of course in repeat viewings- but you want to stay tuned for the really nifty sequences and rewarding unconventional moments and lines.

Bruce Willis is his usually cynical, hard-edged self with remnants of John McClaine kicking around as an ex-officer turned cab driver who's recruited to take the '5th element' (Jovovoich) to get the stones and to the temple. Gary Oldman is very bizarre (see the 'blood' or 'sweat' or whatever trickle down his forehead during a tense phone conversation) as a villain who is a kind of pawn for the enemy, while also supplying weapon for a bunch of ugly creatures. Some of his scenes are the funniest, while being very creepy the whole while. Others like Tony Lister and Ian Holm are dependable as always in uncomplicated 2-dimensional roles. Only Chris Tucker gets pestering in his most flamboyant role to date (if that's possible) as the 'comic relief' in the form of a celeb host. I don't know if whether the character is really the problem or Tucker's interpretation, but I still feel those scenes are kind of distracting and below Tucker's comic skills.But as a pure action spectacle, you could do worse than the 5th Element, where it's a kind of future world with weird gadgets and items, all in a more Earth-bound perspective. The main battle scene in the opera is also on par with some of the better sequences in The Professional. Sometimes the themes are hit a little too often, repetitive if you will, like with Jovovich getting over-emotional (though her little lesson on the history of the world via computer is amazing). So it's not really as fantastic as Besson might think it is, yet every time it was on I didn't change the channel much; it's got that comic-book appeal where you know what will happen- of course in repeat viewings- but you want to stay tuned for the really nifty sequences and rewarding unconventional moments and lines.

It's not really a 'great' film, or one that should be seen by all serious genre fans like Leon- The Professional was for crime films. But it's probably one of the most watchable science fiction adventures put to the screen in the late 90s, a kind of techno-punk version of Star Wars meant more for the late teens crowd than for everyone. It's story is simple enough- trying to retrieve some missing stones that will help save the world from a meteor or other about to collide and destroy everything, and the group of people who can stop it- that its the colorful, strange supporting performances and imaginative visuals can steal the show. Milla Jovovich, more than anyone, makes her mark as a real kind of 'breakthrough' role (i.e. I never really heard of her before the movie and for a while I thought of her as the '5th element' chick in high school). Her role doesn't require too much dialog- as she barely speaks English throughout most of the film. She's got the sexy look (PG-13 with nudity for the boys), lots of power in the fight scenes, and she can even work the emotional scenes to.

If you have seen any of Ed Wood's movies, this is still completely bewildering. The film is both hilarious and tragic, yet it moves with a strange rhythm of its own that leaves one in no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during its running length. Wood, bless him, had some of the loftiest ambitions as a director, wanting to promote peace, understanding, and even acceptance, in the 1950s of all times. When Tim Burton recreated a viewing of Glen Or Glenda by studio execs for his biopic, he showed the execs laughing and telling each other that this had to be a put-on. More than fifty years later, there are still people fighting just to be given the kind of respect that the normal take for granted, so I say it most certainly is not.No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptitude Wood displays in composing his message. Directors frequently use stock footage when they can find some that suits their purposes, and can be edited to fit with their own footage. Ed Wood used stock footage indiscriminately, and Tim Burton's biopic celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood as played by Johnny Depp bets that he could make an entire film out of stock footage. Sadly, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he ever came. The IMDb states that twenty percent of this sixty-something minute film is stock footage, and it is never difficult to guess which footage. Footage of busy highways, planes flying overhead, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, they're all used in a haphazard manner, sometimes repeatedly, and they often only have a loose connection to the story Wood is trying to tell. Had Wood been able to sit back and think about what he is trying to do for a while, there is no telling what kind of heights he could have achieved.Wood himself appears in the film as the titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda.

Having found myself out on the fringe of a society that thinks I am disabled and need to be cured myself, I honestly found myself hoping for the best outcome for Wood's character. In order to make his point, however, Wood weaves in short stories of two other transvestites. One of them takes the extreme step of enduring a sex change in order to become a woman, the other finds himself so disenfranchised that he fears being arrested again so much he commits suicide. The scary thing about this film is that if you edited out the transvestism and substituted such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or such things as schizophrenia, very little of the film would even need to be changed. That is how little society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy.The other significant personality in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood shoehorned into the film. Speculation varies upon Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career, and would do anything in order to achieve this. With the exception of taking his time to carefully construct a good film, that is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood makes usage of Lugosi that was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as bizarre. Lugosi plays a character billed as The Scientist, but comes off more as an omnipotent puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood films before the biopic will think Tim Burton made up the beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep speech. If anything, Burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in depicting Wood-ian dialogue. Nothing can prepare you for seeing the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious ranting during Plan 9 From Outer Space.Observant types will also note the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again, Burton dramatises her reaction to seeing the script for the first time, whereas the film portrays her as being accepting and forward-thinking. I cannot help but feel that Burton's portrayal is more accurate, as Fuller looks extremely uncomfortable in her role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to seem less talented than her cast-mates, if such a thing is possible. Whether Wood's direction was better-focused in this case than usual is hard to determine, but if the ability of the support cast to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is any guide, then it should come as no surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role within one other Wood film. That she went on to write a number of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood would appear before the camera again, it was never as more than a cameo, a walk-on, or a bit-part.I gave Glen Or Glenda a one out of ten.

Strangely enough, despite all of these advantages aiding the movie, and it still turned out to be just a step above what one could generously call terrible. The Devil's Own sports every possible modern storytelling cliché, the worst being the families shown at home in domestic life, which might as well have been cut out of a magazine they are so clean cut and utterly devoid of any sort of believability or imagination. (the scene with Brad Pitt's character's family as a child is painfully awful, the most unbelievable portrait of an on screen family I have seen to date) It goes without saying that the horribly americanized perception of Ireland and Irish customs is downright insulting, as is often the case, but it seems so much more defined and offensive here. Director Alan J. Pakula seems to be trying to make three different movies in one, and have absolutely no idea as to how to tie them together or maintain any sort of continuity or plot flow. The Ireland subplot is likely meant to provide motivation for Brad Pitt's IRA terrorist character, but seems completely at odds with the story of Harrison Ford's painfully stereotypical troubled, world weary cop character back in the States. The concept of the terrorist just by chance happening to go and stay at the house of the police officer who is hunting him down is just plain unbelievable, and doesn't come off as at all clever and ironic as the screenwriters intended it to be. Instead, it is groan worthy, as are most of the incredibly contrived plot twists and goings on in the story.Even on the acting front, the shoddy storytelling comes across. Despite the two major action stars being lined up, both give completely unremarkable and even downright bad performances, and there is the constant storytelling conflict as to which of them is the main character, as if the writers themselves could not decide as to which character was meant to be the protagonist. The rumour that Pitt had serious conflicts of interest with the director and script and in fact tried to dissociate himself with the film shines clear, as he seems to put next to no effort into his performance (his Irish accent is cringe worthy, one of the worst attempted accents in film history to date, which is ironic considering his hilarious performance as an Irish Gypsy in Snatch 3 years later) as if he just wanted to film his scenes and leave. One can't blame him, as it seems he was the only one in the whole film who seemed to understand how badly the film was turning out to be.But Ford, the other bankable action star seems to at least be putting some effort into a believable character, but his policeman character seems so dull and uninspired that we as an audience find it completely impossible to empathize with him in any way. The supporting characters seem to be extras rented off the street for all the acting experience they seem to have at all, and most supporting characters seem barely necessary for the progression of the horribly weak storyline at all. (one still wonders at the end what was the point of including Natascha McElhone's character - a potential love interest for Brad Pitt left half written perhaps?) It's just another front on which the movie demonstrates how little substance there is to it at all, and how weak and clichéd it really is. Overall, it seems fair to say that you should not consider The Devil's Own exactly recommended - not to those who would rather enjoy themselves watching a movie anyway. For those who have a preference for weak, extremely poorly and disjointedly written scripts with completely archetypal characters, lazy and absent minded directing and even some good old fashioned bad acting, you have found your movie. But there are so many other suspense thrillers out there, superior in almost every aspect, so when looking for an enjoyable movie to rent, it would not seem at all presumptuous to pass on The Devil's Own, leaving it to fall back into the domain of poor movie hell in which it belongs.-3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 July 2006","score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" With two such stars as Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt attached to the project, and a political hitch to the storyline involving the Ireland terrorism subplot, The Devil's Own seemed poised to be the year's most powerful and thought provoking, as well as probably very entertaining and income churning action film.

The Devil's Own sports every possible modern storytelling cliché, the worst being the families shown at home in domestic life, which might as well have been cut out of a magazine they are so clean cut and utterly devoid of any sort of believability or imagination. (the scene with Brad Pitt's character's family as a child is painfully awful, the most unbelievable portrait of an on screen family I have seen to date) It goes without saying that the horribly americanized perception of Ireland and Irish customs is downright insulting, as is often the case, but it seems so much more defined and offensive here. Director Alan J. Pakula seems to be trying to make three different movies in one, and have absolutely no idea as to how to tie them together or maintain any sort of continuity or plot flow. The Ireland subplot is likely meant to provide motivation for Brad Pitt's IRA terrorist character, but seems completely at odds with the story of Harrison Ford's painfully stereotypical troubled, world weary cop character back in the States. The concept of the terrorist just by chance happening to go and stay at the house of the police officer who is hunting him down is just plain unbelievable, and doesn't come off as at all clever and ironic as the screenwriters intended it to be. Instead, it is groan worthy, as are most of the incredibly contrived plot twists and goings on in the story.Even on the acting front, the shoddy storytelling comes across. Despite the two major action stars being lined up, both give completely unremarkable and even downright bad performances, and there is the constant storytelling conflict as to which of them is the main character, as if the writers themselves could not decide as to which character was meant to be the protagonist. The rumour that Pitt had serious conflicts of interest with the director and script and in fact tried to dissociate himself with the film shines clear, as he seems to put next to no effort into his performance (his Irish accent is cringe worthy, one of the worst attempted accents in film history to date, which is ironic considering his hilarious performance as an Irish Gypsy in Snatch 3 years later) as if he just wanted to film his scenes and leave. One can't blame him, as it seems he was the only one in the whole film who seemed to understand how badly the film was turning out to be.But Ford, the other bankable action star seems to at least be putting some effort into a believable character, but his policeman character seems so dull and uninspired that we as an audience find it completely impossible to empathize with him in any way. The supporting characters seem to be extras rented off the street for all the acting experience they seem to have at all, and most supporting characters seem barely necessary for the progression of the horribly weak storyline at all. (one still wonders at the end what was the point of including Natascha McElhone's character - a potential love interest for Brad Pitt left half written perhaps?) It's just another front on which the movie demonstrates how little substance there is to it at all, and how weak and clichéd it really is. Overall, it seems fair to say that you should not consider The Devil's Own exactly recommended - not to those who would rather enjoy themselves watching a movie anyway. For those who have a preference for weak, extremely poorly and disjointedly written scripts with completely archetypal characters, lazy and absent minded directing and even some good old fashioned bad acting, you have found your movie.
