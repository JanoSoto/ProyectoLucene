Indeed, with its bloody finale clearly inspired by The Godfather as Walsingham takes care of business for his Capo di tutti Capo, it's almost a mafia movie, with Cate Blanchett's star-making turn as Elizabeth filling in the Michael Corleone role as the heir apparent who must ruthlessly shed emotions and conscience to hold on to the throne. That journey from fresh-faced youth to impregnable white-faced icon gives the film a solid emotional arc that helps prevent it from becoming a simple series of confrontations and thwarted conspiracies, almost - but not quite - turning it into a tragedy of success rather than the usual tragedy of failure that is usually the lot of women in historical pictures (Anne of the Thousand Days, Mary Queen of Scots, Lady Jane, La Reine Margot, etc).It's handsomely cast Joseph Fiennes gives good shallow romanticism as Elizabeth's lover Dudley, Christopher Eccleston in his default misery guts mode makes a fine villain and there's a healthy cast that, if not bursting with A-listers, is at least filled with familiar faces, from Richard Attenborough, Fanny Ardant, Daniel Craig and Vincent Cassel in a dress to Edward Hardwicke, Kelly McDonald, James Frain, Emily Mortimer and Eric Cantona. Yet perhaps even more than Blanchett it's a magnificent Geoffrey Rush who often dominates the film from the sidelines as the Queen's loyal and utterly unscrupulous spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, a man who can seem all things to all men and women but is loyal only to her. Even when he's simply observing from afar he's a powerful presence in all the right ways, emanating a callous intelligence that is truly frightening.It's strange that the sequel has been attacked by the Vatican as anti-Catholic when this first chapter probably occupies a high place on Ian Paisley's Ten Best List, what with Kathy Burke's psychotic Bloody Mary burning Protestants and threatening to do the same to her half-sister and John Gielgud's Pope (earning fifth billing for barely two minutes' screen time) despatching Daniel Craig's priest to assassinate the Protestant queen not merely with his blessing but his promises of a welcome in heaven for any who help in the task. Not entirely inaccurate considering the many attempts by Catholic kingdoms like France and Spain to topple or assassinate Elizabeth during her reign, but a little more historical context might have been helpful for viewers not so familiar with Tudor politics and the causes and effects of the Reformation. It doesn't help that Michael Hirst's screenplay refers to Marie de Guise (Ardant) as Mary, Queen of Scots, leading some to assume she's THE famous Mary, Queen of Scots rather than her mother, but then the problem of just how much historical information you can include before it gets in the way of the drama is always a difficult one in a period film too little and you don't know what's happening, too much and you feel like you should be taking notes in case there's a test later. Instead, this is content to follow Elizabeth's rise at the expense not just of her enemies but also some of her early friendships, keeping it personal even as Elizabeth has to shed her own personality to create an icon a divided nation can follow. It's certainly not flawless, but it's never dull and often impressive.

But crime never pays. The consequences are deadly and now Michael, who always tried to protect his family, will understand too late about crime's consequences.Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction does it again. He creates a parallel world filled with beautiful Italian exteriors, classy camera angles such as in the infamous helicopter attack, and the never tensing opera climax. His directing skills never went away and he gives a unique looking style to the trilogy. The soundtrack is as beautiful, haunting, and dark at the same time. It's just as good as in the previous movies.The acting is glorious. Al Pacino delivers a dramatic performance and takes Michael to a whole new level that we didn't see in previous films. He displays regret, sadness, fury, and even a diabetes attack. All his emotions are powerful and demonstrates why he is the spinal cord of the trilogy. I will never forget the scene where he gets a first diabetes attack and curses against his enemies, and figures out what was going on. Also, when he is in the need to eat a candy or drink orange juice; that's acting. Also, it broke my heart his last crying and how he screamed after his daughter's murder. Diane Keaton is just fine but do not add anything special to the movie, that's my take. Andy García is one good looking guy and delivers a brave performance in the likes of James Caan's Sonny in the original. Joe Mantegna is an actor you have to love, he's charming and plays his part perfectly. I didn't care for Talia Shire's acting, it was wooden in my opinion. The same goes for Sofia Coppola who delivers an extremely wooden performance. She didn't display the most powerful feelings correctly. I always wonder, how would Winona Ryder be in that part?. Richard Bright plays Neri in such a class act that you just don't forget him. The rest of the cast is excellent.The cinematography and art direction is just fine and displays the early 90's artistic techniques.The plot is complex but easy to follow and deals with politics, religious authorities immersed with crime, betrayal, loyalty, power, but in the end, everything is summed up with a single word business.But getting out crime has it's deadly consequences. Crime never pays. The consequences derive in assassinations, conspiracies, church's dark interests, and more.The addition of Vincenzo Corleone added fresh air to the series mainly because he is very different from Michael. It was like bringing back Sonny but in a younger and more clever version. It was also a manner to connect the last chapter with the previous films.Important events from previous films play an important part in Michael's fate. He feels guilty and regrets for Fredo's murder. Anytime he listens to a Hail Mary, dark memories invade his mind. Also, he knows how to deal with Vincent because he perfectly handled Sonny's impulses and raging reactions. It was nice for the fans to hear constantly the name of Vito Corleone, Sonny, and more. Plus, it's always a pleasure to see Al Neri and the rest of the Corleone allies such as Don Tomassino, Calo, and more. Heck, even Johnny Fontaine returns for a last singing! Plus, Michael's children now grown up play an important and vital part. Anthony and Mary are Michael's most appreciated treasure. Special mention for Bridget Fonda's super sexy appearance. I love blondes with long legs and beautiful face.This time, the Corleone's enemies do not represent such a big menace in terms of menacing looks or violent ways. The new enemies are more clever and cold blooded. Except for the thrilling and spectacular helicopter attack; we don't get much shootings as in previous films. That's when we learn that crime is more dangerous through briefcases, tables, and church. Don Altobello was the perfect nemesis for Michael; he is wise, knows who to convince, and pulls the strings masterfully. Joey Zasa is a regular gangster in the likes of Don Fanucci and do not represent a threat for the Corleones. The Vatican Bishop and Lucchetti, a strict-right moralist who is against the Corleone's immersion into religious business. He's by far the most menacing enemy. But we also need to remember about Mosca, a Sicilian capo that is widely known for not failing an attack.There are memorable scenes in this movie, beautiful, haunting moments. The family photo at the beginning of the movie displays that family means union and it's Michael's treasure. Michael dancing with Mary, Vincent counterattacking an assassination attempt, the infamous and sad opera attack, the helicopter attack, the filling of Zasa, Tommassino's sad murder, Mary's murder, Al Neri's final display of his skills, Vito's childhood home visit, and of course, the top three Godfather moments Michael's last thoughts that deal with the important women of his life, then, he dies alone. It's just as haunting as the flashback in part II which features him eating alone, thinking, planning his future.The last Godfather finds death in such a sad but poetic manner.

We don't know exactly about our main character's mental illness, we only know that he's a Nam veteran.An analysis derived from Travis mental status would through tragic clinical results, but from the social point of view, we wound find a troubled man who tries but cannot enter a society that is under a difficult transition that includes politics, violence, and underworld situations.Is Travis misunderstood or is it that society is blinded by social supposed rightness? In Trvis mind, it's OK to take your love interest on a first date to a porno cinema, he also believes it's adequate to be some kind of savior for prostitutes, and he also thinks it's normal to plan an attack against an important politician.Travis got the looks but he was extremely insecure about his behavior and about his mental state. Society didn't give him an opportunity because nobody spent the necessary time with him. Maybe he was just a lonely men who deserved company.Anyways, this is an excellent film that displays the dark side of human behavior. Martin Scorsese creates a dark yet insecure and disturbing environment where Travis wanders and tries to fix it his own way. That's where Scorsese deserves special recognition; for displaying a terrifying underworld where his main character fits perfectly.The acting is top notch. DeNiro steals the show and not only because of his badass display (some infamous scene are thrown like the glorious you talking' to me?). He gives a solid dramatic class act that goes from insanity, to jealousy, extreme violence, through and awkward behavior.

In that respect, this film is way ahead of its time--and perhaps still so, 70 years later.In the late 30s when every British citizen was expected to do his or her duty without questioning orders, this film dared to present the notion that it's the individual who must think for himself, hold himself accountable for all errors, and never pass the buck as just following orders.

We also understand that this (debatably) infringes upon our civil liberties. Since then, dozens of films have warned us of the dangerous extent that technology can take us to, and that rubs off some of the sheen for government agency thriller-lovers trying out Enemy of the State today as opposed to over ten years ago.A great movie is never dated and Enemy of the State definitely is, with Will Smith's hunted character Robert Dean getting all angry at Gene Hackman's gibberish description of a GPS, which is secondhand knowledge for first graders these days. We all know the power of satellites and how the government can bug anything with a mic, tracer or camera. In 1998, we didn't. So there's little novelty to this movie for anyone well-versed in post-9\/11 thrillers -- even for those who've seen more recent Tony Scott-directed films. Enemy must then hinge more on its story, which it didn't when it was released, and the story is just average. It's a bit unfair to what was probably a better movie in its day, but time is one of film's most challenging tests.Starring Smith when he was riding high off of Independence Day and Men in Black, Enemy is about a lawyer who accidentally comes across evidence he doesn't know he has that would expose a giant murder cover-up by that National Security Agency. Naturally, the NSA, led by Jon Voight, wants it at any cost, and using all sorts of technology strips Dean of everything. This convinces him to start running, where he eventually crosses paths with a former NSA tech (Hackman), who represents his only chance of shaking them off.Though the originality of the film fades with age, what improves is the who's who in the cast. In addition to Smith, Hackman and Voight, small roles are played by Jason Lee as the guy who plants the evidence on Dean in the first place, Jack Black as a tech servant of the NSA, Barry Pepper as an NSA field op (Saving Private Ryan), Jamie Kennedy, Philip Baker Hall, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne (The Usual Suspects) and Scott Caan (Ocean's Eleven).Enemy is your typically fast-paced thriller with the government going after the lone fox. It's a bit on the longer side, but it moves quickly at most points. Its only a weak story as far as drama and relationship. Dean's relationship with his wife (Regina King) throughout all this and their history of him cheating on her with Bonet one time years ago pops in and out and breaks the over-arching concept that should be driving the movie Dean wanting to figure out what the hell is going on. He doesn't seem to wise up to pursuing that answer until much later on.Dean's relationship with Brill, Hackman's character, also feels forced and pointless. They have a I need you as much as you need me moment in the second half of the film, but when Hackman doesn't even show up for the first hour, you can't legitimately believe it's true. At this point, the film almost tries to switch into buddy action movie when it's much better as just a techno-thriller. For 1998, the concept of a thriller where an average upper-middle-class lawyer suddenly gets thrust into a nasty chase with the government would definitely be an appealing one -- it would be an easy character and situation to empathize with. But while team heals all, it definitely hurts some movies and particularly those with weak stories containing patchy subplots.

The fight about that, that immediate moment, that emotional bruise that will not heal, will never heal. And in the anger, the seething recriminations, there is the weight of a lifetime of unspoken words coming to the surface, words held back and now refashioned as weapons. Then there is someone at the door. Perhaps another figure in their grueling play, someone who will change the dynamic, ratcheting up the intensity or soothing the animosity. Instead, it is a complete outsider, oblivious to their tragedy. It is a child, a girl going door to door, selling candy bars. For a moment the drama stops as the husband quietly and politely makes a purchase, helping this girl in her fund raising. No matter how devastating a moment may be for those who are in it, the outside world continues moving unimpeded and sometimes its path will trundle through. Life intrudes.That passage exemplifies the strength of Todd Field's feature directorial debut, In the Bedroom. Based on an Andre Dubus short story, the film bears a plot that invites heaving melodrama. There are plentiful examples of other films that tread similar ground, and wind up unbearably portentous. That is not the case here. The film is still undeniably heavy and grave, largely unleavened by any sort of levity or even hope. It is grim and bereft. However, it avoids becoming merely manipulative, largely due to the attention to detail. Every frame of the film feels real, often painfully so. This is because of the intricate examination of the people who move through it, and the heartfelt performances of every actor on screen. But is also because of that uncommon reminder of the ceaseless progression of the world outside of our pain. We're so used to seeing films where characters are the center of the story, to the exclusion of any reminders that anything exists apart from their reactions, their incidents, their devastation. But that, of course, is not the way the world really works. Life isn't a series of plot points. It is a vast, continuous process. It doesn't pause because of a loss, or shift into overdrive because of a crime. Intense moments don't eliminate the quiet moments. They coexist, sometimes side-by-side, and sometimes simultaneously.

As is often the case when someone follows that particular career trajectory, he is especially generous to those he casts in the film.

Far fewer will slow down enough to show a choir teacher enjoying a satisfying practice by her students, smiling kindly as the final note softly fades. It is a mistake to bypass these details, because the quiet pride taken in that moment tells us something about the character that brings more meaning and feeling to scenes that follow. Sissy Spacek plays it with great care, and as much conviction as she brings to the bigger, bolder scenes. She is bringing us the totality of the character, knowing full well that each bit of her&#x96;the rigidity, the fragility, the nurturing instincts&#x96;informs the whole.

One thing I always liked about Robert Redford was that he didn't sell out his integrity for a cheap blockbuster big-payday, unlike say Newman and McQueen in The Towering Inferno. That said this movie belongs along with the likes of the former's Buffalo Bill and The Indians and the latter's Tom Horn as an example of film-making for film-making's sake and is all the better for its artistic integrity.Here, pretty-boy Redford is deglamourised to the extent that for most of the film he's heavily be-whiskered and if he seems less like a grizzled mountain-man than one might have wished (the originally cast Clint Eastwood raising intriguing possibilities), nevertheless in a difficult eponymous role, requiring lots of physical exertion and correspondingly little verbal expression, Redford convinces you of his character's veracity from the off and holds the viewer's attention all the way through.Along the way of course, he encounters a few eccentric characters, which adds to the richness of the narrative and is teamed up for a long time, until their bloody demise at the hands of the avenging Black Crow Indians, an almost mute pair of companions, one a Flat-head Indian squaw to whom he's affianced in near enough a shotgun-wedding and the morose young son of another victim of the Black Crow whom he takes in.The film thus, especially in the first half, moves along in near silence, at its own pace and invites the viewer to get to know this individual character, get under his skin as it were and moreover take in the fantastic snow-covered mountain scenery he inhabits. I had absolutely no problem with this, finding much to admire in director Pollack's beautifully shot cinematography as well as the quality of the acting. An actor's hardest task, it seems to me, is to convey emotion without words and this Redford does superbly throughout especially in the heart-breaking scene when he comes upon his slain adopted family.Despite his orneriness, Johnson does build up a series of interesting relationships with a variety of differing personalities he meets along the way, the last of these being the hard-won respect of his nemesis, the Black Crow leader he encounters throughout the movie. The film also subtly proffers a pacifist message which I would imagine was not quite on-side with the prevalent US Government of the day.Okay, I could have done without the mediocre folk-balladry which regularly interspersed the action and would counsel patience to potential viewers as the movie finds its feet, but can state that those that do will be rewarded with a brave, uncommercial work offering an insight into a long-vanished arcane world peopled with real characters in a time and place far removed from the comfort-zone of this particular city-dweller.

That said this movie belongs along with the likes of the former's Buffalo Bill and The Indians and the latter's Tom Horn as an example of film-making for film-making's sake and is all the better for its artistic integrity.Here, pretty-boy Redford is deglamourised to the extent that for most of the film he's heavily be-whiskered and if he seems less like a grizzled mountain-man than one might have wished (the originally cast Clint Eastwood raising intriguing possibilities), nevertheless in a difficult eponymous role, requiring lots of physical exertion and correspondingly little verbal expression, Redford convinces you of his character's veracity from the off and holds the viewer's attention all the way through.Along the way of course, he encounters a few eccentric characters, which adds to the richness of the narrative and is teamed up for a long time, until their bloody demise at the hands of the avenging Black Crow Indians, an almost mute pair of companions, one a Flat-head Indian squaw to whom he's affianced in near enough a shotgun-wedding and the morose young son of another victim of the Black Crow whom he takes in.The film thus, especially in the first half, moves along in near silence, at its own pace and invites the viewer to get to know this individual character, get under his skin as it were and moreover take in the fantastic snow-covered mountain scenery he inhabits. I had absolutely no problem with this, finding much to admire in director Pollack's beautifully shot cinematography as well as the quality of the acting. An actor's hardest task, it seems to me, is to convey emotion without words and this Redford does superbly throughout especially in the heart-breaking scene when he comes upon his slain adopted family.Despite his orneriness, Johnson does build up a series of interesting relationships with a variety of differing personalities he meets along the way, the last of these being the hard-won respect of his nemesis, the Black Crow leader he encounters throughout the movie. The film also subtly proffers a pacifist message which I would imagine was not quite on-side with the prevalent US Government of the day.Okay, I could have done without the mediocre folk-balladry which regularly interspersed the action and would counsel patience to potential viewers as the movie finds its feet, but can state that those that do will be rewarded with a brave, uncommercial work offering an insight into a long-vanished arcane world peopled with real characters in a time and place far removed from the comfort-zone of this particular city-dweller.

At age 75, Kurosawa puts his own style into Shakespeare's King Lear, the descent of a once great king into utter senility, and the result is a deeply personal and tragic film of great beauty and wisdom.His second Shakespeare samurai adaptation, (after Throne of Blood in 1957, which drew on MacBeth) Kurosawa tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji a famous, revered and aging ruler in feudal Japan who after a bad dream is stirred into abdicating his throne to his sons, Taro, Jiro and Saburo. He gives full control to his eldest, Taro, though his youngest, Saburo, tells him it's a horrible idea and as a result gets banished. Sure enough, Hidetora is denied the respect of Taro when he takes power and wanders off in search of the son he exiled to seek redemption as the elder brothers shred apart his kingdom in attempt to have it all to themselves.Ran is a beautiful film despite the Shakespearian tragedy. Filmed in Kurosawa's style of three simultaneously rolling stationary cameras, it rarely gets in close to the scene and appears to have the style of much older films, save the color. Kurosawa, who's known for painting his story boards, brings this contemporary abstract color to the film by using the three primary colors (yellow, red and blue) to represent the three sons (their respective armies all wear those colors.) The colors are bright and show the division between the brothers -- each distinct yet capable of mixing. Even the blood is bright red paint as opposed to anything more realistic, suggesting how unnecessary the bloodshed is.The film borrows a lot of Japanese tradition in telling a Western story, which in the past always seems to work well. Borrowing on traditions of Noh theatre, allusions to animals like the treacherous fox and the make-up on Hidetora (frequent Kurosawa collaborator Tatsuya Nakadai) is suggestive of Noh techniques that resemble iconic masks that represent characters with certain qualities. Nakadai excellently uses the facial expressions so crucial to Japanese theatre in his incredible portrayal of Hidetora as he goes from confident and powerful to completely lost.It's a meaningful story for Kurosawa to tell at this point in his career, having much of his films in the '60s and '70s pass by unnoticed and in that time attempt to take his own life. Kurosawa takes his bleak look at human nature with Ran, using weather like always to show the coming storm of bloodshed and tragedy. I am lost ... Hidetora says as they wander about, and Kyoami the fool replies such is the human condition. It's apparent where the story will go and Kurosawa delivers it as only a master can.

Now that we've got out of the way one of the most awful opening theme songs any Western has been cursed with (sung by Frankie Laine), let's talk about one of the best-crafted Westerns Hollywood ever made...a fine example of getting the job done superbly and without phony flash, burdensome moral lessons, extra hormones or intense acting. 310 to Yuma is the real goods. It's the short, unadorned story of Dan Evans (Van Heflin), a poor, stubborn rancher in the third year of a drought. He needs water. He needs money. His wife loves him and works as hard as he does. He worries how she's able to put up with all the misfortune. His two young sons look up to him but he'd like to leave them with a memory of him of more than just a hard-working failure. When they're out rounding up cattle the three witness a stagecoach holdup. The youngest boy wants his father to stop the holdup and capture the robbers. He knows with young certitude his father could do it all. Dan tells the boys to be quiet. As played by Van Heflin, we accept Dan's integrity and his earnest desire to do something for his family. It's also the story of Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). He and his gang rob anything they can get money from. Wade makes it a point of pride that he kills a person only if there were no other way to protect his own safety. Ben Wade is intelligent. He's charming, tough, and knows how to get around a woman or get inside a man's head. As played by Glenn Ford, we're nearly captured by star charisma and likability. We know Ben Wade is a smart, sly villain, but we admire his confidence and smiling way of undermining another man's confidence. Dan Evans, desperate for money, agrees for $200 to take the captured Ben Wade to Contention, where he'll put him on the 310 train to Yuma and the Yuma Territorial Prison. Ben Wade knows that his gang will sooner or later figure out that he's being taken to Contention to await the train. He even tells Evans how they'll find out. When they show up and rescue him, they'll kill Evans and anyone helping him. This taut, simple story is told with economy and tension. There's no angst or acting, no allusions to the director's favorite causes, no close-ups of the make-up artists' skill at creating blood clots. In fact, there's not much bloodshed or violence until Dan finally has to find a way to get Ben from the hotel in Contention to the train station, where the train is waiting, and where so is Ben Wade's gang. Although there are some fine subsidiary performances, the movie is all about Evans and Wade. And that means that Heflin and Ford had to be at the top of their game to sustain this 92-minute movie. Dan Evans is a man much like Heflin's Dan Starrett in Shane. He's more resourceful than we might think, but mainly he's an honorable, earnest man who might be tempted by Ben Wade's coaxing tongue, but not for long. He wants the $200 for his family and because he knows he's doing the right thing. Unlike the 2007 remake, there's little question but that his wife loves him and that his two sons look up to him. Glenn Ford rarely played bad guys (watch him in Lust for Gold), but he makes an outstanding one here. His shooting of two men at the start of the movie, one of them a member of his gang, is fast and startling. But it's Ford's winning personality that makes Wade so attractive and so dangerous. Maybe sometimes, when he dallies with a tired, pretty barmaid, he even believes some of what he says. A good deal of the movie is spent in a hotel room in Contention with Wade in handcuffs lying on the bed and Evans holding a shotgun, peering uneasily out the window looking for signs of Wade's gang. The interplay between Ford and Heflin - easy and underplayed - is a pleasure to watch. Ford shows how he can worm his way into Evans' mind, undermining his will and raising doubts. Heflin shows how tempting and frustrating just thinking about what Wade is saying must be. The final shootout is well-staged and violent; the conclusion is satisfying. There are no attempts by rich Hollywood directors and producers to bring Tinsel- town tragedy to a good story. There are echoes of High Noon, which the craftsmanship of this movie and the performances of Ford and Heflin quickly dispel. There are a few clichés that are handled so respectfully, so matter-of-factly and so quickly that they are easy to forgive. The budget for 310 to Yuma (1957) was probably, even in 2007 dollars, less than Russell Crowe's salary alone in 310 to Yuma (2007). If you like movies and appreciate well-crafted stories, 310 to Yuma (1957) might find a place in your collection.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller, Western"},{"date":"16 August 2009","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a film I've seen many times and I don't remember ever seeing it quite like I did today. For the most part, my memory of the film, prior to today's screening, recalled the film's basic plot outline but failed to recall the nitty gritty details that make Point Break a superb action flick. I don't ask much more of my action movies other than they be thrilling, engaging, and entertaining, and Point Break offers all three of these attributes in heavy doses. Upon first glance and on the surface, this is a conventional action movie that manages to raise itself above the norm thanks to fantastic direction from Kathryn Bigelow, incredible stunts, solid performances from a set of A-list actors (both then and now), and several plot twists, all of which add up to make Point Break one of the better action movies of the 1990s.Keanu Reeves portrays Johnny Utah, a rookie FBI agent fresh out of Quantico who is eager to please and get his feet wet. He is paired with a veteran agent with an attitude, Pappas (Gary Busey), and is immediately put on the case of a string of high-profile bank robberies committed by a quartet of men dubbed The Ex-Presidents, so named for the masks they wear as they commit their crimes (we see Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon Johnson). Pappas suspects the criminals are surfers based not only on tan lines seen in surveillance camera footage but also on the fact that the robberies only occur in the summer months, leading him to believe that the robberies are connected to the procurement of monies to fund winter surfing expeditions elsewhere in the world. With only one month left before they suspect the string of robberies will conclude until the following summer, Utah goes undercover into the world of surfing and meets Tyler (Lori Petty), a girl whom Utah convinces to help him learn to surf after she saves him from a near-death experience on the waves. Once deeper into this world, Utah, through Tyler, meets Bodhi, a world-class adrenaline junkie who accepts Utah into his gang. Utah's loyalties, ambitions, and emotions will be tested as he finds himself deeper and more involved in this seemingly innocent corner of the world where not everything, or everyone, is as it appears.There's quite a bit to like about Point Break for action\/adrenaline film enthusiasts. Keanu Reeves, before he was Jack or Neo, was Johnny Utah in Point Break, a role which put him on the map of action stars and paved the way for him to star in the biggest hits of his career. For as much flack as he gets, he's simply perfect in this role; his persona and demeanor are without equal for the Utah character, and he brings to the role a fantastic screen presence and chemistry with his co-stars, notably Patrick Swayze, also in one of his better roles, but this is not necessarily one of his better performances. Both actors are a natural fit for the film; everything from their appearances to their mannerisms and to their grasp of the underlying tones and conflicts of the story, not to mention their fantastic ability to put on a great show during the various action sequences, help set Point Break apart from other, lesser, dime-a-dozen action vehicles. Also appearing are several actors of note, including John C. McGinley and Tom Sizemore in a cameo appearance.Of course, director Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction, eye for action, and keen sense of how to effectively weave a first-rate story is the foundation upon which Point Break is built. Bigelow does a fantastic job in creating a tense, exciting action movie. She knows how to handle the various surprises the movie throws at the audience with unflinching authority, conveying every emotion and twist with almost unparalleled ease and grace, all the while maintaining the tense, blood-and-guts, gritty feel of the movie. Point Break reveals its secrets far earlier than most action movies do, both to the audience and to the characters, and this is perhaps the best aspect of the film. It dares to be different in many regards, this being the most engaging example. It breaks formulas and conventions without isolating itself or pretending to be anything but a slick, well-paced, exciting action flick. All of this combined with its first-rate stunts and sequences (including two fantastic skydiving sequences, the first of which is easily the best sequence in the film thanks not only to its fantastic visuals but also due to the perfect placement of the exciting yet laid back music that accompanies it), Point Break is an action movie lover's delight.

For the most part, my memory of the film, prior to today's screening, recalled the film's basic plot outline but failed to recall the nitty gritty details that make Point Break a superb action flick. I don't ask much more of my action movies other than they be thrilling, engaging, and entertaining, and Point Break offers all three of these attributes in heavy doses. Upon first glance and on the surface, this is a conventional action movie that manages to raise itself above the norm thanks to fantastic direction from Kathryn Bigelow, incredible stunts, solid performances from a set of A-list actors (both then and now), and several plot twists, all of which add up to make Point Break one of the better action movies of the 1990s.Keanu Reeves portrays Johnny Utah, a rookie FBI agent fresh out of Quantico who is eager to please and get his feet wet. He is paired with a veteran agent with an attitude, Pappas (Gary Busey), and is immediately put on the case of a string of high-profile bank robberies committed by a quartet of men dubbed The Ex-Presidents, so named for the masks they wear as they commit their crimes (we see Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon Johnson). Pappas suspects the criminals are surfers based not only on tan lines seen in surveillance camera footage but also on the fact that the robberies only occur in the summer months, leading him to believe that the robberies are connected to the procurement of monies to fund winter surfing expeditions elsewhere in the world. With only one month left before they suspect the string of robberies will conclude until the following summer, Utah goes undercover into the world of surfing and meets Tyler (Lori Petty), a girl whom Utah convinces to help him learn to surf after she saves him from a near-death experience on the waves. Once deeper into this world, Utah, through Tyler, meets Bodhi, a world-class adrenaline junkie who accepts Utah into his gang. Utah's loyalties, ambitions, and emotions will be tested as he finds himself deeper and more involved in this seemingly innocent corner of the world where not everything, or everyone, is as it appears.There's quite a bit to like about Point Break for action\/adrenaline film enthusiasts. Keanu Reeves, before he was Jack or Neo, was Johnny Utah in Point Break, a role which put him on the map of action stars and paved the way for him to star in the biggest hits of his career. For as much flack as he gets, he's simply perfect in this role; his persona and demeanor are without equal for the Utah character, and he brings to the role a fantastic screen presence and chemistry with his co-stars, notably Patrick Swayze, also in one of his better roles, but this is not necessarily one of his better performances. Both actors are a natural fit for the film; everything from their appearances to their mannerisms and to their grasp of the underlying tones and conflicts of the story, not to mention their fantastic ability to put on a great show during the various action sequences, help set Point Break apart from other, lesser, dime-a-dozen action vehicles. Also appearing are several actors of note, including John C. McGinley and Tom Sizemore in a cameo appearance.Of course, director Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction, eye for action, and keen sense of how to effectively weave a first-rate story is the foundation upon which Point Break is built. Bigelow does a fantastic job in creating a tense, exciting action movie. She knows how to handle the various surprises the movie throws at the audience with unflinching authority, conveying every emotion and twist with almost unparalleled ease and grace, all the while maintaining the tense, blood-and-guts, gritty feel of the movie. Point Break reveals its secrets far earlier than most action movies do, both to the audience and to the characters, and this is perhaps the best aspect of the film. It dares to be different in many regards, this being the most engaging example. It breaks formulas and conventions without isolating itself or pretending to be anything but a slick, well-paced, exciting action flick. All of this combined with its first-rate stunts and sequences (including two fantastic skydiving sequences, the first of which is easily the best sequence in the film thanks not only to its fantastic visuals but also due to the perfect placement of the exciting yet laid back music that accompanies it), Point Break is an action movie lover's delight.

The movie sports a few genuinely funny moments, Robin Williams being Robin Williams in one of his better roles (and at his peak), and the movie represents your typical 1990s comedy flair perfectly, blending laughs with timely messages about the realities of family life, not necessarily winding up the way the audience expects (Doubtfire's feel good ending not really so happy as we might expect, but then again, that's life).Daniel Hillard is a talented voice over actor with a moral compass and a loving father to his three children. When he throws a birthday party for his son without his wife Miranda's knowledge, she takes it as the last straw and divorces her husband. At the custody hearing, the judge only allows Daniel to see his three children every Saturday, definitely not enough time in Daniel's mind. When he discovers that his wife is looking for a housekeeper, he employs the help of his brother Frank to transform him through body suits, a wig, false teeth, make-up, and glasses into an aging English housekeeper dubbed Mrs. Doubtfire. His uncanny acting skills put to the ultimate test, Daniel manages to get the job and fool his wife and children completely. He must deal with his court liaison, find a job, learn to accept (or choose to harass) his ex-wife's new boyfriend Stu and learn how to keep house, all the while maintaining his secret identity.It had been so long since I last watched Mrs. Doubtfire that I had forgotten the film was directed by Chris Columbus. As soon as the movie started, I could feel the Columbus touch even before his credit popped up on the screen. The only thing that seems to be missing is Macaulay Culkin as one of the kids. The movie screams 1990s through and through, though it is not my favorite comedy of the decade (not even my favorite Columbus movie of the decade, that title going to Only the Lonely). Still, Mrs. Doubtfire has its moments, mainly any time the Doubtfire character appears on-screen. Williams has definitely nailed the performance (and his make-up artists received a well-deserved Oscar for their work), his character rightfully a show-stopper. Despite the fact that almost every scene seemed important and added to the story, after the first hour or so I had to resist the urge to fast forward to the next scene featuring Mrs. Doubtfire. Still, Mrs. Doubtfire is charming enough to warrant a watch, and even if parts seem dull, it moves fast enough to be entertaining.

But the galaxy was AT peace until the Rebels started fighting FOR it. The Empire are so powerful star systems bowed down before them but what exactly does this mean? Why must empires be synonymous with evil, like corporations? There is really no difference between the Empire and the Alliance, except the costumes were shinier and the music was scarier.In EPISODE I, slavery is condoned - in a political system long before the Empire came to prominence. Did the Alliance fight to stop slavery? No. By EPISODE VI, there are still no salient issues they are fighting for. I guess that's why they're called Rebels, for the mere act of rebelling. We are told they are the good guys unquestioningly; blindly. And you know what happens then - religion is invented.Cue the Jedi.Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears to Luke and rationalizes his lie about Vader killing Luke's father by saying, So what I told you was true... from a certain point of view. With steam comin' outa his ears, Luke retorts, A 'certain point of view'? The story of STAR WARS Compleat is a certain point of view. And if the Empire runs business networks and trade routes galaxywide, in defeating them, the Alliance would only throw galactic business into disarray. But then, Luke and his pals are only dethroning figureheads. Like any corporate machine, it could run automatically until new figureheads are in place. Now I'm all for keeping order in the galaxy, through the use of reasonable taxes, the trade federation and the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet &#x96; it's the freakin' REBELS throwing things out of whack with their spies and ersatz princesses and wookiees wearing no pants.Climactic action is split into three parts - Han and Leia on the forest moon of Endor ally with Ewoks (were these things meant to be cute or annoying?) to nullify the Death Star's deflector shield; Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and a puppet lead a space battle against the Imperial star destroyers; and on the Death Star itself, Darth Vader (now a good guy who only wants the best for his son) must stop Luke doing Burt Lancaster impressions in front of the Emperor, who is having just too much fun being fey.In space, the dogfights continue like Spitfires against Messerschmitts.At the end of the day, the Empire only lasted about thirty years, from EPISODE I to EPISODE VI. The Jedi would constantly pule about some chosen one bringing balance to the Force (meaning Darth Vader) while the Sith would sneer that the Dark Side was stronger (meaning Darth Vader). Both hokey religions were wrong. But no one seems to notice.The biggest mind trick the Jedi ever played on us was making us believe George Lucas knew what he was doing. No doubt RETURN OF THE JEDI is exceptional stuff, with John Williams's orchestral score once again simply magnificent, the best effects money could buy, the broad strokes of redemption, friendship and unity amidst the matte paintings and explosions; yet ROTJ is full of gaping holes, ignorant non-science and silly rationalizations, which no amount of authorized websites can re-imagine into sensibility.I'd go through all the asinine plot holes and physics anomalies, but - as some gutless pilot once wailed, There's too many of them! --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

The girls even threw towels at her while she was crying and having her period. When the gym teacher; Miss Collins sees this happening, she forbids them to go to the prom. Sue Snell, who was throwing towels felt bad and told her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen, one of the girls who hates Carrie plans a terrible revenge that involves pig's blood and asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan to help her. Prom night; Carrie and Tommy are having a wonderful time and (for some reason) win prom King and Queen. After they celebrate, the blood is dropped on Carrie, and the bucket drops on Tommy's head and kills him. Soon, everybody laughs. What Chris and Billy didn't know was that Carrie had telekinesis and uses her powers to kill just about everyone in the gym. Later, Carrie's mom tries to kill her, but Carrie kills her mom and their house falls in and kills Carrie also.

Schmaltz drips, the schlock never stops, the characters are two dimensional, the acting frequently over the top, the dialog corny - all as noted by other reviewers. Yet the film works. Why.First, a word about the special effects they may not meet todays CGI 3-D standards, but even when not entirely believable, they remain visually impressive. And Los Angeles (a personality-less city lacking a memorable skyline) always looks best when it's getting destroyed.Second, the pacing It's just about perfect, with an intense drive that never goes out of control. When confronted by the schmaltz or a line of corny dialog, we aren't given the chance to smirk or cringe, we're pushed into the next moment, on the edge of our seats to see what happens next, even when we know what happens next. There are plenty of shocks and chases and explosions to keep us from noticing the film's weaknesses while watching it.Finally, about the characters as noted, 2-dimensional. Unfortunately, most Americans just happen to be 2-dimensional, and the shrewd Pal (who actually tried for a higher aesthetic in his early animation shorts) quite rightly presents characters that are very much like his intended audience, thus increasing the paranoia-derived fear of the alien and of total destruction that, curiously and unfortunately, Americans so enjoy that most of our heartland culture is built around it.Being American, I'm not happy admitting that; but understanding it allows me to both enjoy the film and recognize its brilliant craftsmanship.
