Sturdy, apparently heartfelt adaptation of Louisa M. Alcott's popular book by Oscar winners Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman was reportedly worked on by many other, uncredited talents; they have managed to retain the Victorian stateliness of the novel--as well as its playful and daydreamy-romantic spirit--though too often the sequences are episodic, and weighed down by the stilted nature of the dialogue. George Cukor directs in a forthright manner which avoids treacly sentimentality, yet the picture is still a tough weeper adorned with variable performances and acting styles. As Jo, the backbone of the material, Katharine Hepburn glows with effusive life; she hits some bad notes on occasion (and Cukor too often reverts to Mona Lisa-like close-ups of Kate to create a mood), though the actress is a magnetic presence and holds together what would otherwise be a skittering narrative. Not so fortunate are Joan Bennett as self-centered Amy, Spring Byington as Marmee, and Edna May Oliver as Aunt March, all of whom are distinctly artificial. Jean Parker is a worthy Beth, the doomed pianist, and the men in the cast fare very well, particularly Henry Stephenson as the neighboring Mr. Laurence and Paul Lukas as a German professor. The make-up in the early scenes is extreme, as if from the silent-era (it seems to tone down as the film progresses), and there are too many characters entering and exiting to make the picture an emotional triumph. It has many fine moments, and Hepburn's admirers should not miss it, but the overall effect is more Hollywood than Massachusetts. **1\/2 from **** ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Four New England sisters and their Marmee hold down the home-front during the Civil War, with the eldest of the clan, tomboyish Josephine, slowly realizing her ambition to become a professional writer.

If you want detailed accuracy about the Beatles, this is not for you. Read the books. But if you want to see a film which tells a good story well, and which will give you a real feel for the vibes of the time and for the characters it claims to portray, and an insight into one important aspect of the early history of the Beatles, I think you will enjoy this. I thought I wouldn't, but I did. And I will watch it again. And, did I say? it's about the Beatles.This is not a biopic, nor does it pretend to be, but it does claim to tell the story of Stu and Astrid, and I thought it did that very well. I don't object at all to the use of some artistic licence, such as Astrid's excellent English. Contrary to some other reviewers, I found the portrayal of the quiet, enigmatic Stu by Stephen Dorff quite excellent, a perfect foil to the bitter, sometimes thoughtful, and wholly charismatic John Lennon, portrayed just as well by Ian Hart.I first heard the Beatles just before their first British record Love Me Do became a minor hit in Autumn 1962. This film portrays events mostly more than a year before then, and even longer before their last stint in Hamburg, at the Star-Club in December 1962, the subject of a famous amateur recording. Apart from the Polydor recordings by Bert Kampfaert, we have little to judge objectively what the band sounded like in 1960-61, but judging from the 1962 live recordings, and the comments of those who heard them before they were famous, I'm quite prepared to believe the Beatles sounded then very much like the band used for the soundtrack to this film. OK, the band aren't the Beatles, and some of the details are a bit askew, but the rock-and-roll standards portrayed were all part of the Beatles' act, and are performed much as they performed them. Everyone tells how Stu Sutcliffe often played turning away from the audience, as often seen in the film. It's hardly a realistic portrayal of the Hamburg clubs on the Reeperbahn in the early 1960s, but I've seen worse, and if you have little idea what life was like for the band before 1962, this will not be a bad introduction.Comparisons with A Hard Day's Night are ingenuous that was a film made by the Beatles early in 1964 after they were famous (in Britain at least); this is a film about the band when they were teenagers, before pretty much anyone knew them outside Liverpool and Hamburg. Not the same at all. And of course, they didn't sound back then like the Beatles' later recordings, or even like they did on their tours of the US and elsewhere. Perhaps the only recording you can really compare is their first album Please Please Me (and the live Star-Club recording, if you have it).It's a film, for goodness' sake. I enjoyed it as one, and I hope you do too. The characters rang true, especially Ian Hart as John Lennon, and the story is well worth telling, and well worth watching.

Sounds like a winning combination to me! The movie is fairly light hearted, putting laughs over scares or logical progression. There were times when I saw the window wide open to do some very dark humor, and I was slightly disappointed that they didn't take those opportunities. The main family members do decay as the movie progresses, as I felt the sister and the father were stronger characters before the plot showed up, and I blame the plot for that. CActing I was excited to see Billy Zane's name in the credits considering I'm a big fan of his work. Sadly, he has a somewhat small role as the 80's dumb boyfriend. At least he does it well. The star of this movie is the kid, played by Scott Grimes, who plays a very confident little crazy-prepared pyromaniac. Outside of the horror genre this kid would probably be seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis, but it works here. Don Keith Opper annoyed me, which is probably a bad thing considering he's in all four of these movies and since I've started down this path I'll have to watch them all. Overall, the acting department gets a B.Direction This has the feel of a children's movie, a little cheesy but with a punch to it. The direction neither offended me nor impressed me, and I'm searching for things to say about it. That sounds like C level to me.Visuals The visuals still work to this day, which I consider to be a high compliment to an 80's special effects movie. The critters have a great combination of cute, yet menacing (I won't say scary, but slightly intimidating). The space ships look cool and the two bounty hunters are a visual highlight of this movie. A Overall Critters is a fun entry into the silly horror genre that I think most kids would be all over and most parents would enjoy with the proper mindset. It's fairly safe, its got some dry humping but no nudity or real sex, some blood but not obscene amounts, and I don't recall any major profanity being dropped. The only real setback for parents would be the need to explain to their children that it is not okay to make bombs in the barn, despite the fact that it worked out for the kid in this movie.
