The plot jumps around too much, the characters are the least interesting thing in the whole movie and the middle part syndrome of storytelling hits it quite badly. You've already established the characters in the first film, yet the big climax has to wait until the third. So what else is there to be done except character building. And the movie is awful at that, as already stated.I think that the biggest problem has to be that there is absolutely no chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, playing Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, respectively. This is supposed to be something huge. A romance that tore the galaxy apart and doomed the entire Jedi Order, yet it feels exactly like what it is. Two young adults, teenagers quite honestly, falling to their hormones. Oh yeah, that has Star Wars written all over it. And I could buy that, possibly, if I could even buy the fact that these two even like each other. But they don't. Especially Padmé spends most of the film being visibly annoyed by Anakin, which I'm not sure was the intention. I think Portman simply had problems with the role, which is a shame because she can be really good in the right movie. I'm also annoyed that Padmé was reduced to this from the tough infiltrating, gun-toting, droid-destroying badass that she was in the first film.But there is some good stuff as well. I still like Ewan McGregor a lot as younger Obi-Wan Kenobi. He has some hokey scenes as well, but I think I'm more inclined to blame the script rather than him in this case. Because in most scenes his dry wit is the only thing holding those scenes together. And naturally we have Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who effortlessly hits just the right amount of over the top to remind us of the original trilogy. Because those weren't serious film, not really. They were deep enough to be taken seriously, but their tone was that of an adventure, of myth.Plus, the special effects are still awesome, even today. The music is very, very good. And it's actually very cool to see the original stormtroopers. Kudos for that.But, when it comes down to it, it's only an average movie at best.

They're not meant to be Oscar winning material.My favourite Friday the 13th movie is pt2 but this comes a close second. I have the DVD version of this film and was disappointed by the lack of extra features. There is only a teaser trailer, but the picture and sound quality is very good. The beginning scene in the graveyard is very creepy, and when they do a close up shot of Jason staring at the viewer it scared the hell out me. Thats what surprised me, as Jason Voorhes doesn't usually scare me. But this time he did. He's not so scary in the rest of the film, it was just the graveyard scene. The movie had some funny moments too, my favourite being the paintgun scene, a lot of people thought this part was silly, but its actually quite amusing. The acting isn't great but who cares? It doesn't spoil the film at all. The music by Alice Cooper is great, i especially loved the closing song 'The Man behind the Mask'. There is also some eye candy for the girls Thom Mathews, Tom Fridley, and for the boys Jennifer Cooke. Overall a fun movie thats entertaining, funny and has a great soundtrack.

It's basically an hour and 25 minute movie stuffed with filler to make it twice as long. For example, a man merely getting off his horse and approaching someone to talk is made out to be an epic blow-your-mind event. Absurd. I'm not saying it's not a good movie; it is and it has numerous attributes, like the great cinematography, outstanding cast and hypnotic score. So it's definitely worth watching, but you have to be prepped for an epic, slow movie that's more of a piece of art than a piece of entertainment.Fans of the film defend its slowness on the grounds that it's an allegory of death. They suggest that the movie's always revealing and expanding itself until the last act, where it becomes clear how everything's connected. At this point the film becomes a catharsis as the plot points converge, ending with a duel. Then the picture loudly reveals its theme The death of the west, the death of gunslingers and the death of the myth. My response The death of the West and the gunslinger via the encroachment of civilization (here represented by the advent of the railroad) is a constant theme in Westerns, before and since this film. While it's a great theme for any Western, it was nothing novel in 1968. Speaking of 1968, that was the year 2001 A Space Odyssey came out, which is sort of the Sci-Fi counterpart to this film. Let me put it this way, if you loathe 2001 you'll probably hate this one too.Some say that Once Upon A Time In the West is very different from Leone's previous film, the iconic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly from 1966, but I see a lot of similarities The epic (overlong) length; the three main characters consisting of good (Bronson), bad (Fonda) and ugly (Robards); a fitting score by Ennio Morricone; and Leone's unmistakably mesmerizing style.Despite my honest criticisms, this is a notable Western and a one-of-a-kind film, highlighted by Bronson's laconic hero, Fonda's villainy, Claudia's curvy beauty and Robards' likable good-desperado. I can see why some hail it as an artistic masterpiece, but I can also see why others think it's repetitive and boring. My appraisal falls in between these two extremes, albeit closer to the former.The version I saw runs 165 minutes and was shot in Arizona; Moab, Utah; Sonora, Mexico; and Andalucía, Spain.GRADE B ","genre":null},{"date":"11 November 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Released in 1968, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is an epic story of a mysterious stranger known as Harmonica (Charles Bronson) who joins forces with a desperado named Cheyanne (Jason Robards) to protect a newly widowed ex-prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) from a ruthless assassin, Frank (Henry Fonda), who works for a railroad tycoon (Gabriele Ferzetti).As my title blurb amusingly suggests, this movie is really slow.

It might have been a better idea to make Charlie a deceased dude rather than integrate the name into Blanka. That's just me, but I don't think adding the name 'Charlie' means a whole lot since later games in the franchise introduce the actual character.

That's just me, but I don't think adding the name 'Charlie' means a whole lot since later games in the franchise introduce the actual character. Chun-Li on the other hand needs a more fleshed out insight into her story, that's all I want from her. Ryu and Ken who are naturally the poster children of the franchise are nothing more than two goofy side characters who go about switching alliances. They're pretty bland. To wrap this movie up, the movie is sure not a good adaptation of a video game but the movie is a good time if I want to have a bit of roast.

Not quite love at first sight, but the early scenes in the film have a quiet majesty and intrigue about them that's hard to deny. Costner's performance has a real core, and as the film expands in scope to include dozens of characters in an epic post-apocalyptic sprawl, Costner in his role as director generously allows the actors to really inhabit the space, creating strong characters nearly across the board.It's a long film, and it has several distinct sections with different mood the early laconic wanderer, then the bitter prisoner on a wild escape, and eventually we get Costner as a revolutionary organizing young people into ad-hoc postal committees to spread information and propaganda against the sadistic fascist regime of Bethlehem (Will Patton). The later parts of the film have a sort of Red Dawn vibe about them, with almost as much nationalistic flag-waving as Milius' film but less of a pro-military attitude. Costner takes his themes and his story seriously, which is admirable and certainly ambitious, but the whole thing is really too sentimental, particularly in the denouement. He has this obsession with slow- motion close-ups of people riding on horses past other people..... just cuz it looked cool in Dances With Wolves doesn't mean he needs to do it in every other shot. Although I'm sure her presence in the film did young Olivia Williams no good, her performance is credible and, again, Costner deserves praise for moving over and letting her steal a lot of their scenes together. Paxton is fascinating, but ultimately not gripping enough to be a great movie villain. It's a unique film in the post-apocalyptic genre because it has a lot more focus on character and mood than just about anything else I've seen, at least up to its time.

He hides Marion and her belongings, including the forty thousand dollars which she had hidden inside a rolled up newspaper, in the boot of her car and drives the car into a nearby swamp.Marion's disappearance prompts her sister, Lila, to start a police investigation.
