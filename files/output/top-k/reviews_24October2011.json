It was the only Superman film to be filmed by two directors. For this reason, the film is surrounded with controversy since original director Richard Donner had completed, by his estimation, roughly 75% of the movie in 1977 before being taken off the project and the remaining 25% completed by Richard Lester.In this movie,Superman is torn between giving up his super powers, confronting criminals from outer space, and having problems with his girlfriend,Lois Lane. When terrorists threaten to destroy Paris with a thermonuclear device as they hold reporter Lois Lane hostage, Superman comes to the rescue and flings the weapon into space. However, its blast outside the earth's orbit awakens Zod,Ursa, and Non,three villains from Superman's home planet of Krypton who were exiled to outer space for their crimes. Zod and his partners arrive on Earth and use their powers in a bid to take over the U.S., and then the world. However, when Lois realizes that mild mannered Clark Kent and Superman are actually the same person, he brings her to his Fortress of Solitude, where his decision to marry Lois costs him his remarkable strength. Thus the superhero faces a great conflict.The movie is a great follow-up to the first film considering that it retains all the delightful characteristics that the first movie has like adventure,tension,suspense and humor.Also,this one goes deeper into the love story between Superman and Lois Lane as well as the sacrifices each one is willing to go forward into their relationship.The performances were good from Reeve,Hackman,Kidder and the three Supervillains - who proved to be a great opponent to our Superhero. The only reason I am giving this one a 9\/10 instead of a 10\/10 unlike the first film is due to the fact that the other director,Richard Lester included numerous campy and comic relief moments to the film's disaster and eventually the franchise as shown in Superman III.But nevertheless,the other 75% work of Richard Donner was great as the original.

Its merit is to define with a powerful clarity the conflict between Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna (Meryl Streep) Kramer who have less in common the last name, than a sincere a profound love for their son, Billy (Justin Henry), both the victim of their divorce and the hostage of their fight for custody.But after several viewings, I find something subtly (and maybe deliberately) misleading in the way the title reduces the story to the trial while it's only the conclusion of a long learning and understanding process, from both sides. Yes, it's easier to root for Ted, as he's the one left by Joanna and jeopardizes his career to take care of Billy and Joanna's screen time isn't enough to bring more insights about the emotional crisis that lead her to leave her son.But the film doesn't ask for a bias, it respects the intelligence of the viewer enough to understand that if the story focused on Joanna, and took time to show what kind of husband and father Ted used to be, she might have gotten more support. But Robert Benton's thought-provoking Oscar winning script, invites us to understand the side we're not standing for, in a quest for the truth, which is so complex it can't be one-sided. This is the most compelling power of courtroom dramas to tell the truth, the whole truth, the only truth, yet it's so underused as most movie trials rely on an innocent vs. guilty basis, and the point is just to determine if the verdict will be fair.Joanna abandoned her home, renounced to her duty as a mother, in a sort of desperate existential impulse, then came back to ask for custody. Ted, while not the perfect father took care of Billy with what was at hands, and the whole film is about his learning of becoming a good parent. It's hard to believe this is not an open-and-shut case, but this is why I mentioned courtroom dramas with uncertain truths take 12 Angry Men, it's never about getting certitude but more about getting closer to a more reasonable approach, deprived from any emotional or sentimental bias.The bias toward Ted is reinforced through something clearly mentally unstable in Joanna's behavior, yet Meryl Streep's extraordinary performance brings a three-dimensional aspect to a mother, from the very first frames, make it absolutely impossible to believe she doesn't love Billy, or she is not a good mother. strong enough to understand the threat her mental state would have caused for her kid. Ted questioned the courage of Joanna for such a 'selfish' act, but he deliberately denies her desperateness. She felt she wouldn't be a good mother as long as her mind would be polluted by her hostility against Ted. Objectively, we can consider Joanna's act as necessary but immature.But Ted isn't a model of maturity either and his relationship with Billy indirectly highlights what kind of man he was. And it takes more than fidelity, than a job, to be a good father. Ted's mistake was basically to take many things for granted and wasted the most precious time of his life, trying to earn it. The point is not to judge if he's right or wrong but he clearly appears like a workaholic incapable to dedicate a time for anything but his work. In the first confrontation with Joanna, he's so blinded by his promotion he can't hear her telling she's leaving. When he faces the sad reality, he denies his responsibilities.And the collateral damage of these immature attitudes is Billy, the heart of the story. The movie realistically depicts the struggle between a father and a kid to reconstruct a relationship, and Robert Benton's direction admirably depicts the evolution through three important stages denial, anger and acceptance. Ted denies his part of responsibility, blames Margaret (Jane Alexander), the recently divorced friend who probably brainwashed Joanna with her feminist ideas and he even promises his boss that he wouldn't let this situation interfere with his job. Both Ted and Billy act as if it was a temporary situation.After the first letter confirming that Mommy will never be back (hence Ted's immediate decision to remove every trace of her presence), the anger can be perceptible as both understand they'll have to endure each other. And this state of anger escalates until the emotional highlight of the film, and its defining moment with the I hate you scene is the pinnacle of Ted's nightmare, and probably the only way he and Billy found to exorcise their fears and anguish, because after that, they understand that it's time to learn about living together. And Ted learns to become a part like Joanna used to be, a reality highlighted by his new friendship with Margaret.Kramer vs. Kramer is about two persons progressively understanding each other, after a reversal of roles. Joanna allows herself to be selfish, and enjoy a sort of freedom, to understand that this feeling would be worthless without the beautiful experience of motherhood. And Ted, for once, faced selfishness and learned about caring, about being patient, about struggling, in other words, becoming a good parent. Never patronizing, the movie depicts with an extraordinary realism, served by close to perfect performance, the documentary-like reality of divorce (three simple breakfast-making scenes illustrate the evolution of the father and son's cohabitation)Kramer vs. Kramer is the coming-of-realization story of two persons; trying to improve themselves in the name of their love for Billy and in fact, the love between them.

But no, of course it's far from a true scary movie really. The one thing that this movie has going for it is its originality but in all truth and honesty, that's more than enough for a movie of this sort.Having a child-sized doll as your killer is obviously a quite unique and original premise. And it actually works well. Having a doll as the killer prevents this movie from falling into the usual genre clichés and makes the movie more original than not with all of its horror\/slasher moments. Besides, the effects for Chucky are all convincing looking, so it actually looks like it's a real doll going berserk and goes on a killing spree, after a serial killer transfered his soul into the doll, right before he died. Not hard to see why he has become an horror icon over the years.And of course who better to play a maniac killer than Brad Dourif. Granted that he only is in the movie for a couple of minutes but he also provided the voice for the Chucky doll, or good boy doll, like he's officially called. The Child's Play series actually gave him lots of fame, even though he's only providing the voice of Chucky in the rest of the series.I would had probably still preferred it if the movie went along with its original idea of letting you in doubt whether or not the Chucky actually truly came to life or if perhaps it was the little kid who committed all of the murders. It would had given the movie an extra dimension, horror-wise but the went for the more straight-forward and perhaps also more safe road instead.

This was probably in part due to the fact that it was the most popular videotape of the year back in 1981. Like many films from that famous list, its really quite difficult now understanding why it was deemed so dangerous. Undoubtedly, this is a very violent film and that is certainly the main source of its notoriety.

The chief reason for this is that they change a little each time in a successful way that keeps the formula fresh. This first instalment is an out-and-out horror film, part two is a comedy-horror par excellence and the third adds a fantasy dimension to proceedings. All achieve what they set out to do. For me, the second film is where the series peaks, as it is the best combination of its two major strengths - the horror and the humour. Star Bruce Campbell and director Sam Raimi were the twin strengths of the second and third instalments. But the original film is really unquestionably Raimi's film.

Fair enough, some of the special effects towards the end are a little ropey now but what can really be expected for a film made on such a shoestring?

Its a testament to what can be achieved if the filmmakers have imagination and ingenuity. It was infamous initially as one of the most prominent members of the video nasties in the UK. This was probably in part due to the fact that it was the most popular videotape of the year back in 1981. Like many films from that famous list, its really quite difficult now understanding why it was deemed so dangerous. Undoubtedly, this is a very violent film and that is certainly the main source of its notoriety. But its just so fantastical and non-realistic that it makes you wonder if the moral guardians of the day had the slightest sense of humour. Yes, this is a splatter movie but its also a pretty kinetic piece of cinema. The Evil Dead is certainly one of the best examples of imaginative filmmaking on an ultra-low budget.The Dead films are one of the best trilogies out there. The chief reason for this is that they change a little each time in a successful way that keeps the formula fresh. This first instalment is an out-and-out horror film, part two is a comedy-horror par excellence and the third adds a fantasy dimension to proceedings. All achieve what they set out to do. For me, the second film is where the series peaks, as it is the best combination of its two major strengths - the horror and the humour. Star Bruce Campbell and director Sam Raimi were the twin strengths of the second and third instalments. But the original film is really unquestionably Raimi's film. Campbell hadn't perfected his knockabout comedy persona here, so its the visual invention of Raimi that the film derives its main strength from. There is a great eye for detail here such as the ominous thump of the swing seat on arrival, the malevolent POV camera-work of the unseen demon in the woods and the scary demonic girl in the cellar. Fair enough, some of the special effects towards the end are a little ropey now but what can really be expected for a film made on such a shoestring? All in all, this remains a very remarkable little movie that deserves its cult reputation. When you consider that everyone involved in making it was in their early twenties it makes it even more impressive bearing in mind how original and non-derivative it is.

After all, effects have to come from mood and atmosphere, not from the easy way out of the slash-and-bleed crowd. What's unusual here is that the lighting is not what you'd expect from a Gothic tale. Instead of the expected heavy gloom, many of the spectral effects occur in bright sunlight, such as by the lake or on the grounds. Then too, the daylight glare is often blinding, lending a different kind of boundary between the earthly and its opposite.

I never did until someone filled me in. Here, the sex angle is much more prominent than in the original, though it's a prime motivating force in both. Then too, it's truly unnerving to see Miss Giddens (Kerr) put a lip-lock on young Miles (is she kissing him or Quint?) My real concern, however, is one particular camera set-up that, I believe, changes the nature of the story.

In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.But no other Hitchcock film had more effect.

You couldn't be today's pervasive moviegoer Walking in late, you'd be waiting to see the star after she's disappeared from the action.

It's all owing to Hitchcock's imagination in two matters not as obvious The pure subjective telling of Marion Crane's story, and her rapport with her new host.

Only when discussion becomes personal does he begin to hesitate and sidestep. He evokes our empathy right alongside Marion's.Nearly every present-day viewer is spending that whole time anticipating the spectacle of murder in store.

Ferris is self-centered, manipulative, dishonest. He uses his friends and family. He hacks into his school computer. He commits identity fraud. But there is something so darn likable about the way Broderick plays Ferris, we don't hold any of that against him. He comes off as likable as any other literary trickster (more likable than some). One of the charming things Bueller does is break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience, sort of like his own Greek chorus. This way we willingly become co-conspirators in his misdeeds, and share the wonderful feeling that comes with shaking school off for the day and having a good time.At rock bottom, Ferris is just a boy who doesn't want to go to school. And it makes sense. Ferris does not seem to cherish a good education, but he is a whole lot smarter than anyone else, especially his drab teachers (one of whom is played hilariously by Ben Stein). By his talk of college, Ferris is probably making good enough marks, and having to sit through one tedious school day after another is wasting a good mind.After all, one of the things Ferris does is to look at Kandinskys in an art museum. A boy who goes to a museum when he blows off school rather than a brothel should not be forced to grind through boring school days that confine his mind. Oh, he also takes in a Cubs game (the film is set in the Chicago area).But Ferris' cleverness is not appreciated in all quarters. Because everything seems to come so easily for Ferris, his sister (Jennifer Grey) is envious. Knowing Ferris is faking sick, she becomes determined to blow his cover and get him in trouble -- not knowing he has taken off from the suburbs and is in the big city. Ferris is also being stalked by Mister Rooney, the principal (Jeffrey Jones, who turned in a wonderful performance as the emperor in Amadeus a couple of years earlier, and who is just as good this time around in a very different part). He has no proof, but he is certain he can catch Ferris Bueller malingering. So obsessive is he -- even though he has Ferris' mother's assurance her son is off sick and not being truant -- one feels Rooney and Bueller have a long history together, and it is not just this one incident that sets him off. Bueller's little games, we sense, have gotten the better of Rooney before.Can Bueller escape detection in truancy with his sister and Rooney both pursuing him? Can he get his friend's father's EXTREMELY rare automobile, which they have taken without permission, back home without a scratch? And will he and his pals get safely back from Chicago before their parents catch them?Loath as I am to bring in personal experiences, I'll admit I am the age of some of the actors in the movie. I was born in the year after Jennifer Grey and the year before Matthew Broderick (I'm also exactly Broderick's height). So even though they are playing teenagers, they were both well into their twenties; I was in grad school the year this film came out. Somehow, I missed it. I probably figured it was another dreary John Hughes teen angst flick. I only caught the movie in 2011, twenty-five years after its release; I may be the only fifty year old this movie speaks to. My philosophy in school was the same as Bueller's. And frankly, work for me has been nothing more than an extension of school. I have pulled many Buellers in my time without having a name for them -- which I will now regularly apply when I call in sick to have a good time.

It's a big drop from the first one - it's lifeless and not a crowd-pleaser. While it did receive a theatrical release, surprisingly, it has a chintzy Direct-To-Video look to it. It never inspires confidence when 95% of your movie takes place in one building. Yes, The Return, as we call it (we refuse to dignify this crud with the Universal Soldier name) is one of THOSE.Even from its silly opening sequence (which naturally involves rockin' jetskis), and throughout its many scenes with terrible music behind them, this movie is trying to be hip and cool, but fails. A great example of this is the character of Squid (Hinkley) - a radically-awesome drinker of Mountain Dew who loves his Frankenberry cereal. And speaking of characters that audiences can't possibly connect with, the choice to cast fitness girl Kiana Tom instead of a proper actress is just odd.

But the most glaring casting change involves the complete lack of Dolph Lundgren. Sure, we all love Goldberg, as much as anyone really can, but he's no substitute for the Dolphster. Surely even Mr. Lundgren, who's no stranger to DTV junk, read the script for this and headed for the hills.Not so for Van Damme, who looks tired and disinterested, even as he spouts his one-liners. Does anyone really want to see Luc Deveraux as just some normal dude - with a kid even? Surely a sign of this movie's status as a pale reflection of its forebear is, instead of the robotic monocle the Unisols wear over an eye in the first film, now they just wear Blu-Blocker Bono sunglasses.And while this movie is very dumb, and disjointed, and features some downright embarrassing steals from Demolition Man and Terminator 2, Michael Jai White ALMOST saves the movie. He puts in by far the best performance and seems dedicated to his role as the sinister SETH. But even despite his valiant efforts, he can't overcome the cruddiness within. But on the bright side, a character rides Goldberg down a flight of stairs like a sled. Yes, you read that correctly.The bottom line is, this movie is an obvious cash-in and simply doesn't need to exist. You might think, before watching this, Yeah! It's a Universal Soldier movie! Cool! - it's only natural to think that, but unfortunately, this movie doesn't satisfy those expectations.For more insanity, please visit comeuppancereviews.com ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"24 October 2011","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Charade is supposedly the result of Singin' In The Rain's director gambling his better hand on a Hitchcockian thriller.

All three are based on The Hunter, a 1962 novel by Donald Westlake. Hunter's novel was also adapted by Ringo Lam in 1992. Titled Full Contact, this version of the tale is an ultra violent Hong Kong actionerPoint Blank stars Lee Marvin as Walker, a thief who's shot and left for dead by his associates. What follows is a revenge plot in which Walker rabidly pursues both vengeance and the money he is owned. The film makes all the usual noir stops &#x96; informants, mob bosses, snitches, ex lovers, bars and bar-room brawls &#x96; before climaxing with our cast assembling around a much desired case of money.Marvin plays Walker as a force of nature, a relentless, violent, no-nonsense man. He says little and is supremely fixated on pay back. Broad-shouldered and unblinking, Marvin moves like a machine, inexorably closing in on his target. The film was directed by John Boorman, a director whose films tend not to age well.Point Blank's predecessor is Fritz Lang's The Big Heat, another film which found a macho man hell-bent on revenge. Coincidentally, Lee Marvin played a bit part in Lang's film as well; a low level mobster with a fondness for beating up women. Point Blank also resembles Melville's Le Samourai, a much better film released that same year.Upon release Point Blank was well received. Marvin took violent, macho stoicism to new heights, the film was shockingly violent and its use of several experimental, avant-garde techniques (elliptical editing, fractured time lines, abrupt, shockingly callous violence, discordant sounds, flashbacks etc) was deemed novel. The film's somewhat odd narrative structure stands out even today. It unfolds as the jagged dreams of a bleeding man, a criminal betrayed even by his dying fantasies. Forever cut off from the money he futilely chases, Walker is perpetually trapped in the mind-space of Alcatraz, always reaching, walking or lunging for that case of green he so manically desires.Actor Mel Gibson released a remake of Point Blank in 1999. Titled Pay Back, Gibson's film amps up the sadism, audacity, violence, relentlessness, sexism and macho determination of Boorman's film. In customary Gibson fashion, Gibson spends most of the film bleeding, battered or tied to a chair whilst being tortured. Gibson's sadistic streak and love for flagellation are given a self-conscious tinge, though, as the film has a comical subplot involving an S and M dominatrix.Regardless, Gibson's character, who makes Marvin's look like a wimp, is so determined to reclaim his money that he systematically works his way to the top of a massive criminal organisation, effortlessly knocking kingpins and mob bosses off one by one in an attempt to find someone man enough to pay him the cash he's owed. Because such films rely on the shock of transgressive violence, and because such cinematic shocks are always exponentially increasing or intensifying, Boorman's Point Blank looks positively tame and pointless today. Marvin knocks off some crooked cops and hoodlums, Gibson climbs a criminal empire. Pay Back was so knowingly, ridiculously extreme in 1999 that even today it packs a punch.Note that Pay Back exists in two cuts. Director Brian Helgeland produced a cut which was deemed dull and dour by Gibson. Gibson thus stepped in, altered the script, removed some scenes (ironic, a domestic abuser removing a wife beating scene), added a noir narrator and had much of the film re-shot, re-scored and colour-graded. Gibson then released his edited version in cinemas as the theatrical cut. Always a populist, Gibson's version sucked in the blood-hungry crowds. This theatrical cut is a violent, comic-book neo-noir which amps up its carnage and comedy. It doesn't take itself seriously and revels in its pulpy ridiculousness. Helgeland's director's cut, assembled years later but hampered because much of the footage necessary for such an assembly was lost or missing, in contrast plays like a straight, 1960s crime movie. Few director's cuts are so radically different from their theatrical releases. In any case, Gibson's theatrical cut, because its relatively unique in tone, is superior. Helgeland's cut too strongly echoes tamer crime dramas of the 60s.8\/10 - Worth one viewing.

With the success of Roger Moore's debut Bond film, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman sought to follow it up as a fast as they possibly could. This rush to follow up one success produced one of the least successful films of the series.Roger Moore follows up a good debut performance with a performance that is anything but good. Like Sean Connery in You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever, Moore's performance is basically sleepwalking his way through the film. His line delivery is flat virtually the whole way through no matter what the situation is be it facing down villains, seducing women or making any one of the horrible one liners. The result is one of the worst performances of any actor in the role.Much the same can be said of Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight. Goodnight embodies the very cliché of what a Bond girl is a pretty face and not an ounce of acting talent. She does little more in the film than whine about how Bond is treating her yet keeps trying to get into bed with him. Outside of this whininess and helping to get the last act of the film going, neither the actress nor the character add much to the film otherwise. The result is pretty close to the worst Bond girl ever.Much more interesting than either Bond or Goodnight is the villain Francisco Scaramanga played by Christopher Lee. Scaramanga is almost the anti-Bond he's suave, charming, seductive and a man who kills for money. Lee plays the role brilliantly, encompassing all of those aspects into his performance. This villain, in the hands of a lesser actor, could easily have been one dimensional, is instead a fleshed out character that is far more interesting than anyone else in the film. In fact, it's almost a shame that Christopher Lee never got the chance to be James Bond himself based on his performance here.The rest of the cast is almost a disaster. Virtually the entire cast is played for laughs whether it is Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack, Richard Loo's over the top performance as Hai Fat and of course the unnecessary, cringe-worthy return of Clifton James as J.W. Pepper. Soon-Taik Oh's performance as Lieutenant Hip is okay, but heavily undermined by some bad dubbing. Even the usual supporting cast members disappoint such as Bernard Lee's grouchy M. If there is a shining star of the supporting cast its Maud Adams as Scaramanga's mistress Andrea Anders who, like Scaramanga, outshines the rest of the cast. The result overall is one of the worst Bond casts yet assembled.The problem with the entire film is that it all feels rushed and lacks polish. The production design and cinematography are both good, but they lack something that worked so well in the previous Bond films. Maurice Binder turns in his first set of lackluster title sequences as well, further undermining the success of the film. Even the score from John Barry shows this lack of polish.

The score lacks Barry's usual lushness as it feels shockingly cramped and unoriginal. Much the same can be said of the title song as well. Barry is even guilty of taking the film's one truly good stunt piece and undermining it with a silly piece of music. Indeed, the entire film feels like it is being played more for laughs then for suspense, something that proves to be the undoing of it. Where does the fault of that come from though? Nothing else in the entire film is as big a culprit in that department then its script. It's a script filled with a lack of logic, overly convenient plot twists and bad one liner's.

Goodnight embodies the very cliché of what a Bond girl is a pretty face and not an ounce of acting talent. She does little more in the film than whine about how Bond is treating her yet keeps trying to get into bed with him. Outside of this whininess and helping to get the last act of the film going, neither the actress nor the character add much to the film otherwise. The result is pretty close to the worst Bond girl ever.Much more interesting than either Bond or Goodnight is the villain Francisco Scaramanga played by Christopher Lee. Scaramanga is almost the anti-Bond he's suave, charming, seductive and a man who kills for money. Lee plays the role brilliantly, encompassing all of those aspects into his performance. This villain, in the hands of a lesser actor, could easily have been one dimensional, is instead a fleshed out character that is far more interesting than anyone else in the film. In fact, it's almost a shame that Christopher Lee never got the chance to be James Bond himself based on his performance here.The rest of the cast is almost a disaster. Virtually the entire cast is played for laughs whether it is Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack, Richard Loo's over the top performance as Hai Fat and of course the unnecessary, cringe-worthy return of Clifton James as J.W. Pepper. Soon-Taik Oh's performance as Lieutenant Hip is okay, but heavily undermined by some bad dubbing. Even the usual supporting cast members disappoint such as Bernard Lee's grouchy M. If there is a shining star of the supporting cast its Maud Adams as Scaramanga's mistress Andrea Anders who, like Scaramanga, outshines the rest of the cast. The result overall is one of the worst Bond casts yet assembled.The problem with the entire film is that it all feels rushed and lacks polish. The production design and cinematography are both good, but they lack something that worked so well in the previous Bond films. Maurice Binder turns in his first set of lackluster title sequences as well, further undermining the success of the film. Even the score from John Barry shows this lack of polish. Compare the score for this film with that of You Only Live Twice, another Bond film set largely in Asia, to illustrate the point. The score lacks Barry's usual lushness as it feels shockingly cramped and unoriginal. Much the same can be said of the title song as well. Barry is even guilty of taking the film's one truly good stunt piece and undermining it with a silly piece of music. Indeed, the entire film feels like it is being played more for laughs then for suspense, something that proves to be the undoing of it. Where does the fault of that come from though? Nothing else in the entire film is as big a culprit in that department then its script. It's a script filled with a lack of logic, overly convenient plot twists and bad one liner's. After a suspenseful pre-credit sequence, the film becomes little more than a list of Bond film clichés that undercuts suspense for the almost two hours that follows right up to the point that it manages to undermine its own climax. Writers Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz, along with director Guy Hamilton, simply reuse the formula they used in the two previous Bond films with the result being stale and unoriginal.At the end of the day, it is easy to see how this film ends up being named one of the worst Bond films ever. Despite an excellent villain and at least one good supporting cast member, this is a film that embodies everything that can be bad about a Bond film. Bond himself is uninteresting, the girl is window dressing, it's played for laughs and it's utterly formulaic. The Man With The Golden Gun? More like a film made with fool's gold&#x85; ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"24 October 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is magnificent dripping with the type of evil that Shakespeare excelled at with the film's central antagonist (played by both Malcolm MacDowell and Paul Bettany) reminding me of Iago. Gangster No1 suffers from the deadly sin of Greed, evinced throughout by his lust for power and its material trappings. The title literally refers to the number one gangster of London. It is also the name of the character played by both Paul Bettany (as the young man) and Malcolm MacDowell (as the older man).Plot-wise a young man (Paul Bettany) brought into a gangster's fold (Freddy Mays, played by David Thewlis) connives to usurp the gangster and replace him become the number one gangster of London. Most of the dialogue of the character Gangster No1 is a narrative spoken by Malcolm MacDowell over scenes in which he is represented by Paul Bettany. MacDowell and Bettany play the same character at different ages because there was concern that Bettany's name alone could not carry the film as lead actor. Whilst this is understandable and MacDowell is good as the aged gangster it is also a mistake both in terms of continuity and because Bettany is better than MacDowell. Bettany is creative in how he portrays the evil psychopathy of Gangster No1. His stares, smiles and screams are frightening and disturbing. MacDowell is more obviously bad and does not quite gel with the more complex Gangster that Bettany plays.The film cleverly suggests much violence whilst showing very little. Much of the menace of the film is conveyed by what is not said in the conversations Gangster No1 has with others. The best example of this occurs when Gangster No1 interrogates Eddie about a meeting he has just had with Freddy May's rival Lenny Taylor. Gangster (Bettany) lays down an axe to which Eddie asks 'what's that?' Gangster tells him it's his 'favourite axe'. No more do we see or hear about the axe but it lies, unseen and unspoken of, for the rest of their conversation during which Gangster No1 interrogates poor Eddie. The film conveys well the corruption that eats away at gangsters like the main antagonist they lust for power, will do anything to achieve it, eschew love and are internally ugly. This particular gangster is also vain and arrogant with a lust for material wealth to emphasis his power and importance. Like a Shakespearian antagonist these cravings undo him.Hopefully this film will continue to attract new viewers not least because of Paul Bettany's performance, which is superlative and not for nothing drew the attention of other film makers\/directors. Bettany is also gorgeous in this too, which plays with the viewer as his character is so ugly.
