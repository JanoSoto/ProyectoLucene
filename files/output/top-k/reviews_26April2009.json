This movie illustrates that quite well. The Jarrett family (son Conrad, father Calvin, and mother Beth) live in an upscale neighborhood outside Chicago. We join the story six weeks after Conrad has been released from a mental hospital, where he stayed for four months after attempting suicide. Before the suicide attempt Conrad was an intelligent high school student who had friends, was on the swim team and in the glee club. Suicides, and suicide attempts, are often mysterious and it piques one's interest as to the motivations. Upon hearing such news the first question to come to mind is almost always Why? That is one of the hooks that keeps your interest in this movie--in a neat plot device we come to gradually understand the motivations behind Conrad's self-abnegating act only in parallel with his psychiatrist, Dr. Berger.The movie opens with a sequence of serene, melancholic images of the Jarrett neighborhood, with trees in fall colors. From that we segue into Conrad singing in the glee club with lyrics like, Free from all the world's desires free of all fear and anxiety sung to an arraignment of Pachelbel's Canon in D. We are shocked out of the reverie created by the opening scenes with a scene of Conrad in his bedroom being awakened in a cold sweat by a nightmare. Soon thereafter we get a brief flashback of a boating accident in a storm, presumably involving Conran. It is then that we realize that this film is going to have some complexities.In very short order we are thrown into the nitty-gritty of the Jarrett's family dynamics, which are difficult to say the least. We find out that Conrad's brother Buck was lost in the boating accident and that has precipitated a crisis in the family.Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is the most difficult to understand and sympathize with. By the time we meet her she is obsessed with public appearances and the privacy of her family, at the expense of honest communication. She has a clear image of how things should be and rejects any evidence to the contrary. The complicating issue is that, in a flashback, we see that she was open and affectionate with her son Buck. Was Buck the only one who could break through her rigid conceptions of how things should be, or was it that he just fit into her world-view? Was the way she dealt with her son's death to retreat into an obsession with trying to control her world? Does she have deep emotions and is afraid to let them out, or is coolness and a desire only to skate on the surface a defining personality trait? You are inclined to believe the latter when Beth makes statements to her husband like, Don't try to change me. If I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry. I'm me, this is my family. If we have problems, then we'll solve those problems in the privacy of our own home. Whatever the case, Mary Tyler Moore creates a striking characterization in her Oscar nominated performance. The hug that Conrad gives his mother toward the end has the be the most awkward ever recorded on film.Calvin (Donald Sutherland) means well but, until the crisis precipitated by his son's death forces him into it, he has never tried to piece together what is going on with his loved ones and how he can make a difference. He has never paid much attention to some fleeting concerns about Conrad. The crisis brings a lot of questions up for him and he struggles for answers. The crisis has changed him and watching the gradual changes brought on by his beginning to ask meaningful questions about himself and others is one of the delights of the film.Timothy Hutton is brilliant as the tortured Conrad. Seeing this performance by such a young actor almost makes you think that he could go on to be another James Dean--he truly shines in the most intense, dramatic scenes. Even though Hutton has had a good career, he has never achieved the status of superstar. Maybe that is not what he ever wanted, but he can be proud of this Oscar winning performance; he makes you care about Conrad as he works through his problems.Then there is Judd Hirsch as Dr. Berger. No Freudian stuff going on with him. No fancy office, no couch, no delving into early childhood complexes. Berger simply wants to address the problems at hand head-on. Would that we all had a Dr. Berger in our lives.Since this family could communicate only when repressed emotions boiled over, they were probably doomed from the moment of their tragedy. The film goes beyond the family in its analysis of the adverse effects of how social pressures restrain people from saying anything near the truth. When Calvin is asked at a party how Conran is doing, he says, Great, just great. Only under extensive questioning by Dr. Berger can Conrad come clean. And Beth seems unable to say anything to her friends more than what she thinks will present a good image.You don't want to unload your problems on people at every opportunity, but this movie makes the case that being as closed down as the Jarretts has serious consequences.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"26 April 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Paris, Texas is a film that encompasses so much human emotion and spiritual drive; a film that travels such sociological lengths within the human mind just as it does physically in space and setting. The film begins in a dusty and lonely desert location, but journeys from here to busy airports; to contemporary American suburbs to the highways connecting these places, to apartments in towering buildings and right on to sleazy performance houses located within the deep, deep crevices of large cities. The sense of travel is important; the sense of journey is apparent. One of my favourite scenes-come-shots in the film occurs when the film's lead stares out of his brother's garden overlooking a highway and an airport runway. No one says or does anything, the character just sits and observes all this activity going on as he forms thoughts in his head; thoughts linked to the fact he must conclude a certain journey he has begins to realise he has already undertaken.The film begins with a lone man walking through a desert, he is Travis Henderson (Stanton) and wears a rugged and unshaven look as he potters about in a smart, but dusty, suit. Eventually, his brother named Walt (Stockwell) drives out to meet him after being called out by an individual that comes into possession of Travis' wallet, and attempts to figure out what happened. Quite quickly, director Wim Wenders combines beautiful scenery; the bending and twisting of conventions when we see a formally dressed man in a place we don't expect to see a formally dressed man; and an element of mystery when it transpires Travis' memory is less than perfect and he's been out of contact for four years. Additionally, when asked what happened &#x96; Travis rejects the question, tiptoeing around it and further placing it on a back-burner. All that he does reveal, to begin with, is the explanation of the title; that being that he wants to own a small plot of land in Paris, Texas &#x96; something he's been observing via a small photograph for all these years. This gives the film an initial overall direction, or something for its mysterious, mute character to aim for.Part of the film's underlying effectiveness is the way Wenders allows us to slowly get involved with characters like Travis. Initially, the audience is invited to toy with a few ideas surrounding him. Do we think he's in trouble with someone? Is he on the run? Can we trust him when he's driving for Walt? Can we trust him when Walt (who knows about as much as we do at most points and thus; speaks for us, the audience) leaves him alone in the motel room as to not merely run off again? The answer to that last question is 'not really' and when it transpires Travis does run away from Walt's attempts at help, maybe we feel a little angry at him; a little frustrated that he's acting in this quite shut off and childish manner.But things change, and people branch out. It's interesting to note that when Walt does disappear from the text as the film nears its final third, Wenders is clearly signalling that he feels comfortable enough he has delivered the necessary information for us to form our own realisation of what's going on and allows Travis to take over as that character that drives the film; as a character that goes places, not randomly, but because he knows what he needs to do &#x96; we know what the situation is and away he goes. It's an effortless switch on Wenders' behalf; a master-class in directing as he delivers this long and drawn out story in the most humbling of manners but never, ever looses track of who's who and what their role is on the screen.The core of the film revolves around the sorting out of problems past; a sort of correcting of mistakes. But this is no film resembling a crude red marker-pen streak straight through several errors on a page, this is more a noting of mistakes made in a first draft before re-writing what should have been accomplished first time out in slick and effortless typography. Not knowing what transpires and why certain people are in the position they're in is 90% of the fun but what I will say is that a third party agent is involved and they're of a rather innocent variety. It is this agent that, when revealed, bridges gaps and enables certain personnel to take on certain responsibilities.Another key tactic in Wenders' delivery is Nastassja Kinski's character. Looking at some of the old posters uploaded here on IMDb, it seems there are a fair few detailing her character with the face of said person slapped all over the covers. But Wenders doesn't reveal what it seems he considers his prize jewel until much later on. I could say her name is Jane perfectly fine, but to mention her surname would be a spoiler of rather unfortunate consequence. Needless to say, she is connected. Paris, Texas is a rewarding experience. It asks us to find time to lend to those that come across as immediately eccentric or not of a 'type' we would immediately pay much attention to. It wants us to look at a person and look at a world through this person's perspective as we begin to realise those of an unspectacular variety might very well have a story of the spectacular variety, to tell.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"26 April 2009","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Going into a Coen brothers movie expecting something traditional is ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Any movie directed by the Coens is going to be severely warped in one way or another, either by approach (No Country for Old Men) or by their sense of humor (everything else).By all accounts, Fargo is a murder mystery, though it is anything but straightforward. This is not Law & Order. It's about a simple crime that spiraled way out of control for all the principal characters. That's understandable, since everyone populating this story is either hopelessly inept or hopelessly stupid.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who needs money to open a new car lot. But since he thinks that the only person who could give the money to him, his father-in-law (Harve Presnell), won't put down the money, he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife (Kristen Rudrud) and split the ransom that his father-in-law will pay. Unfortunately for Jerry, the two thugs he hired don't have any brain cells between them, and Jerry is probably the most incompetent criminal the world has ever seen. Things get out of hand very quickly and the bodies start piling up. This draws the attention of the very pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).It may seem like I've given a lot away, but really, I haven't. That's just the set-up for a series of unexpected (not to mention bizarre) twist and turns that the Coens throw at us. Many thrillers, even the best ones, have easily projected paths. Fargo is anything but.Despite IMDb listing it as such, merely calling Fargo a crime\/thriller is an insufficient description. The film is as much a comedy as anything else. From the character's stupidity or complete ineptitude, to the funny accents and way of speaking that everyone has, the Coens never take Fargo too seriously.The acting is the best part of the film. Frances McDormand is a real scene-stealer, and in many ways the best part of the movie. Marge is relentlessly chirpy and optimistic, and she's easily the smartest character in the film (although that's not exactly saying much). Fargo really takes off whenever she's on screen. William H. Macy gives his best performance as Jerry. As reprehensible as his plan is, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. He's so bad at being a criminal, it's really pathetic. But seeing him try to get out of the jams he gets himself into are nothing short of hilarious. Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell are good as the brainless kidnappers, and even though they think they're smart, they're really, REALLY dumb.Joel Coen has a knack for twisting the story just enough so that it's funny without lampooning the genre. This isn't a satire, but the jabs it takes almost make it so. It has its share of violence, including a scene that in any other movie would be completely sick and disturbing, but as told by the Coens, it's so shocking and absurd that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.Roger Ebert heaped tons of praise on Fargo, saying that Movies like 'Fargo' are the reasons why I love movies. While I greatly enjoyed Fargo, I can't heap that much praise on it. Some of the cuts in the film are too long, and I half-expected a commercial break. Additionally, there's one scene where Marge reunites with a guy from high school that, while funny and irreverent, really doesn't add anything to the story.

The courtroom drama has a long history with films like Twelve Angry Men and To Kill A Mockingbird to more modern films such as the Runaway Jury and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A Few Good Men has the twist that it focuses on the military.A Few Good Men is about the legal investigation and trial of two marines accused of murdering another Marine at Guantanamo Bay. Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) wanted to represent the men but whilst known as a good investigator she is very slow at cases. Her superiors bring in Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), a young member of the JAG team who has a reputation to settle cases out of court. Both Daniel and Joanne take an instant dislike to each other and have different views on taken on the case. But whilst investigating their discovery a culture of abuse being used at Gitmo where superior officers use recruits to force people to shape up and that the dead marine had requested a transfered numerous times.The film has an excellent cast, Tom Cruise in my mind is a good actor and he should do more serious films and he has a real claim in this film where you grow to like him. Demi Moore was decent and believe as Joanne, the military lawyer who has a passion for justice. Jack Nicholson is a strong present even with his short amount of screen-time. Other supporting actors were also very good in the film including Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollak, J.T. Walsh and Wolfgang Bodison.This is a film of themes about justice and the military, especially the culture and difference between officers. The theme of military has always been an issue and still is today all over the world. The abuse theme also reminded me of Full Metal Jacket. The film also relates to the American military's role in the War of Terror with American soldiers abusing detainees.The writer of the film was Aaron Sorkin who based it on his own stage play. To me Sorkin is a genius, giving the world The West Wing and he is a talented writer, mixing in serious topics and some good moments of humour. He made a wonderful screenplay and made his play cinematic.The direction of Rob Reiner was pretty standard, he knows how to handle to camera and got good performances from his actors. He too was able to mix serious and humour. Reiner is the man who also gave the work This is Spinal Tap and Misery.Whilst the film is good, there is a few too many grand speeches and the ending was a bit to sentimental.

He is met by Frenchy (Didi Conn), the Beauty School Dropout who is returning to start her career in cosmetology by learning high school chemistry.Soon after arriving, he bumps into the beautiful Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first starring role), who is the leader of the girls gang the Pink Ladies, and the latest girl of Johnny (Adrian Zmed), the leader of the T-Birds, a gang once lead by Danny in the original movie.It is love at first sight for the well-mannered young man, but he quickly learns that he has to be a T-Bird to date her. But, he will do anything to get close to her.Now, Michael pursues his crush by turning into what Stephanie wants -- a cool rider who will sweep her off her feet.Let me say right off the bat, this is a very weak followup to one of the greatest musicals of all time. It just completely lacks the magic of the original film.First of all, there is the music. If you ask me, only two of the 13 songs are memorable. The rest, though having the sound of early-60's music, is just terrible and uninspired. To me, most of the tunes sounded as if they were just thrown together just before production starts. As for the choreography in these scenes, it's hit or miss. In the original, we get an energetic dance number in the school gym, which is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. In Grease 2, we get an out-of-nowhere number in the local bowling alley that the cast appeared to enjoy doing. However, I would not want to go back to learn these steps (and I am in a wheelchair). I also felt, with some exceptions, that the cast was taught the choreography the day before filming the dance scenes.One of the biggest problems is character development. To me, the characters seemed to have been written as if we are expected to know the new faces. Most of the main characters appear to be loosely based on specific characters from the first film (most notably Michael, a male version of Sandy with a bit of Danny thrown in, and Stephanie, a female version of Danny with a bit of Sandy thrown in). There are also many supporting characters with their own, minor story lines which barely moves the story along. We get only minor basics of these characters, and the audience mostly ignores them due to not being presented well.As for performances from the main cast, they are fairly good, but not perfect. Pfeiffer is near perfect in her first major role on the silver screen, and carries the weaker members of the cast fairly well in their scenes together -- and she can actually carry a tune pretty well (especially in Cool Rider, one of the only two songs you will most likely remember after the closing credits end. Caulfield was pretty good as Michael, even in his invented alter-ego to swoon Stephanie. However, there was something lacking in their romantic chemistry most of the time.The supporting cast, all around, is quite weak. Like I said, these characters are horribly written. We only get the most basic information. The T-Birds lacked the feel of being a unit, as did the Pink Ladies. We even get some of the original cast in this film, but they are only on-screen to deliver a line or two as the movie progresses.As for the wardrobes, nothing real special here. The gym shirts the men wear in one scene appear to have the school name ironed onto it, and not in a quality a school district would spend the money on. I found the wardrobe pretty boring actually. The Pink Ladies and T-Birds iconic jackets don't look that great on the cast members wearing them. And, especially with certain male members of the cast, the hairdos look too much teased. It looked as if they cut some corners on the wardrobes and hairdos to me.The story just feels rushed, especially the part where Michael creates his alter-ego. It appears that he became an expert in riding rather quickly, as there was no way to tell how much time had past.I really can't recommend this one. If you already own the first movie, I would suggest that you get this film just so you can have both movies. And that's the only reason to purchase it.

The gym shirts the men wear in one scene appear to have the school name ironed onto it, and not in a quality a school district would spend the money on. I found the wardrobe pretty boring actually. The Pink Ladies and T-Birds iconic jackets don't look that great on the cast members wearing them. And, especially with certain male members of the cast, the hairdos look too much teased. It looked as if they cut some corners on the wardrobes and hairdos to me.The story just feels rushed, especially the part where Michael creates his alter-ego. It appears that he became an expert in riding rather quickly, as there was no way to tell how much time had past.I really can't recommend this one. If you already own the first movie, I would suggest that you get this film just so you can have both movies. And that's the only reason to purchase it. It's just not able to live up to the icon that is the original.

You can call South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone sick but you can't say they are stupid. South Park is a commentary piece beneath everything about censorship and freedom of speech. It's no secret that Parker and Stone have had trouble with the M.P.A.A passing their projects for R ratings. In a lot of ways the characters of Terrence and Philip represent themselves, two comedians who love fart humor being persecuted for their product. The funny thing is that Terrence and Philip is so outlandishly stupid on purpose, the entire movie, Asses of Fire, consists of the characters in front of a couch cracking fart jokes at the other's expense. The parents in South Park would rather rally around a cause with media attention than have a one to one with their boys. In the end that is what our protagonist Kyle really wants. The argument here is well done. What Parker and Stone are doing is putting a mirror on the hypocrisies of America's conception of the media. The Canadian Ambassador of the Arts loudly exclaims. The United States has graphic violence on television all the time. We can't believe that a movie with some foul language would pi$$ you off so much. Parker and Stone make a point of this by staging a horribly grim cartoon battle between the Canadians and the United States. It's funny to see these poorly animated construction paper characters engaged in so much carnage. If Parker and Stone attempted to do their battle in a live action film there would be enough blood and gore to make your stomach churn. The film's satire can be summed up with Shelia's address to the US troops. Just remember what the MPAA says Horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words. That is what this war is all about!South Park has another very high strength, its music. The picture is a musical-comedy in every sense of the world. South Park creator Trey Parker majored in music and is an experienced musician and he knows how to stage a musical utilizing these cartoon characters. The film was even recognized with an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Parker doesn't have to stage his musicals like the traditional one but he does so to both pay tribute to them and butcher them in a parody. My particular favorite number of the picture is Up There affectionately sung by Satan who reminisces about finding acceptance on the Earth above. This number could easily be placed in any Walt Disney film both in its lyrics and its animation. The brilliance of the number though is that we have Satan, who is by all means a villain, singing a blatant rip off of a number from The Little Mermaid. Parker stages his numbers brilliantly each time and each of them displays the eccentricities of the overly loud musical productions. We have the montage, animated over the top set pieces, dance numbers in the background with dozens of characters. The climax of their musical parody is when the uplifting grand finale ends with an Orca whale jumping over a rainbow. Yeah it's silly but it parodies the fact that so many musicals ask us to suspend our disbelief. The parody is a loving one though. None of these numbers are parodied or showcased just to make them look silly or stupid or the sake of doing so. The songs are clever and have a bite to them as well as make you laugh. I also appreciated the fact that each song represents the character singing it. A problem I have noticed with the musicals is that the songs are more articulate than the character singing them. South Park doesn't make this mistake. The foul mouthed little spoiled brat Cartman has a grand number summing up the kid's frustration, Kyle's Mom is a B***h.In the end I liked the film, maybe even loved it, but it isn't without its flaws. Trey Parker and Matt Stone expose their audience to a lot of filth. They are walking on a thin wire making a picture centered on such obscene jokes. I was able to appreciate them because I have followed their work and consider myself to be a huge fan but South Park isn't for every audience. Trey and Matt acknowledge that in the film and ask their critiques to rate them on content and not toilet humor. Well sometimes the toilet humor and content are so intertwined this becomes impossible. The character of Saddam Hussein is a prime example of this. I understand what they were going for but instead of being edgy in a good way it just becomes way over the top. The character does have a few laughs but I imagine anyone who wasn't a South Park fan cringed at some of his jokes, I'm a huge South Park fan and even I did.Overall though, I would recommend South Park to those who can appreciate the humor. It requires an acquired taste but it provides a lot of laughs if you sit through it. If you can understand South Park for what it is, you will see a very funny film ripe with intelligent satire.

Drawing inspiration from Daphne du Maurier's short-story (adapted by Allan Scott and Chris Bryant), this is a story about loss, grief, fate, madness, set in a Venice which is simultaneous beautiful and nightmarish.John and Laura Baxter travel to Venice where he's engaged in restoring an old church. They also use this travel to try and forget the death of their daughter Christine and possibly salvage a wrecked marriage. But a chance encounter with two British ladies changes everything; one of them, blind and claiming to have psychic powers, tells Laura she's seen Christine and that she's happy. John is skeptical, but the mourning Laura is sucked right into her visions. She also has a warning for John he must leave Venice or he'll die.But John is developing his own madness, as he starts seeing a figure which resembles Christine. Ironically, as Laura starts getting some comfort from the old lady, John becomes himself obsessed. And his obsession will lead him to an unforgettable meeting with fate and to one of the most unexpected endings in film history.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are amazing in their respective roles, he as a commonsensical man who's trying to leave the past behind, she as a mother trying to cope with loss. Their relationship is honest and convincing I really believe they've been a lifetime together and have gone through the death of a child.There's a famous sex scene in this movie, very visual, which some call needless; but for me it summons up their relationship through the movie they're too lonely people who've drifted apart and are trying to reconnect. It's a beautiful moment of passion and intimacy.The technical aspects of the movie are just as excellent. I particularly admire Anthony B. Richmond's cinematography, which turned beautiful Venice into a frightening city full of shadows and unknown horrors at each turn. Pino Donnagio's score is also beautiful it's sad, serene and restrained, much like the movie itself. The editing is also clever Roeg and Graeme Clifford constantly insert bits from John's past into the narrative, showing how past and present are always together.Unfortunately the story is never strong as much as I love the movie, at times it felt incoherent, with a serial killer plot that needed more room for development, especially considering it ties up everything together. I can't wait to read du Maurier's story to see how she dealt with this.All in all, Don't Look Now is a fascinating horror movie, made during horror's last Golden Age (it came out in the same year The Exorcist and The Wicker Man did); it's intelligent, it's mature and it's emotionally engaging. Quite simply, no one makes them like these anymore.

They also use this travel to try and forget the death of their daughter Christine and possibly salvage a wrecked marriage. But a chance encounter with two British ladies changes everything; one of them, blind and claiming to have psychic powers, tells Laura she's seen Christine and that she's happy. John is skeptical, but the mourning Laura is sucked right into her visions. She also has a warning for John he must leave Venice or he'll die.But John is developing his own madness, as he starts seeing a figure which resembles Christine. Ironically, as Laura starts getting some comfort from the old lady, John becomes himself obsessed. And his obsession will lead him to an unforgettable meeting with fate and to one of the most unexpected endings in film history.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are amazing in their respective roles, he as a commonsensical man who's trying to leave the past behind, she as a mother trying to cope with loss. Their relationship is honest and convincing I really believe they've been a lifetime together and have gone through the death of a child.There's a famous sex scene in this movie, very visual, which some call needless; but for me it summons up their relationship through the movie they're too lonely people who've drifted apart and are trying to reconnect. It's a beautiful moment of passion and intimacy.The technical aspects of the movie are just as excellent. I particularly admire Anthony B. Richmond's cinematography, which turned beautiful Venice into a frightening city full of shadows and unknown horrors at each turn. Pino Donnagio's score is also beautiful it's sad, serene and restrained, much like the movie itself. The editing is also clever Roeg and Graeme Clifford constantly insert bits from John's past into the narrative, showing how past and present are always together.Unfortunately the story is never strong as much as I love the movie, at times it felt incoherent, with a serial killer plot that needed more room for development, especially considering it ties up everything together. I can't wait to read du Maurier's story to see how she dealt with this.All in all, Don't Look Now is a fascinating horror movie, made during horror's last Golden Age (it came out in the same year The Exorcist and The Wicker Man did); it's intelligent, it's mature and it's emotionally engaging. Quite simply, no one makes them like these anymore.

But I would give the casting director the benefit of the doubt and assume the guy measures up somehow. Well, he doesn't! Julianne goes through interminable heartbreaking frustration as she tries by fair means and foul to prise this jerk she so likes away from his chosen woman who's the deceptively sweet daughter of a billionaire and clearly both will harass the fiancé into doing what they want - such as force him to give up his chosen job of aimless sports commentator. It's very clear the guy isn't good enough for either girl but the parents will put up with their daughter's choice and the whole family will mould him to what they want for the daughter, whether he likes it or not. No billionaire's going to be happy with this aimless jerk as a son-in-law. The rich girl talks of abandoning her college career to bum around the country with her new husband but you can see this won't satisfy her for long. Julianne's underhand idea that the fiancée's dad should offer the bum fiancé a job he can't refuse makes the jerk fly off the handle and his fiancée placates him, but later admits she intends her future husband to work in the family business and you can see she'll ensure he does. His precious freedom as a bum is in danger but he can't see he's going to end up as a cypher. With Julianne he could have had his freedom - but he can't see that and for Julianne's future happiness thank goodness he doesn't! This jerk is going to get a tough awakening. His wife isn't the sweet malleable admiring young thing he thinks she is. Have I any pity for him? No! Julianne tries everything including introducing her gay friend George (Rupert Everett) as her boyfriend, which makes the jerk jealous - he is greedy, he wants both women under his control, is flattered to have Julianne chasing after him- and eventually Julianne tells the jerk how she loves him. Even that doesn't work, he now goes running off after his fiancée. So Julianne admits defeat, confesses her deceptions and wishes them well. I really didn't expect that and ended the movie feeling very disappointed, annoyed and feeling throughly cheated. But then I thought about it. The jerk isn't in any way worthy of Julianne. What on earth did she see in him? Thank goodness he didn't want her or she'd have been stuck in a bad marriage with this jerk who'd have soon let her down one way or another.

There had never been a film quite like this prior to 1951. It is the kind of film that must have attracted and appealed to a wide international audience. This was a very exciting, youthful, and big production film that came into the fore during the 60s. It must have attracted a lot of attention at the time.Robert Walker plays a very disturbed, yet charming man in some ways. His character is extremely intelligent and extremely disturbed. He is the kind of man who people would trust instinctively until they got to know him a little bit more. Walker stalks a tennis pro (Farley Granger) and in a conversation on the train proposes that he murders his unfaithful wife and that his job will be to kill his hated father.Not surprisingly, Granger's character is blackmailed into the proposal after Walker's character decides to actually murder his unfaithful wife. Both characters are well developed. Granger's is a kind and manipulated man with a promising future. Walker's character is literally a walking time bomb. He is very charming on the surface, but quickly alienates people with his crazy talk.This movie is exciting. However, there are a few things that significantly detract from the film. First of all, Granger's character is too nice. Yes, he does say that he wants to kill his wife and even has a domestic dispute with her in public. However, he is a very nice guy. It would have worked better if he was less of the nice guy. Instead of being the victim of a psychopath's manipulation, he could have been better characterized as someone who was pretty normal and decent on the surface, but rather amoral in reality. That would have made him make a tacit agreement and actually fulfill his part in the bargain. This would have made the story far more entertaining and morally complex.Instead, Hitchcock settled for the typical good guy versus bad guy. This made the movie seem a bit hallow and overproduced. The ending of the movie was a bit too contrived. First of all, why would the police shoot bullets into a crowded carousel with children on it? This killed the attendant on the carousel and caused the carousel to rocket out of control. The ending was a bit too much of a sellout, where the good guy lives happily ever after. Still, it must have been a big deal in 1951. I don't think that prior to this time there was such a big production movie capable of appealing to such a mass, younger audience.

A car alarm goes off across the street. A young woman (lovingly referred to in the credits as Raving Bitch and played by Sarah Silverman) starts screaming at the two men who are sitting on the car and set off the alarm. They ignore her. She screams more and more; one of them (Ryan Philippe) yells back something equally awful. She and a large chunk of the crowd move over to confront the men &#x96; more insults are exchanged, particularly some homophobic slurs. Philippe punches her, very hard, in the face. The other man (Benicio del Toro), stomps on the sandaled foot of another young woman. A big brawl ensues. These are our heroes.I don't mind antiheroes. I don't necessarily mind films where most of the characters are criminals, evil people, unpleasant people, stupid people, or just really irritating people. I didn't mind Cloverfield last year which was full of people I'd like to smack. The Way of the Gun though is something different, something on another level altogether. Del Toro and (especially) Philippe are every bit as awful as they start out showing in their first scene, applying to be blood donors for some quick cash but quickly resorting to such insulting behavior &#x96; lots of homophobic slurs again, among other things - that they get the man interviewing them to blow his top, then contriving to kidnap a girl (Juliette Lewis) pregnant with a rich man's baby for which she's to be paid $1 million and killing a half-dozen guards as they make their getaway. They're pursued by the rich man's two top bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) who figure out rapidly that the old man only cares about the baby &#x96; they have no more compunction than Philippe or Del Toro about icing Lewis as soon as the kid is born.The character who ought to be most sympathetic, the mother-to-be, isn't, really &#x96; she's pathetic, tearful and screaming throughout most of the film, and we never get as much sense of her as a human being as we do of most of the nastier people around her. Of course, in her situation, most of us would scream and cry a lot &#x96; but given that nearly every other character is a murdering, psychopathic macho parody that out-Tarantinos the master, I guess I'd hoped for more. The doctor who tries to help her out is similarly not brazenly evil &#x96; but too weak and cowardly for us to care much about him either.

And somewhere along the way, the fickle movie-going mob forgot where all the magic began, and where it stopped.The original 1989 Tim Burton effort prevails by every measure of creativity, craftsmanship and cinematic significance.Batman is one of the most atmospheric films I have ever seen.

Attired in suits, topped with fedoras and brandishing revolvers; the criminals are perfumed by the past in a classic film noir style. The result is a much more textured and evocative film; conveying a potently palpable sense of seediness and moral decay.Batman's scenes of action are impressive but measured. Burton understands that the key to great action is moderation; only then can the audience engage with it. The Dark Night seems desperate to entertain,compensating for a lack of vision by overloading scenes with elaborate special effects and stunts.Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne is, on the whole, more enigmatic and interesting than Bale's. They are similar in several respects, but Keaton, I feel, brings more humanity to the part; a social misfit and loner on the surface, but with hidden, dark emotional depths.Nicholson's performance, on the other hand, is a tour de force. Ledger provided the shell of a character (hair, makeup and costume) but without the creative and artistic instincts to develop it. Burton managed to bring all the weight and charisma of Jack Nicholson and apply it to a comic book character. The result is one of the most vibrant, vicious, and compelling characters ever committed to celluloid.And of course one cannot forget Danny Elfman's goose-bump inducing score; a sweeping symphonic masterpiece that manages to capture the film's excitement, pace and harrowing qualities.Time has not been kind or fair to Batman. Though big in its day, in the public's estimation, Batman has slipped down the popularity scale from a heavily fortified 1st to a distant and peripheral 3rd.

The actors that play the Oz roles are Ray Bolger (Scarecrow), Jack Haley (Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion), Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the west), Frank Morgan (Emerald City Doorman\/Cabbie\/The Wizard's Guard\/The Wizard of Oz), and Judy Garland (Dorothy Gale). Also all these actors and actresses (except Dorothy Gale) play a double role in Kansas and Oz. The Kansas roles are Ray Bolger (Hunk), Jack Haley (Hickory), Bert Lahr (Zeke), Margaret Hamilton (Miss Almira Gulch), and Frank Morgan (Professor Marvel). During the opening of the movie there is a message saying, For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put it kindly philosophy out of fashion. To those of you who have been faithful to it in return...and to the Young in Heart...we dedicate this picture. This makes the movie sounds like it's a fantasy for children or more or less for little girls. As the film progresses Dorothy comes in the farm to complain about Almira and how she is being mean to Toto the dog. Later Almira comes to take her dog with a sheriff warrant. As she rides the bike back to town with the dog in the back in the basket, the dog escapes and runs back to Dorothy. As soon as the dog comes back Dorothy realizes that Almira is going to come back and she decides to run away. As she is traveling she runs into professor Marvel, whom she asks if she can travel with him. But later the professor decides that he doesn't want her to come with him some he makes up lies about Dorothy aunt getting sick. As Dorothy rushes back to her aunt's farm there is a tornado by the farm. Locking the animals away the farm residents decide to go underground. When Dorothy arrives the tornado is close to the farm and the trees are flying off the ground as Dorothy runs to the house. This scene doesn't make sense because on average a tree weights more than a human being. Dorothy hides in the house and the window hits her; resulting she gets knocked unconscious on the bed. When she wakes up she realizes she is inside the tornado and she sees Almira riding her bike laughing and Almira turns into the wicked witch. While the tornado stops she realizes she is in some fantasy land (Oz). Dorothy is accused of being the savior of the munchkin people because she fell with her house on the wicked witch of the East that controlled them (munchkin people). The mayor of the munchkins calls it the day of independence because the death of the witch. Later Dorothy goes on a journey wearing the ruby slippers that the wicked witch of the west wants. While on her journey to meet the wizard that can take back to Kansas she meets a scarecrow (that is not scary), a tin man (who needs oil), and a tiger (who is a coward). While they are on the journey the wicked witch of the west plots a plan to put the crew to sleep. It works but only the scarecrow and tin man are not placed under the spell. They start yelling help and the good witch of the north makes it snow and wakes them up. They reach the city and all the residents are wearing green as they freshen up the wicked witch of the west come and scare the residents by spelling surrender Dorothy, leaving everyone in panic. Dorothy realizes that there is no wizard of oz and she breaks down and starts crying; as she is telling her story about her aunt getting sick the emerald city door man hears her and takes her to the wizard. When they see him they are petrified of the great fire and the floating head of the wizard. The wizard decides to grant them their wish only if they bring the broomstick of the witch of the west. Dorothy and the three go and search for the witch in the haunted forest and Dorothy and her dog get kidnapped by flying monkeys. Toto escapes to look for the other three and takes them to rescue Dorothy. Dorothy kills the witch with water, which is one of the worst endings one can think of. The crew gets the broom back and goes back to the wizard of oz and Dorothy discovers that he is a fake. Wizard leaves Dorothy and the good witch of the north arrives and tells her the truth that she can go back whenever she pleases. Then Dorothy awakens with her aunt and friends there and she tells them her story of fantasy. This picture is a little bit childish but it can be easily the movie of the 1940's, because of the color tone added to the black and white picture as soon as Dorothy goes into her fantasy state. The cuts and scenes of this movie are in a proper sequence except for the fact when she is in the tornado and the house falls there needs to be more details. When the house falls the scene doesn't show the witch getting hit and the impact of the house falling. The wizard of Oz is a movie that is remembered and cherish by many younger generations. The lesson learned from this movie is that running away is never good.

The mayor of the munchkins calls it the day of independence because the death of the witch. Later Dorothy goes on a journey wearing the ruby slippers that the wicked witch of the west wants. While on her journey to meet the wizard that can take back to Kansas she meets a scarecrow (that is not scary), a tin man (who needs oil), and a tiger (who is a coward). While they are on the journey the wicked witch of the west plots a plan to put the crew to sleep. It works but only the scarecrow and tin man are not placed under the spell. They start yelling help and the good witch of the north makes it snow and wakes them up. They reach the city and all the residents are wearing green as they freshen up the wicked witch of the west come and scare the residents by spelling surrender Dorothy, leaving everyone in panic. Dorothy realizes that there is no wizard of oz and she breaks down and starts crying; as she is telling her story about her aunt getting sick the emerald city door man hears her and takes her to the wizard. When they see him they are petrified of the great fire and the floating head of the wizard. The wizard decides to grant them their wish only if they bring the broomstick of the witch of the west. Dorothy and the three go and search for the witch in the haunted forest and Dorothy and her dog get kidnapped by flying monkeys. Toto escapes to look for the other three and takes them to rescue Dorothy. Dorothy kills the witch with water, which is one of the worst endings one can think of. The crew gets the broom back and goes back to the wizard of oz and Dorothy discovers that he is a fake. Wizard leaves Dorothy and the good witch of the north arrives and tells her the truth that she can go back whenever she pleases. Then Dorothy awakens with her aunt and friends there and she tells them her story of fantasy. This picture is a little bit childish but it can be easily the movie of the 1940's, because of the color tone added to the black and white picture as soon as Dorothy goes into her fantasy state. The cuts and scenes of this movie are in a proper sequence except for the fact when she is in the tornado and the house falls there needs to be more details. When the house falls the scene doesn't show the witch getting hit and the impact of the house falling. The wizard of Oz is a movie that is remembered and cherish by many younger generations. The lesson learned from this movie is that running away is never good.

The actors that play the Oz roles are Ray Bolger (Scarecrow), Jack Haley (Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion), Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the west), Frank Morgan (Emerald City Doorman\/Cabbie\/The Wizard's Guard\/The Wizard of Oz), and Judy Garland (Dorothy Gale). Also all these actors and actresses (except Dorothy Gale) play a double role in Kansas and Oz. The Kansas roles are Ray Bolger (Hunk), Jack Haley (Hickory), Bert Lahr (Zeke), Margaret Hamilton (Miss Almira Gulch), and Frank Morgan (Professor Marvel). During the opening of the movie there is a message saying, For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put it kindly philosophy out of fashion. To those of you who have been faithful to it in return...and to the Young in Heart...we dedicate this picture. This makes the movie sounds like it's a fantasy for children or more or less for little girls. As the film progresses Dorothy comes in the farm to complain about Almira and how she is being mean to Toto the dog. Later Almira comes to take her dog with a sheriff warrant. As she rides the bike back to town with the dog in the back in the basket, the dog escapes and runs back to Dorothy. As soon as the dog comes back Dorothy realizes that Almira is going to come back and she decides to run away. As she is traveling she runs into professor Marvel, whom she asks if she can travel with him. But later the professor decides that he doesn't want her to come with him some he makes up lies about Dorothy aunt getting sick. As Dorothy rushes back to her aunt's farm there is a tornado by the farm. Locking the animals away the farm residents decide to go underground. When Dorothy arrives the tornado is close to the farm and the trees are flying off the ground as Dorothy runs to the house. This scene doesn't make sense because on average a tree weights more than a human being. Dorothy hides in the house and the window hits her; resulting she gets knocked unconscious on the bed. When she wakes up she realizes she is inside the tornado and she sees Almira riding her bike laughing and Almira turns into the wicked witch. While the tornado stops she realizes she is in some fantasy land (Oz).

Not many, if any, other than Ellen. Burstyn gives a stunning and heart wrenching performance in this film of the horrors of dreams\/aspirations and drug addictions. We see Sarah Goldfarb's psychological deterioration as she slowly looses touch with reality while taking diet pills and is left alone by her son, who is battling his own addiction. I will say that this movie is not an easy film to watch as it is very depressing and horrific(One of the few sheer dramas reviewed by Fangoria Magazine), but the story is compelling and entertaining through excellent use of cinematography and editing.The other main characters in this movie are interesting and well acted; Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly all create solid and real characters.
