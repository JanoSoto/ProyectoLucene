While this is only arguably Kubrick's best film (I have it second), it is certainly his most important. Contemporary critics were stupefied and divisive; to me, that typically means one of two things either you have a comedy film or dark, dark drama that heavily depends on individual taste; or you have one of the greatest works of cinema ever made, one that people just aren't ready for yet. i am confident when I say that this is part of the latter category.I'm sure that you know some of the famous lines or scenes from the film; the protohumans banging on the mysterious black monolith, the interactions between the computer and Dave, and the trippy sequence near the film's conclusion that ends with the main character turning into a starchild.

The movie is a hard-core action, I have ever seen. Hard Boiled is my third John Woo favorite action film that I love to death! I don't get why people do not call Hard Boiled John Woo's Masterpiece?! In my opinion Hard Boiled is John Woo's one of the best HK action movies from the 90's and a true masterpiece along with The Killer (1989) and Hard Target (1993) his first American movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in the main role. Hard Boiled and The Killer are mine favorite John Woo's HK action movies. The Action Sequences in this movie are among the greatest ever filmed. This Action astonish film in my opinion is in a Die Hard Style, Die Hard was released in 1988, this film was released 2 years later after Die Hard 2 come out , beside Die Hard, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, Hard Target is Hard Boiled the fourth favorite best Action movie of mine! I love this movie to death, I love it so much. , those two HK movies are mine John Woo's favorite movies! This is the real cinema, Hollywood can not make any good action this days, movie without involving CGI in the movie. The Hong Kong Cinema Hard Boiled has everything in it, no CGI, the stunts are real, the explosions are bigger and the plot of the film is amazing you can get in to the story without guessing what is going to happened and what the plot is about. The acting in this movie is superb and very outstanding, realistic, the character developments are awesome! Mobsters are smuggling guns into Hong Kong. The police orchestrate a raid at a teahouse where an ace detective loses his partner. Meanwhile, the two main gun smugglers are having a war over territory, and a young new gun is enlisted to wipe out informants and overcome barriers to growth. The detective, acting from inside sources, gets closer to the ring leaders and eventually must work with the inside man directly. That's your basic plot. It does involve a lot of gun play, awesome shootouts, rescuing the hostages in the Hospital and realistic acting. I don't know why people are saying the acting in this movie wasn't realistic? I don't get it--sorry. I did like the gun-fight between Philip Kwok and Tony Leung. I remember Philip starts it after confirming all the innocent by-standers are completely out of their way. The shoot-out sequences are some of the best put to screen and the characters were awesome especially Mad Dog. I think the entire Hospital sequence is about 40 minutes long. And it does have Fantastic Action Scenes. I enjoy Hard Boiled, it's a solid flick. Not only is there a ton of gun action in that one take, but also some serious dramatic acting after Tony Leung kills the cop. When they get in the elevator they didn't go to a different floor. 30 or 40 art department people came out and reset the scene while they were chatting. Before people relied so heavily on special effects and stuff they had to make this stuff happen in real life and it is amazing. Too bad they don't make movies with balls anymore, now everything is PG-13﻿. There's A lot of blood and violence with awesome characters and dialogue, and John Woo being a director that makes a lot of sweet, long and awesome action sequences (do not get confused with Michael Bay or I swear to god) with smart plot developments.Chow Yun-Fat and Tony Leung are a great duo who constantly bicker and kick ass throughout the movie. The whole warehouse raid is amazing as we have nothing but gunfire and explosions left and right. And the whole hospital sequence at the end just tops it. This is the essential action movie. The last scenes in the hospital were very realistic, when Tequila is running down the exploding hallway with the baby, John Woo wasn't satisfied that the explosions were big and frightening enough in the scene. So the special effects technicians did reset the explosives and give him the trigger. When he pull the trigger, he almost killed Chow Yun Fat running down the hall the scenes were amazing and only in Hong Kong movies you can see that. The gunplay is delivered in perfect slo-mo John Woo-style -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. This movie is a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth and I love this movie to death! Hard Boiled is a 1992 action crime film co-written and directed by John Woo. The film stars Chow Yun-Fat as Tequila, a veteran Hong Kong Police Force inspector who takes on a crime syndicate that is smuggling arms through the city. Tony Leung Chiu Wai co-stars as Alan, a gangster on his way up in the syndicate whom Tequila cross paths with and discovers has more to his past than is seen on the surface. John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat would continue the story of Tequila in the video game Stranglehold. 10\/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Golden Princess Film Production Limited, Milestone Pictures, Pioneer LDC Starring Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Teresa Mo, Philip Chan, Philip Kwok, Anthony Wong Director John Woo Producers Linda Kuk, Terence Chang Screenplay Barry Wong Story by John Woo Rated R Running Time 2 Hr. 8 Mins.

But once the movie clicks into vampire mode &#x97; which, let's face it, is why we're watching this in the first place &#x97; Rodriguez seems to become a directorial zombie.It's as if he worked so hard on the first half that he was plum too tuckered out to maintain the film's edgy excellence. More than anything, it's a problem of quality control. Everything in the second half suffers due to a steady stream of irregularities and lazy execution. For example, everyone knows (and the movie acknowledges this) that vampire stories come with certain rules &#x97; holy water, stakes in the heart, that sort of thing. But here, one person will almost instantly turn into a vampire after a bite in one scene, while another character will have about an hour before he changes in a later scene. The vampires even look different in terms of their makeup from one to another, both as living vampires and when they're killed.All of the inconsistencies pile up on one another until the action devolves into something bordering on camp. Whereas in a truly scary picture you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering when the next attack is coming, here there were scenes where you could literally see vampires in the background sort of dancing in place, waiting for the stars to say their lines before they finally attacked.Lazy, lazy, lazy.It's a shame The goodwill earned by this movie's truly eerie and suspenseful first half is effectively frittered away by the inattention to detail that follows, and not even the clever ending can redeem it.Unlike some other viewers, I have no problem with the sort of portmanteau thriller\/monster-movie construction the filmmakers attempted here. But vampires that aren't frightening? Oh, the horror.

Directed by Steve Miner, and originally release in 3-D, Friday the 13th Part III is the first movie to feature the antagonist Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) with his iconic signature hockey mask, which has since become a trademark of both the character and franchise as a whole. As a direct sequel to 1980's Friday the 13th & 1981's Friday the 13th Part 2, the first part of the film follows the aftermath of the massacres at Camp Crystal Lake, very loosely. We see a recap of the last minutes of the previous film through archive footage. However, it doesn't really fit well, with the rest of this film, since that part wasn't shot in 3D. Other glaring factors is that none of the previous cast, return for this film. Not even, Amy Steel as Ginny Field, who surprising, was never even kill by Jason. I guess, they didn't want to do the Ginny at psychiatric hospital route, since 1981's Halloween 2 kinda did it first. Instead, the movie focus on a new batch of teenagers lead by Chrissy Higgins (Dana Kimmell) in a new location, Higgins Haven trying to have some vacation time, before the new school year on surprising Sunday, the 15th, not Friday the 13th. I wasn't impressed with any of the actors acting here. It was a bit jarring to see, mid 30s somethings, trying to act like teens. Not only that; unlike the other film, where most of the supporting characters were likable. Most of them in this movie, weren't likable! They were all, highly obnoxious! First off, you got Rick (Paul Kraka) whom loves, surprising and forcing sex on supposedly rape victims. Then you got the over-the-top Cheech & Chong rip-off, stoner, Charles 'Chuck Garth (David Katims) who looks like, he has step into the wrong set! Then you got the cheesy Michael Jackson's 'BAD' looking motorcycle gang that really had, no purpose in the film, just to serve as filler. Then you got the guy, Andy Beltrami (Jeffery Rodgers) and his pregnant girlfriend, Debbie Klein (Tracie Savage) whom gimmick was it, to walk on his hands. Then you got Debbie, whom I really don't know, why they had to try to kill her and unborn child. I guess, the producers really hated, teen pregnancies. Then you got the really horrible character, Shelly Finkelstein (Larry Zerner), whom I didn't like him, at all! He really ruins the film for me. Does he have mental problems or something!? Who does mean pranks like that!? Are you sure, this movie wasn't made as a comedy, because they all, look like a joke! The only person, besides Chrissy that was somewhat decent was Vera Sanchez (Catherine Parks) who had an eye on things. Honestly, for the most part, I wanted all of them to die, quick. It's a bad sign, if you cheer for the bad guy, more than the good guys. Anyways, the movie is full of silly 3-D gimmicks. We get to see, a number of mundane 3-D effects from Yo-Yo being tossed at us to juggling tricks. It seemed like they were really stretching, when coming up with ideas on how to use the 3-D in this film. Still, there were a number of really cool shots that was worth seeing, such as the harpoon gun or pitchfork scene. Still, some of the deaths in the film were edited in order to avoid an X rating, and you really can tell, where the cuts ends. The film also contains an infamous alternate ending in which the lead character Chris, played by Dana Kimmell, is decapitated by Jason at the conclusion. Though this sequence has never been commercially released, stills of it can be seen. Still, the ending, they did choose, was very lackluster, with all the fake-outs dream sequences. Despite all the blood and gore, this movie lacks the suspense, compare to the previous two. I really didn't find, the movie to be, that scary. After all, the movie has a funky disco soundtrack by Harry Manfredini that sounds like a Halloween dance-off party and lots of nudity that give anybody, a chubby. When first released, the film was intended to end the series as a trilogy. However unlike its sequel Friday the 13th Part IV The Final Chapter (1984) and the later film, Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday (1993), Friday the 13th Part III did not include a moniker in its title to indicate it as such. Overall it's one of the films, you have to watch at least once, if you into the 1980's horror genre. Just don't think too much about it when watching. It's just one of those films you watch if you want cheap thrills, nothing more.

The original is the only Friday movie that I give a ten to, there's just something very special about it to me, and it's certainly the one that I find the most creepy. It's such a good old-fashioned stalk and slash through the dark of the highest order! Perhaps it's even the granddaddy of all such grisly fare. I'm aware that it isn't quite the first slasher ever, but it was certainly an influential game changer and a definer of the genre. It was definitely one of the first to, whether they were aware of what they were doing or not, wholeheartedly embrace all of the beloved 'rules' and themes of the slasher. It works as an 'official' template for them all. Now it's probably considered to be fairly standard stuff by most folks, but I for one love it. The dialogue and characterisation is more than a little on the hokey side, but the most endearing quality is the fantastic haunting atmosphere, the ever- present surroundings of the beautiful lake and foreboding woods are so eerie. And then there's the music, and the iconic 'Jason' noise, and crazy old hag Mrs.Voorhees with her blue sweater and big nasty dentures! Very sorry to hear that gal recently passed away. Such a novel twist how it was a little old lady doing it the whole time! You'd never see that one coming.. She's so game for it in the scenes where she's grappling with the enchanting Adrienne King until she famously turns the tables and lops off her head in one legendary moment of gore! All of the gruesome effects still look really well done, Tom Savini did such excellent work. Very nice and cruel. Oh wait, let me explain. I've always found that it's okay to 'enjoy' the slaughter of this film series in that each death is like the punchline to a macabre joke, and then so begins the buildup to the next one.. It's something akin to the carnival game where you shoot the ducks that pop up! The scariest part for me is when the girl goes out into the storm after hearing a child's distant cry of ~Help meeee!~ It gives me a chill every time I hear it. I don't like curtains being open at night. Somebody might be out in the dark, looking in. You can't see them, but they can see you. It really gives me the creeps. You never see her die, just hear her scream, and like when the annoying comic relief guy in the feather headdress is quietly finished off, I find it more unsettling when it's what you don't see, and your head fills in the rest! The cast speak fondly of their time working on the film and remember the good times they had, and I think that shows, it does have a certain enthusiasm about it. It kinda feels like this movie gets a free pass with me, forgiveness for all of its faults - because it's Friday the f*****g 13th man! It's such a romp, it always was. I think it's seminal horror viewing . There's a reason why this humble movie from 1980 with a cast of unknowns at the time, still lives on. It's suspenseful, it's funny and it's fun, and that jump scare with the boat at the end is one of the best in horror movie history! I'd like to see anything from today come close to such longevity. Most of those are forgotten on the way home from the cinema! An undeniable classic and essential for good spooky fun.

I don't like curtains being open at night. Somebody might be out in the dark, looking in. You can't see them, but they can see you. It really gives me the creeps. You never see her die, just hear her scream, and like when the annoying comic relief guy in the feather headdress is quietly finished off, I find it more unsettling when it's what you don't see, and your head fills in the rest! The cast speak fondly of their time working on the film and remember the good times they had, and I think that shows, it does have a certain enthusiasm about it. It kinda feels like this movie gets a free pass with me, forgiveness for all of its faults - because it's Friday the f*****g 13th man! It's such a romp, it always was. I think it's seminal horror viewing . There's a reason why this humble movie from 1980 with a cast of unknowns at the time, still lives on. It's suspenseful, it's funny and it's fun, and that jump scare with the boat at the end is one of the best in horror movie history! I'd like to see anything from today come close to such longevity. Most of those are forgotten on the way home from the cinema! An undeniable classic and essential for good spooky fun.

At first I thought one of the oranges would roll under her brake pedal and cause a wreck. When that didn't happen, I thought there might be some symbolism to the shot, as if we were meant to realize that Connie's life was running out of control like so much fresh produce rolling on the floorboard of an SUV. Maybe, or maybe it was pointless, like everything else in the film.Unfaithful is the latest Adrian Lyne flick to hit the big screen (and now DVD), and it isn't any better than or even as good as any of his previous efforts. Unlike Indecent Proposal, which explored basic consequences of an unusual situation, or Fatal Attraction, which explored unusual consequences of a basic situation, Unfaithful is basic all the way around woman has affair, husband begins to suspect. There's nothing here that hasn't been done a hundred times before and a hundred times better.Part of the problem is that we never really have a reason to make an emotional investment in the characters. Connie loves her family, true, but we don't really get to know her, and as a result, we never understand why she would fall for the suave Frenchman she literally bumps into on the street. Nor do we see enough of her husband to really empathize with him. We pity him, but that's a much less interesting emotion. Once the affair begins, Connie's days are filled with sex and her nights are filled with the occasional fear that she will be discovered and the nagging sense that what she's doing is wrong. Again, though, we don't understand why she began the affair or why she keeps it going. The whole thing seems to be based on sex, hardly making her a sympathetic character.Another problem is the direction. Adrian Lyne seems desperate to infuse the film with meaning, but he never succeeds. More than half the scenes feel completely pointless. The son, for example, has no significant role in the film whatsoever, yet his screen time rivals that of the lover. It may be important for us to see the innocent victims here, but in an art form in which every frame of film has to justify its existence, Lyne bogs the proceedings down with entire scenes that do nothing to expand the plot or the characters. Some may defend it by pointing to the realism of the scenes, but as Tom Clancy once said, real life is boring. If realism is indeed what Lyne was striving to achieve, I guess he succeeded.What Lyne does well is sex, and this film is full of it. I didn't realize I was going to be seeing a porno movie when I sat down to watch this, but with the basic plot and extremely explicit sexuality, I would have to say Unfaithful qualifies as one. Various positions, various locations, it's all here, and it's surprisingly graphic for a major motion picture, so be warned if you find such things offensive.The movie isn't all bad, though. Diane Lane's performance is excellent, especially in the train scene following her first illicit encounter. It's also nice to see Richard Gere playing a more insecure character than his gigolo persona. There's chemistry in all the scenes, and every relationship seems believable (even if we never fully understand the affair). Really, the only things that are truly awful about the film are the script and the direction, but those deficiencies are far too big for the cast to overcome. What we are left with is a well-acted movie that pushes the limits of what is permissible in an R-rated film but fails to expand any horizons.

Villard and James Nagel, this is an extremely effective and often very moving depiction of the teenage Ernest Hemingway's relationship with the 26-year-old nurse Agnes von Kurowsky in Italy during the latter stages of the First World War. They fell in love and were planning on getting married after the war ended but Agnes broke up with him as she thought that he was too young. The experience left an indelible mark on Hemingway and it directly inspired several of his works, most notably A Farewell to Arms. The film has a very strong script and it is extremely well and sensitively directed by Richard Attenborough, who was the obvious choice to handle this material. It bears some superficial similarities to his previous film Shadowlands in that it likewise concerns a famous author who has his first real experience of romantic love but then has to deal with the loss of that love, albeit in an extremely different way. It is not on the same level as that film, one of Attenborough's absolute best, but it nevertheless a very good film.Chris O'Donnell is very good as the 18\/19-year-old Hemingway. He is depicted as a brash, arrogant, headstrong young man who joined the Red Cross in search of adventure. Considering that it was the War to End All Wars, he did not believe that he would get another chance to fight. However, the reality of the situation hits home when he receives a severe leg wound in the process of saving a young Italian soldier named Roberto, who dies shortly thereafter. He is taken to an American Red Cross-run hospital where he meets Agnes, who is played very well by Sandra Bullock, for the first time. Hemingway is immediately smitten but she maintains a polite disinterest for him for some time until she realises that she has fallen for him as well. The two of them have a very sweet, understated romance. Seven years is not much of an age difference in most adult relationships but it's a very big one when it is between 19 and 26. Hemingway is very brave and certainly very intelligent but he is still a teenager and occasionally does stupid things, most notably when he lies to his friend and rival Harry Villard and says, in her presence, that he and Agnes slept together. She slaps in the face - I'd have probably done the same thing in her position - but eventually forgives him.The main problem is that Agnes is a mature woman while Hemingway is very immature in many respects. He rushes headlong into their relationship and proposes marriage with only a vague and fairly unrealistic plan for their post-war life. Given that she accepts his proposal, she is initially swept away by the romance of the situation but she soon develops doubts about it. When Villard tells Agnes that she will be good for him as she can take care of him, she points out that this is what his mother is for. While Agnes is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked, O'Donnell and Bullock have great chemistry and many of their scenes together, particularly the last one, are very affecting. The supporting cast is very good, particularly Emilio Bonucci as Hemingway's more serious romantic rival Dr. Domenico Caracciolo, Mackenzie Astin as Villard and Ingrid Lacey as Elsie MacDonald.The film was aptly titled as it also explores the horror of war, something which Attenborough previously did, albeit more extensively and effectively, in Oh! What a Lovely War and his masterpiece A Bridge Too Far. This is best handled in the case of Hemingway's friend Jimmy McBride, who suffers horrific injuries to most of his body. He eventually loses the will to live and commits suicide as the pain is just too great. The discovery of his body is the most moving scene in the entire film. As far as I can tell, McBride is an entirely fictional character so it is possible that his fate was intended as a reference to Hemingway's own suicide in 1961. Hemingway shows a softer side as well as his writing ability when he dictates the perfect letter to McBride's parents, supposedly from their son. It was a very kind thing to do.I've read several of Hemingway's novels but I am certainly not an expert on either his body of work or his life. However, I learned from a New York Times article published to mark the film's release that it took some liberties. In reality, according to her Dear John letter, she came to realise that she was very fond of him as a son rather than a sweetheart whereas she truly loved him in the romantic sense in the film. Their relationship is consummated in the film but they probably never did so in real life and the article argues that they were probably both virgins when they returned to the United States. I'm of two minds as to whether it was a good decision to have them sleep together in the film. Finally, they never saw each other after Agnes sent him the Dear John letter but they have one final meeting in the film. While the two of them never seeing each other again would have been a more poignant ending, their last brief encounter is necessary given the way that the film is structured. At the end of the film, Hemingway is as most people would picture him bearded, brooding and drinking.Overall, this is an extremely strong film on the subject of first love, doomed love and the problems associated with notable age gaps in relationships. That said, it is more of a February-March relationship than a May-December one! The film's biggest problem is that it loses a little bit of its momentum in the last 20 to 25 minutes.

Considering that it was the War to End All Wars, he did not believe that he would get another chance to fight. However, the reality of the situation hits home when he receives a severe leg wound in the process of saving a young Italian soldier named Roberto, who dies shortly thereafter. He is taken to an American Red Cross-run hospital where he meets Agnes, who is played very well by Sandra Bullock, for the first time. Hemingway is immediately smitten but she maintains a polite disinterest for him for some time until she realises that she has fallen for him as well. The two of them have a very sweet, understated romance. Seven years is not much of an age difference in most adult relationships but it's a very big one when it is between 19 and 26. Hemingway is very brave and certainly very intelligent but he is still a teenager and occasionally does stupid things, most notably when he lies to his friend and rival Harry Villard and says, in her presence, that he and Agnes slept together. She slaps in the face - I'd have probably done the same thing in her position - but eventually forgives him.The main problem is that Agnes is a mature woman while Hemingway is very immature in many respects. He rushes headlong into their relationship and proposes marriage with only a vague and fairly unrealistic plan for their post-war life. Given that she accepts his proposal, she is initially swept away by the romance of the situation but she soon develops doubts about it. When Villard tells Agnes that she will be good for him as she can take care of him, she points out that this is what his mother is for. While Agnes is not quite as strong a character as I would have liked, O'Donnell and Bullock have great chemistry and many of their scenes together, particularly the last one, are very affecting. The supporting cast is very good, particularly Emilio Bonucci as Hemingway's more serious romantic rival Dr. Domenico Caracciolo, Mackenzie Astin as Villard and Ingrid Lacey as Elsie MacDonald.The film was aptly titled as it also explores the horror of war, something which Attenborough previously did, albeit more extensively and effectively, in Oh! What a Lovely War and his masterpiece A Bridge Too Far. This is best handled in the case of Hemingway's friend Jimmy McBride, who suffers horrific injuries to most of his body. He eventually loses the will to live and commits suicide as the pain is just too great. The discovery of his body is the most moving scene in the entire film. As far as I can tell, McBride is an entirely fictional character so it is possible that his fate was intended as a reference to Hemingway's own suicide in 1961. Hemingway shows a softer side as well as his writing ability when he dictates the perfect letter to McBride's parents, supposedly from their son. It was a very kind thing to do.I've read several of Hemingway's novels but I am certainly not an expert on either his body of work or his life. However, I learned from a New York Times article published to mark the film's release that it took some liberties. In reality, according to her Dear John letter, she came to realise that she was very fond of him as a son rather than a sweetheart whereas she truly loved him in the romantic sense in the film. Their relationship is consummated in the film but they probably never did so in real life and the article argues that they were probably both virgins when they returned to the United States. I'm of two minds as to whether it was a good decision to have them sleep together in the film. Finally, they never saw each other after Agnes sent him the Dear John letter but they have one final meeting in the film. While the two of them never seeing each other again would have been a more poignant ending, their last brief encounter is necessary given the way that the film is structured. At the end of the film, Hemingway is as most people would picture him bearded, brooding and drinking.Overall, this is an extremely strong film on the subject of first love, doomed love and the problems associated with notable age gaps in relationships. That said, it is more of a February-March relationship than a May-December one! The film's biggest problem is that it loses a little bit of its momentum in the last 20 to 25 minutes. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"13 November 2015","score":"","review":" Based on the 1989 book Hemingway in Love and War by Henry S. Villard and James Nagel, this is an extremely effective and often very moving depiction of the teenage Ernest Hemingway's relationship with the 26-year-old nurse Agnes von Kurowsky in Italy during the latter stages of the First World War. They fell in love and were planning on getting married after the war ended but Agnes broke up with him as she thought that he was too young. The experience left an indelible mark on Hemingway and it directly inspired several of his works, most notably A Farewell to Arms. The film has a very strong script and it is extremely well and sensitively directed by Richard Attenborough, who was the obvious choice to handle this material. It bears some superficial similarities to his previous film Shadowlands in that it likewise concerns a famous author who has his first real experience of romantic love but then has to deal with the loss of that love, albeit in an extremely different way. It is not on the same level as that film, one of Attenborough's absolute best, but it nevertheless a very good film.Chris O'Donnell is very good as the 18\/19-year-old Hemingway.
