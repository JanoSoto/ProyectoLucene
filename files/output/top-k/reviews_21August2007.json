[{"date":"21 August 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Amy (Mira Sorvino) is a successful but overly-dedicated Manhattan architect. As she has become testy and depressed at work, at times, her colleagues at the firm insist she take a much-needed vacation. Amy heads for beautiful upstate New York, where she takes refuge at a spa-type resort. It is there that she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer), a talented masseur who restores her, body and soul, with his skilled hands. Amy is startled to soon realize that Virgil is blind, as he is quite capable on the job and elsewhere. Yet, she is drawn to him and they are soon quite in love. Virgil's caring but uptight sister (Kelly McGillis) is skeptical but understands Virgil's wish to move to New York City with Amy. Things get even more complex when Amy discovers that there may be an operation to restore Virgil's sight. Should he risk the surgery and its aftermath? This may be Kilmer's finest hour, as his Virgil is one of the best blind characters ever put on screen. His portrayal makes it clear that no sighted person can ever truly comprehend what blindness entails or what is truly best for the disabled person in general. Sorvino is lovely and touching as the woman who truly cares for Virgil but who finds it difficult to understand his overall situation. McGillis is excellent as the caretaker sister and Nathan Lane also shines in his role as a therapist to the disabled population. Everyone will also love the costumes, settings, and look of the film. In short, those who adore romantic dramas will not want to miss this one, as it is compelling story of true love. But, the movie's depiction of the disability of blindness is so first rate that anyone wishing to understand the unsighted should put this film on their A-list now.

Otherwise, it's the story of four Little Women growing up, and finding love's direction. Hepburn (she's Jo) is sister to Joan Bennett (she's Amy), Jean Parker (she's Beth), and Frances Dee (she's Meg). Of their suitors, Douglass Montgomery (he's Laurie) gets the most action.Ms. Bennett steals the actual acting honors with a performance that is natural and consistent; her voice and mannerisms are appropriately girlish, young womanish&#x85; and, selfish. Ms. Hepburn plays girlish like she's had too many cups of coffee; additionally, she never looks even remotely tomboyish; looking, instead, like a ravishingly made-up MGM movie star. Ms. Parker rises out of her sick bed like a zombie, but is okay in other scenes.Watching Hepburn being romanced by Mr. Montgomery and Paul Lukas is unnerving. The story does have some reasons to watch, however. The production is obviously top-of-the-line. Hepburn may not be in her best role, but it's not awful; she slows down and gets better after her character grows older. The script has well-written characters - Jo, Amy, and Laurie - who illustrate a sweet story of family, love, and friendship. ******* Little Women (11\/16\/33) George Cukor ~ Katharine Hepburn, Joan Bennett, Douglass Montgomery, Paul Lukas ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2007","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" The film might be more accurately titled Little Woman, with Katherine Hepburn seizing the lead role, and never letting go.

I doubt I am alone in viewing her professional legacy in the reverse as a great singer who happens to be an actress . . . director, producer, screenplay writer, musical score composer, humanitarian, and lately, concerned with using her production and direction talents to bring out important social issues (like ageism--The Living Century is about centurions--people a hundred years old or more).Yentl marks the beginning of a woman blazing a new trail as a director, singer, composer, her hands in the screenplay, and production. She's spoken in a segment on The Directors, about how various cultures have treated her as a result of her deliberate transcendence of Hollywood's gender-biased boundaries. One of her most interesting points reveals how well she was treated in England by the British filming crew. Since gender-bias against women is not even comparable to gender bias in the US, because England is so far advanced beyond gender discrimination because one is a woman, Streisand remarks how much easier it was for her to accomplish her goals on the set because the British film crew treated her without gender-bias, and with the respect she is certainly due.Yentl royally upset the AFI in the US because Streisand entered into no woman's land when she had a hand in nearly every aspect of the motion picture. Yentl has some of the most memorable, touching, humanely familiar music and lyrics, yet it received no Academy Award. The direction was brilliant--no Academy Award. The screenplay was one that was serious, hilarious, religious, spiritual, and even addressed the issues of gender-bias head on--no Academy Award. Streisand's and Amy Irving's acting was stupendous--no Academy Award.Streisand paved the way and took the non-recognition by the Film Academy without stopping. This musical motional picture pales many that are classics. The story is an extra interesting one, the likes of which have not been reproduced with anything close to as much skill and class.I'll give this classic about six Academy Awards, including several that go to Streisand alone.
