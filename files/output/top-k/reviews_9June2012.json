Requiem for a dream is the kind of movie that leaves you a bitter taste when you're done watching it. One of the geniuses behind this masterpiece is Darren Aronofsky, the movie director and the same person that gave us Pi, another personal favorite. Why did I say another? Take a wild guess.Now, I'm going to ask - not necessarily you - what's the difference between a speed junkie and someone addicted to food, TV, tabloids, you name it? What if there comes a moment when you can't distinguish what's real and what's an illusion because of your excessive hobby? I know it's a bit disturbing to picture someone massively hallucinating from reading too many pop magazines, but that was not the point. The point is that our sickened society hit a new milestone with its hypocrisy, becoming unable to make the difference between heroin addicts and TV potatoes. What's the connection with the present movie, you might wonder? Well, the main idea that Aronofsky (successfully) pictures is that there's no practical difference between ANY kind of addiction, be it crystal meth, junk food, or idiotic TV shows.Take a normal teen, right? Like any teen, he experiments. In some cases, he can even make a passion out of these little escapades. First some hash, then a little bit of snow, some speed now and then and he ends up with his own thing in no time! Mix up a good pal to help with business and an adorable girl with similar ambitions as our guy and the result is perfect. Did I mention the over-protective maa'? But aiming too high isn't good for business, neither for personal health. Can I be less specific than this? No? OK. To sum up the whole plot, this movie presents the lives of a junkie teen and his mama, starting from a point where things seem to be alright, if not fine, and ending up at a point where they are unrecognizable. Did I mention that the old's lady is a TV junkie? I don't know much about filming techniques, but I guess the best people gathered and formed the best filming crew ever, for this movie. For example, take the simple 1-2-3 technique. Integrated like it is in this movie, it makes wonders and takes the immersion to a whole new level. And the whole movie is built like this, which surprisingly doesn't make it boring one second. Add a marvelous soundtrack (including Clint Mansell's godlike Requiem for a dream, made special for this movie I think) and you have an equally astounding, exceptional and haunting movie.If you haven't figured it out yet, this is the kind of art that makes you think about certain things. Like a lot. If you don't decide to watch it after reading this - and my purpose wasn't to make you see it, really - at least consider this would you rather end up with an infected arm or enchained to an asylum bed? P.S. If you don't think the excess of TV crappy shows can be a menace, try to picture yourself taking so-called diet pills to get slim enough in order to fit again in her 20-years-old red dress. To be part of a show. A TV show. AND THE FRIDGE F***ING TRIES TO EAT YOU. Not kidding, watch and see for yourself.More details at the-movie-press DOT Blog Spot DOT com.

After doing new versions of The Little Princess and Great Expectations, he went back to Mexico and made Y tu mamá también, a film that proved he was among the best talents working in world cinema. In his Mexican films he has always worked with his brother Carlos, with whom he co-wrote both his first film and this fragmentary, good film that has different levels of interpretation. First it can be seen as a common sex-crazed youth comedy, but it belongs more appropriately to the anti-genre mode, as Robert Altman's caustic O.C. & Stiggs. Both films use elements from that sub-genre to comment on the status quo, class relations, sexual politics, warring ideologies and ecology. Y tu mamá también goes beyond that, thanks to a narrator who makes comments about everything Mexican and human, making it a universal reflection on existence. Also, the movie confronts moral values and iconography when it deals with sex, showing what most films suppress or sublimate, especially when they enter homo-erotic terrain. While lesbian scenes are commonplace in mainstream cinema, Cuarón does not fall into the trap of many filmmakers who cannot hide their homophobia or personal fears when they have to show two men's intimacy. Second, it also works as a rite de passage psychological melodrama, and as a film about gender confusion, which has been a fashionable topic for too long now. Wisely it does not capitalize on it as other films have done, turning themselves into campaigns to promote sexual ambiguity. In these times, there seem to be more confused or ambiguous people than certified homosexuals or lesbians, and young people have become natural targets of campaigns that benefit from this mess. The truth hits the two male leads, Julio (Gael García Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna), when they find themselves engaged in sex with Luisa, a foreign lady (Maribel Verdú) and with each other and, as in everyday life, they have to face the truth about humans' rich, complex and sometimes dark sexual nature, which sometimes brings break-ups, death or sorrow. But my favorite and most attractive level is a third one, in which I see its story as a metaphor of the predatory work done by the national and international agents of globalization in the so-called underdeveloped countries. This reading may be more meaningful to a Latin American, but the elements are there to consider its validity. The three main characters are introduced within their social, ideological and economic frames. The boy from upper middle class (Julio) who follow orders to keep up with the rich and powerful; the rich boy (Tenoch) who will follow the work of his elders, and the foreign lady (Luisa) whose initial attraction to the New World kids later becomes disdain, imposition of her rules and control over their bodies and souls. For some Luisa is the most endearing character I find her rapacious and two-faced, often hiding her motivations. My appreciation of this character is not motivated by xenophobia or misogyny it is simply based on direct observation of many international agents (male or female) working in Latin America. The three meet in the overblown wedding of a bourgeois couple, with the Mexican President as a guest of honor. Then they make a trip through the Mexican landscape where they witness the inner culture that market economy erodes in most countries. The cultural devastation finds barriers in countries with strong millenarian cultures, as Mexico. In this scenario, it's not a surprise that Tenoch decides to study economics, that Luisa is a Spaniard who is rotten inside (it does not matter if she is out of scene in the end, more agents will come to follow her work), and that Julio has not yet found a way to subsist in this ever-changing situation, with middle class in impoverishing conditions, due to ruthless economic measures taken by governments and international financing agencies. When the three engage in sexual rites, they have a striking effect on them. Sex &#x96;as suggested by Pasolini, Reich or De Sade&#x96; has a corrosive effect on bad consciousness. What the Cuarón brothers show is what is happening outside the minds and illusory, comfortable and acclimatized environments of the rich and famous, and their sycophants in the middle sectors. The Cuaróns are brave enough to show it without palliatives. Bravo! 10\/10.

This film won't be lost to time like tears in the rain. 8.9\/10 ","genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"9 June 2012","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" IMDb Top 250 115Note This is a review of The Final Cut.Don't be deceived by Harrison Ford's face and the bright neon signs you will find no happiness in Blade Runner. Unapologetically draining, Blade Runner sees LA, 2019 as a packed slum of flying cars, advertisements and an especially Asian influx of culture. There is a hanging mood of decay, of uncaring, and it creates an empty feeling. Blade Runner is extraordinarily atmospheric. Also there's robots, and the robots- replicants- are a problem.Thus, the blade runners were created, police force (executioners) who retire (kill) illegal replicants on Earth. Deckard is one such hunter, played by Harrison Ford in his least macho and most vulnerable major role. He returns from (is forced out of) retirement to find and terminate 4 replicants, and this task composes the plot of the film.Despite the future setting, Blade Runner is an old school noir at heart, with a flawed protagonist,important setting, and menacing villains. It's the next generation of noir, both in the film and real life. Both in content and aesthetically, Blade Runner is ahead of the curve. The cheese of certain 80's sci-fi is non existent here, and I'm not sure if that relates to the DVD I have or if the film is just extra gorgeous. There's a certain aura of primitive technology with films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Terminator that just isn't in this film. The cinematography and art design is magnificent, as well as Vangelis' electronic score.This serious film is filled with serious characters. Leading is the aforementioned Deckard, a victim of his city he is constantly in a state of melancholy, and often found with a drink in his hand. He hasn't found what to do with himself, and it's so absorbing to see Ford in a weakened state. His prey, the replicants are also intriguing in their own ways Batty, Pris and Leon. The all bring something different, a different angle. I won't even get into Batty's final, mission stating speech.One of the best things about sci-fi is that it can work with material that no other genre can. Blade Runner is outrageously packed with symbols and metaphors, such as eyes and origami. The film is filled with themes and open to many interpretations. I believe that all sci-fi can be applied to the present or past, and saw this situation as a parallel to post- Civil War America and found the ultimate message being that all life is precious, and that when we die things indescribable die with us.
