The acting is convincing enough, the plot is good and creep, plus the effects aren't too bad, even with David Allen gone, and some of the archive footage fits in alright I guess. The best role in the film is Doctor Magrew, played by George Peck. He turns in a great performance, being creepy and just slightly off, which works great for the movie. And most of the other roles are played well too. There are also a few dumb lines that are very funny and many creepy moments. So in all a quite good, especially with full moon falling through, and David Allen being gone. A great edition to the series.
