I recently went to see it in the theatre to figure out why. It's impossible to judge this movie on a grand scale, since there are so many little intricacies.Storyline Less than fresh. Three brothers die, so a team of men is sent to find the remaining brother to take him home. Uh-huh, yeah, that's realistic. This movie basically has no storyline. It's just a bunch of dialogue strung together in the hopes that someone will make sense out of it all.Casting While each one of the actors cast in the role did an admirable job (with particular notice going to Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, who were both extremely impressive), I'd be interested in knowing why Spielberg thought he couldn't go within ten miles of reality. I'm sorry, but the average age of a soldier during WWII was not 35. It was 20. It's a sad, sad day when a 22-yr-old Giovanni Ribisi is the closest thing Spielberg has to a realistic soldier.Emotional Reality In as far as getting the reactions of soldiers, Spielberg did a fairly good job. Yes, war is Hell, which is what Spielberg showed with his message that war could turn any man into a monster. Too bad he killed it with chain of command. Those officers were just a tad too willing to scream at their CO's.Physical Reality There are a lot of complaints about the Americanism of the film. Of COURSE the film is Americanised! The only unit that actually managed to land anywhere near Omaha Beach was American. While it is asking a little much to expect viewers to believe that the troops never ran into troops from any other army, I don't think Spielberg wanted to test his luck. He couldn't get his OWN country's uniforms A-OK, let alone another country's.Truthfulness We ALL know that there is absolutely no fact in this movie whatsoever. Spielberg may have originally touted this as the true story of the Niland brothers, but he recanted long ago, since it's obvious it wasn't. (If it was, they'd have gotten at least one fact in that story right.)Military Reality I'm with the experts on this one. A little less flash and trash there, Spielberg, and make an effort next time to get the right kind of weaponry. And BTW, Spielberg, no army would risk losing eight men to get one home, even if he was the president's son.Cinematic Worth Excellent. While the direction at times was a little choppy and left something to be desired, this was still an excellent movie.Most people who are dissatisfied with this movie are probably those who expected to see a true story. Sorry, but you got the wrong war movie of 1998 -- the true story is in The Thin Red Line, which in itself is an excellent war movie. Now sure, I admit, I spent half the movie hoping Matt Damon's character would get it in the end, but I was still extremely satisfied. (I did have to practically hold my great-uncles, both of whom were at Normandy, down to get them to stay -- both wanted to leave in disgust with Spielberg's Hollywoodization and capitalization on this horrific event.) It was well worth going to see in the theatre, and I don't often do that. I do think, though, that the movie will be highly disappointing once on video, because it's the kind of movie one NEEDS to see in a theatre.Altogether? It's not the best movie of the year, but it's not the worst. It's an excellent fictional account of what life COULD have been like in WWII for a group of soldiers. If you want reality, watch The Thin Red Line, but if you enjoy fictionalized war films like SPR, check out any of the films available in the War section of your local video store. Well, okay, so maybe Rambo isn't the thing to go for, but there are a number of excellent movies out there.

Three brothers die, so a team of men is sent to find the remaining brother to take him home. Uh-huh, yeah, that's realistic. This movie basically has no storyline. It's just a bunch of dialogue strung together in the hopes that someone will make sense out of it all.Casting While each one of the actors cast in the role did an admirable job (with particular notice going to Edward Burns and Barry Pepper, who were both extremely impressive), I'd be interested in knowing why Spielberg thought he couldn't go within ten miles of reality. I'm sorry, but the average age of a soldier during WWII was not 35. It was 20. It's a sad, sad day when a 22-yr-old Giovanni Ribisi is the closest thing Spielberg has to a realistic soldier.Emotional Reality In as far as getting the reactions of soldiers, Spielberg did a fairly good job. Yes, war is Hell, which is what Spielberg showed with his message that war could turn any man into a monster. Too bad he killed it with chain of command. Those officers were just a tad too willing to scream at their CO's.Physical Reality There are a lot of complaints about the Americanism of the film. Of COURSE the film is Americanised! The only unit that actually managed to land anywhere near Omaha Beach was American. While it is asking a little much to expect viewers to believe that the troops never ran into troops from any other army, I don't think Spielberg wanted to test his luck. He couldn't get his OWN country's uniforms A-OK, let alone another country's.Truthfulness We ALL know that there is absolutely no fact in this movie whatsoever. Spielberg may have originally touted this as the true story of the Niland brothers, but he recanted long ago, since it's obvious it wasn't. (If it was, they'd have gotten at least one fact in that story right.)Military Reality I'm with the experts on this one. A little less flash and trash there, Spielberg, and make an effort next time to get the right kind of weaponry. And BTW, Spielberg, no army would risk losing eight men to get one home, even if he was the president's son.Cinematic Worth Excellent. While the direction at times was a little choppy and left something to be desired, this was still an excellent movie.Most people who are dissatisfied with this movie are probably those who expected to see a true story. Sorry, but you got the wrong war movie of 1998 -- the true story is in The Thin Red Line, which in itself is an excellent war movie. Now sure, I admit, I spent half the movie hoping Matt Damon's character would get it in the end, but I was still extremely satisfied. (I did have to practically hold my great-uncles, both of whom were at Normandy, down to get them to stay -- both wanted to leave in disgust with Spielberg's Hollywoodization and capitalization on this horrific event.) It was well worth going to see in the theatre, and I don't often do that. I do think, though, that the movie will be highly disappointing once on video, because it's the kind of movie one NEEDS to see in a theatre.Altogether? It's not the best movie of the year, but it's not the worst. It's an excellent fictional account of what life COULD have been like in WWII for a group of soldiers. If you want reality, watch The Thin Red Line, but if you enjoy fictionalized war films like SPR, check out any of the films available in the War section of your local video store. Well, okay, so maybe Rambo isn't the thing to go for, but there are a number of excellent movies out there.

I was highly anticipating it, and the movie does leave a mark on you, but nothing struck me as particularly good in this film. The movie is a violent, seedy mess of ideas and morals.  I've never seen any film go this far with its adult underworld plot, but yet the film seems to manufacture its horrors in some slick Hollywood way that I can't put my finger on.  If somebody wanted to do a film on hardcore S&M, or even the legend of the snuff film, I think that picture would be about 5 hours long - there's just so much material.  But `8mm' picks and chooses its fights rather amateurishly. Touching only on what is necessary to keep the attention span of the mostly single male audience. Nicholas Cage is, has, and will be a breath of fresh air on the big screen.  I love his `do or die' acting style, it's endlessly entertaining.  But here you can see the seams of his performance.Hard to believe, but you can tell when Cage is acting.  It was a weird feeling that I couldn't lose during the remainder of the movie.  It's a stiff performance that, I think, should have included more dread and sorrow.  Schumacher also lets things slip by casting VERY familiar names in parts they ALWAYS play.  JamesGandolfini and Peter Stormare as a evil pornographers?  They give performances that we have seen them do better before. The masterful Catherine Keener is stuck with a lame role as Cage's wife. She can only sit on a bed and coo `Oh, Tom' so many times before you weep to what her career has come to.  Only Joaquin Phoenix registers here with a deft and charming performance as a porno shop clerk with connections.  After viewing the film, what are we supposed to take from it?  By having Cage exact revenge on everybody, he could easily be considered as evil as the snuff filmmakers.  The film tries to hide behind a complex issue and to present itself as the film daring to go over the line, yet when Nicholas Cage endures a second `I can't quite reach my gun' moment of tension, you then know that this is a Joel Schumacher film and nothing more.And how this mean and dark film gets an R rating, yet the good-spirited and violence free `Orgazmo' receives an NC-17???It's the most unjust ruling I have ever seen.

But that film had real people interacting in a real way.  This film, the best film I saw in 1997, is his most human film yet.  It takes the tragedy of every parent's nightmare - losing your child - magnifies it, with a bus crash that kills 14 children and paralyzes another, and deals with it without being exploitative.  The novel by Russell Banks is emotionally direct and while Egoyan tempers some of that to avoid sentiment, it's still direct and powerful.The way the narrative weaves from past to present before we see the crash (after which it's pretty straightforward) captures the unease the town feels after the crash, and how each of the characters is caught in some sort of flux.  The way Egoyan handles the problem of narration (the novel is narrated in five chapters by four of the characters; Dolores (Gabrielle Rose) the bus driver, Billy Ansell (Bruce Greenwood), who witnessed the crash, Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) the lawyer, and Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), the only survivor besides Dolores) by eliminating Billy's, instead depending on Greenwood to show on his face what Billy said in the novel, which he does, using Dolores' testimony as narration, using Mitchell's conversation with Alison, the friend of his daughter, as narration and subtext of his actions, and using Nicole's telling of the Pied Piper story as subtext to her actions.  So we get what we need from the novel's narration without it feeling unnecessary.Egoyan is known primarily as an urban or suburban filmmaker, and most of the actors are known for work in urban or suburban films or TV shows, but they all fit into this small town, and you get a sense of the pallor hanging over the town even before you see the crash.  And Holm is a perfect representation of not only the town's helpless rage, but also his own helpless rage (he fights not only for the town, but because he can't save his daughter).  Polley is a revelation here, for she's the most idealized character, being the only survivor, and the voice of truth (ironic how she has to tell a lie to tell the truth), and yet she never plays on our sympathies, but earns them.Two other notes; it's a neat symmetry that in both EXOTICA and this film, Polley plays a babysitter for Greenwood, and after seeing this film in a theater in Toronto it had been playing in for several weeks, I left the theater, looked at some of the posters outside it, and who should I see but Egoyan walking past.

Polley is a revelation here, for she's the most idealized character, being the only survivor, and the voice of truth (ironic how she has to tell a lie to tell the truth), and yet she never plays on our sympathies, but earns them.Two other notes; it's a neat symmetry that in both EXOTICA and this film, Polley plays a babysitter for Greenwood, and after seeing this film in a theater in Toronto it had been playing in for several weeks, I left the theater, looked at some of the posters outside it, and who should I see but Egoyan walking past.  I ran up to him and told him how much I loved the movie, and he shook my hand and said thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Egoyan.

I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting, but it's not the attempt that counts.  I found the film dull, boring, and stretched out.  The acting was nothing spectacular.  Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films.  Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above.  The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However, that shot was very Usual Suspectsish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat.  Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this.

In a very touching, and personal, film Kevin Smith has outdone himself.  Changing his style a bit he finally makes a movie that takes place in more than one day - he has made a REAL movie.  Not that there was anything wrong with Clerks.  I loved Clerks for its simplicity, but this was just... wow.  Not being a big fan of Ben Affleck I was completely impressed by him in this movie.  Also with Joey Lauren Adams I was moved - yes her voice is a little too much and you can start the movie thinking am I going to have to listen to her for the whole movie!  but it doesn't become an issue, in fact I grew to love her voice.  The movie was very true to life - it didn't give us a fake, Hollywood ending, it was true to the situation.  Sure maybe people don't like to see something a little sad or realistic, but I think Mr. Smith handled it just fine.  And his cameo as Silent Bob was perfect - much longer than his others, but just right.  I congratulate you Mr. Smith and look forward to Dogma.

If you thought Cage was too energetic in Snake Eyes'(anybody seen Gary Sinise since?) in 8MM Cage shows Zoloft really does work. Nick is as slow and pained as the last man in the unemployment line. Keneer...nice girl,weak role, not her fault. Joaquin Phoenix is the only one with a target who gives it a real shot. The rest the of the cast runs around on the screen with no particular place to go. An heiress who can't be believed, a porn director who isn't evil enough, a smut peddler who isn't much worse than the local deli owner, a lawyer who's a scum bag, and a porn actor, sex fiend, murderer accountant. Five minutes with a camcorder in front of my apartment building and you've got the same thing.What bothers me the most about this film is that the story is so blatantly stolen from the Lawrence Block novel A Dance at the Slaughter House and not in a good way.

The voice-overs gave us insight into what the characters were thinking, feeling, etc.  The acting was superb, particularly Nolte and Penn.  The nature shots were insightful and beautiful.
