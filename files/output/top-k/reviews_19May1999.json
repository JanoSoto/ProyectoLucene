A little note of caution; I'm a die-hard fan, so it would be hard for me to give this movie a bad review. Frankly, they could have shown ninety minutes of R2-D2 rolling down a hill or outtakes from the other films and I probably would have liked it. So of course I asked for the day off and saw the second show on opening day.That being said, I might as well get my negative remarks out of the way. Here they areThe movie started slow. It took me a little while to really get into it - I don't think I was that excited about what was going on for at least the first twenty minutes or so. But once things really got moving, I was loving every minute of it. So - if you think you aren't liking the film, wait a little while and give it a chance. It picks up. There was a significant dose of corniness. This was especially noticeable in the character of Jar-Jar Binks, an alien that teams up with our heroes early on. He's your typical cutesy comic-relief character, and frequently says silly things in an attempt to squeeze out some cheap laughs. He's clutzy and a little dim-witted, which is funny enough without some of his stupid (in my opinion) lines. If I want to hear someone say How rude! in a cute childish voice ad nauseum, I'll watch reruns of the Olsen twins on Full House, thankyouverymuch.Okay, now that I got that over with, let me say that I loved this film. The battle scenes were fantastic, the special effects phenomenal. As always, John Williams' musical score was terrific, adding a pulse to the movie. And the story itself was well-done. I've heard it said that this movie was really just a set-up for the next two, but really it works great as a stand-alone film. There wasn't a real cliffhanger to force you to come back for the next episode, but there was enough groundwork laid down to leave you begging for more.There were some scenes that may be scary for small children (say, under seven years old) but I might just try to brace my daughter for them and bring her anyway (she's almost five). There was enough about the film that a child can relate to without making it a kid's movie; I think she'll like it. At the very least, it's an excuse for me to see the movie again.I've been following the progress of this movie during its entire production, reading every article, every Internet posting I could find, and even reading the spoilers that have found their way to the web. In a way, I felt a little guilty about knowing a lot of the plot in advance, but when you're as starved for a dose of the Force as I was, it's hard not to. Still, I was happily surprised that not every significant turn of events was leaked. For example (not to give anything away, hopefully), I knew in advance that one character wasn't going to make it to the next film, if you know what I'm saying. That, to me, was the spoiler of all spoilers. But there's at least one event as significant as that which I wasn't aware of.I guess I can't keep writing without giving more of the film away, so I'll end things here. In summary, this was a great film for die-hard fans and newcomers alike. I strongly recommend this movie, and give it nine stars (out of ten). I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

The opening credits rolled - we were all screaming with delight.  I was nearly in tears. Amazing!  To think I was actually seeing a new Star Wars movie!My reactions to the movie are nearly all good.  It was interesting how the Jedi were portrayed.  From the original trilogy, we knew that they were once an important part of the galaxy, but we never really knew how.  Now we get to see how they used to be, to see what they were before they were destroyed by Darth Vader.  Let's examine the characters.  First, Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn.  He was absolutely fantastic!!  I knew he would be.  I've always admired his acting ability.  I have no complaints at all about him. WOW!  His death scene was good, VERY good.  I was sobbing all the way through the end credits.  Both he and Ewan McGregor did a stupendous job. I had my doubts about Ewan as I went in, I had none as I left.  His character was a little underdeveloped, but I say that because I know what his character becomes in Episodes IV-VI.  That's the problem with already knowing the end of a story.  His character should be developed much more fully in the next two.  He did an excellent job of showing his grief for a dying friend who had really been a father to him.  Oh, and let's not forget that these two men had nice accents. )JarJar.  What can I say about him?  People I talked to had portrayed him as so utterly despicable that he was beyond all hope of liking.  I didn't have a very good opinion of him from the trailers either.  He turned out to be less annoying than I had anticipated, though.  Still, I think far too much focus was given to him.  At times, I felt like his dialogue was inappropriate to the scene, and was just added because they wanted him to be noticed.  I feel like, unfortunately, George has resorted to some shallow humor regarding this character.  Why must he be a bumbling, clumsy fellow? It's almost a cliche.  It was too much.Anakin was somewhat of a disappointment, mostly because I had expected him to be different.  That is the problem with excessive hype about movies - we get our preconceived ideas about characters, plot points, etc., and when the movie is different we don't like it.  He was a very believable child, but at the same time I didn't think he carried the seriousness and maturity that a child slave would have.  Of course, this could be attributed to the scriptwriters.  His outbursts of Yippee! bothered me because I wanted him to be different, but if I ignore my preconceived ideas, he did a pretty good job.  Plus, he's a cute kid!I'm eternally jealous of Natalie Portman.  She's so beautiful and she's a splendid actress.  She did the split role well.  Ian McDiarmid did a wonderful job playing a seemingly good senator on the surface with evil intentions underneath.  Ray Parks... WOW!  He far exceeded my expectations. He was SO GREAT!  And let's not forget his menacing facial expressions. The first time he appeared I caught my breath.  As a villain, he demanded attention and was very, very effective.  Some people have complained that he should have been more like Darth Vader, but I'm proud of George Lucas for being able to create different kinds of villains.Which brings me to the duel!  Can I just say I was completely taken in by this?  It was the most breathtaking duel I have EVER seen, Star Wars-wise or otherwise.  It was incredible.  This was a very fitting end to the movie. This scene alone made the whole thing worth it.  Not that the rest wasn't worth it, but for those who can do nothing but complain about the movie, they need to see it for this scene.  Fast-paced, tragic, awe-inspiring all at once.The pod race was enjoyable in every aspect except one.  I hated the announcer.  That was an unnecessary character cliche, and I didn't find him funny at all.I thought the plot point explaining the Force scientifically was interesting.  I'm still contemplating my reactions to throwing this in. I'm not sure if it was necessary, but I think I did like it.I would have liked to have seen more of the Jedi Council.  I was looking forward to seeing Yaddle, among others, but we never got to know him at all. Samuel L. Jackson was superb in his role.  I do wish he could have had a little more screen time, but again, his character will be more developed in the next episodes.The costumes were gorgeous!  Bravo!  The music was astounding.  Perfect. Wonderful.  John Williams is nothing short of a genius.  Duel of the Fates - Mmmm...  Truly moving.  And finally, the special effects.  I was surprisingly impressed.  I used to cringe at the mention of computer animated characters.  This movie has believable CGI characters.  The sets were beautiful as well.  It all fit together into a believable galaxy. Naboo was breathtakingly beautiful!  It is indeed a breakthrough in movie technology, and once again, George Lucas was the first to do it.  I have to add, though, that the real, physical characters are who I ultimately ended up caring for.  CGI characters will never be quite as human (for the lack of a better term).As for the story itself, of course it leaves loose ends.  It's supposed to. It's comparable to A New Hope.  It's overall an exciting, happy movie that promises more to come.So yes, there were a few things I would like to have been different.  I expected that.  Overall though, a fabulous movie.

I think it may be because the characters don't really connect with each other the way they did in the first movie. I see what some others are saying about stilted dialogue and unimaginative plot elements, and yeah, those are factors, too. There weren't any lines that really tugged at me, or sent shivers down my spine, or moved me to spontaneous laughter. I really only cared about the characters because I already knew where they were heading- if this were truly the first movie, I don't know how much I'd have emotionally invested in their fate. For example (mild spoiler follows), in Episode IV, when Ben Kenobi is struck down by Darth Vader, it's a very real, poignant moment. We've come to care about him throughout the movie, we know how Luke feels about him, we have good reasons for hating Darth Vader, the music swells up... hopefully, you know what I mean. In Phantom Menace, when an extremely similar scene took place, I just didn't care as much. The lightsaber duel scenes were thrilling, to say the least, but the emotional investment in the characters just wasn't there.My biggest criticism has to be with the handling of the character Jar Jar Binks. I can understand how he would appeal to children- though I found him thoroughly annoying- but the worst part about it was that he was in *way* too much of this movie. I know one of Lucas' kids named the character, but I wish he hadn't felt so obligated to put Jar Jar in nearly *every* scene. He is a completely one-dimensional character, whose one schtick of mispronouncing things and haplessly flailing around was stupid enough at first but was far worse when it was endlessly repeated throughout the movie. All the on-screen time- and $$ on digital effects- that were lavished on Jar Jar could have been better spent in so many other ways. There were other characters who could have been fleshed out more Neeson's character, who never really gets a decent background, the interplay between him and his apprentice Obi-Wan, Darth Maul who basically swings a lightsaber and does nothing else... all of these characters were much more interesting and should have been better developed. I think we really lost something there.The Star Wars movies have a universal appeal. So why do we need stuff like Jar Jar and the Pod-racing sports commentator who says things like That had to hurt...? I feel those kinds of additions are just pandering to the lowest common denominator, and it really hurts the movie. Keep the movie at a higher level, and people will rise to the occasion. Create stronger characters, give them better dialogue and interactions, and that, more so than all the CG effects, will create another legendary movie. I sincerely hope we see more of that in the next two installments.

Considering the hype and expectations of this film, you could be certain that a number of reviewers would be exceedingly tough on the film.  Well, ignore all of that.  If you enjoyed any of the previous installments of Star Wars then you'll enjoy The Phantom Menace.We all know George Lucas and his style of storytelling... let's just say that he speaks better with visuals than with words.  But what visuals! This has got to be the most visually stunning film ever made.  Lucas has done on film what Tolkien did in novels... created a wholly believable, realistic universe.  To be able to translate that to film and to do so convincingly is an amazing achievement.  Chances are that you'll find yourself wanting to see this film a couple of extra times just to see all of the scenery, creatures, the pod race, and the light saber duels again.The dialogue isn't exactly Shakespeare, and the character development and relationships aren't exactly deep.  Then again, the Star Wars series isn't about that sort of thing.  Shakespeare in Space might be an interesting idea, but its time has yet to come!  What we have in Menace is a decent script with solid characters, respectable acting and a heavy reliance on visual storytelling ... by the way, this is also what we had with the other Star Wars films.  We might gripe a bit about how the story is too adult for kids and too childish for adults, but that's something that we can live with, considering the end product.My biggest gripe about SWTPM concerns the comic relief character, Jar Jar Binks.  He is at times irritatingly childish, and made me recall how I thought the Ewoks really detracted from Return of the Jedi.  He does manage to be amusing at times, but his accented English was so muddled that I didn't understand 1\/4 of what he said.  Also, his body movements smacked of a computer-generated effect, and not so much a living, breathing being.  I found myself wanting less Binks silliness.A minor gripe is the short-lived career of Darth Maul, who made for quite the menacing, animalistic, evil dark force.  He had great potential as a precursor to Darth Vader's dark side.  But his on-screen time was exciting, and his light saber duels were eye-popping and thrilling.In the end, this film isn't going to satisfy the viewer who thinks Ingmar Bergman is the greatest thing in filmmaking.  However, any viewer who enjoyed the previous Star Wars films will be very pleased with Menace. This is a movie for fans, not for critics, and it should enjoy much-deserved great success.  When the film is over, and you're swimming in a sea of fantastic images, excited thoughts of what will come in the next film, and trying to figure out when you'll come back to see Menace again, you'll realize that you were entertained for 2 hours and the time flew by.

Considering the hype and expectations of this film, you could be certain that a number of reviewers would be exceedingly tough on the film.  Well, ignore all of that.  If you enjoyed any of the previous installments of Star Wars then you'll enjoy The Phantom Menace.We all know George Lucas and his style of storytelling... let's just say that he speaks better with visuals than with words.  But what visuals! This has got to be the most visually stunning film ever made.  Lucas has done on film what Tolkien did in novels... created a wholly believable, realistic universe.  To be able to translate that to film and to do so convincingly is an amazing achievement.  Chances are that you'll find yourself wanting to see this film a couple of extra times just to see all of the scenery, creatures, the pod race, and the light saber duels again.The dialogue isn't exactly Shakespeare, and the character development and relationships aren't exactly deep.  Then again, the Star Wars series isn't about that sort of thing.  Shakespeare in Space might be an interesting idea, but its time has yet to come!  What we have in Menace is a decent script with solid characters, respectable acting and a heavy reliance on visual storytelling ... by the way, this is also what we had with the other Star Wars films.  We might gripe a bit about how the story is too adult for kids and too childish for adults, but that's something that we can live with, considering the end product.My biggest gripe about SWTPM concerns the comic relief character, Jar Jar Binks.  He is at times irritatingly childish, and made me recall how I thought the Ewoks really detracted from Return of the Jedi.  He does manage to be amusing at times, but his accented English was so muddled that I didn't understand 1\/4 of what he said.  Also, his body movements smacked of a computer-generated effect, and not so much a living, breathing being.  I found myself wanting less Binks silliness.A minor gripe is the short-lived career of Darth Maul, who made for quite the menacing, animalistic, evil dark force.  He had great potential as a precursor to Darth Vader's dark side.  But his on-screen time was exciting, and his light saber duels were eye-popping and thrilling.In the end, this film isn't going to satisfy the viewer who thinks Ingmar Bergman is the greatest thing in filmmaking.  However, any viewer who enjoyed the previous Star Wars films will be very pleased with Menace. This is a movie for fans, not for critics, and it should enjoy much-deserved great success.  When the film is over, and you're swimming in a sea of fantastic images, excited thoughts of what will come in the next film, and trying to figure out when you'll come back to see Menace again, you'll realize that you were entertained for 2 hours and the time flew by.  I wish I could say that about most movies I see.

The last time I felt so good after seeing a movie and to relate so much to it was when I saw Trainspotting. SLC Punk! and Trainspotting are movies that totally give me the sense of association about art imitating life. SLC's most definitively not for everyone. It's too simple for regular individuals with complicated minds to get the meaning. How much I wish I could have seen and lived that moment back in the late 70s and early 80s. But, I'll just have to be content enough; when I went through my so called punk and rebellious years, those original hard core and punk songs were around to give us that bit more power and attitude. SLC Punk! plainly states; that people like me, the so called outcast, social misfit and weirdo need to realize if we really want to damage the system, we don't need to wear an outfit. The clothing only gives you a character. That's it. The power is to be mentally an anarchist. If you want to screw the world of the trendy and fake people, the 9 to 5 corporate blood suckers, the owners of 3 dozen major credit cards, etc., unfortunately you need to be part of their world and work it from the inside out. At the sad end, this movie leaves you with realistic thoughts about the system, good morals from a different point of view and with the hope that more movies would be made as simple, funny and real as this one. I can compare SLC Punk! to this other movie called Get Real. Even though these two films are on the opposite side of the spectrum, they have a lot in common; especially when both movies show how hard it is to be yourself and to be accepted by society that still stuck in the dark ages. Go see SLC with a person that went through that period and really knows what a punk and an anarchist were all about.

Some people have been waiting for its release ever since Lucas announced the trilogy of prequels was underway.  Unfortunately, this much time of anticipation means many people may have gotten their hopes raised a little too high.  Don't get me wrong--this film definitely works as far as the Star Wars movies go, but just not quite as well as the earlier films did. I hesitate to say this is the worst film of them, because I did like it, and I liked all the others.  It's just that each of the other three were better, though not by too much.  Not having ever had to wait for the release of one of the original films, I don't know how different they would have seemed to me if I did.  But this film did have its share of flaws.There were moments in the film that seemed put there for no other purpose than to get applause from the audience, though it may have seemed that way partly because it did get applause.  There didn't seem to really be a point to having a cameo appearance by Jabba the Hutt, for example.  Also, apparently someone couldn't resist the temptation to make I have a bad feeling about this one of the first lines in the film.  Perhaps that will get it out of their system for the remainder of the trilogy.  Another thing is that in this film, some of the action sequences seemed a little too segregated from the rest of the movie, as if it were a video game.  When some action sequences started, instead of just letting it happen, it practically spelled it out for you before starting, as if they didn't give the audience enough credit.  At one point in the film, Anakin Skywalker is told to hide somewhere safe, so he chooses the cockpit of a fighter.  As if that's not obvious enough, Obi-Wan tells him whatever he does, stay in that cockpit, and there is a brief pause so people can figure out where this is leading, as if we couldn't tell.  But the lightsaber duel definitely lived up to those scenes in the first films, with the twist of having it be a three-way fight, between Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Darth Maul (Peter Serafinowicz), and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson both do excellent jobs in their roles. McGregor faces the challenge of living up to the standards Alec Guinness left him, but I've always thought he was a good actor, and he does the job well.  Anakin Skywalker is played by Jake Lloyd, who's about a nine-year-old.  I tried to suspend a little disbelief for his sake, since this is his first role in a movie, and nobody is expecting him to be the best actor in the film, but there were moments where it was just too distracting because he'd say something that sounded like no more than a line-reading, and he seemed to have no emotion behind what he was saying. Hopefully it won't be as big of a problem in the next film.  Darth Maul, this film's equivalent of Darth Vader, manages to strike at least almost as much terror as Vader did.  He doesn't have many lines in the film, but it is made up for in the fight scenes, when he shows off his speed.The film draws many equivalents to A New Hope, with George Lucas back in the director's chair.  There is a similar ending sequence, with the heroes standing before everyone and a celebration taking place.  The climax consists of a lightsaber duel, a space battle, and a ground battle, sort of like the climax of Return of the Jedi.  It was almost as good a final battle scene, but didn't last as long.  It is one thing that may have been a little disappointing to the people who have been eagerly awaiting the film for so long, because some might have been expecting it to dwarf all the other films' climaxes, but was as good a battle as those in the other films. Despite the fact that this is the film to follow the largest gap between release dates of the Star Wars films, the first film shouldn't be expected to be the greatest of them all anyway, because it is largely exposition for those people seeing it before any of the other films, but it does a good enough job to be Episode 1 of a 6 part (maybe more) saga.  Like A New Hope this starts out with a lot of exposition instead of just plunging into battle as in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, but because this film is at least almost as good as A New Hope, I have a feeling Episode 2 will be even better, as was The Empire Strikes Back.

However I also have a hobby of giving movie reviews, so just before the movie started I forced myself to consider this just a normal movie until I'd seen it. With all the mixed reviews that have been thrown around in the last couple of weeks I got pretty nervous that Phanton Mennace would suck. Fortunately it definitely did not. Lets start with the best part of the movie and I hate to repeat what everyone else has already said but I will, the special effects. Visually this movie is nothing less than spectacular, the underwater scene was stunning, the lightsaber battle at the end was the best one yet, the pod race was one of the coolest things I have ever seen in my life (even people who hated the movie liked that part), the creatures were seamless, and the ships were overwhelming. Lucas and ILM didn't leave out any details no matter how small, the shadows, the light coming from different angles, the chrome on shiny ships, take a look it's all there. Everyone always cuts down on the acting but I didn't think it was bad at all, Neeson was really good as usual, McGreggor was playing a very different role than he's used to but he still did a good job, Portman was great, she was one of the big highlights of the film, Lloyd wasn't as bad as people made him out to be, I mean come on people, the kid's only eight how good do you expect him to be? The plot seemed a little bit weird considering the whole thing was about trade taxation, doesn't really seem like a star wars plot does it? But I'm pretty confident that everything will get straightened out in the next two films. My biggest complaint about the movie was a floppy eared alien named Jar Jar Binks, this character was just flat out stupid, I really think he should have been left out of the picture entirely, I couldn't believe that Lucas would throw in a character that bad just for a few laughs from his 6 year old audience. Another smaller flaw in the movie was the incredible luck all the characters had, when they're underwater a big fish attacks them and a bigger fish eats it, then they get attacked again and the same fish eats the second one. Also there's a part where Jar Jar Binks gets his foot attached to the wires of a downed attack droid and when he tries to shake it off the blaster in the dead droid's hands goes off three times killing three more droids, I wish that one of those shots had hit Jar Jar right in his stupid looking face, god I hate that guy. All in all it was definitely a very entertaining movie with all the charm of the original three and with cool new special effects to boot. On a scale of 1 to 10 if Jar Jar binks hadn't been in it I would have given it a 10 but because of that clumsy freak I give it a 9.

There is a level of political intrigue as Senator Palpatine begins his path to becoming Emporer, and we are introduced to Darth Sidious, who has suspicious similarities to the senator. We are introduced to the characters of Amidala, Obi Wan, Anakin, Yoda and legions of others who will likely play a role in unfolding of the saga that will lead us back to A New Hope where it all began. I was quite pleased to be able to see R2, C3PO, Jabba, and others from the orginal trilogy on the big screen again and I must say that I found the new aliens to be less distracting than some of the early reviews would have led one to believe. However, There are a few disturbing elements of the dark side in this 1st installment of the Star Wars Saga that I hope George Lucas will allow the force to correct in Episode II. Many of the key aliens have voices that are inaudible or just simply distracting from the action that was occurring on screen. I wish there had been less of dialogue like Mesa Hata Thisa Waya yousa Talkin. There were times when I was begging for captioning so I could understand what they were saying.

The human actors were slightly cardboard at times but acceptable and I love the hints of Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan in the Obi Wan of Ewan McGregor. The movie is more like Jedi in its pace as opposed to ANH or ESB. At times it could have used a Han Solo adrenalin rush. Still it is star wars at its heart and if you are patient and do not fear change the dark side will lose out and you'll find yourself loving this movie as I do.

And while the special FX are hyper awesome they tend to be overused and seem to overstay their welcome at times. And this movie has some VERY dull spots,especially when they keep talking about all the senate\/treaty crap...uhh!...give us more light sabre fights already.But overall a good start for the series and I cant wait too see how episode 2 and 3 turn out.

I heard what the critics said and I was fearful I would see this movie and it would put a major downer on the trilogoy, a set of movies that I love dearly.  It's not Star Wars, even George Lucas said that.   But Star Wars was one of those magical movies that only come once in a lifetime and we have to move on to new movies.The Phantom Menance, first off, was a technological wonder.  The special effects were the best I have ever seen.  Just as some of the critics were stating, the plot was somewhat weak, especially in the middle.  But I did not leave disappointed, the action sequences were incredible; they left you breathless at times.  And yes, at the end of the movie the audience I was at was on their feet and applauding.I think George created an excellent movie and he has some good building blocks for the next 2 installments of the movie.  The writing needs to be cleaned up some.  I'll be seeing this movie at least 3 more times since I promised several kids I know that I would take them to see the movie.

I found my way to the main reactor using my skill and the force. Boom, I blew it up all by myself.5. Why do some Jedis (Yoda, Ben) disappear when they die and some (Qui Gon, Vader) don't? And why is QuiGon the trainer of Obi Wan when Obi Wan said in the Trilogy that Yoda was his trainer? I'm getting picky now.6.
