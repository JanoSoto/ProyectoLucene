The above is basically the whole of Requiem for a Dream summed up in one sentence. You don't need any more, because there isn't any more to the movie.Even though RFAD has received massive acclaim, I just can't understand why people rave about it. My personal belief is that RFAD goes down much better in the US and that the scores it gets here on IMDb are a reflection of the fact that most of the people who frequent this website are Americans. To a degree, I feel that the marks it has received are due to the US attitude to hard drugs and addiction.As a European, I didn't find anything brutal or shocking about RFAD. The earlier Trainspotting was THE movie about drug addiction and it portrayed a much more realistic attitude to addiction. It's a case of Seen it all before only better. Realism was a big problem. Really, for heroin junkies, the guys and girls in this movie didn't have a hair out of place. Clean finger nails, tidy hair, clean clothes, dammit, they looked better than most of the people I know! Some of the decisions they made were really out there (even for junkies) and the plot left a lot to be desired (what little there was of it). There were also many instances where the plot veered off into the realms of being illogical - things happened to characters that just wouldn't have happened in real life - no matter how whacked out on drugs they were. One could counter that the movie's strength was that it was a bleak portrayal using extremes as a way of gaining impact but bleakness doesn't make it a classic and extremes still have to be put into a context where they don't overwhelm logic.And my other beef? RFAD seems to be a hybrid of Trainspotting and Snatch\/Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (again, people rave about the camera-work and music in RFAD, but again, it's something we've already seen done far better in European film long before). Take away the originality of the camera-work and score, take away the originality of the Addiction Story and you're not really left with anything else but a mediocre movie.I've read elsewhere people defending RFAD, saying that the book clarifies this or the book clarifies that and that criticising the movie whilst being unaware of the book's contents means that any negative view is unjustified. But come on people!! I went to see a movie. I didn't want to read the book. The movie really should tell me everything I want to know and if I have to read the book to have a better understanding, that means that the movie has failed.Believe me, I tried to like RFAD. I looked at the IMDb score and thought, It's got to be great. Then, when I discovered that it really wasn't that good, I thought maybe the problem was with me. But on analysis - no. No punch. No realism. No meat. No originality. Finally, I'd just like to add, that I didn't relate to any of the characters - they were all annoying idiots. The only one who could elicit any sympathy at all was Wayan's character, Tyrone (although again, his final predicament didn't follow logic). I always find it very hard to like any movie where all the characters grind on my nerves. I'm not talking about just disliking characters - that could be the point of the plot and negative emotions could be the director's intentions, but in this case, they were just plain aggravating and I'd be pretty sure that was never the intended result. Personally, I couldn't have cared less what happened to them and to tell the absolute truth, I actually hoped from an early stage that something bad would happen to at least one of them and that kind of tramples over everything that the movie probably tried to be.Sorry. For all the raving RFAD is just an average movie.

Having been unfamiliar with Hunter S. Thompson or his work, and having no experience with any of the drugs in the movie except alcohol and pot, I thought it looked over-the-top, but I had heard great things about it. I knew it was directed by Terry Gilliam, (of Monty Python) and starred Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, so I was inclined to give it a shot. What an experience I was in for! This movie is 2 hours of drug-induced craziness. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, or you are offended by any amount (and I do mean ANY amount) of drug use, then don't watch this movie. It's not for you. The rest of us, however, are in for a treat. The movie takes place in 1972, and follows journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo as they head to Vegas to cover the Mint 400. They soon forget about the story, however, and focus on the drugs in their suitcase. (acid, mescaline, cocaine, hard liquor, beer, pot, ether, and many, many pills.) Johnny Depp captures Raoul Duke's craziness perfectly, and within the first 25 minutes you already know he is going to be an iconic character. A cigarette always hangs from his mouth, (literally, there is not one scene he is without it) and he has a very distinct voice you won't soon forget. Johnny Depp spent 4 months with the real Hunter S. Thompson, learning his mannerisms, and it shows. As he partakes of every drug in his suitcase, you see the good, the bad, and the hilarious. Johnny Depp truly looks intoxicated throughout most of the movie. I don't know how he did it. Benicio Del Toro is also great, playing Raoul Duke's lawyer Dr. Gonzo perfectly. He is a slightly darker and more violent character, and Benicio Del Toro captures this very well. He is at times funny, and at other times truly scary. He is even more irresponsible than Duke, and does things you truly won't believe. He also captures the madness of being extremely intoxicated on a variety of drugs, just as well as Depp. The two actors also have great chemistry, and they really come across as two long-time buddies who really, really like to get messed up. Director Terry Gilliam also proves to be more than up to the task, and he provides the final piece of the puzzle in creating a movie about two guys drugged out of their minds. The script, which he helped write, is great, as is the camera-work that changes and distorts as the duo take different drugs. He takes the great acting and turns it into a great film. This was a very difficult book to commit to film, as it is so over-the-top that it seems cartoonish at times. Gilliam both grounds the movie enough that it feels real, while still embracing the aspects that make it seem unreal. I do not believe there were many, if any, directors who could have matched his final result. The movie does have a few downsides, however. It probably could have been 10 minutes shorter, and the ending feels abrupt. If they spent more time on it, and a little less on other parts of the movie, it probably would have made this movie a true classic. The movie is also simply too crazy, drug-induced, and challenging for a mainstream audience. While that is good at times, it also means the great acting and directing won't be appreciated by as wide of an audience as it should be. The cameos, while good, distract more that they add to the movie. This is Depp, Del Toro, and Gilliam's movie, and it shows.Overall, I would recommend this movie to those who can handle it. It is truly unique, and one of the few films about which you can say that there are no other movies like it. It took me two viewings to fully appreciate. While there are parts where you feel like the sober guy at a party with a bunch of drunk people, the movie overall conveys the drug use very well.

The walls of the girls' Jericho did not fall until the third session of filming that particular scene, some things take work. There are also two rather special historic commentaries on my DVD and I assume that proper late 70's rock fans are likely to know of those. This is from a time that was not too good from my view, personal disaster, but there was some good rock and roll on the radio. Buying a few, very few, LPs, USA speak albums?, KISS was there. Not the best but among those that stood out as among the best. The classical music that stood out for me included Carmina Burana and I would have interpreted its influence on me in a different way to how this feature uses that piece, for me I was more waving a red rag at bulls that did not appear to be bulls. There is a lot of violence in this story, but other facets too. Round our way most seemed to use more subtle forms of violence on big babies but this does give some variations of that, sort of. I found it easy to get ground down, those years. Some get trouble from all sides. * The commentaries point to KISS having been targeted by some fundamentalist Christians who considered the band to be agents of the devil, their music something that these fun C felt a need to attack. My difficulty is with how the feature interprets that. The feature shows Catholic mothers and priests as agents of the anti KISS. They are very much in parody form. As an ex Catholic I do find the expression to be not in tune with the wide variety in that church. The bits with priests are mostly too way out for me to be able to take, I need to jump over those. The exception as the bit where Beth notices her love going into the church. Inside the church a problem, despite Beth's acting. There are several features where I would really need a personalised copy and this is one of them. I need deletions. The Catholic mothers, particularly the mum of Jeremiah, a different thing. First time round that felt way too bad but that reaction soon calmed. More viewings also allowed me to notice how her idea of child care appeared to be influenced by ways of dealing with a pet dog. Not a warm sort of way as with Hermione and her Crookshanks, more a Ron with Pig as shown in the novels. Pig expected to do things on a Must Do basis, otherwise no love.

Jonathan Pryce's character (Sam Lowry) is a man who works at some office in which everyone uses old typewriters with computer monitors (Again sounds like 1984) that seem to contain all the information big brother has on people. He is obsessed with finding this blond girl he sees in his dreams and spends the entire film using his access to these strange computers to locate her. The sets for this film are some of the strangest I have seen in the movies. Looks like something right out of a comic book with looming buildings that block the sky and endless tubes going here and there. Old movie posters are plastered everywhere that seem to be suggesting a better time or something.

The rest of the film does not seem to have any focus. Why does he need to find this girl? And when he does find her what does he hope to do? Robert DeNiro plays some maintenance guy that fixes tubes and he seems strangely out out place in this movie jumping like spider man from building to building.

I wanted more of her and her husband, played by Peter Horton, and much less of the children.Sadly, this movie is as much about the kids as it is about the couple getting terrorized by these kids. This is a bad thing because the filmmakers got some of the worst child actors to have played these villains, with an exception of Robby Kiger and AnneMarie McEvoy. On top of that, the film takes so much time setting up everything.

True that it seems as ordinary flick, with the word TV written all over it (frankly I thought many times about the irony between the 18 million dollar budget and the 5 and a half million gross !). Though, it is a fine entertaining movie, for me, more than that Oscar winning movie of the 1970s.I liked Linda Fiorentino's both role and performance. She made it well as sensitive, hot and most of all understanding her character not as a lover of the old man, but a mentor's pupil. Just notice her eye look whenever she's with Newman; she's hungry for his brilliance so his experience.The thing about this movie is all in the last 15 minutes, not with the clever twists but where the meaning completes clearly. The movie's world centers around dead people (the old folks), live people but subsist as dead (the married young couple), and one truly live man (the master thief). The whole story is about the journey of these 2 love birds through the vivid world of this thief. And who'd have the ability to stand it and continue living it as it should  daringly and smartly. Because outside this way you'd be either a cowered or a loser (both dead anyway). So where is the money ?

It did not deserve the bad reviews it got. Does anyone have an imagination anymore?? The people who said this movie had plot holes were not thinking correctly. Maybe the reason the aliens had no idea that they were allergic to water is because their planet did not have any water on it. Maybe they were scouting our planet to see what resources we had. Could it have been that this was their first time off of their spaceship and that from now on they will know better.

Admittedly, though that may of helped me find some scenes funny, the acting in this film made lines that should of worked not work and the movie almost screams for a laugh track as it would be appropriate, given the wooden dialogue and sitcom-like over-acting and premises.Time has moved on and good comedies of today are in a far superior league not just because of the acting shown but because they either choose to embrace the cheesiness or wackiness of their story and do things that people in the 70's wouldn't imagine seeing at M and R16 comedies, which Animal House tries to do but fails as the wacky, disturbing stuff was done far more tastefully.Other comedies focus on realism and are funny because you can imagine yourself in a situation not too far away from the one the characters find themselves in and the jokes they make are a lot like the ones you and your friends make.In short, Animal House may have been revolutionary in the 70's but an audience watching it today would expect far more from a movie so highly acclaimed.

Until this one.Let's start with the obvious. Direction. Directing was so poor and intrusive even the most unaware of the viewers must have noticed it and realized for the first time in their lives how the watching experience can be influenced by bad directorial choices. One single choice stands out like turd in a punchbowl - tilting the camera in every single shot. Every single shot you watch with nauseating feeling desperately wishing that the camera straightens up. But it never happens. And there was never any artistic justification for it. Okay, we see the future world through skewed eyes because the future world is screwed - point taken - now can we watch the bloody movie? No.I did endure watching it though, on a TV station that mercifully airs commercials every 15 minutes, so I could take breaks from time to time. I was able to realize that not only the picture has been massacred but the story as well.I was hoping it wouldn't be due to the following Hubbard, author of the story, was founder of Scientology \/ Travolta is one of his zealous followers \/ this movie is Travolta's passion child \/ Travolta took a key role in production as well. One would assume Travolta would honor his master enough to make this faithful to the book. Well, he didn't. And it's a pity because I found the book to be spectacular (I was in high-school, but nevertheless).

It is about his journey from slave to master and mankind's journey to rediscover what they have lost. The decision to put Travolta's villain in the spotlight and casting the hero aside was instrumental in killing the spirit of the original story.

There were even a few of these evenings where they eschewed telling me about it to simply put it on instead. Sitting down to experience anything with the pre-ordained promise that it's the best is a recipe for disaster. In the case of Office Space, which is assuredly NOT the funniest thing ever (I could offer at least a dozen films more worthy of this distinction off the top of my head, but I'll save that for when I get around to reviewing them), it's sort of a shame, because O-Space is actually a pretty nifty little flick, and at times, it could almost be considered hilarious. Without the slavish devotion its many fans have bestowed upon it, this film could stand quite well on its own. But the stigma of the cult classic status it has been unjustly awarded merely ensures that those seeing Office Space for the first time are bound to be let down, since it most definitely doesn't live up to the hype.Most of the truly funny bits happen in the first half-hour, and when the plot is set into motion, the film sort of coasts along and leaves the jokes in the dust. What begins as an extremely clever series of skits with the Seinfeld-ian ability to wring big laughs out of the most mundane and recognizable facets of our daily grinds morphs into a half-baked slacker larceny scheme and a space-filling romance that is so under-developed and ultimately pointless that it seems as if it was tacked on because women at the test screenings weren't impressed with the film.Granted, the funniest moments here are fantastic, especially the send-up of annoying chain restaurants with license plates and other meaningless ephemera on the walls, which is spot-on.

Whitley Strieber, who turned his own novel into a screenplay and co-produced the film, unceasingly claims that Communion is based on his very own experiences as being the target of alien abduction and examination. Now this given could easily be dismissed as a cuckoo and sensational gimmick to promote the film, but simultaneously you can't deny that Strieber and director Philippe Mora (The Beast Within, The Howling II) attempted &#x96; and mainly succeeded &#x96; to insert a lot more psychological depth and feeling into this film than usually the case with alien movies. Communion is, above all, an extremely weird film and undeniably one that provokes thoughts and opinions that go far beyond the experiences you usually have when watching late 80's movies that deal with extraterrestrial encounters. The author Whitley Strieber is depicted by Christopher Walken &#x96; I'll get back to his unforgettable performance later &#x96; and the movie begins somewhere early October 1985. During a series of recesses at their country cabin, whether with friends or just with his family, Whitley has meetings with two types of alien visitors &#x96; the stereotypical large black-eyed ones and little blue monsters &#x96; that thoroughly subject him to painful and psychologically devastating examinations. Since Whitley doesn't recall these meeting but obviously alter his mental state of mind, he eventually agrees to relive them via hypnosis sessions. The revelations that come to the surface during these sessions are amazing and fantastic, to say the least&#x85; This film's greatest trump is inarguably how it forces you to identify with the supportive characters. Not the protagonist himself, as he's obviously a character you can't easily relate to, but his wife or his doctor. Personally, I'm not a believer in extraterrestrial life myself, but that doesn't matter because you are only supposed to accept that Whitley Strieber strongly believes all the ordeals that he's hallucinating about. It's quite remarkable how Strieber and Mora manage to put the emphasis on the impact that Whitley's behavior has on his social life, rather than on the actual alien encounters itself. I haven't read it myself, but a friend of mine assured me that the novel digs even deeper into the psychological aspects, so if you're into complex protagonist portrayals you might want to check out the book.

He yells, stares creepily, pauses between words and pulls petrifying faces almost like he's spoofing his own personality. In an attempt to appeal to an as versatile as possible audience, Communion loses a lot of its credibility and ingenuity near the end, with sequences that are just exaggeratedly demented and special effects that ruin the surreal ambiance. The last fifteen minutes are overlong and sorely disappointing.

Yet while seeming to be action based, Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan would also have some of the series most dramatic moments as well. The result of this, in the hands of director Nicholas Meyer would be the best of the Star Trek films.To begin with the acting is pretty solid. The performances from the original series cast members are all well done especially int he cases of William Shatner, Loenard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly. In particular Shatner and Nimor get some fantastic scenes together including one of the best staged and moving farewell death scenes in film history (even if it is only temporary). Also of special mention is the performance of James Doohan whose performance gets some additional (and excellent) material in the director's edition DVD version. Plus there are also good performances from other cast members including Kirstie Alley in her film debut and Bibi Besch amongst others. Then there is the villain...Ricardo Montalban's performance as Khan, in my opinion anyway, is one of the all time great film villain performances. While Montalban had made quite an impact with the character int he original 1967 TV episode that performance was just the tip of what this film would reveal to the character. It's a layered performance with echoes, both in writing and in performance, to characters like King Lear and Capatin Ahab as Khan is revealed to be more then a genetically engineered superman in exile but a man driven to vengeance at any cost (hence the title). Khan's face-off's with Kirk are pieces of acting that focus your attention onto him which is even more incredible considering that the two characters (and presumably the actors as well) never come face to face int he film but spend the entire film facing off against each other via screens and communicators. It speaks to the power of a performance when despite that fact, the villain comes across as a real and imposing threat to the film's other characters.The film's special effects also remain top notch. This film remains a prime example of the power of pre-CGI visual effects not only with ships in flight but with the still visually striking battle sequences and things like the Mutara Nebula sequence and the formation of the Genesis Planet. The film also makes nice reuses of some of the effects footage from the first Star Trek film as well which, for once in a case of footage reuse, doesn't make the film look cheap at all. All in all it's rather impressive material coming out of a film that is fast approaching its third decade of existence.If the success of this film can really be credited to any single person it would be Nicholas Meyer. Despite Jack B. Sowards and executive producer Harve Bennett being credited as the writers of Star Trek II it was Meyer who did the (uncredited) massive re-write that brought together the film as it is. Whiel the script is firm in placing the film into being a science fiction action film, the film also a philosophical side as well. yet unlike its predecessor, the second Star Trek film is philosophical not about what's out there but about the human condition as it covers (without hopefully sounding cliché) the full range of the human condition including the emotional need for revenge, youth, knowledge vs experience, aging, morality, regrets and, most famously, death. Perhpaos the greatest example of this is the films use of the opening and closing liens from Dickens A Tale Of Two Cities as effective bookends to the film. Meyer also makes use of the film's rather limited budget to effectively create a vision of life in the 23rd century and the result is that this film, perhaps more then any other of the Star Trek film, seems to occupy a real world thanks to Meyer's direction of people ranging from cinematographer Gayne Rescher to costume designer Robert Fletcher and the set designs of Joseph R. Jennings. Meyer proves that it is story, not just good effects, that makes good science fiction work.There is also the film's score. Then newcomer James Horner faced quite a challenge in trying to create a score that followed on from Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece for Star Trek The Motion Picture. Yet Horner proved up to the task with pieces such as his main title music, the theme of the Enterprising leaving space dock (which reused the same footage that Goldsmith had scored to in Star Trek The Motion Picture), the battle in the Mutara Nebula and the film's emotional finale. Whiel ti may lack the sound of the size of orchestra that Goldsmtih had Horner's score still has the power to add great emotional nd tension to any scene it accompany. Indoing so, Horner kicked off a career that continues to this very day.Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan is the best of the Star Trek films. Why you may ask? Well with fine performances, a great villain, impressive special effects, a nice script, the direction of Nicholas Meyer and a score by James Horner it what every Trek film has had to live up to. It is a film that is as much about the human condition as it is about action and is all the better for it. That's why it is.

The performances from the original series cast members are all well done especially int he cases of William Shatner, Loenard Nimoy and DeForest Kelly.
