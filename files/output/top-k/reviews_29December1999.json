Well, watching Man on the Moon, the new film about the life of entertainer Andy Kaufman, who died in 1984 at age 35, will not give you any answers to the above questions or much anything else.  Somewhat entertaining, this paper-thin film is basically a kaleidoscope of Kufman's famous routines thrown together randomly, a very expensive, but less informative A&E Biography.Man on the Moon starts off with a great opening credit, briefly touches Andy's childhood and basically shoots straight to his Saturday Night Live and Taxi gigs and his other famous routines including his very obnoxious and hilarious alter ego Tony Clifton and his wrestling promotion stunts, which practically killed his career.  Director Milos Forman and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski really make no attempt to explain what made Andy Kaufman tick, it's just one routine after another, with little personal information in between.  Just recently A&E's Biography presented an hour on Andy Kaufman and was much more informative and almost as entertaining showing basically the same skits that were recreated in the film, but instead of seeing Jim Carrey, you had the honor of seeing the original at work.Speaking of Jim Carrey, he has gotten much press even before the movie was released about how he appeared on the set in character and never stopped until the end of filming.  He is also being mentioned for an Oscar nomination and has even been promoting himself on the talk show circuit.  My opinion, Carrey does a brilliant impression, but that is basically it.  He has all the mannerisms down pat, sounds like Kaufman, even looks like Kaufman, but it is more of an impression than a performance.  I can't really fault Carrey for this, but the screenplay really doesn't give him much to work with except to mimic Andy's routines.  That is a shame, because for the first time, I was able to tolerate Carrey and he was very grounded considering he was playing such a loose cannon.  Danny DeVito, as always, is very good as George Shapiro, the talent manager who discovers Kaufman at a comedy club and eventually managed his career.  Paul Giamatti also does fine work as Bob Zmuda, Andy's friend and writing partner.Man on the Moon also has some major flaws that should have never happened.  Many of the characters such as David Letterman, SNL producer Lorne Michaels and some of the actors for the TV show Taxi play themselves.  This would have been fine if the film was set in the mid 90's, but they are really pushing the envelope considering that these events took place late 70's, early 80's.  Some of the Taxi crew look like waxworks, while David Letterman looks like he just walked of his show the other day and said Okay, let's shoot this baby, I have to get back to my set. Come on, this is Hollywood, use some dye, wigs, make-up to make these folks look somewhat younger.  There is also a real cheap shot toward the end of the film.  Andy Kaufman is sick with a rare form of lung cancer and tells George Shapiro that he would like to perform one last huge production, then the film cuts to the extravagant concert that Andy did at Carnegie Hall.  One problem, this concert was done early in Andy's career, years before he had cancer.  Talk about playing on the audience's sympathy.  And did we really need over a half hour devoted to Andy's pro-wrestling stunts, they were pretty boring back then, here they almost stop the film dead in it's tracks.It was great to relive the highlights of Andy Kaufman's career and there is no denying his talents, but Man on the Moon left me feeling empty and I'm sure wherever Andy is, he is probably saying Tank you very much, but no tanks.

In my opinion, this won't even get him a nomination.  Although Milos Forman cast Carrey perfectly for the role, it was only because Jim Carrey is the Andy Kaufman of the nineties.  If the roles were reversed and Kaufman starred in the movie, `Jim Carrey There Was No Pet Detective Like Him, Kaufman would be receiving the praise.  Critics say, `you think you are actually seeing Andy,' and although most people will agree, is it a true statement?  For the first part of the film, the audience sees Carrey, a man who is imitating a performance artist, but as the film continues, you forget you are watching Carrey.  Why is that? Great acting?  The only way I can explain it is like when watching a movie made in England (Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Full Monty, ect). At first, it is impossible to understand what anyone is saying because of the accents, but as the film goes on, you slowly start to feel more comfortable with the accents and without even consciously realizing it, you can understand ever word.  That is the only way I can parallel it.  I watched Carrey's bad imitation, got used to it, and by the end of the movie thought it was dead on.Second, the movie in general.  I would have to agree with the majority of the critics who state that Forman, Alexander, and Karaszewski did not go deep enough into Andy's world.

How much you enjoy it might be directly related to what you thought of the real Andy. It is well acted with an amazing performance by Danny Devito as Kaufman's agent.

Entering the theater, I had great expectations, but I would not be disappointed by what I experienced that night.I got to see 2001 in the old Cinerama format which used three synchronized projectors to display the movie on a wide curved screen. The effect was less impressive than today's IMAX, but it DID make things larger than life. The special effects were impressive without detracting attention from the story.

Never was his talent on display better than it was in this film. John Hughes and John Candy went on to develop what I can only surmise was quite the friendship because Candy appeared in many Hughes films either as the star ( this one, Uncle Buck, Great Outdoors ) or with a cameo ( Home Alone, Vacation and a few others that I can't think of right now, but check the IMDb and you'll see that he did ). But of all the films that Candy did, including Stripes, I don't think he has ever been as good and as funny as he was in here. If there was any justice in the Academy ( and we all know that is an oxymoron, Academy and justice ) then Candy would have at least been nominated for best actor in 1987. I think Douglas won that year for Wall Street and he deserved to but Candy was brilliant in this film. It was a shame to see his career cut short because even in his bad films he was good. This is his best and most complete role. He will be missed but at least we have great roles like this to remember him by.Planes.... is a film about one man trying to get home for the American Thanksgiving. He is Neil Page and he is played with perfect smugness by Steve Martin. He is a work-a-holic and his lifestyle is that of many John Hughes family men that live in suburbia Chicago. He lives in a huge house, much like the one in Home Alone and Weird Science, and his family is a beautiful one that consists of a lovely wife and three kids. But he is never home and for all of his success professionally, it is the kind of family that although is together now, it may not survive the fast approaching 90's if Neil Page continues his ways.John Candy plays Dell Griffith. He is a jolly man, much like Santa Clause but without the beard and the old age. This is a man that carries a giant trunk around with him and is a constant chatter box. He is the kind of man that you know is good at sales, but on a lower level. He is too much of a slob to really be a corporate sales guy. Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him, then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know, they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel, not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this  You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say, because I can take anything, I've been with Dell Griffith, and they'd say,  I know what you mean. Whooooo, shower curtain guy!  And as funny as that scene is, Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told, first and foremost, this is a funny, funny film. And if anyone has scene it, they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves, he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk, who subsequently is Grace, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying, Can I help you? Martin replies, You can start by wiping that f***ing dumbass smile off your rosy f@**ing cheeks.  From there he goes into an F-Word filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of f***ing nowhere with f****ing keys to a f***ing car that isn't f***ing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family, friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now, it may be looked upon as Hughes best film.

Of course this Laurel and Hardy pair cross paths and from here on out Neil's simple task of getting home to his family for Thanksgiving is going to be a journey from hell.First of all he loses his cab in New York rush hour to Candy who unwittingly steals it from him, then he is bumped from first class and ends up sitting next to Candy on the plane. Then they are delayed because of weather problems and what do you know, they end up spending the night together in not only the same hotel, not only the same room but the same bed. This presents all sorts of comic possibilities and Hughes doesn't miss one of them. His comic timing and development of the two characters is brilliant. Some of the best scenes are when the two are bantering and Candy is verbally assaulted by Martin. Martin goes off and says that he is annoying to listen to and then he says this  You know I could sit through an insurance seminar and still look happy and the others would say how do you do it? And I would say, because I can take anything, I've been with Dell Griffith, and they'd say,  I know what you mean. Whooooo, shower curtain guy!  And as funny as that scene is, Hughes goes for more than the quick payoff of laughter. He then reminds you that this isn't just a comedy but a film with many layers and substance to it. Because the next scene has Candy delivering a monologue that almost makes you embarrassed for laughing at what Martin said.But truth be told, first and foremost, this is a funny, funny film. And if anyone has scene it, they will tell you about the airport scene where Page has lost his rental car and he comes back and does what we have all dreamed of doing ourselves, he goes ballistic on the person behind the desk, who subsequently is Grace, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. She must have been fired by Ed Rooney and now rents cars at airports for a living. She plays a desk clerk that has decided to take the Thanksgiving holiday a little sooner that she is supposed to. Martin comes in and she starts by saying, Can I help you? Martin replies, You can start by wiping that f***ing dumbass smile off your rosy f@**ing cheeks.  From there he goes into an F-Word filled tirade about how her company left him in the middle of f***ing nowhere with f****ing keys to a f***ing car that isn't f***ing there. It is one of the funniest moments that I have seen in any film because you don't expect it from a Hughes film.Planes... is a heart warming film about family, friendship and good will towards men. It is also a wickedly funny movie and it will stand the test of time and I think in 30 or 40 years from now, it may be looked upon as Hughes best film. Candy and Martin are wonderful in here and it is really a treat to watch them work together.10 out of 10 ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"29 December 1999","score":"6 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":"  if you like filmmaking then dont see this movie. this movie has created an entirely new category in the movie world, aptly named porno sympathy. it is like a dirty old man on the street who opens his coat to show you what he's made of. this movie hides nothing, showing you how very sympathetic a movie can be.there is no challenge to it. the ending is inevitable from the start. at this point one could at least hope for good characterization, seeing that the movie is 3 hrs long. but i felt as if i knew the motivations of no one character any better at the end. if you are questioning your faith then this movie wont help you. if you have no faith then this movie wont help you. if you are blissfully excited by your faith then you dont need a movie to help you.but alas, no movie is all bad. kudos to michael duncan clark but the rest of the cast are playing worn characters, esp tom hanks, with a very worn southern accent to boot.

Walking out of the theater with my Italian comrade Americus, I said right off the back, I did not like it.  But after a few days of taking it in, my original opinion is half-right.  After a fascinating first half, the film loses steam for me until the last ten minutes.  Regardless The Talented Mr. Ripley is a cerebral psychological tale, well executed and unlike most cookie cutter films cranked out by Hollywood today (with the possible exception of this year).  It also claims an unbelievable performance by Jude Law, whose stock should sky rocket after this, and of course the beautiful landscape of my people, Italy.  It is a gorgeous picture to the human eye.Ripley is adapted from the novel by Patricia Highsmith, which first received film treatment in the 1960 French-Italian film, Purple Noon.  It is the late 1950's and Tom Ripley (Matt Damon taking a risk unlike his buddy Ben Affleck), is a young man with no clout or fortune. He is asked by shipping magnate Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) to go to Italy and bring back his son, Dickie (Jude Law), which Tom lies about knowing from Princeton.  Once in Italy, Tom starts to soak up the ambiance of the rich and famous and attempts to take on the role of the upper crust.  He works his way into the life of Dickie and his fiancee Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow).  But Tom's charade is starting to bore Dickie and is being question by those around him, and eventually tragedy strikes Dickie. Tom now take the opportunity to dig in deeper by passing himself off as Dickie to the point where there is no return back to ordinary Tom.Director Anthony Minghella of the overrated and big yawn The English Patient strikes a chord this time around and creates some suspenseful moments and wonderful sexual ambivalence that rings so true in life as we know it, but may not want to admit.  Some of his scenes are astonishing including the wonderful scene between Tom and Dickie in the bathroom, while Dickie is bathing. But this film belongs to Jude Law who sets the screen on fire in every scene.  You can see his mind working a mile a minute and are never quite sure what he is thinking all the time. It is one of this year's best performances and deserves an Oscar nomination for supporting actor.  Unfortunately Law exits the 2nd half of the picture, which then falls entirely on Matt Damon's shoulder. Without the interesting bond between Dickie and Tom, what is left in the second half of this film is a not so interesting murder mystery that only redeems itself in the last few minutes of the reel.  Damon captures the shallowness and manipulative side of the character, and the desire to climb the social ladder, but what is missing is the sheer desperation that makes this character so tragic. Some of the other actors here do some very good work including Jack Davenport as Peter who falls for Tom, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dickie's obnoxious and creepy friend.  The female roles are not as fully realized as their male counterparts and Paltrow and Blanchett probably signed on for the scenery.  There is really nothing special about their performances.  Jude Law is the one that shines here and Damon must be given credit for tackling a very difficult role.The Talented Mr. Ripley is not for your average movie audience who needs to be spoon-feed everything.

The spotlight is always on; I'd like to know what is happening on the side,  as that can be more telling.  But there is no time for subtle transitions or shades of gray here; everything is over the top and hence, a bit much!  Sometimes a close up is so close, you don't get the whole picture.       I liked the difference-ness of the movie and would see it again, but I think most would find it somewhat tedious after the initial humor and then going places not very appealing.  The cinematography is good with many authentic, life-like scenes (yet no landscapes which often imply great cinematography).*John Reilly's officer is the exception; some of his scenes are more background than in your face, and hence more fully developed.
