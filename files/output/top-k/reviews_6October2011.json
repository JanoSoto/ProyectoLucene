Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you.Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed.This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.

Russell and Quinlan have been keeping an eye on that ominous pick up and Russell decides that he'd better stay with the car and maybe Walsh can drive his wife to the diner where she can call the auto club.It was wise of Russell not to desert the car. Anything might have happened. My car once blew a rod on a lonely stretch of desert road near St. George, Utah, and it was several days before I could have it retrieved. Three months later, the FBI knocked on my mother's door in New Jersey and asked about the abandoned car. No kidding.Okay, okay. That's pointless divagation you say, and you're right. I only bring it up to illustrate a point, namely that Kurt Russell's character isn't entirely stupid or, at least, no more stupid than most of us.

It's one of those bleak desert stops with a nasal voice crooning some Western ballad in the background and a dozen silent patrons scattered around. Nobody has seen either Quinlan or Walsh. The counter man is a little resentful that he should be asked about it.It's a rather neatly done and enjoyable thriller, as thrillers go. It's full of élan and formulaic incidents. Probably nothing you see or hear will make you gasp with surprise but it's a lot of fun seeing these things played out on the screen, reassuringly familiar, like a church service or a family dinner. I'll give an example to point up the properties of the movie. Russell manages to stab a particularly vicious bad guy in the chest with an eight-inch letter opener -- up to the hilt. Does this kill the bad guy? Or -- no, that's too easy. Does it even SLOW HIM DOWN? The bang-up ending is a multiple car chase that winds up with a truck and a car hooked together and dangling from a high bridge while Quinlan is trapped within the endangered car and two men are having a brawl on and around the truck beneath.The scenery is majestic, evoking images and memories of other movies, other directors.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"6 October 2011","score":"","review":" Two stories intertwine in a classical movie centered around the construction of the railroad to the Atlantic and the impeding end of the wild west. Much like the movies of Sam Peckinpah Once Upon a Time in the West is a romantic swansong to an era gone past, as well as to its idealised pop-cultural meaning. The film centers around four characters with a varying level of immorality. Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), a former New Orleans prostitute turned housewife, will do anything to preserve her life, even for the sake of her honour and dignity. Cheyenne (Jason Robards)is a fearless outlaw, but with a code of honour and a lot of class. Harmonica (Charles Bronson), a mysterious gunslinger travelling with only a gun in hand and a harmonica hanging on his neck, enters the fray is real style and remains the main protagonist of the story. Opposing them is the villainous Frank (Henry Fonda), a scrupulous gun-for-hire with a knack for torture and psychological warfare, which does not back down from killing women and children in order to forward his own gains.In this bleak vision of the American west dichotomous concepts of good and evil have R.I.P. written all over them. Sergio Leone delves into this world, but adds his own touch of class to the realism. Interested more in the calm before the storm much of the focus is placed not on the action and gunfights themselves (these are normally over within a matter of seconds), but the emotional buildup that precedes it. Long suspenseful shots, which create an unmistakable aura and tension, inhabit the story in droves and also cause it to last over 2,5 hours. Some of these intense scenes are absolutely memorable, while the opening shootout at the station remains one of the best sequences in movie history ever. That said there seems to be an overload of such scenes, which cause the story to drag to a halt. Given this movie lacks the tongue-in-cheek humour of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, it can be a sometimes awkwardly tiresome affair. One however that is well worth the toil.Despite being much more somber in nature than the previous trilogy there seems to be much less weight to the story and save for some spectacular storytelling and cinematography I much prefer the mentioned The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, despite giving them similar notes. The symbolical use of water and trains throughout the movie does seem rather simpleminded at times and doesn't really add depth to the movie. Nonetheless Once Upon a Time in the West remains an classic tale about the end of an era. Whats more I get the immense feeling that no one will ever be able to tell a similar story with such unmistakable wit and charm as Sergio Leone did. His westerns seems impossible to replicate in form and whenever I see anyone replicate his long focused shots full of tension and expectation it always seems to be bordering on farcical.Sergio Leone had a short and uneven career. Despite the fact that I feel his A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More are vastly overrated and rather poor movies Once Upon a Time in the West stamps out his position as one of the all-time movie greats.

Long established as an innocent, chaste genre, it suddenly acquired a raunchy, burlesque quality that brought it back to its pre-code roots in the early 30s. And this is itself the very era that Cabaret transports us back too &#x96; a bygone age of glamour and sexual liberty that became as much a key for the new generation of musicals as the 1900s had been for those of the previous generation.Like many of the greatest musicals, at the centre of Cabaret is one mesmerising, momentous performance. Liza Minnelli is playful, passionate and ultimately deeply emotive in a turn that would be impressive enough were it purely a dramatic role. But what is more she puts every inch the Sally Bowles character into the way she sings and dances. Constantly beguiling, she seems to build up some mysterious rapport with the audience, beckoning us to come join her in this cabaret of a life. Emerging gradually from the chorus line in the first number, she quickly becomes absolutely riveting.And then we have some top class direction from Bob Fosse. Fosse was originally a choreographer, and more than any other director of musicals he treats cinematic technique as a form of choreography, with whip-pans, focus-shifts and angle-changes all a part of the dance. He was a little heavy-handed in his first feature, Sweet Charity, but here it is all done with such poise and precision that we barely realise how much the image is being manipulated. Fosse also shows himself to be a master of making us see exactly what he wants, for example making sure during one of the numbers that it is only when he reveals himself that we realise one of the dancing girls is actually a dragged-up Joel Grey.But really it is very hard to talk about the individual talents that have gone into Cabaret because this seems so very much a movie in which everyone is working together for the same stylistic aims. I can explain this with the example of just one of the musical numbers &#x96; Maybe This Time. It is, first off, a wonderful Kander and Ebb tune (this is really the only great score they produced). The song of course occurs outside the main line of narrative, but it is nevertheless supposed to be a commentary on the relationship between Liza and Michael York, and Ms Minnelli uses these feelings from the screen romance to inform her performance. The marvellous cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth shows her at first as a face amid the darkness, eventually throwing a light on her from behind that sends arcs out from her arms and legs as the song swells to a climax. Fosse has his camera slowly wheel about her, giving the impression that she might be singing alone. And when he eventually does show the rest of the club, it's a series of inserts that show this is a rather low-key point in the night, the audience no more than a handful of bored-looking patrons, and suddenly the whole thing has an extra layer of sadness.But there is another strand that winds its way through the movie &#x96; the rising shadow of Nazism. At first it's little more than a bit of historical background detail, seen but not directly commented upon, but eventually Hitler's thugs creep into the story and the songs, taking them over absolutely. One cannot help but speculate, since we know what subsequently happened in Germany, on the eventual fate of Fritz and Natalia, or the various possibly gay characters at the Kit Kat Club. Cabaret finally becomes a dreadfully sinister reminder that this vibrant and liberated society could become horrifically barbaric. At times it is as delightful and joyous as the finest Rodgers and Hammerstein shows, few musicals are quite so effectively chilling.

Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film with the poster was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone The Godfather from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if The Shawshank Redemption, the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of The Shawshank Redemption, its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is Get busy living or get busy dying. Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today.

In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs  Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose.

And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is Get busy living or get busy dying. Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is The Shawshank RedemptionIn the same vein than One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Shawshank is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs  Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose. This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.The Shawshank Redemption a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.

Pakula is best known for his conspiracy trilogy (Klute, The Parallax View, All the President's Men). What people forget are his other conspiracy movies, The Pelican Brief and Rollover, which somewhat prophetically deals with far reaching oil scandals, economic conspiracies, banking cartels and market manipulation. All these films have one foot in film noir, and highlight how genuine noirs morphed into the conspiracy come the 1960s, noir heroes now navigating a far larger canvas and now battling a now larger range of murky forces. Indeed, the kinds of paper trails, leads and dead ends Pakula's heroes - often newspaper reporters - are asked to deal with would stump even the greatest noir detectives or PI's of the 40s or 50s. The world's changed. The plot has thickened.Klute, to my mind the least of Pakula's conspiracy movies, opens on a tape recorder, thrusting us quickly into a world of late 60s, early 70s paranoia, electro-surveillance and distrust (see The Conversation, Chinatown, Manchurian Candidate, Polanski, Frankenheimer, Gavras, Pontecorvo etc). The film then revolves around John Klute, a wonderfully atypical noir detective (played by the bug-eyed Donald Sutherland) who is busy tracking down a friend who has mysteriously vanished. His search takes him to New York, where he is quickly immersed in a dangerous, seedy world of sex, prostitutes, murder and vulgar letters. Here he meets Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda, taking her sex-kitten image into method territory) a prostitute who aspires to be an actress. The film's main interests are the way Pakula teases out the noir hero's misogyny and re-writes the femme fatale (Bree) as a defenceless, vulnerable figure. Far from pulling strings and knowing more than she lets on, which is how Klute perceives her, Bree is a fragile girl whose insecurities have made her prey to all manners of people. The film's villain (and his motivations) remains the stuff of early noirs a power hungry business executive. The film uses the lazy trope of having a character repeatedly talk to a psychologist in order for the character's psychology to be divulged to the audience. It also too self consciously wallows in post-censorship, post-60s freedoms and indulgences, proud of Fonda's disrobings and pleased that it features a hooker as a main character. Such things don't shock today.The film's cinematography, wonderfully moody, was by Gordon Willis, perhaps the cinematographer who most defined 70s American film-making. He was responsible for the look of all of Coppola's Godfather movies, a number of Woody Allen's films, and all of Pakula's first three conspiracy flicks.It is with his subsequent conspiracy movies that Pakula would move into more interesting directions. His later films begin to ditch dark noir landscapes in favour for brightly lit, banal, but strangely ominous locations (All The President's Men, Parallax View and Rollover are wonderful for how, in their best moments, they conjure up menace out of sheer, silent architecture). They also ditch outright murder and stalkings for more ambiguous, uncertain events, and begin to move violence away from corrupt figureheads and into more elusive, amorphous directions.The cutting edge of the conspiracy\/noir genre (the two genres are by definition now inseparable) are fare like The Wire, Twin Peaks, Inland Empire, Eyes Wide Shut, X-Files, Mulholland Drive, all virtually incomparable to neo and classical noirs, positing far larger worlds, global narratives that are always in flux and never resolved. Here, even the conspirators are conspired against, the conspiracy paradoxically engenders emasculation and is upheld as a means of wrestling order\/control, the noir hero's autonomy is robbed as much from systemic and cosmic forces as from evil figureheads, man is at the mercy of a now globalized, larger world where conspiratorial forces spring from all directions (nature, DNA, family, society, technology, business, politics, inside, outside, capital, a malevolent cosmos etc), and, as is beautifully done in Eyes Wide Shut, we're not even sure who has been murdered, if anyone has been murdered, whether crimes have been committed, what crimes have been committed and whether indeed a conspiracy is even taking place; conspiracy as a product of a gap in both knowledge and desire, and conspiracy\/power as being actively sought (I seek to retain information from you).The mark of a great noir is that it initially leaves one angry and confused, welcomes re-watches and, as is the case of the aforementioned modern noirs\/conspiracy movies, gets more complex, interesting, labyrinthine, mysterious and prompts more questions when returned to (hard to do, as it requires the director to model whole worlds). Klute can't do this. It's a case of case closed.7.9\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing. See All The President's Men, The Parallax View and Rollover, the last two, despite their flaws, being Pakula's best work in this genre. All The President's Men is special too, but is ultimately too easily resolved. See also Jane Champion's underrated In The Cut. Worth one viewing.

The film's villain (and his motivations) remains the stuff of early noirs a power hungry business executive. The film uses the lazy trope of having a character repeatedly talk to a psychologist in order for the character's psychology to be divulged to the audience. It also too self consciously wallows in post-censorship, post-60s freedoms and indulgences, proud of Fonda's disrobings and pleased that it features a hooker as a main character. Such things don't shock today.The film's cinematography, wonderfully moody, was by Gordon Willis, perhaps the cinematographer who most defined 70s American film-making. He was responsible for the look of all of Coppola's Godfather movies, a number of Woody Allen's films, and all of Pakula's first three conspiracy flicks.It is with his subsequent conspiracy movies that Pakula would move into more interesting directions. His later films begin to ditch dark noir landscapes in favour for brightly lit, banal, but strangely ominous locations (All The President's Men, Parallax View and Rollover are wonderful for how, in their best moments, they conjure up menace out of sheer, silent architecture). They also ditch outright murder and stalkings for more ambiguous, uncertain events, and begin to move violence away from corrupt figureheads and into more elusive, amorphous directions.The cutting edge of the conspiracy\/noir genre (the two genres are by definition now inseparable) are fare like The Wire, Twin Peaks, Inland Empire, Eyes Wide Shut, X-Files, Mulholland Drive, all virtually incomparable to neo and classical noirs, positing far larger worlds, global narratives that are always in flux and never resolved. Here, even the conspirators are conspired against, the conspiracy paradoxically engenders emasculation and is upheld as a means of wrestling order\/control, the noir hero's autonomy is robbed as much from systemic and cosmic forces as from evil figureheads, man is at the mercy of a now globalized, larger world where conspiratorial forces spring from all directions (nature, DNA, family, society, technology, business, politics, inside, outside, capital, a malevolent cosmos etc), and, as is beautifully done in Eyes Wide Shut, we're not even sure who has been murdered, if anyone has been murdered, whether crimes have been committed, what crimes have been committed and whether indeed a conspiracy is even taking place; conspiracy as a product of a gap in both knowledge and desire, and conspiracy\/power as being actively sought (I seek to retain information from you).The mark of a great noir is that it initially leaves one angry and confused, welcomes re-watches and, as is the case of the aforementioned modern noirs\/conspiracy movies, gets more complex, interesting, labyrinthine, mysterious and prompts more questions when returned to (hard to do, as it requires the director to model whole worlds). Klute can't do this. It's a case of case closed.7.9\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing. See All The President's Men, The Parallax View and Rollover, the last two, despite their flaws, being Pakula's best work in this genre. All The President's Men is special too, but is ultimately too easily resolved. See also Jane Champion's underrated In The Cut. Worth one viewing. ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"6 October 2011","score":"","review":" Director Alan J. Pakula is best known for his conspiracy trilogy (Klute, The Parallax View, All the President's Men). What people forget are his other conspiracy movies, The Pelican Brief and Rollover, which somewhat prophetically deals with far reaching oil scandals, economic conspiracies, banking cartels and market manipulation. All these films have one foot in film noir, and highlight how genuine noirs morphed into the conspiracy come the 1960s, noir heroes now navigating a far larger canvas and now battling a now larger range of murky forces. Indeed, the kinds of paper trails, leads and dead ends Pakula's heroes - often newspaper reporters - are asked to deal with would stump even the greatest noir detectives or PI's of the 40s or 50s. The world's changed. The plot has thickened.Klute, to my mind the least of Pakula's conspiracy movies, opens on a tape recorder, thrusting us quickly into a world of late 60s, early 70s paranoia, electro-surveillance and distrust (see The Conversation, Chinatown, Manchurian Candidate, Polanski, Frankenheimer, Gavras, Pontecorvo etc). The film then revolves around John Klute, a wonderfully atypical noir detective (played by the bug-eyed Donald Sutherland) who is busy tracking down a friend who has mysteriously vanished. His search takes him to New York, where he is quickly immersed in a dangerous, seedy world of sex, prostitutes, murder and vulgar letters. Here he meets Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda, taking her sex-kitten image into method territory) a prostitute who aspires to be an actress. The film's main interests are the way Pakula teases out the noir hero's misogyny and re-writes the femme fatale (Bree) as a defenceless, vulnerable figure.

The movie is basically about the siblings of a formidable and well-known vampire that is un-named, but is obviously referring to Count Dracula -- adding the special famous shot of Bela Lugosi in the role for one brief moment. The female sibling is mourning her father's death, who was killed by a vampire hunter -- played by Peter Fonda in a very quirky role. Nadja(the daughter) is the main focus of the movie and is displayed as weak and misunderstood initially, but as the movie goes forward her evil is revealed. She becomes obsessed with a young wife, who is discontent with her husband and her life -- she goes home with her after a visit at a bar, and then puts her into a zombie-like state after having sex with her. The husband and wife then get the help of the vampire killer and the twin brother, as they try to put away Nadja. The twin brother's nurse(whom he is in love with) is taken hostage by Nadja -- giving him a reason to take his sister out. Despite the horror movie storyline, this is really more a quirky vampire drama than a scary movie. Fonda is given some really strange dialogue that I believe was added to give the movie some humor, but it's very tongue-in-cheek. There is also some very corny dialogue, but the unique feel of the movie lets you forgive them because you're glued to the screen trying to figure out what direction the movie is going next. Overall, this is a very unique and sometimes sexy movie that shouldn't be missed.

The opening reel especially is suffused with melancholy and might be a flavor-of-the-month director transposing Uncle Vanya to the Old West. Then Ford falls victim to the old 'failed flashback' syndrome in which one person - in this case James Steward - begins by recalling a scene in which he himself was present but gradually that same flashback shifts perspective so that the original person has become a reporter rather than a participant. Duke Wayne gives one of his less mannered performances here and often just his presence in a scene is sufficient to lend gravitas. I've always admired Edmond O'Brien and I resent the way Ford makes him a buffoon, Lee Marvin phones it in as the eponymous villain of the piece but overall it had a pleasant feel to it.
