Really, there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.Ben Stiller is a sad-eyed magazine writer named Ted who never got over the girl of his high school dreams, Mary, who vanished from his life after a single date in which getting horizontal meant being carted away in an ambulance. Ted has seedy detective Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) investigate a lead in Miami. Healy finds her and reports back that she's a walrus in a wheelchair. Ted thinks maybe he should check up on her anyway, to see if he can be helpful to her, but Healy explains she's now en route to Japan as a mail-order bride.Ted What are they, desperate!

By the time Ted learns the truth, Healy's already putting on the moves on Mary with the help of a fake identity and a pair of gargantuan dentures. To counter this, without himself being exposed as a `stalker,' Ted has to reintroduce himself under similarly false pretenses. Will Mary go for this old near-flame?

That's probably what redeems it and makes it such a joy to watch over and over again, the fact that this proto-`American Pie' has a real heart. The makers of the film, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, reveal in their DVD commentary that Ted's reaction to Healy's news of Mary's condition is the key to making the film work, and they are right.Frankly, I could live in a world without `American Pie' and so many other stupid raunch-fests of its ilk, but `Mary' is pure gold all the way through. Not only is the comedy saved by virtue of its brilliance (I never heard a theater laugh so hard all the way through as I did seeing this in a stuffy Greenwich, CT cinema), it's also a very cleverly put-together film, with a lot of plot twists that hold up as well as the humor during repeat viewings. It's interesting to read people's comments and see them say that it would have been a good film if they had held off on the bad-taste stuff. That was kind of what put it on the map in the first place, the `hair gel' scene and Magda's breasts and Ted's zipper problems, but I see what they mean. You almost could make this film into a Hallmark romantic film, with minimal comedy of any kind, and it would still be interesting. I don't think I'd watch it 23 times like I have this version, however. The film never stops upping the ante on the ick-meter, a large part of what makes it brilliant.Diaz and Stiller blend very well together, with special kudos to Diaz for being so utterly wonderful and charming in the title role. You understand what the title means without ever having it explained. Also terrific are the supporting players, major ones like Matt Dillon and Chris Elliott as well as Harland Williams as the six-minute abs guy and, of course, Puffy the dog. Jonathan Richman and his drummer are especially valuable in their cameo bits that bookend the various acts in the movie, with songs that manage to be as funny and affecting as the show they are built around. And the end credit sequence is the all-time best. I still smile when I hear `Build Me Up Buttercup' on the radio, don't you?

Secondly, if you are going to re-do a movie or a tale as well-known as Robin Hood, you either have to do exactly what has always been done (which gets boring but people still pay) or change things around (which makes for a more interesting film).  Prince of Thieves, even with its historical inaccuracies, makes for a very intriguing interpretation of the Robin Hood tale.1.  Who cares about Costner's accent?  We all know he's American and would probably sound pretty phony if he tried one on. 2.  There is nothing that suggests that the Sheriff will inherit the throne by marryin' Marian.  It's a move that would be viewed as smart because the Sheriff obviously was trying to gain support of the nobles in England.  Marian is beautiful and for once in his lifetime the sheriff will have something pure. 3.  The fact that the story sways, with Morgan Freeman's character Azim (spelling?), does not detract from the interesting stance the writers take...what was going on in the world during the time of Robin Hood?  The Crusades maybe?  What did young Christian noblemen do?  Go off to fight with Richard, the king who is present in the earlier stories.  Throwing in a Moor brings to light the superiority of the Islamic empire at the time, at least as far as medicine, sciences, and knowledge of gunpowder, though I grant that the movie does go a bit over the top in glorifying Azim as a wizard..though that is what people would have thought at the time.I like adventure films; I am guilty of being morbidly fascinated at the sight of blood.

Especially brilliant are the many sly references to the best-known Watergate film, 'All The President's Men,' with both films beginning inside a typewriter as the date of the Watergate burglary is typed on paper (just not that quickly or professionally in the 'Dick' version.) Other scenes, like the one where Betsy announces they are being bugged, and the parking garage meets, are clear parallels to similar scenes in 'All The President's Men.' It's almost worth it to watch them as a double feature, saving 'Dick' for after. It's not good to rush things too much if you are about to have some 'Dick.'OK, that was lame. But be warned, if that offended you, it's something you will have to deal with here. There are a lot of silly crude jokes surrounding Nixon's first name in the movie, starting with the title. Like the other less-than-stellar running gag in the comedy (people are ingesting pot without knowing it and look how much fun they are having! Creating world peace even!) it's a byproduct of a film that is sometimes less clever than its creators think it to be. What carries it along and makes it truly enjoyable are the way-out elements, such as the set and costume design (which push the '70s identification as far as possible in every frame, with awesome gusto) and the verve of the actors, particularly the leads.Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams) are good enough characters to almost wish they were left alone, with no Nixon storyline, and allowed to gambol and gossip and deal with regular growing-up issues as buddies-for-life. The actors play so well off one another that it's hard to believe they are as young as the characters they play, and they're not, a relief for those of us who ogle them in their crazy pants in every other scene.Both actors have a fetching innocence, and a willingness to overplay that serves the comedy. Dunst grabs most of the attention as the leader, her guiding principle being any idea is a good one, even if that is to tape-record a mash note to the President on his private bugging system.

It wasn't intended to be a box office runaway, or a cash cow.  It was meant to make a statement.  I was fairly young by the time this came out, but even by then, I'd found many things in my own life that I'd identify with in this movie.  First, I'm half Cherokee, and went through the whole biased, racist, halfbreed garbage myself, and still do on a rare occasion.  Secondly, I'm a martial artist, albeit of a much different style than the Hapkido studied by Tom Laughlin and the character of Billy Jack.  Thirdly, I'm what would be termed a hippie.  This movie made a very powerful statement about what racism, as far as pertains to Native Americans, was and can still be like in this country today.  It made a statement about the hippie movement, which 99.99% of its detractors have no idea what its about, or why we did it and continue to do it.  So you can tell there's a stuntman that takes Tom's place in the park. Big deal.  MANY movies, especially of that era, have similar problems with the suspension of disbelief.  The thing you have to remember is that this is a MOVIE.  Yes, its supposed to give the surrealism of watching something in real life, but we know its a movie.  Enjoy the story for the sake of the story.  Don't nit pick each and every little detail and flaw.  Ever seen those movies with the cars driving down a wet road at night, and you can see the reflection of the car headlights, and the trails they leave on the lens of the camera?  Of course you have.  This is something that will distract the nit picker but won't mean much of anything to someone trying to enjoy the story.  Besides, nobody's perfect.  You've got to be who you are, what you are, and all that is revolved around what turns you on, not in a sexual sense, but turned on as in makes you tick.  So what if Fox was the original bankroller of the film?  They obviously didn't KEEP bankrolling it. The quality is terrible, by today's standards, yes.

Why?  Because what i find funny somebody else may think is stale.  Granted most people find a scene where a toilet that has erupted feces all over a classroom is too much.

So all i'm really saying is that the movie covers all bases(caters to the whole audience and keeps everybody entertained).  They have mild humor(The kind that watches cheers,cosbys,roseanne, and friends) and excessive humor(The kind of audience that only appreciates MTV's jackass,beavis and butthead).

Lionel Braham is quite pleasant as The Ghost Of Christmas Present, and Ann Rutherford &#x96; Only 21, at the time &#x96; Does very well with her turn as The Ghost Of Christmas Past, but her screen time is way too short, thanks to the omission of some of the 'Christmas Past' sequences, from the book.A rather rotund Gene Lockhart does well as Bob Cratchit, but doesn't fit the role, physically. Two of Mr. Lockhart's real-life family members play two members of his on-screen family. His Wife, Kathleen, plays Mrs. Cratchit, and his Daughter, June (Later, of TV's 'Lassie', and 'Lost In Space'), plays the younger Cratchit Daughter, Belinda. Mrs. Lockhart does quite well, but it bothered me a bit, that her character doesn't seem to have a hateful-enough attitude toward her Husband's employer.Elvira Stevens, in a very brief 'Christmas Past' sequence, is delightful as Fran ('Fan' in the book), Scrooge's young Sister, and was very close to the character described by Dickens. Terry Kilburn was hard to accept, as Tiny Tim. He was too old (13 at the time), and definitely too big for the part, and appears way too healthy to be afflicted with the unnamed debilitating disease of Dickens' story.I was disappointed that some sequences from the book were left out, in favor of some made-up scenes. The Christmas Eve dance at Fezziwig's warehouse, Scrooge's ill-fated love affair with Belle, and the 'Rag and bone shop' scenes are the most notable absences. The producers apparently wanted to keep this film short, but it seems to me that they could have included at least one of these book scenes in place of &#x96; For instance &#x96; The snowball-throwing scene, which isn't in the original story.Overall, this is a pretty good movie. Though not nearly as faithful to Dickens' story as it could have been, some good sets and costumes convey well, the Old London atmosphere, and the special effects aren't bad, if you don't judge them by later standards.

It was actually the first TCM movie I ever saw.  Despite lots of criticism, I found it to be pretty damn good.  It worked well as a sequel and was worthy of the TCM name.  They should have left the franchise alone after that and never produced the train wreck that was TCM 3.  I haven't even seen part 4 yet.  I understand it is pretty horrible.

To me, he brings a weary, defeated, and depressed vibe to every role he plays. This works well in some films (The Remains Of The Day, Silence Of The Lambs) and backfires in many others (The Human Stain, ANY attempt at comedy). When I heard that Oliver Stone would be making a film about Richard Nixon, I had high hopes. Watching the film, however, I am sure that Mr. Hopkins was the wrong actor for the lead.Oliver Stone's Nixon attempts to tragedize the rise and fall of one of America's most controversial presidents, and not being an expert on Richard Nixon, I expected to learn a lot about him; his motivations, both personal and political, that drove him to do the things he did. But what we're left with is a frenetic newsreel, a glorified made-for-TV dramatized documentary. (Bear in mind that I think Oliver Stone is a GREAT director, and that The Doors is one of the most underrated films of the 90's.) We never find Nixon's heart or soul, and while I cannot blame Hopkins completely for this, it doesn't help that he plays him as a disoriented, mumbling stumbling robot who speaks in a barely-concealed Welsh accent. This was a role for an American actor, pure and simple.While the supporting cast is top-rate (including the always-brilliant James Woods), they have little to do except circle around Nixon until the inevitable. Stone tries to portray Nixon as a great but flawed man, but the undeniable image we are left with is simply a weak-willed politician for whom winning is more important than anything else (SEE Bill Clinton).Nixon wasn't the man behind the Kennedy assassination, the Bay of Pigs debacle, the Vietnam War, or any of the other government-sponsored disasters of the 1960's. He, like Lee Harvey Oswald, was really just a patsy... a puppet used by the real men in power to stoke their war and take America away from the people.

Steptoe, it being a British-focused film. Generic, geriatric exercise in Boys' Own heroism, based on a real-life story, though dressed up with goofy sitcom dialogue and a slumming cast of over-the-hill stars.The film is an amiable-enough timekiller, but hopelessly disjointed in tone, even more so than the better-known comic war film Kelly's Heroes because it doesn't make nearly the same case for itself in terms of pure entertainment. You have two stories, neither very strong. In one, a bunch of old-timers try to do their bit for the Allied cause in the backwater of India. The other is a kind of retro-James Bond yarn featuring 007 Mark II himself, Roger Moore, bedhopping and punning like a madman. I like Moore a lot, and in other efforts of the same period with director Andrew V. McLagen, like The Wild Geese and the underappreciated ffolkes, Moore made a case for himself as someone who could deliver the goods in guises other than that of Britain's greatest secret agent. This time, he's strictly a by-the-numbers bully-with-a-cause half the time, then consigned to the background (arranging a fireworks diversion, of all things, while the central story is resolved by the rest of the cast). You wonder why Moore bothered, except perhaps for a nice jaunt in India on someone else's dime. Shoulda waited for Octopussy. Even a bad Bond is better than this.This story actually happened, as we are told, but one wonders why the producers thought it so worthy of cinematic treatment. The raid on the German merchantmen in the neutral Portugese colony of Goa is pretty routine on-screen, with nearly everyone getting shot in the arm but no serious suspense. The Germans seem too easily cowed. David Niven looks in danger of imminent angina attack in one of his last roles, while Gregory Peck struggles unsuccessfully with an English accent (apparently having learned nothing from his similar botched job in the Hitchcock fiasco The Paradine Case.) The jokes fly fast, but they creak as much as the all-fogy commando squad. There's about three upchuck routines alone as the raiders sail to Goa on a rusty old tub called `Phoebe.' Some feeble efforts at characterization go nowhere, like Patrick Macnee's Yogi character, who natters on about his Eastern philosophy a little but otherwise just sets explosives and is easily ignored.Everyone is ignorable, though, even Peck. I did appreciate Allan Cuthbertson as the game, stodgy Melbourne (a recognizable Guns of Navarone alumnus, with Niven and Peck), and the scene where the crew of the Phoebe mistakes a shark fin for a U-Boat periscope (followed nicely by a scene where the real U-Boat gets the Phoebe in its sights, only to have its captain decide the scow's not worth a torpedo anyway.) The scenery is nice, including Barbara Kellerman, who's unfortunately not as interesting in the villainness department (though I blame the script more than her.)

It's not exciting, it's not funny, and it's not appealing to the eye. The shoddy production values (at least for a film with a cast, director, and writer of such high calibre) were apparent to many critics of the time, so the video and DVD releases probably look no worse than the film did in 1953.

There were a few reasons I did not like this movie. For one I watched it In the morning-after very little sleep-NOT a good time to watch a movie like this! Also-the plot. It was very confusing and just very movieish if that makes sense. Action oriented with many typical type movie scenes thrown in. I can't give specifics as it is difficult for me to remember it scene by scene which I guess means I didn't like it.I'm also not a major Sean Connery fan but this movie just seemed longer then it was and a bit off the top at times. It didn't make a strong impression on me and it seemed like typical Connory. Definitely not the worst but would not see it again.

At 65, director Hawks was still in top form, and the risks he took paid off...HATARI!, despite it's length, is never boring!The story focuses on a season with a team of professional hunter\/trappers, capturing animals for zoos and circuses. With a breathtaking opening scene of a rhino chase, costing them the use of veteran driver, 'Indian' (legendary actor Bruce Cabot), the 'family' dynamic is quickly established, with rugged Sean Mercer (Wayne) both boss and father-figure to the group. As he and the rest of the 'family' (Red Buttons, Hardy Krüger, Valentin de Vargas, and Michèle Girardon) meet 'Indian's' replacement, 'Chips' (Gérard Blain), Mercer has an even bigger headache to deal with; beautiful photographer Anna Maria 'Dallas' D'Allesandro (Elsa Martinelli) has arrived, to shoot a magazine spread. A 'traditional' Hawks leading lady, 'Dallas' is feisty, sultry, and attracted to Mercer, and the older man, uncomfortable with the ease by which she fits into the group, as well as his own stirrings, tries to make it clear that romance has no place on his agenda (in much the same manner as he did with Angie Dickinson in RIO BRAVO...and with the same results).While some elements of the story are dated and politically incorrect (shooting a baby African elephant, even as a 'mercy killing', would be a major offense, today, as it is an endangered species), the combination of spectacular 'hunt' sequences, and the warmth and easy camaraderie of the cast in the subplots make HATARI! a rich, rewarding experience.A major plus for the film is a very atypical Henry Mancini score, combining tense, African-influenced themes for the chases, and the very funny 'Elephant Walk' to punctuate 'Dallas's' relationship with her adopted pachyderm 'children'. The baby elephant scenes are film highlights, as is the rocket capture of a tree filled with monkeys, and both rhino chases (which clearly shows Wayne in some real danger!)From the opening rhino sequence to the closing 'Honeymoon' scene, HATARI! is a grand entertainment, and escapism at it's best!
