I was going in, expecting to see another half-hearted attempt at a vampire movie and was pleasantly surprised. It was original it its history and treatment of vampires, and had some very interesting changes to some myths and legends. Definately not just another butchered remake of Bram Stoker's tale. Nor was it a vampire movie where my friends and I found ourselves playing 'Name that Clan', as is often done among White Wolf gamers. Some pleasantly original ideas went into making this film.  It was also very humorous, having more one liners than you can shake a stake at. James Woods was highly entertaining. The audience was quite responsive, cheering and booing, oohing and aahing during the film, and applauding as the closing credits rolled. It's been a long time since I've been to see a movie where the audience got that into watching the film. It was an all around pleasurable experience, and I definately recommend that you see this movie once it's released. I know I'll be seeing it again.

And in fact the film starts in French.  Yes, things do happen, but episodically, by way of illustration , not in relation to any central, continual story.What interested me in retrospect was WHY it's plotless, and what that says about the kind of portrait being drawn here.The film is putatively about the protagonist, whom we see from childhood through adolescence. But in fact it is a carefully drawn study of that classic ideal, the Honest and Just Man.  In this case, her father, based on the novelist James Jones (played by Kris Kristofferson, whose craggy face so suits the ideal in question that he hardly has to speak.)Most of the incidents serve to demonstrate one of two points that her father is deeply loving and understanding, and a bit unconventional (as is her mother), and that the family - which includes her adopted French brother - is close and loving despite being outsiders both in France and the US.  We also see scattered images of her sexual awakening (which includes some early promiscuity), but even these in the end say more about her father than her.The film's greatest strength is, in fact, this portrait of a family united in unconditional love, which endures even after the father's death.  This image - certainly a profoundly tempting ideal to many of us - lingers after the film is over and is its most satisfying element.  And in fact the film stayed with me well after I'd seen it, and I could recommend it to many viewers on that basis.But&#133;  why is a film with four characters, rich in emotion, devoid of a central plot?Because it's devoid of a central conflict.  The father is relentlessly understanding and loving; the daughter is relentlessly grateful.  Meanwhile , it's clear, even in this idealized portrait, that both parents drink (a lot).  The daughter's attachment to another outsider at one school and her sexual acting out at another are never really examined.  Yet they suggest something far more difficult and conflicted than a happy childhood.  Certainly, the known effects of growing up with alcoholic are barely acknowledged, much less highlighted.Perhaps this was a conscious decision, an attempt to avoid an aspect that of course is overdone in much contemporary drama.  But certainly it points to SOME drama at the heart of this family, some conflict that might have more productively been examined and used as a guiding thread. (Even the simple fact of adoring a 'perfect' father has its own inherent conflicts, as was beautifully shown in Eve's Bayou.)So what we end up with is an ideal, and certainly the hunger for ideals is real enough.  But here I felt too that it was a missed opportunity, an attempt to portray perfection at the expense of achieving resolution.
