[{"date":"8 February 2013","score":"","review":" Ravenous is a 1999 Horror Comedy and while it may not be very funny it is scary good.Ravenous has some really strong star power pushing it and I think that helps the film a great deal.One of the films many strong points is it's very creepy and unusual soundtrack which I absolutely love. The film also showcases very good performances from Robert Carlyle and Jeffery Jones. The film spares no expense when it comes to gore and blood as the whole film is about cannibalism and murder. If there is a problem I had with the film is that it got a little cheesy at points and that some of the comedy was not very funny at points, but that is that.See this flick if you like blood,guts,and gore.Skip it if you are disgusted easily and if you find the tale of Wendigo boring. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 February 2013","score":"","review":" Ravenous is a 1999 Horror Comedy and while it may not be very funny it is scary good.Ravenous has some really strong star power pushing it and I think that helps the film a great deal.One of the films many strong points is it's very creepy and unusual soundtrack which I absolutely love.
