I was expecting a good old-fashioned serious court drama but instead I got all the information handed on a plate and the serious part was very unfortunately and unsuccessfully combined with unintelligent and highly annoying and unappropriate humor that made the movie feel less credible and almost cheap. For this I blame everything on Elsa Lanchester who perhaps played one of the least suitable and useless not to mention most blatant and annoying characters I ever saw in a movie of such caliber. Her stupid facial expressions and lines during the trial should have been completely edited out and burned but she got nominated for an Oscar instead. Charles Laughton was the only truly bright star of this movie as he was  the only one who wasn't all that transparent and provided the best moments and laughs throughout the movie. His performance was really good, but somewhat short of being David Niven good. As for our main femme fatale, mrs. Dietrich's performance was the key to figuring out the plot before the foundations were even laid. When we first see her, turning up at Sir Wilfrid Robarts's house her striking and sinister-looking face made it perfectly clear.My reasoning - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The plot would definitely include her somewhere in the disentanglement, because the character is simply too imposing and she will definitely turn out to be one of the good guys because it's just too obvious to let her stay evil-looking through the entire picture. Either that or the movie was really going to suck. So it made me think that the good guy, her husband, played by Tyrone Power, was also more than met the eye, he was just too nice and too innocent for some reason. With this in mind I quickly realized that the two would work together either that or they were giving extremely bad performances. So basically the movie was finished as far as anticipation and mystery was concerned. I didn't however, put two and two together with Christine's disguise although I kept wondering if a woman could be that ugly and even more so to as how she got the letters to the husband in the first place. And the very ending was also a surprise when Leonard ditches Christine and explains why.   So sadly, I was deprived of the big surprise, or turn of events if you will, but it made me realize that I had perhaps seen a crime drama too many not to complete such a simple and obvious puzzle.

The mysterious killer targets a certain group of friends who initially do not realize, or even ignore, the upcoming danger and fall prey to   his clutches. They leave their rooms unlocked or go alone in the forest at night. The killer's main victim seems to be Natalie (Alicia Witt) a very typical gal, at least on the surface. The killer stalks her and harasses her continuously and Natalie not only tries to convince everyone about the danger in vain, but has to deal with melanic issues from her past. People soon start dropping like flies and Natalie and her friends are helpless before they all meet their fate. Many years before the incidents the college was rumored to have been plagued by an insane professor who flipped and invaded the students' dormitory killing many fraternity members at one single night. One of the few survivors is proven to be a sociopath weird janitor who is not willing to share his traumatic memories in order to help solving the mystery of this new killing spree. The murderer is much more than a freaked loser copycat who simply wants to rekindle the horror on the 25th anniversary of the alleged massacre, but has an obscure agenda.Maybe all these plot elements sound stereotyped and nothing special. The premise of a horror movie localized in a college is as old as it gets and has been done to death (no pun intended). Nevertheless there is a special originality in this film. The killer's modus operandi follows a unique pattern of an urban legend methodology. You probably all know what an urban legend is. Folklore stories which are always laying on the verge of reality and myth. Usually they are scary crimes and everyone seems to know or have heard or have read a similar crime although no one seems to have actually enlisted specific names. Stories like these are usually typical frightening tales. One example is the poisoned candy children are frequently treated on Halloween by insane people. Another example is the seemingly normal father who mysteriously brutally slaughtered his entire family over one night, preferably by axe, and disappeared never to be heard of again. The screenwriter plays cleverly with all the cliches and the fears of the dark. The urban legends provide fertile ground for some genuinely original and shocking death scenes. Urban Legend, despite an intriguing premise, cannot hide its  origin. It is a typical 90's horror film mixed with a whodunit subplot, recognizable TV faces and plenty of gore. The film succeeds in being a memorable and above average effort but if you are set to watch it you are bound to find all the stupid overused themes a teeny bopper provides (without nudity though that is the determinant between 80's and 90's). There are plot holes the size of a volcano crater. For example the police officers are so dim witted that they regard a clearly obvious strangulation which would probably have left distinct bruises on the victim's neck as a suicide. Moreover why, oh why don't they send officers during the climactic tragic events after all those murders. I can accept the fact that the phone lines were dead but couldn't someone just go and ask for help? When they do arrive it is far too late. The cast was also over-crowded and it was obvious that the protagonists were nothing more than screen fillers. It is too bad since their acting skills, which seemed promising, were withheld. For example Jared Leto and Michael Rosenbaum are Paul and Parker respectively. Although the film starts off interestingly with equal screen time, Natalie soon wins the absolute focus and their roles are so small that they end up being extras. Things are even worse for Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) and Sasha (Tara Reid) who also had shrunken roles and are wandering pretty faces waiting in line to be sliced and diced. Although the suspects are many, the final revelation of the killer is weak, the motives even weaker and of course we have the inevitable cat-lived nature of the killer-who-refuses-to-die escorted by the predictable cliffhanger epilogue with the TO BE SEQUELED sign.An extra detrimental element is the presence of Alicia Witt in an especially important role. Her acting is not awful but it is definitely misguided and fails. Witt is way too calm to convince as a realistic character. After a certain point it is clear that her psychopath stalker has not only killed her friends, but is after her, and she doesn't even show a trace of panic. She DOES try of course to warn the bonehead authorities and she does a little research on the urban legends. The bad thing is that even in the gruesome finale she doesn't seem to fear the maniac even a little bit and even worse she is not the willing-to-fight heroine that Sidney Prescott in Scream was. Now I don't want to be misunderstood, I wasn't looking for Jamie Lee Curtis's overblown vocal pipes but she could have more human reactions, especially after the deaths of her friends. It's as though Natalie had read the victim list and knew that she had a contractual commitment to survive until the end. The only one of the main characters with some substance is Joshua Jackson as Damon. This guy is a derivative from other horror films and strikes as a cardboard cutout a prankster who teases his friends and is slightly horny. At least Damon has a certain and sensible persona and Jackson is adequate. The funniest aspect of the film is that the cameos are far more successful and memorable than the leads!! Danielle Harris in a short role is the quite trendy Gothic young diva who is the incarnation of the Lust sin, the aged John Neville is the strict and by the rules Dean of the University and Brad Dourif gives an excellent performance in a role which I won't reveal. The best of them is Robert Englund as the clever and a bit creepy Professor who teaches folklore and introduces his students to the urban legends. Professor Wexler seems to be the chief suspect for this horrific situation and although there are sporadic hints throughout the film which point to other directions, Englund virtually dominates the screen even with his absence!!! Of course I won't omit Loretta Devine as Reese the guardian of the University who is very funny and adds the necessary comic relief. Who could have thought? A woman and indeed a black one as the cop\/protector. It is another attempt to break a few cliches. Well done casting directors.Apart from some good performances Urban Legend has many other assets. The opening sequence alone was enough to keep me hooked on as I realized I would watch a great film. The rainy frames and the professional shooting with the distant take angles is enough to pose the threatening tone and warn us about what is to follow. The introductory scene is a stand alone masterpiece. The killer here doesn't have a costume but hides under a winter jacket with a cowl and this gives a realistic touch and a difficulty in pinpointing the culprit since many people have the same type of jacket. The best part of Urban Legend is the setting and the cinematography. The university buildings are bulky and old enough to support a medieval atmosphere which excites our imagination. Further, these baroque aged buildings give a much more scary climate and ensure that no matter how much they run, the protagonists will never get away since the corridors are so long that probably no one is going to hear them scream. But the greatest virtue is the photography which was dreary and gave a sense of a documentary style. The best example to describe the stigma the director tried to pull off are the library scenes. The leads are in a situation reminiscent of the Name of the Rose (lacking the religious undertones of course!!!) and are trapped in an infernal game they cannot escape. The whole point of view of the movie is clearly cinematic and the imaging techniques are much supportive. As I aforementioned the death scenes are fascinating and catapult the adrenaline to heights. Although the character development is bare you feel sorry for the victims (well, OK, for most of them). One surprise follows another as the body count increases. It comes as a great disappointment therefore that after a chilling 90 minutes period, the last 30 minutes go downhill. The action is very weak, the suspense retreats and we are left with overacting, inept and predictable plot twists, inadequate explanations and a rather disappointing climax . I mean how could anyone not wonder why the maniac wouldn't just kill Natalie and get over with this revenging mission instead of doing this wild carnage. So be warned the last half hour is extremely disappointing. Thus, if you are a horror fan who wants an entertaining thriller Urban Legend is a good shot. Despite some letdowns Urban Legend is yet another landmark in 90's horror genre. URBAN LEGEND - 8 \/ 10  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2003","score":"25 out of 45 people found the following review useful","review":"  A local college is being terrorized by brutal murders. The mysterious killer targets a certain group of friends who initially do not realize, or even ignore, the upcoming danger and fall prey to   his clutches. They leave their rooms unlocked or go alone in the forest at night. The killer's main victim seems to be Natalie (Alicia Witt) a very typical gal, at least on the surface. The killer stalks her and harasses her continuously and Natalie not only tries to convince everyone about the danger in vain, but has to deal with melanic issues from her past. People soon start dropping like flies and Natalie and her friends are helpless before they all meet their fate. Many years before the incidents the college was rumored to have been plagued by an insane professor who flipped and invaded the students' dormitory killing many fraternity members at one single night. One of the few survivors is proven to be a sociopath weird janitor who is not willing to share his traumatic memories in order to help solving the mystery of this new killing spree. The murderer is much more than a freaked loser copycat who simply wants to rekindle the horror on the 25th anniversary of the alleged massacre, but has an obscure agenda.Maybe all these plot elements sound stereotyped and nothing special. The premise of a horror movie localized in a college is as old as it gets and has been done to death (no pun intended). Nevertheless there is a special originality in this film. The killer's modus operandi follows a unique pattern of an urban legend methodology. You probably all know what an urban legend is. Folklore stories which are always laying on the verge of reality and myth. Usually they are scary crimes and everyone seems to know or have heard or have read a similar crime although no one seems to have actually enlisted specific names. Stories like these are usually typical frightening tales. One example is the poisoned candy children are frequently treated on Halloween by insane people. Another example is the seemingly normal father who mysteriously brutally slaughtered his entire family over one night, preferably by axe, and disappeared never to be heard of again. The screenwriter plays cleverly with all the cliches and the fears of the dark. The urban legends provide fertile ground for some genuinely original and shocking death scenes. Urban Legend, despite an intriguing premise, cannot hide its  origin. It is a typical 90's horror film mixed with a whodunit subplot, recognizable TV faces and plenty of gore. The film succeeds in being a memorable and above average effort but if you are set to watch it you are bound to find all the stupid overused themes a teeny bopper provides (without nudity though that is the determinant between 80's and 90's). There are plot holes the size of a volcano crater. For example the police officers are so dim witted that they regard a clearly obvious strangulation which would probably have left distinct bruises on the victim's neck as a suicide. Moreover why, oh why don't they send officers during the climactic tragic events after all those murders. I can accept the fact that the phone lines were dead but couldn't someone just go and ask for help? When they do arrive it is far too late. The cast was also over-crowded and it was obvious that the protagonists were nothing more than screen fillers. It is too bad since their acting skills, which seemed promising, were withheld. For example Jared Leto and Michael Rosenbaum are Paul and Parker respectively. Although the film starts off interestingly with equal screen time, Natalie soon wins the absolute focus and their roles are so small that they end up being extras. Things are even worse for Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) and Sasha (Tara Reid) who also had shrunken roles and are wandering pretty faces waiting in line to be sliced and diced. Although the suspects are many, the final revelation of the killer is weak, the motives even weaker and of course we have the inevitable cat-lived nature of the killer-who-refuses-to-die escorted by the predictable cliffhanger epilogue with the TO BE SEQUELED sign.An extra detrimental element is the presence of Alicia Witt in an especially important role. Her acting is not awful but it is definitely misguided and fails. Witt is way too calm to convince as a realistic character. After a certain point it is clear that her psychopath stalker has not only killed her friends, but is after her, and she doesn't even show a trace of panic. She DOES try of course to warn the bonehead authorities and she does a little research on the urban legends. The bad thing is that even in the gruesome finale she doesn't seem to fear the maniac even a little bit and even worse she is not the willing-to-fight heroine that Sidney Prescott in Scream was. Now I don't want to be misunderstood, I wasn't looking for Jamie Lee Curtis's overblown vocal pipes but she could have more human reactions, especially after the deaths of her friends. It's as though Natalie had read the victim list and knew that she had a contractual commitment to survive until the end. The only one of the main characters with some substance is Joshua Jackson as Damon. This guy is a derivative from other horror films and strikes as a cardboard cutout a prankster who teases his friends and is slightly horny. At least Damon has a certain and sensible persona and Jackson is adequate. The funniest aspect of the film is that the cameos are far more successful and memorable than the leads!! Danielle Harris in a short role is the quite trendy Gothic young diva who is the incarnation of the Lust sin, the aged John Neville is the strict and by the rules Dean of the University and Brad Dourif gives an excellent performance in a role which I won't reveal. The best of them is Robert Englund as the clever and a bit creepy Professor who teaches folklore and introduces his students to the urban legends. Professor Wexler seems to be the chief suspect for this horrific situation and although there are sporadic hints throughout the film which point to other directions, Englund virtually dominates the screen even with his absence!!! Of course I won't omit Loretta Devine as Reese the guardian of the University who is very funny and adds the necessary comic relief. Who could have thought? A woman and indeed a black one as the cop\/protector. It is another attempt to break a few cliches. Well done casting directors.Apart from some good performances Urban Legend has many other assets.

I think it was the most surprising Wellesian experience i've had since my initial viewing of Citizen Kane. Welles injects his brilliant visual sensibilities and gift for telling a story with a camera into a dark, exciting crime story. Quite simply - its the greatest film noir ever made - the best thriller i've ever seen, and certainly more suspenseful than anything Hitchcock ever did. I won't talk about any images or shots, because i think words can't do justice to them - but i will say that Touch of Evil is much more than just the opening shot this opening shot, while incredible, is all anyone ever says about this movie. There are many other great moments in it. Just make sure you see the 1998 version, currently out on DVD under the phrase restored to Orson Welles' vision - the original theatrical release of 1958 was not edited to Welles' vision, and was released the way the studio wanted it. Welles' would have been happy with the 1998 restoration, which was edited how he wanted it done.The most surprising thing about Touch of Evil was Welles' performance - i'm a big fan of Welles' as a director, but i usually just enjoy his acting, though it often seems ungenuine (in Othello and Macbeth, for example). Recently i've been exposed to his great performance in Compulsion and his own cinematic opus Chimes at Midnight as Falstaff. Yet Hank Quinlan seemed to me the most true and genuine of the lot. Often, especially near the end, i got the feeling i do when watching Brando - that i'm really watching a character. When the character on screen is so convincing it starts to change your perception of the actor's personality! There were a few moments when he touched me to the quick with his acting - Quinlan's halo line, near the end, was one.Touch of evil is a thing to be beheld. Although his four surviving masterpieces are hard to pick between, i place it here1. Citizen Kane 2. Touch of Evil 3. Chimes at Midnight 4. The TrialTo place it above Chimes at Midnight is high praise indeed - though Chimes perhaps has more stunning visual moments, especially for its lesser budget, i guess i could associate more with this noirish world than with the Shakespearean world of Chimes.Clifford.

However all the fun began to vanish when the movie decided to take itself more seriously than it had the right to. At this point, its demands became disturbing and somewhat devious.(As noted by other reviewers) The movie shamelessly plugged every cliché ever recorded on celluloid rain-soaked confrontations, public declarations, cute animals, needy children, convenient diseases, gay\/minority best friends with a heart of gold - but no real life of their own, and BAD SINGING! Yet the movie still felt that it could (and SHOULD) present itself as a somber tribute to the pain of life and love. The repeated and ridiculously heavy-handed diatribes about Sara's trying to, control her uncontrollable circumstances and, die with dignity seemed as if they were beamed in to give all the preceding romantic fluffiness weight. I have no problem with those arguments, but they belonged in another movie and appeared extremely contrived. Dying young is perhaps the ultimate example of life's unfairness, but to try to make a movie that is both eye candy and reality tale is almost as unfair.

I always try to respect a movie's genre. This was a romantic comedy\/fantasy so I wasn't expecting Kramer vs. Kramer. I could accept the melodramatic premise (beautiful dying girl falls in love with\/tries to save handsome self-involved young man from himself) but most of the movie just didn't sit well with me. When trying to gather my overall impression, my mind can't help but bring up the scene where Sara is vomiting on the floor of her bedroom.I really don't think I was asking for much. Instead, I think the movie demanded too much. Suspending my disbelief was a fair requirement. I actually consider it part of the fun. However all the fun began to vanish when the movie decided to take itself more seriously than it had the right to. At this point, its demands became disturbing and somewhat devious.(As noted by other reviewers) The movie shamelessly plugged every cliché ever recorded on celluloid rain-soaked confrontations, public declarations, cute animals, needy children, convenient diseases, gay\/minority best friends with a heart of gold - but no real life of their own, and BAD SINGING!

'Fast Times' deserves special kudos because it came out when the times in question were still taking place - in fact 'Fast Times' would go on to define its era as the must-see comedy for those who made up the movie's subject matter back in late '82 and early '83.Here's my problem It's not much of a comedy. Sure, it has funny moments, but it's very downbeat too much of the time. The two main female characters, played by Jennifer Jason-Leigh (Stacy) and Phoebe Cates (Linda), give solid performances but have hardly a true laugh between them, other than Cates' simple action of opening a door. The male characters have their funny scenes, too, but in-between acts of such casual cruelty and harshness that it really doesn't compensate. Here's something to ponder The funniest performance in this film is by a guy whose only other comedies were 'Shanghai Surprise' and 'We're No Angels.' Sean Penn is very good as Spicoli, but he's got the one character you are encouraged to laugh at, him and Ray Walston's Mr. Hand, of course, both hilarious. 'Jefferson was saying if we don't get some cool rules pronto, we'll be bogus, too!' When they aren't in the film, my attention drifts. As a comedy, it's alternately funny and flailing. As a drama, this is an afterschool special with swear words and nudity.'Fast Times' is fun to watch simply for the time-capsule elements. Writer Cameron Crowe really had his ear to the ground as he took measure of a LA-area high school in the guise of a student, and director Amy Heckerling has a clearly sympathetic understanding for the tribal rites of the young. The score is warmed-over '70s mellow guitar rock already past its prime, but offers great songs, none better than Jackson Browne's last great hit, 'Somebody's Baby,' which had its first release on the 'Fast Times' soundtrack (and might be subtitled 'Stacey's Sex Theme' as it shows up whenever she gets it on.) Heckerling doesn't gloss up the sex (the first such scene takes place in a grimy concrete bunker with the memorable graffito 'Surf Nazis' over Stacy's head), and that's to her credit. The film's grittiness works in this way for me because the early '80s seem on retrospect a less innocent time than the earlier eras depicted in the other teen films, the first time in which sex between young people could be truly casual while traditional religious and social strictures seemed to fall mute. In that way, she hits the right notes.But Heckerling accepts this casualness to the point of promulgating it. We see Stacy unabashedly learning about oral sex with a carrot and getting an abortion in which her main source of pain seems to be about getting a ride and money from the guy who knocked her up. With AIDS just around the corner, and a host of moral issues surrounding unbridled sex among minors, I find myself wanting to scream at the screen like Mr. Hand 'What are you people, on dope?'That's a personal issue a lot of 'Fast Times' viewers won't join me in feeling. What I think is a broader problem is the shallowness of the story lines and the characters, how lacking in deeper resonance they are. As Heckerling points out in her joint DVD commentary with Crowe, Mark (Rat) Ratner is someone who finds sex as difficult as others find trigonometry. He's a nerd, and I can relate, so how is it the attractive, sexually active Stacey chooses him and seeks a relationship with him? Hot girls don't chase nerds, simple as that. The film might have tried to flesh out this relationship and offer some explanation why else she likes him other than his awkward smile, his obvious desire, and his willingness to offer her some encouragement after Mr. Vargas' morgue demonstration, but you are left with a couple of half-finished, awkward conversations and the sense that they had to wind up together because they are the lead actors.'Fast Times' is a fun film to watch, but thin as the soles on a pair of checkered loafers. It's the definitive teen film of its time, but 'Valley Girl' and 'Sixteen Candles' have better narratives, 'The Breakfast Club' more interesting characters, and 'Last American Virgin' a stronger ending. If it was just Sean Penn and Ray Walston sitting at Perry's Pizza for ninety minutes, in a sort of 'My Dinner With Spicoli,' I think 'Fast Times' would have been more fun.

This is one of thosemovies that can and should be watched over and over again. Every time it is seen it gives the viewer the feeling of christmas andhopefully, it helps them to realize that they should be thankful forwhat they have and just be happy with their life. The acting in this movie is actually really good considering thetime when it was made.  It doesn't come off as cheesy or corny atall.  It's believable and it's like you almost can't tell that it's justacting.  The casting director picked some great actors\/actressesfor this movie.  Jimmy Stewart is absolutely great as George Bailey.  It's AWonderful Life wouldn't be as good as it is without Stewart playingthe main character.  Stewart can portray all kinds of emotions andactually make the viewer believe that that is what he is feeling.  Hecan be enthusiastic, sad, happy, or really mad and the viewer won'teven know he is acting.  Donna Reed made a wonderful Mary Bailey.  She plays one ofthose wives that sticks by her man no matter what.  And shemakes a really believable mother.  Stewart and Reed together make a great acting pair and they arepart of the reason that It's A Wonderful Life is as great as it is.The setting in this movie was all the little town of Bedford Falls. There was no fake backgrounds, everything was real, realbuildings, real cars, real trees etc.  The only wierd thing that wasn'treal was at the beginning of the movie when the angels are likegalaxies up in the sky.  That whole scene wasn't very realistic andit was kind of odd, but despite it's oddness this movie is still great!The music was all background except for when the characters inthe movie sing.  The music was nice and it really adds to themovie. It's A Wonderful Life is a great film and this reviewer will never beconvinced that it isn't.  It is a classic and it is one that should neverbe forgotten.

There he signed on as crewman on a merchant vessel and spent the next 15 years sailing the seven seas. At 30 years of age he landed in London and decided to settle. He married and began writing novels - in English. Now, what kind of English he learnt aboard merchant sailing ships late in the 19th Century might well be imagined Greeks, Italians, Chinese, Filipinos, Indians, Galicians.........  However, his novels are among the greatest literary achievements in literature in the English language. His first novel near 1900, but as he had not been schooled in the Victorian style, his narrative was entirely different. Basing himself on his own experiences roaming the wild and wide seas, where he even went through a shipwreck, his novels were on the one hand resounding novels of adventure, if not of the swashbuckler type, but backed up by that deeply rooted Russian philosophical sense of feelings and human emotions. His novels are not simply `yarns' as such; nor are they simply romantic `nouvelles'; nor are they simply autobiographical; they are combination of all these, and much more. Today, among the best pieces of literature ever written in English, we have `Lord Jim' and `Nostromo', two gigantic tales with superb human and humane backgrounds.Simply watching a film based on a Joseph Conrad novel is not enough to reveal all the invisible, profound thoughts, the real human philosophy of life, how humans think and react under different situations. To really understand this author it is imperative that you slowly read and digest his works. Perhaps you should start with `Almayer's Folly' before embarking on the two previously mentioned masterpieces.However, `Swept from the Sea', based on his story `Amy Foster' does wonderfully well in not only showing the story, but also giving us a glimpse into the powerful thinking of Joseph Conrad. This point was evidently on Ms. Beeban Kidron's mind when she set out on making this film. Ably helped by her cast, the result is pretty good, even more than good. Vincent Perez is not bad, even quite good at times; Rachel Weisz has made the job of her life in a highly concentrated reading, and the supporting cast like Ian McKellar and Kathy Bates is top-notch stuff. The filming sequences on the Cornish coast in the deep south west of England, especially with the fog curling round the forelands and creeping up the inlets and into the harbours, or in the pouring rain, gives excellent ambientation to the telling of the story. John Barry's musical apportation was the same as always, such that if I had closed my eyes I might well have been watching `Dances With Wolves' (qv); however it fitted in with the proceedings and the photography well enough.Filmed on the wild coastline of Cornwall, south-west England, now tamed by the August hordes of campers and footpathers, carvanners and English language learners; IMDb lists Pentire Point on the northern coastline, but I cannot help thinking that I saw some village streets such as in Mullion, Coverack or even Mousehole (pronounced muzzle) on the south coast of that beautiful holidaying area of England. The famous author John Le Carré also has his home down there.This is a film worth seeing, even for the most pedantic and enthusiastic readers of Conrad's novels such as I, precisely because I think Conrad himself would have been quite pleased with Ms. Kidron's work, with Tim Willocks' very correct adaptation for the screen.  But whatever happens, do not pass up reading and seeing Conrad's Masterpiece, converted into a masterpiece for TV Nostromo (1996) (mini) (qv).

Watching it now, I still enjoy it very much, despite some questionable moments, I think this was a very well planned thriller that sends chills down your spine and makes you watch your back to make sure you are not being followed. Keanu Reeves as a villain, actually, in some sick way, it works, he does have the creepiness vibe down. I mean, this is Keanu Reeves we're talking about and he's actually pretty good in this film. I would say him and Marissa carry the film very well together. James Spader does an alright job. But the story is a very good one that I'm sure you'll like.Joel is a detective who has just moved to Chicago to get away from some bad situations where he used to live. Mainly to get away from a love who was murdered, but the murderer he was investigating follows him to Chicago. The murderer, David Griffin, studies females, memorizes their schedules, tortures and kills them. But now he's mocking the police when he gives them a picture of a girl and gives them 24 hours to find her, but they keep failing. David wants Joes to admit that they are one of a kind and that they need each other. He even goes as far as to attack Joel's psychiatrist, Polly, who is close to Joel.The Watcher was by no means film of the year, but I felt like it was an intelligent thriller. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the whole situation with David giving the photos to the police, them broadcasting it across the news, and yet somehow they fail? No one recognized these girls? It just seemed a tad unbelievable. But other than that, I would recommend this film, I thought it was good and if you enjoy thrillers, I think you'll like it too.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2003","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw The Watcher in the movie theaters with my dad and sister, in 2000, I think this was my favorite film.
