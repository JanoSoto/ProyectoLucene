Right from the glorious opening shot, as Brian Henson's camera glides over a convincing Dickensian townscape before coming to rest in a snowy town square teeming with surreal and hilarious activity (fans of the show will get a big kick out of the speaking vegetables and the brief cameo by lunatic boomerang fish salesman Lew Zealand), you know you're in for something very special. Gonzo, the self-styled connoisseur of pain, and his wisecracking little pal Rizzo the rat take centre stage as the storytellers, setting the scene just before Michael Caine as Scrooge (in one of his very finest performances) strides around the corner and an already unfeasibly busy film bursts into stunning, detailed and endlessly rewatchable life. The set design in this film is just amazing - check out the amount of action taking place at the windows, in the gutters, in the doorways and almost everywhere else - and the animation of the puppet characters never ceases to be charmingly convincing. The production design is also remarkably good - there's an early example during the first song, when the appearance of Caine causes a sudden shift in the lighting and atmosphere from the warm glow of Gonzo's prologue to an almost eerie pale blue light. Although Rizzo actually remarks on this, the change is so subtle you probably won't notice it until your second or third viewing, but you certainly will appreciate it, subconsciously or not. Rather than getting bogged down in special effects and technical wizardry for its own sake, the scenes that utilize visual trickery are smoothly incorporated into the flow of the story rather than being imposed upon the film as self-conscious set pieces - take, for example, the Spirit of Christmas Past's flight over London (our attention is with Gonzo's death-defying method of hitching a ride), or the ever-changing size of the Spirit of Christmas Present (clue - look in the background during the brief glimpse of the party being held in the mousehole), or the location segues during the Spirit of Christmas Past's visitation. This approach benefits the film immensely, as it never distracts or misleads the viewer - a lesson the Disney company still refuses to take on board, as even their finest efforts are invariably laden with showstoppers that stick in the mind long after the rest of the film has faded into distant memory. But the most remarkable aspect of this beautifully subversive take on the beloved Dickens classic is that the core story, with all its attendant pathos, humour and timeless theme of welcome redemption, is neither diluted or stripped of its resonating power. Whilst the Disney animated version, in which Donald Duck played the unscrupulous miser, fell on its face with its ceaseless romanticism and stylization, this Muppetational version retains not just a Dickensian mood but, with the narration of Gonzo and much of the human players' dialogue, a truly Dickensian flavour as well.Besides, what's not to love about this film? It's virtually flawless. Kermit, as Bob Cratchit, remains one of the most loveable and endearing characters in the Muppet repetory company. Everything about this self-effacing little green frog is funny - the way he walks (slightly stooped), his half-dazed eyes, his voice, his ultra-expressive face...and if you don't double up laughing at his acapella sing-song with his nephew Robin (here cast, inevitably, as Tiny Tim) as they come skipping over the hill on Christmas day, then you should hire a stonemason to carve the word CYNIC onto your heart. And yes, Robin gets to sing again, Jerry Nelson making his voice sound uncannily like a child's with the charming Bless Us All, a logical companion piece to Halfway Down The Stairs. Waldorf and Statler, perhaps the show's ultimate cult figures, are finally rewarded with a scene-stealing turn as the ghostly Marley brothers, backed up by a chorus line of singing cash boxes (it's the Muppets, remember!); Fozzie bear is suitably overwhelmed as Fozziwig, the rubber chicken manufacturer (and his use of an ear trumpet in the closing scenes provide the hapless would-be comedian with his biggest laugh for decades); Bunsen and Beaker get some decent scenes as a pair of charity collectors (is it just me, or does Beaker flip the bird at Scrooge at the end of their first scene together?!); Miss Piggy makes a fine wife for Cratchit, and Animalgets a well-deserved close-up, although Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem are hardly suited to playing slow waltzes! Paul Williams's songs, on first hearing, are servicable rather than memorable, but after a couple of viewings they'll be as hard to get out of your head as Rainbow Connection, and ultimately emerge as one of the reasons this film stands up to repeated viewings so well.THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is a delightful family film, possibly too good for kids, but definitely worth dusting off at any time of the year, especially when you're feeling blue.

I never would have suspected it walking off with Best Picture at the Oscars that year, but I am SO GLAD that it did.  Come to think of it, that was the year that Saving Private Ryan was nominated for Best Picture as well and it was almost a certainty that it would end up receiving top accolades that year.  The only thing that I can remember being certain of on Oscar night 1999 was that Gywneth Paltrow would take home an award as Best Actress of the year...and of course, as we all know by now, I was right. Most people say that her performance was over the top in this film but I alas, must disagree.  Paltrow played the role of a woman of aristocratic means betrothed to another man to whom she can show no affection whatsoever just itching to experience the excitement and passion that is live theater as an actress in the day when all of the female roles that were out there were portrayed solely by men.  So, in essence she bucks tradition and goes against everything she's ever known to be right within the world to fulfill her dream and win the heart of the only man she's ever really truly loved William Shakespeare, played here exquisitely and sexily by Joseph Fiennes. It is a shame that Fiennes' portrayal of the Bard of Avon never garnered any nominations or any awards for that matter at either that years Golden Globes or Oscar Ceremonies.  He truly gave one of that years most riveting and explosive breakout performances.  Dame Judi Dench was amazing as she always is and it was a shame that she wasn't on for more than just eight minutes.

I just watched it on DVD last week and found it fun and a great romantic\/date film to watch with that special someone in your life but as a film that says something to the masses, this film gets a good push from the starting line but somehow falters in its overall viewpoint by dragging on for at least an excessive ten minutes in the midst of it all.

The cliche goes a picture is worth a thousand words, and if you sit down and watch 'The Wild Bunch' for yourself you will immediately see why it is so special. Sam Peckinpah was one of the most misunderstood and underrated directors of the modern era, and 'The Wild Bunch' is his single most accomplished and powerful movie. Peckinpah's critics focus on his use of violence, and there is no denying that the climax of this movie is still one of the bloodiest in movie history, but there is much more to his work than that. 'The Wild Bunch' is basically a story about ageing, about a changing world and how to cope with it, and about loyalty and comradeship. AND about violence. The late William Holden ('Network') gives one of the strongest performances of his career as Pike Bishop, and he is supported by a first rate cast of character actors, especially Ernest Borgnine ('Escape From New York'), Robert Ryan ('The Dirty Dozen'), Jaime Sanchez ('Carlito's Way'), and western legends Warren Oates ('Dillinger') and Ben Johnson ('One-Eyed Jacks') as the unforgettable Gorch brothers. Also keep an eye out for Bo Hopkins' debut as Crazy Lee, and the wonderful duo of Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones, all three being Peckinpah semi-regulars. Everything about this movie is brilliant, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music. If you haven't seen this movie you must do so. I believe your life will be richer for it. If you have already watch it I urge you to watch it again, as it is a deceptively complex film that is worth revisiting time and again. Every time I watch it I get something more out of it.

He is with the love of his life, Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk), and has his best friend, Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce), by his side.  But his world is turned upside down when he is betrayed by his friend and framed for treason.Kevin Reynolds has given us such a great action film for only $35 million - relatively low in Hollywood nowadays.  He uses his resources wisely, creating a film which does not follow the novel but is good in it's own right.  For a while, I thought they should have given it a different title because it strays so much from Alexandre Dumas' book, but then they could be in hot water for plagiarism.  Too bad they released this in January, when movies tend not to fare very well.Caviezel finally gets to show off his acting skill here, portraying a multi-layered character with an intensity I didn't expect him to be able to muster.  Guy Pearce is, as always, a great storyteller, creating a Mondego that is truly a hateable character.  I don't know why people call doing the role the best he can overacting; it was not a subdued character by any means.Richard Harris seems to move through this film effortlessly, giving a performance so good that when I went home the evening of seeing this film I popped Camelot into the VCR just to watch him again.  Luis Guzman is perfect in his supporting role; I don't think the character would have worked with someone else in the role.  Dominczyk was also impressive in her screen time, but she did not get a great too many lines.  What a shame.To warn you ahead of time, this film does not follow the book.  It is, however, great storytelling and definetly worth owning on DVD, no joke.

It is precisely the same issue that dogged Hogan's Heroes (which, along with Great Escape, this was loosely based) how can you make fun of war, especially the Nazis? Does making fun of them, or the situation, demonstrate total disregard for the nightmare they inflicted upon generations?First off, there are a number of well-respected people (philosopher & Holocaust survivor, Viktor Frankl and even Mel Brooks come to mind) who believe humor, by virtue of its freedom, is a powerful threat against the villainous fools of this world. Not to mention, humor has a therapeutic value that has been utilized through the most horrendous of circumstances (wartime being one of them - again I refer back to Frankl). Hogan's Heroes, it could be argued, was irresponsible because it doesn't really portray the true villainy of the Nazis, and the motivations of the POW escapes are extremely implausable (Hogan would casually leave - often through such ridiculous escape devices as a hollowed out tree stump - to attend a Nazi ball with a hot date & inexplicably, willingly return to the camp! What happened to duty?). Apart from showcasing what is perhaps Holden's finest performance, Stalag 17 IS responsible in its depiction of Nazi terror (at least relative to its own, contained story about a Nazi mole amongst American prisoners.). Watching this as a child, I never thought the POWs had it easy. Their living conditions are cramped, dirty, cold, uncomfortable & deprived (remember that this came out not too long after the war ended, and more than one veteran I've had the opportunity to meet was impressed by the accuracy of the conditions, uniforms, attitudes & lingo.

The cast, led by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, is in solid form, ten years in hiatus hadn't changed the crew's camaraderie.  Directed by Robert Wise, he aims for cerebral sci-fi, though given the rushed ending, it feels as if though the movie's primary goal was simply to re-inroduce Star Trek to the mainstream, and at that, it's a success.

Mystery thrillers NEED a good number of characters populating the story in order to work properly.

So that leaves...huh, you know who.Whoever wrote this script must have an I.Q. of 40. Every fundamental aspect about thrillers is missing. The fact that the film spends almost all of its entire very long two hours on two characters might have worked IF the script had been character driven.

Unfortunately, because WLB is a mystery thriller, the whole story about the dead woman and who killed her has to remain unknown for most of the film in order for it to be effective as a mystery. But the story is PATENTLY obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence because we're dealing with only two characters here.

He was probably the best M there was.What I didn't like about MR1. In this movie, as well as MWTGG, you will see the worst of Roger Moore's ridiculous gags and humor which does not belong in a bond film. Roger was a good bond at times, but when you watch this, you'll sometimes wonder how he replaced Connery.2. Way too Sci-fi. Yes Star Wars was out, and it could have meant big bucks for Cubby Broccoli (which it did, one of the highest grossing bonds of all time) but it just is not bond to be on spaceships shooting laser guns. If you watch the next bond FYEO it is interesting to see the difference.

After having screened a VHS copy acquired at Yard Sale Videos, I still feel that way a little but not because I didn't like it. Seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way I prefer to do.I had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film's setup. The self-filmed documentary approach can't quite carry the movie's weight through its entire length. Some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists, as was the implication, yet there they were. No one among the three `film makers' could have managed the presence of mind, in the midst deep panic, to have filmed Heather running screaming through the dark woods. It was all too far out of pre-established character, although the image is certainly indelible. But even a Dodge Dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations, I was forced to admit that The Blair Witch Project is.very effective.There are moments when Blair Witch has the dankness of Silence of The Lambs and the raw, twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of Night of the Living Dead, in my opinion one of the great horror sequences. I became a true believer at the point where Josh and Mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling Burkittsville woods, that they really had to get out, and were ramping up to full freak while Heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film. This sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless know-it-all, especially when said person is female and, thereby, largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males. Josh and Mike, aggravated and frightened as they were, still could not abandon Heather, who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset. Both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squat-less and being unable to admit it.The Blair Witch Project has an unassuming, almost sneaky way of getting to you. First off, the main characters are not at all likeable, which in itself is fatiguing. Josh and Mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any Saturday night, marooned in a mall or mini-mart parking lot. Heather is an almost-cute, soon-to-be-overweight, classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor, or of the ironic. A few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night, freed from the shackles of Daylight Savings Time, comes too soon and remains too long. When the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags, you're right with them. Then, you're suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons. The sound of fracturing wood, out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough, are not just twigs being snapped. They're branches, big ones. But this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio. One of the three refers to the sound as `footsteps' but only if the feet are size-72 American. It's left up to us to fully grasp the implications.The three principal actors are, essentially, playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous. But playing one's self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction, most notably the tough-minded, endlessly irritating Heather. Her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end, you know the doo-doo has gotten very deep. It's not mere post-adolescent, cheeseburger-craving discomfort any longer. That trifle has been left far behind; somewhere back under the decaying leaves. Heather's runny-nosed, video self-portrait, made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far, far over their heads, is truly poignant. We may enjoy seeing vain, clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the Blair Witch trio; three somewhat loosely-wrapped goofballs trying to pull off a film-making project, are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid. They've just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time.And finally the ending, which is really what this film is all about. Almost everything you ever feared in your youth, both in the light of day and dark of night, is compressed perfectly into the film's last few seconds. When the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam, the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced. All exploding skulls, bursting rib cages, and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple, implicit power. Only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement, in Psycho, even comes close. Keep the little ones away from this one, Mom and Dad. A child's mind will have no defense, nowhere to run, and most disturbing, nothing tangible to run from; only an invisible, meticulously goal-oriented malevolence that comes from nowhere, and everywhere, at once.
