He's is best known for his comedies with Marilyn Monroe (Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch), but his other films haven't remained in the shadows either. In 1944 he directed his film-noir masterpiece Double Indemnity, which became a big inspiration for many directors. In addition to these films Billy Wilder's trade mark is probably his own unique satire, best seen in One Two Three!, A Foreign Affair and of course in Sunset Blvd. In 1950 Billy Wilder was already at the top of his career, he produced his films himself and therefore had much more artistic freedom. This freedom allowed him to make a different kind of film with the screenwriter, Charles Brackett. Sunset Blvd. was no one night wonder, it took two years to finish it and the most time went to the writing. Brackett has told that someone suggested that they should make a film about a forgotten silent-era actress, who meets a desperate writer. They casted Gloria Swanson (who actually was one of the biggest silent-era starts) to play the role of Norma Desmond, a forgotten star.Sunset Boulevard is the second longest highway in Los Angeles, it reaches from the central station to the shore of the ocean. The boulevard entails more different modes of life than any other street in the world, the life around it is temporary; small stores, singles without families and motels. It's the street full of television and radio studios. The sunset is also the boulevard of cinema fame. This milieu of the film is very important to understand while watching Sunset Blvd.Sunset Boulevard, the film and the actual boulevard, mean traveling back in both time and place. It passes by the historical Hollywood, but the new modern Hollywood is also built around it. It's a historical journey to cinema. One could easily call Sunset Blvd. the best film ever made in Hollywood, it is a true Hollywood Story. It's a modern tragedy, that follows the genre film-noir. It is very interesting from many perspectives, it's a cruel film about a cruel industry. It's a satirical description of Hollywood.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a desperate writer trying to get a job, the films he has written the stories for have never been that successful. One day people from the debt collection agency come to take his car. While hiding away from them Joe randomly parks his car next to an old mansion, which seems deserted. It doesn't take long for him to realize that it's actually the home of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent film actress. Norma hasn't been acting in 20 years and thinks that it is the time for her big 'comeback', so with the help of Joe she decides to write a screenplay for herself. The more Joe gets to know Norma the more he becomes aware that she is still living in the past.This is a story about two desperate people; Joe is desperately trying to get work, he has one sad relationship with a girl, which of course leads nowhere. Norma still thinks she is the biggest star in Hollywood, she still gets hundreds of fan letter each day - actually sent by her butler. The mansion is full of memories, full of her photos and there's even a film theater for her, which only shows films she acted in. Once a week Norma goes to play bridge with her friends, who all are old silent-film actors - also played by themselves; Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. Joe operatively names this group, the wax museum. When Norma falls in love with Joe, troubles start to occur. Norma seems to be a very suicidal person, she is very depressed, yearning for attention and admiration. This she can get from Joe, buy giving him everything he wants.There's something mystical with Norman's butler too he's her ex-husband and her director, played by Erich von Stroheim. What makes this film so unique is that it is designed very carefully to the smallest detail. It's full of intelligence, observations, mastery, ruthlessness, it's an agonizing film about the flip side of Hollywood. The American critics, the media, the producers and the people working in the commercial film industry saw a reflection of themselves in Sunset Blvd. The people working with cinema far away praised it for its ruthless way of dealing with actual issues below the surface. No one had actually brought these things up, so it was a very intellect idea for Wilder to do it. In addition to its main theme, the flip side of Hollywood glamor, it criticizes the way media deals with people. The disregard of human life, so many people don't care about each other, they just want to sell their stories. Then they got a couple of pruning hooks from the garden and fished me out... ever so gently. Funny, how gentle people get with you once you're dead.I had seen Sunset Blvd. on television already, but now I got the chance to see it on the screen in its original format. It was a very interesting experience and I must say that this must be seen on screen, don't miss your chance if you come across with one. Sunset Boulevard is a gorgeous film about cinema and the media. It shows us the bad sides of this industry. It's also a beautiful tale of humanity and love, obsession and lust, oblivion and memory.

He first, though, has to have his own first kill to truly become one of them, and his younger son, played by Corey Haim, along with a goofy couple of brothers, try to stop this from happening. These brothers try to hunt down and kill the lead vampire, which is supposed to reverse the curse. The movie is filled with hilarious one-liners which shows me that it's not taking itself too seriously and makes the movie better.

The movie is 35 years old, but is so beautifully and creatively made, and mixes horrifying, ugly, funny and touching so perfectly that it has not become outdated and it won't be even after 100 or more years. Wertmüller made the film that both Tarantino with Inglorious Basterds and Roberto Benigni with Life is Beautiful could only dream about. I've seen thousands of movies but I can count on one hand these that made me cry, laugh, terrified and amused at the same time. Seven Beauties is one of them. In Seven Beauties, grim and shocking scenes of war and survival in a concentration camp are intermixed with memories of the protagonist, Pasqualino, nicknamed Seven Beauties of the pre-war Naples, about his life as a petty thief, pimp, and a wannabe Mafioso, and a guardian of his seven ugly as hell sisters' family honor. That's where the irony of the film's title comes from. I must say that for a film with such an abundance of beautiful women in the title, Lina Wertmüller surpassed Federico Fellini who was just as mesmerized with the ugliness as he was with beauty, and often inhabited his films with the grotesque figures. I guess Wertmuller learned a lot from Fellini whom she met through Marcello Mastroianni and worked as an assistant on the set of 8 1\/2 in 1962. I also think that only a woman can highlight inadequacies and unattractiveness of the other women so eloquently in Wertmüller's film. The film's protagonist, Pasqualino - weak, silly, but full of self-importance as the only male in the big family responsible for the sisters and their mother, and is ready to stand up for their dignity and honor (as he understood it) at any cost. That includes the killing rather by accident of a man who made a prostitute of Pasqualino's sister... and disposal of the corpse ( here the movie turns into a horror, mixed with the moments so funny that I could not look at the screen and turn off it at the same time. After the fast solving of messy crime and trial, Pasqualino was found mentally incompetent and sent to a psychiatric hospital for 12 years. But Italy needs soldiers, and Pasqualino escapes from a mental hospital, gets to the front, deserts, and ends up a prisoner of war in the concentration camp in Germany which is run by a formidable petrifying never parting with her whip larger than life woman-commandant. Pasqualino had two true talents - success with the ladies and an amazing ability to survive.

The movie is 35 years old, but is so beautifully and creatively made, and mixes horrifying, ugly, funny and touching so perfectly that it has not become outdated and it won't be even after 100 or more years. Wertmüller made the film that both Tarantino with Inglorious Basterds and Roberto Benigni with Life is Beautiful could only dream about. I've seen thousands of movies but I can count on one hand these that made me cry, laugh, terrified and amused at the same time. Seven Beauties is one of them. In Seven Beauties, grim and shocking scenes of war and survival in a concentration camp are intermixed with memories of the protagonist, Pasqualino, nicknamed Seven Beauties of the pre-war Naples, about his life as a petty thief, pimp, and a wannabe Mafioso, and a guardian of his seven ugly as hell sisters' family honor. That's where the irony of the film's title comes from. I must say that for a film with such an abundance of beautiful women in the title, Lina Wertmüller surpassed Federico Fellini who was just as mesmerized with the ugliness as he was with beauty, and often inhabited his films with the grotesque figures. I guess Wertmuller learned a lot from Fellini whom she met through Marcello Mastroianni and worked as an assistant on the set of 8 1\/2 in 1962. I also think that only a woman can highlight inadequacies and unattractiveness of the other women so eloquently in Wertmüller's film. The film's protagonist, Pasqualino - weak, silly, but full of self-importance as the only male in the big family responsible for the sisters and their mother, and is ready to stand up for their dignity and honor (as he understood it) at any cost. That includes the killing rather by accident of a man who made a prostitute of Pasqualino's sister... and disposal of the corpse ( here the movie turns into a horror, mixed with the moments so funny that I could not look at the screen and turn off it at the same time. After the fast solving of messy crime and trial, Pasqualino was found mentally incompetent and sent to a psychiatric hospital for 12 years. But Italy needs soldiers, and Pasqualino escapes from a mental hospital, gets to the front, deserts, and ends up a prisoner of war in the concentration camp in Germany which is run by a formidable petrifying never parting with her whip larger than life woman-commandant. Pasqualino had two true talents - success with the ladies and an amazing ability to survive.

Sometimes those films are unknown to most people. The Cranes Are Flying is one of those films. Made in Soviet Russia in 1957, the films starts with the romance of Veronika and Boris, a romance that is rudely interrupted when he volunteers to go to the front during WWII. After the lose of her own family, Boris' family invite her to live with them, only for his brother who found exemption from fighting 'forcing' her into marriage. The family are forced to move to Siberia to escape the onslaught of the Germans and it is here Veronika learns the fate of her real love.The film's main plot, the love story, is tragic, but the film as a whole is as tragic in it's depiction of war and the immense effect it has on people. Through fine performances the cast bring another episode of war to life, with drama, joy, despair and hope. Director Mikhail Kalatozov achieves something else, a masterpiece of film making. The film contains some of the most remarkable camera work you'll likely to see in a pre-CGI film world. One of the early scenes where Boris runs up flights of stairs as the camera pans and follows in one take is a hint of things to come. That scene is mirrored when Veronika returns to her family apartment to find it bombed and runs up the same stairwell, that hangs among the ruins and fire. There are fine tracking shots, such as where Veronica runs along the dispatch area or when she runs along the train track. Another stand out scene is where Veronica is 'trapped' by the brother during an air raid, the noise loud, the camera angles obscure, the lighting jarred and ominous, it's a powerful moment, among many throughout the film.The audience learns the fate of Boris way before Veronica, who tries to hang onto hope that he will return. Her love grows ever more when she discovers the note he left in the toy squirrel.

It was done in a realistic way in American Gangster where the police sold drugs to dealers. But Lethal Weapon 3 does take a more ridiculous route, with the main baddie just going into a police station to kill a guy and kidnapping a senior police officer. The film also falls into it's own clichés (which the Simpsons end up making fun), with Murtaugh taking more risks despite being on the edge of retirement, Murtaugh and Riggs being demoted, Riggs and Cole having a hostile relationship before having sex, more over the top action sequences and looking for the smallest excuse for an action sequence. The film's humour was weaker, with Gibson's Three Stooges stick getting old and Joe Pesci's performance as an obnoxious real estate agent was very obnoxious not funny (he is so much better playing sociopathic Mafia hit-man in Martin Scorsese films).

They helped set up the formula but by the third film ended up falling into it's own traps making it the weakest the series.After years working together Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is eight days from retirement. But after messing up a bomb disposal, Murtaugh Sgt. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) are demoted to patrolmen where they stop a robbery of an armoured car. This leads them getting involved with an investigate led by tough cookie Internal Affairs officer Sgt. Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), investigating ex-officer Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson), selling automatic gun and armour-piercing bullets.There is a decent idea for a plot, corrupt cops selling powerful weapons from the police evidence. It was done in a realistic way in American Gangster where the police sold drugs to dealers. But Lethal Weapon 3 does take a more ridiculous route, with the main baddie just going into a police station to kill a guy and kidnapping a senior police officer. The film also falls into it's own clichés (which the Simpsons end up making fun), with Murtaugh taking more risks despite being on the edge of retirement, Murtaugh and Riggs being demoted, Riggs and Cole having a hostile relationship before having sex, more over the top action sequences and looking for the smallest excuse for an action sequence. The film's humour was weaker, with Gibson's Three Stooges stick getting old and Joe Pesci's performance as an obnoxious real estate agent was very obnoxious not funny (he is so much better playing sociopathic Mafia hit-man in Martin Scorsese films). The film's attempt to be dramatic also felt forced and the main villain, Travis lacked menace to the villains of the other Lethal Weapon films.But whilst there are weaknesses in the film, there are some merits. Russo was very convincing as a tough, kick-ass woman, and well, I enjoy seeing women beating up men. There is still good chemistry between Glover and Riggs and Richard Donner does know how to direct an action sequence. As stated there is a good basis for a plot, with a real issue about cop killer bullets. It is still a well made movie.Overall Lethal Weapon 3 is the weakest series, but it is still an okay film when watching it with the other three films.

Although I haven't seen the TV show since then, it left a better impression on me than this rather drawn-out, poorly scripted and acted film.Perhaps the actors in the TV series had more time to get into their roles, but here Michael York's acting fails to greatly differentiate himself from one of the trees in the forest, while Jenny Agutter, fetching enough in a shorty-negligee, seems to be reading her lines from scene to scene and wouldn't you know, she gets another, albeit brief, nude scene (c.f. Walkabout, Equus).

You learn nothing more about the characters than you could have in about 10 minutes. Even after they return home it moves slowly. The Russian roulette sequences (which were VERY hotly debated) never happened in reality. There's no proof at all that it ever happened. Also one character makes a living out of playing Russian roulette???? Come on! The Vietnamese are portrayed as victims or monsters--very black and white. No shadings of character.

It takes place between 1969 to 1974 all around the United States.The film starts off in 1969 when William Miller (Fugit) discovers that he is only eleven instead of thirteen because his mother has been telling him he is older instead of telling him how she pushed him through certain grade levels. Then William's older sister, Anita (Deschanel), tells their mother, Elaine (McDormand), that she is leaving because her mother is such a control freak. Before Anita leaves she tells William how she left something that will change his life under her bed and when William goes to look he finds records of all the famous rock bands. The film cuts to a few years later when William is fifteen and wants to be a music critic. He goes to meet with a successful music critic, Lester Bangs (Hoffman), who gives him advice on how to become great and they talk about rock and roll. Then William goes to a concert that takes him on the journey of a life time...The screenplay for this film won an Oscar and I do not really understand why. Every single character is a stock character. William is a nerdy kid with big dreams, Elaine is an obsessive mother, all the rock stars are stereotypical rock stars, and band aids are stereotypical groupies besides maybe Penny Lane. Along with that there is really no plot which I understand works well in some movies because it is supposed to be a journey, but this one seemed very repetitive the whole way through. It was always William loves Penny Lane, Russell loves Penny Lane, no one really says much about it. And the whole time William is just trying to get an interview from Russell but there is always some little distraction I mean I'm pretty sure they could have made time for an interview even if it was on the long bus rides they had to take. Overall I thought the screenplay was weak and I know a lot of people are going to be against on this one because this is a beloved movie for a reason most likely due to the music and the time period.The direction of film by Crowe was fine. I understand this film is very important to Crowe because he traveled with a band when he was a young kid. Crowe is quite good at working with actors but in this film it was somewhat mixed performances that he got out of them. Some of the supporting roles were really strong while I felt every single other one was quite weak. There was nothing really special shot wise I mean there were some good ones in it but nothing that blew me away. Crowe is a fine director, but I think Jerry Maguire is what he will always be remembered for.The acting in this film was on both ends of the spectrum. If your names are Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, or Philip Seymour Hoffman you gave a solid performance that kept me interested in the film. If your name is Billy Crudup or Patrick Fugit you should probably never act again. If you are someone in the film that I didn't mention, then you're not worth mentioning. McDormand played a stock character but played it to the max the role could be possibly played and I don't necessarily think she deserved the Oscar nomination but she was definitely very good. Hudson played a groupie with mystery and depth and gave the best performance of her career. She was interesting and really made the film worth watching. Hoffman had a small role but he played it very well being very smart and creative. Fugit was William and all he did was basically read the lines looking concerned. It seemed like it was his first time acting. Crudup I feel like I was supposed to have an emotional connection to but I never did and he never really made me want him to get through all his problems. Like I said the acting is at both ends of the spectrum on this one.Overall I give this film a 5\/10, I would of gave lower if there was not the few memorable performances. I know this is a beloved film but I just did not enjoy it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock and roll, the sixties and early seventies, and Cameron Crowe.

Before Anita leaves she tells William how she left something that will change his life under her bed and when William goes to look he finds records of all the famous rock bands. The film cuts to a few years later when William is fifteen and wants to be a music critic. He goes to meet with a successful music critic, Lester Bangs (Hoffman), who gives him advice on how to become great and they talk about rock and roll. Then William goes to a concert that takes him on the journey of a life time...The screenplay for this film won an Oscar and I do not really understand why. Every single character is a stock character. William is a nerdy kid with big dreams, Elaine is an obsessive mother, all the rock stars are stereotypical rock stars, and band aids are stereotypical groupies besides maybe Penny Lane. Along with that there is really no plot which I understand works well in some movies because it is supposed to be a journey, but this one seemed very repetitive the whole way through. It was always William loves Penny Lane, Russell loves Penny Lane, no one really says much about it. And the whole time William is just trying to get an interview from Russell but there is always some little distraction I mean I'm pretty sure they could have made time for an interview even if it was on the long bus rides they had to take. Overall I thought the screenplay was weak and I know a lot of people are going to be against on this one because this is a beloved movie for a reason most likely due to the music and the time period.The direction of film by Crowe was fine. I understand this film is very important to Crowe because he traveled with a band when he was a young kid. Crowe is quite good at working with actors but in this film it was somewhat mixed performances that he got out of them. Some of the supporting roles were really strong while I felt every single other one was quite weak. There was nothing really special shot wise I mean there were some good ones in it but nothing that blew me away. Crowe is a fine director, but I think Jerry Maguire is what he will always be remembered for.The acting in this film was on both ends of the spectrum. If your names are Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, or Philip Seymour Hoffman you gave a solid performance that kept me interested in the film. If your name is Billy Crudup or Patrick Fugit you should probably never act again. If you are someone in the film that I didn't mention, then you're not worth mentioning. McDormand played a stock character but played it to the max the role could be possibly played and I don't necessarily think she deserved the Oscar nomination but she was definitely very good. Hudson played a groupie with mystery and depth and gave the best performance of her career. She was interesting and really made the film worth watching. Hoffman had a small role but he played it very well being very smart and creative. Fugit was William and all he did was basically read the lines looking concerned. It seemed like it was his first time acting. Crudup I feel like I was supposed to have an emotional connection to but I never did and he never really made me want him to get through all his problems. Like I said the acting is at both ends of the spectrum on this one.Overall I give this film a 5\/10, I would of gave lower if there was not the few memorable performances. I know this is a beloved film but I just did not enjoy it. I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock and roll, the sixties and early seventies, and Cameron Crowe.

The reason for this is simple Coppola is a master storyteller. Too often a sequel is ruined because it seems obsessed with the mantra bigger is better &#x96; more action, more explosions, and more special effects. Part II succeeds because it places its focus on its characters and lets the story unravel around them. In some respects however, Part II is a bloated film with many affecting and individual characters spanning two story lines, abundant with plot twists, drama and yes -- plenty of action, all packed into its eye-watering 200 minute runtime. It's a testament to Coppola's ability that he is able to balance all these individual elements and create what is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.Part II follows Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) efforts to strengthen the family business through expanding his gambling ventures into revolutionary Cuba. After an attempt on his life, he must plot and scheme to ensure that those responsible are punished without derailing his business endeavours. Interweaved with this story we see the life of Vito Corleone, (played by Robert DeNiro) from his tragic upbringing in Sicily at the turn of the 20th Century, to his rise to power in New York. Coppola's decision to include both stories is not just a means to test his audience's endurance abilities &#x96; it allows for his viewers to analyse the differences between Michael and Vito - between father and son. Those who have no interest in exercising their critical faculties can simply sit back and enjoy a smartly structured and expertly paced story of ambition and loss in capitalist America.For a movie that places such an emphasis on family; in particular upon the relationship between father and son, we see surprisingly little of Michael together with his children. Vito was an intelligent man who had genuine love for his children, and knew from his miserable upbringing the effect that the Mafioso lifestyle could have for his family. By placing these two stories together we can better understand decisions Don Vito made in Part I in attempting to avoid bloodshed and compare the frenzied decisions made by Michael in Part II. It's questionable what kind of a man Michael would have been if he had genuine loving relationship with his children, or indeed the rest of his family, who leave him, one by one, over the course of this film. Furthermore one might question whether Michael had genuine love for any of these people &#x96; throughout the film there is evidence that he finds value in people and things because they are his brother, his family, his property. Take the scene where Kay confronts Michael about a possible divorce his anger stems from the fact that she is trying to take away his children, who get most of their love and nourishment from their mother and who receive little interest from himself. There's further evidence in his treatment of family consigliere Tom Hagen (a wonderful, understated performance by Duvall) who, not being a blood brother, Michael always seems to give the short stick.Eventually Michael's choices and lifestyle leaves him safe, but alone, as he slowly alienates everybody who cared for him. This loss is reflected in Coppola's haunting final shot, where we see Michael alone, contemplating his actions. Pacino's performance works because he shows us two sides of Michael &#x96; quiet and pensive at one moment, then a raging, scheming monster the next. This is the kind of controlled intensity which a Pacino performance sometimes lacks. Yes, the times where Michael loses his cool are spectacular in their bombast &#x96; particularly when his wife Kay confronts him about his children; but these are not the only images I am confronted with when I think about what makes the performance great. For instance, Michael's simmering unrevealed rage at Senator Geary's attack on him, his family and his people. Michael's quiet disbelief and anger as his brother Fredo unwittingly reveals his treachery. Michael alone at the dinner table as his brothers rush away to greet their father in a flashback. These snapshots of an isolated man can serve to humanize a character, who gives us no real cause for sympathy.Then there's Nino Rota's masterful score, which is of such importance to the film that it is impossible to imagine the two apart.

Even in comparing character development to Alien, the sequel proves weaker. Alien was able to develop deeper and realistic characters in a much shorter timeframe, and didn't need more characters than the story required.Anything new to Cameron's picture is nothing more than convenient plot-devices, thus lacking any shred of cleverness. Aside from Weaver's presence, the film hardly reminds us of the original.

For a Few Dollars more has the advantage of costing a few dollars more than the previous movie, which suffered from a low budget. It's an overall superior movie, with a much more original story (A Fistful of Dollars took most of its story from the samurai flick Yojimbo), more expansive sets, grander music and a better cast. Although it's not as good as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, For a Few Dollars More still holds up as one of the definitive westerns of the 1960s.
