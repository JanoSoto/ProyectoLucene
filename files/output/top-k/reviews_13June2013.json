[{"date":"13 June 2013","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Fight club is made by one of my favorite film-maker David Fincher. It is based on the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. Edward Norton & Brad Pitt have acted in this film.I love this film because of its philosophy. Probably this is one film which is very close to my heart. I am addicted to this film, in a way it motivates me; therefore whenever I feel low I choose to watch this film.I also love this film for its motivational quotes, its unconventional characters, stylized treatment, and dripping background scores&#x85;However, I don't think that any conscious reason will justify my explanation behind taking this film as a topic for film analysis; hence I will only say that this is my kind of cinema. Story- Fight Club is a fascinating story of an Edward Norton and his world, his inner as well as outer world. This is a story of Tyler Durden. Edward Norton is a social animal who lives a monotonous life. He buys everything of which he sees an advertisement, however at the end of the day he also knows that nothing is worth buying. He is bored of his routine and flat life. He is bored of his falsehood, the artificiality in him have created all the complication in the story. On one not so fine day his fully furnished and occupied complex caught fire, he felt so lost and depressed. He just wanted to share his grief to anybody, hence he called Tyler Durden to whom he has recently met in an airplane and with whom he has also exchanged a number. This was his greatest mistake. Tyler was smart, dynamic and everything that Edward Norton has always aspires to be. Tyler was free from all kind of obligation and responsibilities. Edward Norton collaborated with Tyler and starts a club known as Fight Club. Fight Club is the way to break free. It is a club where two people will fight with each other. It is a club with the certain set of rules. Members of fight club are obliged to these rules. Tyler was the mentor, motivator and inspiration for the club member, they respect Tyler. This brought Tyler an opportunity to initiate project Mayhem (I am not going to disclose the details of Project Mayhem as it will be spoiler). However I will like to tell that Project Mayhem was all about destruction, it was all about economic equilibrium. Edward Norton didn't want this to happen as it will create havoc, and thus he fought against Project Mayhem, he fought against Tyler. But how can you defeat the animal within? Fight Club is a social film which deals with metaphysical plot.Tyler Durden is one of my favorite characters in the history of cinema, and Brad Pitt has excellently portrayed the character of Tyler Durden. I don't think that any other Actor other than Brad Pitt would have done justice to this character. Brad Pitt has given style to the character which was needed. I think Brad Pitt was most appropriate for the role of Tyler Durden however I will also say that the character of Tyler Durden was such a well written character half the job of the actor was done while writing it.Edward Norton is a fantastic actor, he have a capability to get into the skin of the character. In this film he has played a narrator and story was said from his point of view. I will say that Edward Norton have done a great job, as his character was recognized even after the presence of the strong character of Tyler Durden.David Fincher is a great storyteller he had courage to tell this complicated story with such a style and elegance. I have watched this film hundreds of time, and after watching and re-watching this film again and again I can say that this may be one of flawless film that I have watched. I respect the director for his detailing on the script, on his characters. I respect him for the style that he put in the film. I respect him for the subject of the film. Dialogues is also one of the most important part of this film, every time Tyler Durden speaks his words punches the viewer on their face. This film is full of quote and I will like to mention some of it over here.Things that you own ends up owning youYou are not the content of the wallet, You are not your job, You are not the car that you own, You are all the singing and dancing crab of this worldAnd many more&#x85;Hypnotic background score and cinematography have done its job. On a whole I love this film as it motivates me every time I watch this.Strongly Recommended...

I was never a Brad Pitt fan... Until I made a deal with a friend of mine. He hates Tom Hanks, but I said he had to see Saving Private Ryan. He said he would watch it if I watched Fight Club. I watched Fight Club and loved it, he still needs to watch SPR... he is putting it off well. Since then I have grown to like Brad. He has made some great films.Anyway... back to Snatch.I thought it was brilliant. A great comedy with plenty of action. I really liked Lock Stock so am not really surprised that I liked this.The film is about a diamond... a big diamond that it seems everyone wants. I would say the main character is a guy called Turkish. He is a boxing promoter, and a dodgy one at that. He makes a deal and fixes a match for a very dangerous man named Brick Top. Turkish gets a pikey named Mickey to fight for him as he knocked out his prized fighter, but Mickey does not like to play by the rules. Whilst all this is happening, there is still the small matter of the diamond that is being killed for by a few people and are chasing it around London.The story is kind of all over the place, but it is great... it is not hard to follow and it has some great comedy moments in there. I was laughing at the situation and the reactions of the characters.The cast list is also very impressive. It stars Jason Statham, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Brad Pitt, Alan Ford and Mike Reid. Yes, that's right... Frank from Eastenders. Everyone acts great in here. It is a proper cockney gangster story with a comedy twist. But this is definitely what you would expect from a Guy Ritchie film. It is as good as Lock Stock.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Very funny and with some great characters.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" SNATCHThis is one of those movies that I was never really interested in watching because I couldn't stand watching Brad Pitt.

What a technologically sound and crime free future! Everything in this film is so imaginative. The subject matter is fascinating, nifty, thoughtful and disturbing. Imagine a seemingly controllable but still humanly fallible future. Has anyone wondered 'what if' something bad befalls the precognitive trio that keeps the fabric of this new reality together? They have to die at some point, yes? Then what? Will there not be rioting in the street as people lament over a once secure country now forced to return to its unpredictable and dangerous past? Maybe the strange pool the trio perpetually floats in is the fountain of youth? The Precrime Division certainly doesn't allow them to go on a date. Maybe they can mate with each other and retain some cognitive power for their offspring? I don't know, and I don't think anyone in this film knows either. They are living peacefully on borrowed time at the expense of these all-knowing slaves.Oh, have you seen these neat tiny floppy discs? You can store home movies on them. These captured memories are fuzzy, despite the stellar technology everywhere else, further echoing human imperfection. The memory of loved ones is constantly fading. The sad people who watch these videos of the past are hurting. These trinkets of better times fail to purge agony, as do the countless breathtaking gizmos, neuroin drug business, and an imaginarium that can give you a tasty session of your deepest dreams, any of them... for a price, of course. By the way, there are also retinal scans everywhere, computer programs at the GAP that greet you at the door and remind you of your last purchase as if these computers know your fashion taste...because they do! There are eyes everywhere. There may be a small amount of privacy in futuristic apartments with lights and appliances that activate upon verbal command, until spider droids crawl into your bathroom while you're on the toilet or into your bed while you're making love to make sure you're not the future criminal that Precrime Division is looking for! Last, but not least-- JET PACKS! This film is geek heaven.The opening sequence is a thrilling spectacle with soldiers a second away from rappelling through your windows and arresting you for a crime you haven't committed yet! No trial, no jury, you get hauled off to a giant storage chamber where you watch cartoons in your head for the rest of your life! The action is awesome, but the intent is controversial, yet it works! Or...does it? Predetermination and choice are putting their boxing gloves on.As a fan of both, it was a pleasure to see Collin Farrell and Tom Cruise on screen together during a classic can't catch the wily protagonist fight scene. It winds up with Cruise escaping in one of those slick dreamy cars of the future. I'm not sure how he survived being inside during the car's assembly, though. Be careful of that car! It may override your control so it can start driving in reverse for you! Phooey on your intended destination! Naturally, perfection comes at a cost. I won't say what the cost is, but it's dirty, and the way it is executed avoids the cliché we've come to know so well.Minority Report is provocative, sly, dazzling and is served wonderfully by 2 hours and 26 minutes, allowed to breathe and let the viewer enjoy this spectacle. It's everything the Total Recall remake tried to be. The CGI work is impressive for 2002, and amidst all of this sheen, there is mostly a substantive story.I would give it a 9 out of 10. I wish one part could've gotten some closure. Then the ending wouldn't have felt so abrupt.
