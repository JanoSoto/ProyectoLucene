The most obvious problem with the film is the cast. Never have I seen so many miscastings in a single Hollywood production, and that is really saying a lot. For example, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves in any film set in Victorian England is a big, big mistake. The two look so out of place that it really destroys the whole illusion within one shot. Give their roles to people like Helena Bonham Carter and John Cusack, people who are actually capable of acting, and the results would have been quite a long way better. Then there's all the nonsense with Dracula's ability to appear as mist, a wolf, or a total of five different things during the film. This really made it difficult to understand what on Earth we are supposed to be afraid of. The use of religion in the film as a plot device was a minus, too. Just watch the behaviour of the good Christian boys throughout the film and see if you'll still wonder why a lot of audiences root for the vampires in these films.The new introduction describing Prince Vlad's life was a nice touch in spite of it not being at all part of the novel, however. For once, it is nice to be shown the sort of atrocity the bible inspires on the big screen, even if it is still very inaccurately described. The rest of the film is faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel in a way that no other film has accomplished. Rather than presenting some hokey vision of the original legend revolving around bad actors in cloaks and tepid women who are only interesting as props, they presented the vampire legend as Bram Stoker saw it. The women in the film are powerful, interesting characters, the big vampire lord himself has a reason for the things he does, and the fear or fanatacism in the so-called heroes is there to be seen in plain colour. Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant job of making his character seem like one of two evils, while Gary Oldman injects a depth into Prince Vlad that has never been achieved in cinema before. As he mopes about his castle, searching for the lost love of his life that was so cruelly taken from him (and let's not forget how cruelly the salt was rubbed into the wounds by those so-called good church boys), one begins to understand his pain and anger. Which is why the ending works so much better here than it does in the novel. Bram Stoker's novel simply has the men staking Dracula and cutting his head off... no cop outs like that in Francis' film. He uses this as an opportunity to fully resolve the painful conflicts that made Dracula what he is.Were I making this film again, I'd do everything Francis Ford Coppola had done, with some small adjustments. First of all, I would get better actors to play Jonathan and Mina, because actors like Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder seriously lack the depth to play anything other than stock American youth stereotypes. Even though Natalie Portman clearly doesn't look old enough to play Mina Harker, she'd wipe the floor with Winona Ryder simply because she is capable of getting into character. I am not sure if I would have cast Anthony Hopkins... if I did, I would give him strict instructions to cut out the overacting. And I would have changed the script a lot to deemphasise the religious overtone. It wasn't that strong in Bram Stoker's novel, and raising it this far in the film was disrespectful. People have already learned (often with the help of such cults) that real-life, everyday evil blows away what can be portrayed on the screen. Removing it altogether would have eliminated the lack of sympathy one feels for the characters. Other than that, I would have done everything pretty much the same. Maybe they should have let Kenneth Branagh direct this one too?In all, I'm giving Dracula six out of ten. While it is mostly faithful to the novel in a good way, the additional religious mumbo-jumbo that was inserted in the screenplay just bogs it down, and the casting agents should have known better. The overuse of special effects in portraying five different Draculas was also a bad idea. Still, I think people should focus more on what they did get right, and this is without a doubt the closest we've ever gotten to seeing the real Dracula on-screen.

Oh, sure, there was the competent Baby Boy, and A.I. was interesting but a bit short of brilliant. But I hadn't left a movie with a smile on my face, thinking I'd really seen something worth watching, since the extraordinary Memento back in May. That is, until Hearts in Atlantis. The movie could be seen as three intersecting stories, detailing 11-year-old Bobby Garfield's relationships with three people in his life. The first one is Bobby (Anton Yelchin) and his mother, Elizabeth Garfield, played flawlessly by Hope Davis. Bobby's father died when he was only 5, and his mother never wastes an opportunity to remind her son that she can't give him money because his father didn't exactly leave us well off, you know. Bobby is constantly frustrated by this oft-repeated chorus, but continues to defend his mother even when she buys expensive dresses right after telling him how poor they are. His mother may be selfish, but it seems clear they love each other. Next is Bobby's relationship with their new upstairs neighbor Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins). Hopkins is, as usual, right on top of his game as a kind old man who has some sort of special mental power. He can see what people are thinking, and might be able to see the future and heal people's sickness. This is a little vague, mostly because the movie downplayed the supernatural aspects of the plot. Also, Ted can pass along some of his mental power to anyone who touches him, which results in a few semi-dangerous moments for Bobby. This was more troublesome in the book, however. Ted is trying to avoid the low men, who are said to be after something he has, presumably his mental prowess. Finally, the most poignant part of the story may be Bobby's close friendship with Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem). One of King's strengths, shown best in Stand By Me, is his ability to tell stories very well through the eyes of a child. The growing love between Carol and Bobby is told beautifully and more than a few people will relate to the idea of a first love and a first kiss and how you will never forget either.

This one felt rushed and I actually thought that Jane was going to have to win back Eddie's affections after what she'd done, when suddenly the movie was over. I felt cheated. Apart from that, I thought they spent too much time on the relationship with Greg Kinnear's character. A whole half an hour?

The Godfather I, led by Vito and Sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily).  Michael pales as an imposing figure next to Vito, and altho Al Pacino is a good actor, I just get tired of watching Michael too much--I was even getting a little tired of him at the end of Godfather I.  In other words, I think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here.  The end of Godfather II, with Michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially Michael himself.  I think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure.   And what is the point of Kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him?   And wasn't that abortion blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving?  Not to me.The main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse.  We have sordid characters (Hyman Roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of Fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and Connie.  This is a precursor to a lot of post mid-70s movies in which the plot is overcomplicated and not crisp and the characters sleazy and unappealing--in movies like this, I would like the characters to be less dwelled on and the action to rule.On the other hand, there is reason to be somewhat interested in the development of Vito and the flashbacks of the family.

Yes, it is true, modern movies are less uplifting than ones preceding the mid-60s, but in spite of the many elements that some people complain about--violence, corruption, sex, pomposity, ridiculously overdone and confusing special effects--there are often some redeeming or uplifting features.  Certainly none here, and this film is depressing and sometimes boring, in spite of some good individual scenes and substance here and there to the story and characters.

After the Godfather I, and Michael's evolution is complete, who needs a sequel about unsavory characters so much?  The Godfather I, led by Vito and Sonny, had elements that provided for great entertainment and made you less bothered by the evil and sleaze (temporarily).  Michael pales as an imposing figure next to Vito, and altho Al Pacino is a good actor, I just get tired of watching Michael too much--I was even getting a little tired of him at the end of Godfather I.  In other words, I think the disadvantage sequels have of becoming-tiresome subject matter are more present, not less, here.  The end of Godfather II, with Michael staring out morosely into the water from a chair, symbolizes the decadence of the story and the corrupt characters, especially Michael himself.  I think more toward a pathetic character than a tragic one, despite some of the events he had to endure.   And what is the point of Kay's back and forth moral concerns if she is staying with him?   And wasn't that abortion blowup scene (natch, male child) so moving?  Not to me.The main story here is somewhat convoluted and disorganized, so when the flashbacks are inserted the confusion gets worse.  We have sordid characters (Hyman Roth etc.) who do not particularly entertain me on a movie screen, and the depressing figures of Fredo (geez, isn't he such a compelling character) and Connie.

However, the last laugh was shared by the Italian directors, whose new style of portraying Colonial America in a realistic style rather than the romanticised way that was characteristic of John Wayne and his contemporaries will be remembered long after the films of the romanticised style are no more.The plot is indescribably simple, as Clint Eastwood simply wanders into a town where gang warfare has stripped the economy to the point where only the local undertaker makes a profit and turns the two warring families against one another. Sergio Leone's best-known trademark, his dynamic use of widescreen ratios, comes to the fore here as Clint shares a film frame with no less than four of his enemies, all of whom have plenty to say to him and vice versa. This is one film where a pan and scan transfer is purely and simply vandalism. Some of the dialogue that is included here absolutely takes the cake for cleverness and wit, too. Asking four gunslingers to apologise to a horse, well, if it wasn't a man as famous for playing a gunslinger as Clint Eastwood, it'd be ridiculous.Transplanting old Samurai legends into the Wild West works well, as you can see here. Simply having an old mercenary who travels the land in search of wrongs to right and battles to be fought makes the story a lot more compelling than the Westerns where we are told every iota of the characters' motivations in the hope that it will give them some depth. The element of the main hero not getting involved in every scuffle that the bad guys cause, our semi-nameless hero's ignoring a drunken thug shooting at a little boy being the most obvious example, was another master stroke, one that got Eastwood involved in doing the film to begin with.

As I hunkered down to watch the DVD version of `Remember the Titans' - a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a diet soda in the other - what did I discover, to my amazement and horror, but that there was NO widescreen edition of the film anywhere to be found on the disc!  As a lover of movers, I long ago made a pact with myself that I would try to watch every movie in its purest possible form and that includes seeing it with its original theatrical ratio in tact.  What good is watching a movie when up to half its original picture is missing?  That is why I love DVD so much.  It almost always provides us with that option.  Watching a film that has been panned-and-scanned to fit the requirements of a square TV screen is as anathema to me as watching a film spliced-and-diced to meet `broadcast standards' or to make room for oodles of mind-numbing commercials selling products you wouldn't want even if they were given to you free of charge.   All this is prelude to saying that the review you will be reading from here on out is based on at best 90% of the movie that was shown in theatres around the country (and that's a conservative estimate).  Yes, I know there is a widescreen DVD version of the film on the market.  My point is trying to fathom why Disney feels the need to separate its full and wide screen editions when many of us may not have access to both, since we often find ourselves at the mercy of numbskull video storeowners who wouldn't know a jump cut from a freeze frame if their lives depended on it.  Furthermore, once a person gets home with a video, how many of us are going to want to go through the hassle of returning to the store to pick up the widescreen version?  Get a clue, Disney! `Remember the Titans' is a near-perfect film for young people to see.  Not only does it open their eyes to just how recently - a mere 30 years ago - blatant institutionalized racism was woven into the fabric of many segments of American society, but the film shows them just how far we've come in rectifying that situation in a very short while.  Stylistically, `Remember the Titans' emerges as an effective distillation of two sure-fire popular genres  the inspirational true-life sports story and the inspirational consciousness-raising racial drama.  Although the more cynical among us may feel a bit `inspirationed' out by the time the film's closing credits go rolling by, the rest of us will probably find ourselves dewy-eyed and emotionally uplifted by the experience. Based on a true story, `Remember the Titans' takes us back to the year 1971 when a high school in Alexandria, Virginia - like schools all over the South - was just beginning to cope with the hot button, highly emotional issue of court ordered desegregation.  Into this hornet's nest of bigotry and rancor steps Herman Boone, a black football coach, hired to replace Bill Yoast, a top-notch coach who has led his team to no fewer than 15 championship seasons.  Credit `Remember the Titans' for tackling this issue in a unique way.  By acknowledging the unfairness done to Yoast (ironically, in the name of `fairness'), the film makes the reaction of some of the whites at least  comprehensible.  Few films of this type seem willing to delve into the moral complexity surrounding the sensitive issue of racism and choose instead to paint their characters literally as well as figuratively in black-and-white terms.  `Remember the Titans' doesn't do that.  We are allowed to see the issue from the white people's view as well - and to understand a bit where  they too are coming from.  Indeed, the basic theme of `Remember the Titans' is that anyone can change, given the proper chance and the set of circumstances necessary to bring it about. It is with this set of circumstances that `Remember the Titans' most concerns itself, as it chronicles the gradual but inexorable change that takes place not only in the individuals involved but in the community as a whole.  The amazing thing, too, is that `Remember the Titans' manages to do all this without resorting to the use of a single four-letter expletive - an accomplishment that is not only rare in this day and age  it is positively unique!  This, along with the salutary theme, makes `Remember the Titans' ideal viewing for schools and youth groups as well.  Director Boaz Yakin and writer Gregory Allen Howard are to be commended for crafting a film that is believable, fast moving and emotionally powerful all at the same time.  The actors are all superb in their various roles, with Denzel Washington, as always, serving as the solid center holding the whole project in place. `Remember the Titans' could be dismissed as just another cliché-ridden, feel-good film designed to appease a smug, self-congratulatory liberal audience, making them feel superior by confirming their own goodness.  If it is such a film, so be it.  When a reminder of our common humanity comes along that is as good as `Remember the Titans,' the cynics will just have to be content to sit this one out and bitch from the sidelines.

As I hunkered down to watch the DVD version of `Remember the Titans' - a bowl of popcorn in one hand and a diet soda in the other - what did I discover, to my amazement and horror, but that there was NO widescreen edition of the film anywhere to be found on the disc!  As a lover of movers, I long ago made a pact with myself that I would try to watch every movie in its purest possible form and that includes seeing it with its original theatrical ratio in tact.  What good is watching a movie when up to half its original picture is missing?  That is why I love DVD so much.  It almost always provides us with that option.  Watching a film that has been panned-and-scanned to fit the requirements of a square TV screen is as anathema to me as watching a film spliced-and-diced to meet `broadcast standards' or to make room for oodles of mind-numbing commercials selling products you wouldn't want even if they were given to you free of charge.   All this is prelude to saying that the review you will be reading from here on out is based on at best 90% of the movie that was shown in theatres around the country (and that's a conservative estimate).  Yes, I know there is a widescreen DVD version of the film on the market.  My point is trying to fathom why Disney feels the need to separate its full and wide screen editions when many of us may not have access to both, since we often find ourselves at the mercy of numbskull video storeowners who wouldn't know a jump cut from a freeze frame if their lives depended on it.  Furthermore, once a person gets home with a video, how many of us are going to want to go through the hassle of returning to the store to pick up the widescreen version?  Get a clue, Disney! `Remember the Titans' is a near-perfect film for young people to see.  Not only does it open their eyes to just how recently - a mere 30 years ago - blatant institutionalized racism was woven into the fabric of many segments of American society, but the film shows them just how far we've come in rectifying that situation in a very short while.  Stylistically, `Remember the Titans' emerges as an effective distillation of two sure-fire popular genres  the inspirational true-life sports story and the inspirational consciousness-raising racial drama.  Although the more cynical among us may feel a bit `inspirationed' out by the time the film's closing credits go rolling by, the rest of us will probably find ourselves dewy-eyed and emotionally uplifted by the experience. Based on a true story, `Remember the Titans' takes us back to the year 1971 when a high school in Alexandria, Virginia - like schools all over the South - was just beginning to cope with the hot button, highly emotional issue of court ordered desegregation.  Into this hornet's nest of bigotry and rancor steps Herman Boone, a black football coach, hired to replace Bill Yoast, a top-notch coach who has led his team to no fewer than 15 championship seasons.  Credit `Remember the Titans' for tackling this issue in a unique way.  By acknowledging the unfairness done to Yoast (ironically, in the name of `fairness'), the film makes the reaction of some of the whites at least  comprehensible.  Few films of this type seem willing to delve into the moral complexity surrounding the sensitive issue of racism and choose instead to paint their characters literally as well as figuratively in black-and-white terms.  `Remember the Titans' doesn't do that.  We are allowed to see the issue from the white people's view as well - and to understand a bit where  they too are coming from.  Indeed, the basic theme of `Remember the Titans' is that anyone can change, given the proper chance and the set of circumstances necessary to bring it about.

Until, of course, down and out Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is cornered into coaching the team in return for a loan from a friend to pay off his gambling debts. Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane), the boys' teacher, is also along for part of the ride.I apologize up front for the lazy synopsis I just gave but for a movie as generic and average as this I just couldn't spend the brain energy on making it anymore exciting than that.  Now don't get me wrong this wasn't really a bad movie, it just wasn't a really good movie either.  This movie seems to have a hard time figuring out what it is about.  Is it about Conor's gambling problem and his attempts to not get killed for his bad debts?  Or is it about a Little League team and a coach who learn to care for each other and rely on each other?  Or is it about Conor and Elizabeth and their relationship?  If you picked any of these answers you are wrong. It's about none of them.  Oh it dabbles in all of them but doesn't really take any of them far enough to say it is actually about them.  The movie seems to dip in and out of the different story lines without really advancing them or resolving anything.  Take the boys and the little league team for example.  They start of as the worst team on the league.  By game two they are kicking butts and taking numbers.  When did they learn all these skills.  Were they just pretending to be so bad to lure the other teams into a false sense of security?  We don't get to see Conor (Keanu) really doing any coaching or forming any bonds with the boys on the team, yet we are supposed to believe that these things happened.  One boy finds out he can't play for the team because of his age and runs off to join a gang.  What happens to him, not important apparently and Conor seems like he doesn't care either.  And the gambling thing?  Resolved halfway through and it just goes away.  We don't see him making any of these amends, we are supposed to accept that it has happened.  Plot holes galore, things not resolved, blech!  Lazy writing I say.  Now the story wasn't all bad, it was redeemed a little by the last 10 minutes, but it wasn't enough to pull this out of the average category.Now lets talk a little about the actors.  I like Keanu Reeves, really I do.  It's just that he needs very specific roles.  If you need someone to look lost and confused and not much else, Keanu is your man.  I though he was perfect for The Matrix.  Really though people, as much as some of you Keanu fans want to believe it, the man can't act.  That's all there is to it.  It's not like he's reading his lines off a queue card or anything like some 'actors' (i.e. pretty boy Justin Chambers of The Musketeer) he's just a little robotic.  It's not a good show of your acting chops when you are outdone by a group of 10 year olds.  I thought all the kids in this movie were pretty good, they were likable and they had me laughing (in the good way) a few times.Overall this movie was not horrible and if you are deciding between this and The Musketeer (now there was a real crapper but you can go read my review for that and find out what I really thought), Hardball should win hands down.

There is only one problem with Leonard's search, he has been unable to form new memories since the night of his wife's murder.  The entire film plays backwards so that, like Leonard, you have no recollection of what happened previously.  The films plot points come together slowly as each new scene sheds more light on the one you viewed previously.  It's a bit confusing, but an interesting way to keep the viewer's attention.Leonard keeps his memories intact through a bizarre method of tatooing the facts about the murder all over his body.  He also takes pictures of everyone and writes little notes on them to remember who they are and how they are related to his investigation.  Whenever someone approaches him, he refers to his pictures to remind himself who they are, how they're involved in the investigation and whether or not he suspects them of being the killer.  As the film continues to play back, it is revealed that Leonard's search is infinitely more complicated than we thought it was.  The film's ending (by that I mean beginning) is a shocking revelation about Leonard's psychological condition that will leave you with your jaw on the floor.In short, MEMENTO is the best thriller to come out in quite some time.

Night Shyamalan is attempting to bring a whole new sensibility to American moviemaking.  Unlike most filmmakers who dabble in the `horror film' genre, Shyamalan eschews sensationalism and gore in favor of understatement, subtlety and indirection, preferring that we, in the audience, be given room to conjure up our own demons rather than having the filmmaker do it for us. The characters in his films drift like somnambulists through worlds drained of sound, color and emotion - and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.Shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with `The Sixth Sense,' a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings &#150; the first time to be amazed and dazzled by the sheer ingeniousness of the multileveled plotting, the second to study retroactively just how intricately each plot element fell into place, catching us unawares the first time around.  It is natural that Shyamalan should have tried to duplicate that success in his next film, using virtually the same stylistic elements and the same leading man, Bruce Willis, as he did in `The Sixth Sense.'   Unfortunately, `Unbreakable' fails to live up to the quality of the earlier film. For one thing, `The Sixth Sense' really WENT someplace &#150; it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.  `Unbreakable,' for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end &#150; nay, worse, a conclusion that is absurd, undeveloped and thoroughly unsatisfying. Shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.  Here, however, he never finds it.  Willis plays a character almost too similar to the one he portrayed in `The Sixth Sense' &#150; a brooding, taciturn man who seems to wander through life in a perpetual emotionless fog of detachment and depression.  David Dunn, a man caught in what appears to be a loveless, deteriorating marriage, is the sole survivor of a Philadelphia train wreck.  Already we are alerted to `Sixth Sense' parallels, so much so that we begin to subconsciously suspect that this might indeed be a sequel of sorts to the previous film.  Actually, it isn't, but rest assured there is something `not quite right' about this man, although the revelation of what it is has no where near the kick provided by the earlier work.  After his miraculous escape, David is contacted by Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, a man suffering from a strange genetic illness that causes his bones to shatter like glass and who becomes convinced that David may be his alter ego, i.e. a man immune from injury and disease.  This premise, based on a built&#150;in dichotomy (just as `The Sixth Sense' was built on the dichotomy of life and death), also tries to explore the twin dichotomies of good vs. evil and hero vs. villain, but the context in which the filmmakers launch their exploration &#150; the world of comic books of all things &#150; robs the film of much of its potential profundity.  We just can't take Willis very seriously when he is wandering stoically around the city, clad in a hooded sweatshirt, like some sort of `super hero' on Prozac, saving innocent victims from the clutches of evildoers whose purposes he senses when he brushes up against them in crowds (the tag line for this film could well be `I see criminals').  Thus, without a decent story to tell, the film turns out to be all style and no substance.  What was artistry in `The Sixth Sense' becomes artiness here.  Even clever visual motifs - like showing us many images upside down first, then right side up or having only the bad guys dressed in bright colors so that they stand out against the muted grays of everyone else - become sheer artifice with no thematic purpose behind them.  `Unbreakable,' for all its beauty of atmosphere and tone, leaves us bewildered, frustrated and unsatisfied.  Shyamalan is definitely a talent worth nurturing.  Let's hope next time he can once again find that perfect marriage between form and content that he hit upon so brilliantly in `The Sixth Sense.'

The characters in his films drift like somnambulists through worlds drained of sound, color and emotion - and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.Shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with `The Sixth Sense,' a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings &#150; the first time to be amazed and dazzled by the sheer ingeniousness of the multileveled plotting, the second to study retroactively just how intricately each plot element fell into place, catching us unawares the first time around.  It is natural that Shyamalan should have tried to duplicate that success in his next film, using virtually the same stylistic elements and the same leading man, Bruce Willis, as he did in `The Sixth Sense.'   Unfortunately, `Unbreakable' fails to live up to the quality of the earlier film. For one thing, `The Sixth Sense' really WENT someplace &#150; it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.  `Unbreakable,' for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end &#150; nay, worse, a conclusion that is absurd, undeveloped and thoroughly unsatisfying. Shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.  Here, however, he never finds it.  Willis plays a character almost too similar to the one he portrayed in `The Sixth Sense' &#150; a brooding, taciturn man who seems to wander through life in a perpetual emotionless fog of detachment and depression.  David Dunn, a man caught in what appears to be a loveless, deteriorating marriage, is the sole survivor of a Philadelphia train wreck.  Already we are alerted to `Sixth Sense' parallels, so much so that we begin to subconsciously suspect that this might indeed be a sequel of sorts to the previous film.  Actually, it isn't, but rest assured there is something `not quite right' about this man, although the revelation of what it is has no where near the kick provided by the earlier work.  After his miraculous escape, David is contacted by Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, a man suffering from a strange genetic illness that causes his bones to shatter like glass and who becomes convinced that David may be his alter ego, i.e. a man immune from injury and disease.  This premise, based on a built&#150;in dichotomy (just as `The Sixth Sense' was built on the dichotomy of life and death), also tries to explore the twin dichotomies of good vs. evil and hero vs. villain, but the context in which the filmmakers launch their exploration &#150; the world of comic books of all things &#150; robs the film of much of its potential profundity.  We just can't take Willis very seriously when he is wandering stoically around the city, clad in a hooded sweatshirt, like some sort of `super hero' on Prozac, saving innocent victims from the clutches of evildoers whose purposes he senses when he brushes up against them in crowds (the tag line for this film could well be `I see criminals').  Thus, without a decent story to tell, the film turns out to be all style and no substance.  What was artistry in `The Sixth Sense' becomes artiness here.  Even clever visual motifs - like showing us many images upside down first, then right side up or having only the bad guys dressed in bright colors so that they stand out against the muted grays of everyone else - become sheer artifice with no thematic purpose behind them.  `Unbreakable,' for all its beauty of atmosphere and tone, leaves us bewildered, frustrated and unsatisfied.  Shyamalan is definitely a talent worth nurturing.  Let's hope next time he can once again find that perfect marriage between form and content that he hit upon so brilliantly in `The Sixth Sense.'  We need adventurous filmmakers like him around.

It's difficult disguising this fact in a cinema and, to a Brit, somewhat threatening, if in a nice way.I don't think this film is 'uneven', I think it has an uncompromising vision, like it or hate it, and pertains to the inner landscapes of memory, very much in the tradition of magic realism. It is not for children, although it magically travels through familiar terrain like 'Logan's Run', Grimm's fairy tales, 'Wizard Of Oz', Shockheaded Peter, Li'l Nemo and even 'Babe Pig In The City'. The results are over busy, a tad indigestible but always enchanting. It is not for the young, but is very much an older person's film, looking back at life even as the film propels forward in time. David is the guide by which we journey through and puzzle out man's spirituality (if any) and it appeals directly to emotions as markers to take us forward rather than through the empiricism of entirely 'credible events'. Some are distrustful of 'emotional' truths, seeing them as vague and ephemeral or even open to manipulation but this film spoke to me. It is sincere to the point of embarrassement. Does it work? Not entirely, it is something of a curate's egg but even when fatuousness threatens to strike with homely voice overs (very much part of bedtime story reading, therefore valid as collective memory), subtitles for Aliens and funfairs, you never quite laugh, and you could hear a pin drop in the cinema. Some cliches appear such as the old Star Trek you are an interesting species line that always puts us at the centre of the universe as some sort of special divinity. I demur.The film has been criticised for not ending at a logical point on the seabed but the film is not just the boy's story or the well worn supposition that that which makes us human is our capacity for making meaning through memory and through that defining the concept of love. As the film draws to a close, the exigences of science are cast aside  for the sake of fable (not all will go along with this) in the service of a requiem for the human race as at some point the lights must dim for us for all time. What then will be seen as most important, that which defines us and gives sense to the murky mystery of life and time itself? Well, Steven, a good Jewish boy, let's us know in no uncertain terms that it's that special secretive knowingness between a child and it's mother. As such, I think it's obviously a deeply personal film and also, despite it's faults, it's valediction. You can almost imagine Steven with his mum in a bubble on a seabed in some future, imaginary landscape. Very good, Steven, but when are you going to put down the cameras and get a proper job like a nice doctor, already? Perhaps he falters with a final line that is more fortune cookie than ultimate wisdom but a story book usually does leave the child feeling re-assured (and the parent too?) It's very poignant and I agree whole heartedly with it's quiet, stillborn blessing. Mum is NUMBER ONE! (And her apple pie, too!) And a desperate need to tell her just that as soon as possible.

After years of legal wrangling over who had the rights to the character the filmmakers decided to show that they didn't need him anyway and unceremoniously dumped him once and for all.

Here we are reminded that Moore wasn't playing Bond at the time of his marriage. That serious tone pervades throughout the movie, with less wisecracking than usual, and a subdued villain, at odds with the expected megalomaniac we are used to.

There are some fantastic action set-pieces including a chase in a Citroen 2CV, and a ski chase that tops even that of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', along with a tense finale that is literally a cliffhanger.
