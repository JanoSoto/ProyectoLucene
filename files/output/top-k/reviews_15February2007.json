Heck, even Rue Morgue magazine (the Canadian equivalent of Fangoria) bluntly says this is the superior choice. And you know, they are probably right this film is more fun. And sometimes fun is the key to success.Tobe Hooper was originally just the producer, and only stepped up to be director after several career conscious young directors passed up on it. He worked on the script, though he says the script's humor comes from co-writer Kit Carson, who also incorporated some of the phrases like dog will hunt and music is my life. Hooper saw his input as making the film true to the Yuppie-ism of the 1980s and notes it is satirical even in its poster, which mimicked The Breakfast Club.Dennis Hopper in any movie is a good idea, but Hopper with chainsaws is really about as good as it gets. I will not lie to you the chainsaw fight in Motel Hell is better than the chainsaw fight in this movie, but either way you have dueling chainsaws and Dennis Hopper. I cannot stress enough how cool that is (and if you do not understand, you are watching the wrong genre, my friend).Leatherface was sort of goony in this movie, looking very non-frightening, and shaking his head and shoulders every time he lifted his chainsaw (for reasons I cannot even attempt to explain). But he was made up for by Bill Moseley (Chop Top) with his very odd character and immortalized line, Dog will hunt. Immortalized if you listen to the Primus song, Jerry Was a Racecar Driver, that is. Moseley is now a horror movie standard, but this is arguably his most notable appearance and what brought his specialty to the attention of horror fans.Bill Moseley got hired after sending Hooper a Betamax tape called Texas Chainsaw Manicure. Although already in his 30s, this was only his second film, previously appearing in the little-seen Endangered Species (1982). That film, incidentally, had JoBeth Williams just after she wrapped Poltergeist, which may have been what inspired Moseley to audition.The gore is surprisingly minimal. Few people die, and even though corpses get chopped up and faces removed, it is really not very creepy. Hooper says that special effects maestro Tom Savini was more than inventive in coming up with some bizarre and gory detail.While the film is more silly than scary in many ways and has a weak ending, it still has some sort of charm about it. Watch until the first death. If you like it, keep watching. If not, this film is not for you. Most likely, you will find this worth your time.The Fox-MGM Blu-ray has a handful of special features, including two commentaries. One with Tobe Hooper and another with the actors.

You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2007","score":"21 out of 43 people found the following review useful","review":" From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it.

He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 February 2007","score":"21 out of 43 people found the following review useful","review":" From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem.

This turned out, however, as a huge anticlimax.As a book, the story worked; but as seen in 'Manhunter', the evidence suggests that it wasn't material that was good enough to transfer to the silver screen although Brett Ratner did do a fine job in his version so that proves that it is possible. Here, in the 1986 version, the adaptation is just an absolute mess.First of all, the film has aged terribly. I would go as far to say it has aged in the same vein as 'Top Gun' as it's clearly the 1980's with music, costume and hair playing a big part in convincing us this film is very questionable as to take seriously or not. These things that have not aged not only make Manhunter more of a comic viewing but also take away any psychological feeling of uneasiness that might have been there (and was in Ratner's version) if the film had been done properly. The music is very inappropriate given the film's theme and content. A serial killer in a psychological\/detective thriller is killing these families and generally causing havoc so what kind music do we hear? Cheesy 80's pop music; that's what and it's not even done intentionally as it was with 'Stuck in the Middle With You' from 'Reservoir Dogs'. This makes it more comic than disturbing. The film also feels like it's in a rush. Characters act and talk far too quickly to know what's going on and it's only because I had read the book and seen Ratner's version that I could fathom any kind of clues as to how they were getting nearer to the killer. This would suggest that people who haven't read the book will be in absolute disarray when watching it, which isn't good. In fact, those who have read the book will probably feel like I felt when viewing it a little insulted.Numerous things are missing from the novel which made it so effective and which made the killer so effectively disturbing. For one, the killer is hardly in this film; we only see him eliminate a certain character and more towards the end when he starts his relationship with Reba. Secondly, there is no hint of his past whatsoever and nor does it mention his grandmother whom is, basically, the reason for his killings. Thirdly, the fact he lives in a modern looking apartment as opposed to the large, creepy old house that he did in the book completely infuriated me as it served the basis for his evilness. It's mentioned that the killer lived and grew up in that house, suffered his abuse in that house and wasn't used to going to other people's more modern houses (like Reba's in the book and Ratner's version) building up a dangerous profile of him that he is severally alienated from most up-to-date people. In this film, it's all wrong.Another thing is Hannibal Lecter himself. The filmmakers couldn't even spell his name correctly in this film; let alone get his persona right. Brian Cox portrays Lecter in a way in which he is more akin to a locked up east-end, London gangster than a mass murderer\/cannibal. He talks too quickly and too colloquially, destroying any sophistication which should have been present in the film. In the book, special attention is paid to the ways in which Lecter moves; his tiny instances of body language are described but here, everything you thought you knew about Lecter is annihilated in an instance. Here, Lecter talks in an everyday way, sits with his feet up on the wall and talks down the phone like a laid back guy, lying on a sofa. There're also no references to his cultural knowledge. No pictures or no paintings on the wall; nothing. Just a few books.What also drives Manhunter towards the tag of 'Hollywood nonsense' is the way it builds its final third. The killer's relationship with Reba is dealt with far too quickly in a filmic sense and the touching scenes involving him making his way to the museum to eat the painting were left out; destroying the fact that he was undergoing a change due to his love for Reba (who is blind, by the way!). The way in which the police storm the house towards the end, crashing through windows like in a 'Lethal Weapon' film was just insulting and the way in which he was finally dealt with was equally bad.Unfortunately, Manhunter is a real disappointment and those that say they like it; well, I really can't see why.

Although the writer and director is a female, this is a story from a neutral perspective and both men and women can find themselves in it. You can identify with one of the characters and understand the other one.The first time I saw it wasn't from the beginning and it caught my eye in a weird way. I underestimated it when I first saw it but something pulled me to watch it again. I've seen it few times since and I think to really understand it you have to see it more than ones. Before you start calling me names, like dumb and stuff for not getting it right away, I should mention that my profession is psychologist and actually I'm in Mensa. Not that it matters when we discuss taste for movies, but when it comes to analyzing the characters I am more than educated to give my saying. Being amateur scriptwriter is helping me see the story from a different perspective. But enough in my defense, the point is to actually give you a friendly advice if you hated the movie the first time See it again.What I look for in a movie is a realistic character with flaws and virtues. Good and bad sides. Actually, in a way, the performance of the leading actors was borderline brilliant and I'm not sure that they even realize it. Harper Sloane is a naive (but this movie is not) girl with low self-esteem not the center of attention she would like to be. So she goes on the other side. The alternative side where she's denying the need for attention on the outside but accumulating it inside. A very common story in real life. She meets the disgustingly ugly character Connie (sorry Stephen ) ) who is giving her the one thing she needs the most. In fact she's identifying herself with him. And thus feels very close to him, he is the only one that gets her or the only one who seemingly cares to understand her. A potential soul mate. Sure, you can see him as a dirty old man if you like, and call him the abuser of a naive young body but think again. Cause you can call her the abuser also, she's getting what she wants from him maybe more than he does. She tells him that she plans to move out (not right away but has plans to do so) and what does he do. Gets insanely drunk and ends up in the hospital. He actually loves her. Perhaps not exactly Harper, but what she represents. And he is actually if need be, ready to put everything on the line for that. What he loves is presented to us by the mother Deborah, another complex character that looks predictable on the first look. Also this is confirmed by the other girls that Connie loved in same way. Sweet naive losers with desperate need for attention, and even more, help in the forming themselves into bearable creatures as they mature. Bearable for them not for the others. They are all unhappy and depressed. Looking for someone to save them from these feelings. They are all special in some way; Connie brings them out of their cocoons they might have never left if it wasn't for him, and makes them special. This is a story of life and death (the nature itself), metaphorically speaking, cause throughout the movie we are constantly waiting for the separation of Harper and Connie. The end points it out very explicitly. Probably for those who failed to understand it during the course of the action. About the archetypes, what can I say, perfectly painted in the modern environment. The old man, the naive girl, the mother&#133; I could go on for hours but that would probably bore the hell out of the ones who care enough to read what I have to say about this piece of work. I had a feeling when I finished watching it that it can be done much better. Sure, the movie could have been directed better, superstar cast might have done it differently, more appealing, but than it would lose the imperfection. This way, it's like that old book you found with ripped pages, very unappealing, and read about the secrets in it. Like a diamond found in the garbage. It can be private this way, just for those who spend the time to really grasp it. If it would be a blockbuster, it wouldn't be as precious as it is this way.

You can identify with one of the characters and understand the other one.The first time I saw it wasn't from the beginning and it caught my eye in a weird way. I underestimated it when I first saw it but something pulled me to watch it again. I've seen it few times since and I think to really understand it you have to see it more than ones. Before you start calling me names, like dumb and stuff for not getting it right away, I should mention that my profession is psychologist and actually I'm in Mensa. Not that it matters when we discuss taste for movies, but when it comes to analyzing the characters I am more than educated to give my saying. Being amateur scriptwriter is helping me see the story from a different perspective. But enough in my defense, the point is to actually give you a friendly advice if you hated the movie the first time See it again.What I look for in a movie is a realistic character with flaws and virtues. Good and bad sides. Actually, in a way, the performance of the leading actors was borderline brilliant and I'm not sure that they even realize it. Harper Sloane is a naive (but this movie is not) girl with low self-esteem not the center of attention she would like to be. So she goes on the other side. The alternative side where she's denying the need for attention on the outside but accumulating it inside. A very common story in real life. She meets the disgustingly ugly character Connie (sorry Stephen ) ) who is giving her the one thing she needs the most. In fact she's identifying herself with him. And thus feels very close to him, he is the only one that gets her or the only one who seemingly cares to understand her. A potential soul mate. Sure, you can see him as a dirty old man if you like, and call him the abuser of a naive young body but think again. Cause you can call her the abuser also, she's getting what she wants from him maybe more than he does. She tells him that she plans to move out (not right away but has plans to do so) and what does he do. Gets insanely drunk and ends up in the hospital. He actually loves her. Perhaps not exactly Harper, but what she represents. And he is actually if need be, ready to put everything on the line for that. What he loves is presented to us by the mother Deborah, another complex character that looks predictable on the first look. Also this is confirmed by the other girls that Connie loved in same way. Sweet naive losers with desperate need for attention, and even more, help in the forming themselves into bearable creatures as they mature. Bearable for them not for the others. They are all unhappy and depressed. Looking for someone to save them from these feelings. They are all special in some way; Connie brings them out of their cocoons they might have never left if it wasn't for him, and makes them special. This is a story of life and death (the nature itself), metaphorically speaking, cause throughout the movie we are constantly waiting for the separation of Harper and Connie. The end points it out very explicitly. Probably for those who failed to understand it during the course of the action. About the archetypes, what can I say, perfectly painted in the modern environment. The old man, the naive girl, the mother&#133; I could go on for hours but that would probably bore the hell out of the ones who care enough to read what I have to say about this piece of work. I had a feeling when I finished watching it that it can be done much better. Sure, the movie could have been directed better, superstar cast might have done it differently, more appealing, but than it would lose the imperfection. This way, it's like that old book you found with ripped pages, very unappealing, and read about the secrets in it. Like a diamond found in the garbage. It can be private this way, just for those who spend the time to really grasp it. If it would be a blockbuster, it wouldn't be as precious as it is this way.

It is a movie of almost unrelenting bleakness and cynicism, lightened only slightly at its outermost margins. It also not only stands up well more than 50 years later, it has a freshness and relevance that comes from an almost uncannily eerie spot on prediction about the future of the role of media in our culture. Wilder notably responded to the initial negative reaction to the film by noting that he did not think he made in cynical enough. In a time of wall-to-wall media coverage of the parentage of Anna Nicole Smith's baby, breathless television commentary on the suit Kobe Bryant wore to a hearing on his rape case or a prosecutor's hairstyle, crowds of gawkers outside of a mine disaster, Ace in the Hole plays with a more harshly realistic light now than it probably did on its initial release.Kirk Douglas gives a tremendous, fearless performance as Chuck Tatum, a newspaper reporter who has fallen off the face of the journalistic globe and who smells the chance to regain his fortune when he stumbles on the story of Leo Minosa, trapped in an old Indian cliff dwelling. Tatum immediately recognizes that he can remake his name on Leo's story, if he can stretch the coverage out long enough. With the connivance of the fame-hungry local sheriff (despicably well played by Ray Teal), Tatum deliberately delays the rescue in order to maximize the story.I have never seen Douglas give a performance quite like this, or in a role like this. In fact, there may not be another role like this in that era. Tatum is almost uncompromisingly nasty and self-serving to everyone; his boss, his coworker, Leo's slatternly wife, and Leo himself. Douglas the movie star disappears completely in this film. It is a masterful performance; any clue that we are watching Kirk Douglas acting would tear the film down.Also wonderful is Jan Sterling as Leo's femme fatale (literally) wife, whose reaction, at first, is that Leo's predicament gives her a head start on leaving him. Later, Tatum convinces her that she can make scads of money of her husband, which she does with tremendous malice - the price to visit the cliff dwelling goes from free to one dollar quite rapidly. Sterling brings a great balance of sexiness and ruthlessness to her role.But the goat of this movie is not just two or three heartless people, it is all of us. As in Frank Cady (Sam Drucker in Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction) who, with his wife, is proudly and fiercely the first of the throng that encamps at the cliff dwelling, and who is not above using his status for his own personal gain; he turns an interview into an advertisement for his insurance business. Leo's predicament draws a huge crowd, including a literal carnival, and other people who are looking to cash in on Leo, most notably a country band hawking the sheet music to their song, We're Coming Leo. Wilder handles all of this material with his usual straightforward aplomb. Wilder is not one for shots that call attention to themselves, and the unpretentious nature of his direction serves the starkness of the story well. Likewise the script is full of the bitter wit and great lines that grace any Wilder film.But the film has one major failure, and that is the end. Tatum, it turns out, at least belatedly has a heart and isn't the most cynical person in the film, and we get an unnecessary and unlikely attempted murder, a stabbing, comeuppance for the bad guy - all of which seems tacked on and diminishes the film. To me the real end of the movie comes a few minutes earlier, when Tatum announces that Leo had died, and the carnival closes down, the crowds leave and even as the dust begins to settle, we see a long shot of the solitary figure of Leo's lame father, slowly hobbling back to the mountain that still holds the body of his son. That is an unforgettable shot. That ending, with Tatum essentially unredeemed and alive, would serve the movie much better.Still, this bitter, cynical and well-made movie is a great gem, and a fine addition to Wilder's brilliant oeuvre ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There has probably never been a movie from a major director quite like Ace in the Hole.

I've heard many comments that this movie should be pulled from the shelves, or that it's too sensitive of subject matter. Frankly, if you do not know the difference between watching a movie and acting, then do not watch this movie. For those who can appreciate the drama and lessons shown in film, this is a superb tale. Bastard Out Of Carolina is exactly that, a story about a bastard who commits one of life's most horrific tragedies; sexual child abuse. It will have you cringing and crying, but despite all the emotions it pulls out of you, it's no different then many other films depicting tragedy in some humans lives, be that death, divorce, illness, or child abuse. It does the job of showing us the reality of child rape extremely well.

A flawed classic at that. It has all the familiar trappings of a typical slasher, but it feels a little off in some aspect. The real action seems to take forever to get going. This could be o.k. if there was something to tide you over, but there really isn't. The only thing that keeps you watching is the unusually talented cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Leslie Neilsen, Casey Stevens, and Anne Marie Martin.The plot is a loose retelling of Lois Duncan's I Know What You Did Last Summer, but there's enough here to keep you interested. It's not totally original, but it has an interesting style to it. It feels more like an Italian giallo with it's black gloved killer, cryptic and threatening messages, obscene phone calls and it's strong use of color.It's still a fun movie with a shocking killer revelation and a great chase scene through a locked school building. The disco score is suitably nostalgic as well.

It is true that Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has a complex and almost unbelievable storyline, but several main parts of the plot were changed in this movie, and the change was not for the better! It seemed to me that the purpose of the changes was to condense the plot so that it would fit in a 2-hour movie. This movie was a MAJOR disappointment. The only redeeming portion was the part about the child Jane. Even in this part, changes were made in the plot. And the actors that played Rochester and the adult Jane were simply unsuitable for the parts. They were completely passionless and there was no chemistry between them. An awful adaptation.

But for me, I think it's simply not appropriate to compare it to the original (I haven't seen the original yet or read the book, so I can't compare). Still, however, I couldn't quite recommend it other than a second look.The Neverending Story II The Next Chapter is made back then, where movies don't have CGI to do the special-effects as realistic as today. Back then, viewers watch it like any other movie. Today, it seemed something new, that's why we think its not as realistic. But I love watching older movies. Today, most movies' main components are CGI effects or a well-known cast. Back then, where there are no CGI, filmmakers let the viewers imagine that the things they see are real ('cause back then, stop-motion or miniatures are as real as CGI counterparts). But even the stunning special effects work can salvage some of this film's weak points. Namely, a story that should easily fit in a Saturday-morning cartoon. But when it isn't about special effects, this sequel lacks magic, better writing and more engaging characters. Nothing but a curiosity piece and nothing more. Rating ** out of 5.
