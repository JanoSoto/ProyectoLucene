[{"date":"15 July 2015","score":"","review":" The Faculty is an excellent,entertaining and underrated SCI-FI-Horror-Thriller that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,a sharp script,fine special effects and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make The Faculty solid entertainment that's Robert Rodriguez at his best.Set in Ohio,The Faculty tells the story of High School teenagers Casey(Eiljah Wood),Zeke(Josh Hartnett),Delilah(Jordana Brewster),Stokely(Clea DuVall),Stan(Shawn Hatosy)and Marybeth(Laura Harris)who find out that their teachers and fellow students have been taken over and possessed by Aliens. With nowhere to run or hide,the teens decide to fight back against the Aliens and survive.After the critical and Box Office success of Wes Craven's Horror classic Scream in 1996 there was a trend and wave of hip and clever Teen Horror films that were released in theaters during the late 1990s and early 2000s(which also included I Know What You Did Last Summer in 1997 and Urban Legend in 1998)and one of the best Teen Horror films and one of my favorites during this time was director Robert Rodriguez and screenwriter Kevin Williamson collaboration The Faculty,a movie that that was a modest success at the Box Office and is a film that combines Rodriguez's special effects driven style with Williamson's dialog and is Horror movie that's truly underrated and very overlooked. The Faculty is a terrific and memorable SCI-FI-Horror-Thriller that would be described as The Breakfast Club meets Invasion Of The Body Snatchers with a dash of John Carpenter's The Thing and is a movie that gives viewers a fun and interesting take on the Alien invasion genre with High School and with teenagers dealing with adults even though the movie isn't serious. The storyline in The Faculty may not be original or creative but the movie is a non-stop thrill ride from beginning to end giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink with tons of thrills,excitement and suspense that is done in a over the top style that just works. While The Faculty is a SCI-FI-Horror movie it's not a scary one to make you keep your lights on at night,but there are moments in the film that are suspenseful and intense and will gives some viewers jolts and surprises. As for Blood and Gore there isn't much of it in this film but there is bits and pieces that show up in the movie. The screenplay by Kevin Williamson is terrific and memorable,with Williamson's dialog being clever and witty basically bringing the same type of dialog and style he brought to his Scream screenplay which makes The Faculty funny and humorous at times thanks to some of the back and forth dialog with the characters. While the characters and the dialog make reference to other SCI-FI-Horror movies The Faculty isn't as self aware or ironic as Scream was. The main teen characters are a direct homage to the John Hughes Teen\/High School classic The Breakfast Club with all of the main characters pretty much representing some of the main stereotypes you would see in other Teen movies(geek,jock,criminal etc)but all of them are well-developed and interesting becoming more and more likable and heroic as the film goes on and we root for them as things become dangerous and chaotic. The ending of The Faculty is amazing,thrilling and filled with excitement,surprises that will leave viewers satisfied. A great ending.The cast is great. Elijah Wood is wonderful as Casey,a nerd. Jordana Brewster is terrific as Delilah,a popular girl Casey has a crush on. Clea DuVall is fantastic as Stoakley,a loner. Shawn Hatosy is great as Stan,a Football jock that's Delilah's boyfriend. Josh Hartnett is amazing as Zeke,a genius who makes drugs. Laura Harris is great as Marybeth,a new girl at school. Famke Janssen(Ms. Burke),Robert Patrick(Coach Willis),Salma Hayak(Nurse Harper),Piper Laurie(Mrs. Olson),Bebe Neuwirth(Principal Drake),Jon Stewart(Professor Furlong),Daniel Van Bargen(Mr. Tate),Christopher McDonald(Mr. Connor),Libby Villari(Mrs. Connor),Usher Raymond(Gabe),Jon Abrahams(Boy),Summer Phoenix(Girl)Danny Masterson(Messed Up Kid),Wiley Wiggins(Messed Up Kid),Duane Martin(Police Officer),Katherine Willis(Police Officer)and Susan Willis(Mrs. Brummel)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriguez is amazing and stylish,with Rodriquez keeping the camera moving also using freeze frames,slow motion and giving the film a nice style and atmosphere. Fantastic direction,Rodriguez.The score by Marco Beltrami is impressive,suspenseful and intense and matches the tone of the movie. Nice score,Beltrami. There is also a wonderful Pop\/Rock soundtrack that includes a great cover of the Pink Floyd song Another Brick In The Wall by the group Class Of 99.The Special and Practical Effects by K.N.B. Efx Group are terrific and effective mixing together practical effects with CGI very well. Great job once again,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Horror films,SCI-FI or Robert Rodriguez,I highly suggest you see The Faculty,an excellent,entertaining and underrated SCI-FI-Horror film that well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

Stalag 17 is not quite one of my favourites from Wilder but that doesn't stop it from being a classic.As always with Wilder's films, Stalag 17 visually is a very well-made film, and German PoW camp life is very effectively and accurately depicted as claustrophobic. It's beautifully photographed and atmospherically lit, still managing to look aesthetically pleasing while still making the claustrophobic setting as evocative as possible and never looking too flashy or static. As always, there is nothing really to fault Wilder's direction, his visual and writing always shines and he doesn't fail to make the story or characters interesting. Franz Waxman's score is another winner from him, stirring, luscious and haunting while always being appropriate to the film's mood and not being too syrupy.Stalag 17 has a very compelling story, with a good mix of the hilarious, the poignant and the foreboding, emotions are never forced, the pacing is both controlled and exciting, for me the comedy didn't get too much or too goofy and the suspense and tension reach nail-biting heights. The script superbly balances comedy, drama and even satire, what the film tried to be and do not once coming into question. The comedy, a lot of it deliciously dark, is genuinely funny and quite endearing, it may be too much or too goofy for some viewers (depending on whether the antics of Animal and Harry are to your tastes or not) but it appealed to me just fine, and Animal and Harry's antics were appropriately light-hearted and gave the film its heart. The drama doesn't fall into clichés and doesn't slow the film at all, also avoiding the mistake of some comedy-dramas seen of jarring with the comedy to the extent the film feels like two different ones. It's also very charming and poignant. The satire is sharp and biting without falling into attacking or bitterness, never does it feel like it's too much.The performances are spot-on from a top notch, and they are advantaged by the fact that the characters are interesting and their situation relatable without falling into stereotypes (even when more stylised that's even including the Germans). William Holden got a well-deserved Oscar for his powerful performance in a somewhat unsympathetic role, while Robert Strauss is funny and moving as Animal, the character that can be seen as the heart of the story, and Otto Preminger (in a surprise piece of casting, considering I know him better as a director) mesmerises as a particularly nasty character, looking like he was having a whale of a time. Harvey Lembeck, like Strauss, was part of the original Broadway run, and it's easy to see why in a fine performance that endears far more than it annoys. Sig Ruman gives a character that could have easily been a buffoonish caricature some welcome subtlety and genuine menace while clearly having a ball.Overall, another Billy Wilder classic. 10\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Billy Wilder was a truly great director, whose best work was up there with the best films ever made (i.e. Sunset Boulevard) and even lesser films like The Emperor Waltz were still worth watching.

Exciting film packs intrigue , intense scenes , noisy action and astonishing suspense . Freak meteor storm cause a a commercial transport airship to make landing on an unknown planet . Then the spaceship and its survivors are marooned on a planet with three suns and apparently no life and where mysterious events spread across the land . The greatest danger facing our crew has been the planet's best kept secret...until now . Later on , the crew to be aware the planet is full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night . But then , they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur .Creepy and gory Sci-Fi with thrills , chills , suspense and some familiar elements . This is a pretty good as well as scary movie with violent events , intriguing incidents , starked outdoors , and chilling scenes . This is a peculiar rendition of ¨The only come out at night¨ in which some passengers , pilots , bounty hunters and prisoner discover that very nasty hunting creatures attack after dark and the planet is in for a total eclipse . Interesting screenplay from Jim Wheat , Ken Wheat and David Twohy . The film developed from David Twohy's unused idea for Alien³ (1992) , involving a space prison . The fantastic alien creatures are perfectly designed by Patrick Tatopoulos, they have three phases of evolution 1) embryonic - little harmless Bioluminescent beings 2) youngish - which fly in flock to hunt and finally 3) adult - big gray creatures who are able to kill other members of the species to eat . Vin Diesel gives a hard-ass acting , as usual , as a convicted killer who has nothing to lose . Nice support cast such as Radha Mitchell , Cole Hauser , Claudia Black , Lewis Fitzgerald , Simon Burke , John Moore and Keith David . Thrilling and stirring musical score by Graeme Revell . Colorful cinematography by David Eggby who shows splendidly the desert landscapes from Queensland , Australia . In fact , the hot desert where they filmed was actually about 50F, they were misting water on the actors to make it appear as if they were sweating . As desert scenes filmed in the same location used for Mad Max , beyond Thunderdome (1985) .The motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy , it had a 60 days shooting schedule. David is an expert writer and director of splendid Sci-Fi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable ¨Timescape¨ . He also wrote ¨Warlock¨, ¨Waterworld ¨, a script for ¨Alien 3¨ in 1988, but it was rejected . Back in May of 2000 , Fox Studios once inquired for his availability to write and direct AVP Alien vs. Predator , but turned down the offer due to scheduling conflicts . David subsequently directed ¨Below¨, the successful ¨Pich Black¨ and its sequel ¨ The chronicles of Riddick¨ (2004) in which the wanted criminal Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime, and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, an army that plans, to convert or kill all humans in the universe , it stars  Colm Feore , Thandie Newton , Judi Dench , Alexa Davalos , Karl Urban , Linus Roache and again Keith David . Furthermore , a third installment  ¨Riddick¨ (2013) in which left for dead on a sun-scorched planet, Riddick finds himself up against an alien race of predators , it stars  Jordi Mollà , Katee Sackhoff , Dave Bautista , Matt Nable , Bokeem Woodbine , Raoul Trujillo , Conrad Pla , and , of course , Vin Diesel .

Later on , the crew to be aware the planet is full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night . But then , they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur .Creepy and gory Sci-Fi with thrills , chills , suspense and some familiar elements . This is a pretty good as well as scary movie with violent events , intriguing incidents , starked outdoors , and chilling scenes . This is a peculiar rendition of ¨The only come out at night¨ in which some passengers , pilots , bounty hunters and prisoner discover that very nasty hunting creatures attack after dark and the planet is in for a total eclipse . Interesting screenplay from Jim Wheat , Ken Wheat and David Twohy . The film developed from David Twohy's unused idea for Alien³ (1992) , involving a space prison . The fantastic alien creatures are perfectly designed by Patrick Tatopoulos, they have three phases of evolution 1) embryonic - little harmless Bioluminescent beings 2) youngish - which fly in flock to hunt and finally 3) adult - big gray creatures who are able to kill other members of the species to eat . Vin Diesel gives a hard-ass acting , as usual , as a convicted killer who has nothing to lose . Nice support cast such as Radha Mitchell , Cole Hauser , Claudia Black , Lewis Fitzgerald , Simon Burke , John Moore and Keith David . Thrilling and stirring musical score by Graeme Revell .

Naturally right behind this Italian supercar the cops are in hot pursuit. In the meantime Lee Van Cleef, in a very small cameo, plays an elderly grandfather teaching his grandson how to skip stones across a small lake. Van Cleef tells the young boy how to throw the stone at just the right angle so it can skip across the water. All of a sudden the red Lambo comes roaring up to the waterline and flies across the obviously shallow lake, skipping just like a flat stone...kinda, it then takes off once it hits dry land. The young boy looks at his grandfather and asks him about the angle he should throw the stone, Van Cleef looks at the car in disbelief and...annoyance I guess. The whole setup is cheesy as hell and doesn't really work to be honest, its not funny at all and Van Cleef is wasted totally, shame. The intro is good, its always good to see an 80's Lambo tearing it up, but it doesn't hold a candle to the first two movie intros.I think you can guess what the plot is here, its another race, from east (Washington D.C.) to west (Santa Monica) and the winners this time stand to receive 1 million Dollars. Unfortunately the D.C. chief of police (Peter Boyle) manages to arrest all of the drivers prior to game time so a whole bunch of new drivers must be found. One by one each sponsor clambers to find a new driver any way they can, no matter who they are.In the starting grid this time we have Charlie (John Candy), who has been tricked and bullied into driving for his so called best friend from school Gus (Eugene Levy). Charlie is a parking valet and brilliant driver, hence Gus wanting him for the race. Along for the ride is Tiffany, Gus's love interest, for some reason, mainly because she is eye candy. They use a BMW.Matt Frewer plays Englishman Alec who is in debt to loan sharks. They send a hit-man to whack him (Joe Flaherty), but Alec persuades Vic to ride in the race with him in order to pay back the money he owes. Vic may have other ideas though. They drive a Jag XJS.The two sexy ladies for this movie aren't quite as sexy as the previous two but hey, you gotta have the sexy ladies in a sexy car, its obligatory. Here they manage to persuade a Ferrari owner to use his Spyder. The duo are MIT grads and electronics\/gadgets experts, so they use their brains and electronic gizmos to assist them in gaining the upper hand. This is the easy bit of tame progression for the movie (and 80's), having the sexy females actually going against the norm and being intelligent and skillful characters instead of just skimpily dressed sluts.Tim Matheson is a TV reporter who gets caught up in the race in his van, so he decides to race. The driver of the red Lambo from the intro sequence (John Schneider of 'The Dukes of Hazzard') gets arrested with all the other original drivers, its left in the hands of an Italian porter. An ice cool dude called Flash steps up outta nowhere and takes control to drive it, he's an ex-cop and wants the money for his own unknown reasons. Flash is a super cool, shades wearing driver, where as the Italian is a trembling nervous wreck.Lastly Nelson and Randolph Sloane are two millionaires who spend their whole time trying to cheat their way to the finish, mainly by catching a plane to the finish line. They drive a Bentley Corniche. Jamie Farr makes a cameo as the Sheik from the first two movies but he doesn't race.As you can imagine much of the run time is taken up with the predictable scenarios of the various characters getting into all sorts of close calls. There are some nice moments of car porn but nowhere near as much as the previous two movies, this time an emphasis has been put on making the few set pieces bigger. Hence the race from downtown Washington D.C. which is a highlight admittedly, the race into Santa Monica, and the use of a large aircraft. In between all that there are various small cameos of course and the usual tomfoolery and slapstick routines. One such sequence sees Candy pretty much redoing (homaging?) a famous scene from his classic movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'. Another sees a learner driver being taught by a racist instructor who bullies the learner into overtaking any foreign car, whilst he verbally abuses the driver as they pass. Definitely another highlight as its actually very amusing to see this guys reaction to a Volvo and Alfa Romeo.All things considering there aren't many, if any, car wrecks in this movie, it seems they were too scared to possibly damage anything, or maybe the budget wasn't high enough. The movie takes an age to get going and an age to actually finish and once the race is done it carries on with boring fluff. Its not a particularly funny film, or exciting film, alas we've kinda seen it all before now and this feels very much like beating a dead horse. Nonetheless it is fun at times, the cars are great as always (as long as you like cars) and the range of character actors on display is reasonable. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Much like the previous two movies this one opens with yet another red Lamborghini Countache, but this time its tearing down a small winding wooded country road, a change from the open desert.

However, most people don't mention some of his earlier works when they talk about Nolan's most intriguing or greatest films. One of these films is Insomnia, a 2002 film that remakes a Norwegian film released in 1997. As I'm always interested to see the films that nobody talks about, let's go take a look at one of Nolan's earliest films.Insomnia follows two Los Angeles detectives who head to a small fishing town in Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. They soon corner the man responsible, and when they are forced to give chase in the fog, one of the detectives kills the other. As the murder starts to wear at his psyche, as does the 24-hour sunlight, he begins to get calls from the man who is responsible for the girl's murder.This film was one I had been interested in for a while now, and I am really glad I saw it. Let's get into the positives. Al Pacino does a fantastic job as Will Dormer, the detective who is plagued with insomnia and has killed his partner. As the film progresses, you really see his slow and somewhat subtle descent into madness. It's really fascinating to watch. Robin Williams does a great job as the writer Walter Finch, a man who really becomes involved with Dormer and he does a delishly creepy job during the film. Hilary Swank plays the traditional cop who wants to be one of the greats, like Dormer, Nicky Katt is one of the cops from Alaska investigating the girl's murder, and he does a pretty good job. Martin Donovan also does a great job as Dormer's partner.The cinematography in this film is just brilliant. The opening scene where the two detectives are in a plane flying over Alaska looks great, and a lot of the shots of the scenery during the film, especially noted during driving scenes, look amazing. The music in this film, although not always noteworthy, and mostly just background music, was still really great, and it especially worked in scenes like the one approximately 30 minutes in, and the ending.I really enjoyed the script to the film. Yeah, sure, perhaps there were a few too many 'fucks' in there, but it was still a script that, at least to start, managed to keep itself being taken seriously while also having a lot of jokes in there. That really added something to the film as a whole. I also enjoyed the entire mystery, as before you find out who did it, it really is amazing how Will and his partner always seem to act like they're always going to get it right and always act somewhat suspicious.Overall, Insomnia is a smart thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Sure, the film is a bit too dour at times, and the ending could have been reworked a bit, but the film still is an achievement in it's acting, plotting, script, mystery, music and cinematography. If you've been neglecting this one, or haven't seen it yet, go see it, as it is a intensely brilliant film that features one of the best performances from the late Robin Williams and from Al Pacino. I promise you, you won't regret it.9\/10.

Here, it's the iconic image of Scarlet O'Hara standing underneath the giant tree (saying There's always tomorrow.) that was used in 'Principal Charming'. The Technicolor look of 'Gone with the wind' is pretty amazing, for instance in the aforementioned scene, and otherwise mostly in similar grand scenes and images. During the film I had guessed the film was from the fifties, so discovering that it was made in 1939 rather blew my mind.I loved this movie, but only up until just after the ending of the Civil War. Then it became much more like a soap opera (though still better than your average soap series), focusing mostly on Scarlet and Rhett Butler and their turbulent 'romantic' times. I can't say I got bored with it, nor was it really bad, but their characters went all over the place without really convincing me of their sincerity. Still, it's not hard to see how this is a classic, and I'm very likely to give it another chance some other time. Scarlet O'Hara is in any case a terrific movie character that will stick with me for a good while - great balls of fire!Until then, a big 7 out of 10.

Firstly the film seemed too funny, there was too much visual comedy that made the film feel almost like a parody of itself.

Speaking of fear, it is something I didn't feel once during the film as the Alien creatures have become too familiar, also director Jean-Pierre Jeunet might want to look up the definition of suspense in the dictionary.Overall this was quite a silly, needless movie, the visual effects and set design were very well done however it is a shame the story wasn't up to scratch and left me feeling unfulfilled.Take away everything that made Alien (1979) great and you're left with Alien Resurrection.

Take the term bunny boiler for example - how many times has it been said by someone who hasn't the faintest idea that it originated in this movie? It's an impressive feat, but the film itself has been held up to serious scrutiny over the years due to it's (supposed) underlying message.More on that later, though. It's more important to enjoy a movie than analyze it, and Fatal Attraction is a great thriller. It feels like the kind of film Hitchcock might have made had he been born 30 or 40 years later - that is to say it's a total suspense movie, with more violence and sex than he would have been allowed (or allowed himself) to show. The director Adrian Lyne (who would go on to forge a career based on this kind of subject) injects the screenplay with a kind of creepy, sexually charged drama that gives the film its famous bite. Impressively, he never shows much to the camera - violence is rare, nasty, but left to our imagination.On equally impressive footing is Glenn Close in her signature role. It begs belief that she actually managed to make a character like Alex, who seems like a nasty piece of work on paper, seem sympathetic and genuinely mentally ill on screen. For every histrionic fit, there's a genuine sadness and depression in her eyes. Her performance sets it apart from slasher-lite territory - she doesn't portray a superhuman, jealous monster, she portrays a woman with needs, affections and senses. It's a breath of fresh air, further enhanced by equally strong supporting work from Anne Archer.And now, back to why it's ever so slightly problematic. Here be spoilers; you have been warned.Her performance, unfortunately, is one that the film doesn't know what to do with. In portraying Alex so well, Ms. Close managed to show up some major problems with the film, mostly to do with the ending. For the first 110 minutes or so, the film manages to function as both a commentary on infidelity and marriage, and a balls-to-the-wall thriller. For the final 10 minutes, it shifts gear and kicks it into full on thriller. A violent struggle ensues, our villain has been killed, and our protagonist has managed to die another day. Yay! But this is the kind of ending that only works when we don't feel a sympathy for the villain - Glenn Close does such a good job as Alex that we realize she WAS a human, a mentally ill one. Michael Douglas'character doesn't go to the police until it's too late because he doesn't want to own up. So, in the end, the mentally ill woman is killed, and the cheating husband gets off comparatively light. This small flaw puts the rest of the film in a slightly bad light - for a film that straddles the line between a thriller and classy commentary so expertly, it manages to nosedive fairly drastically here. It's a pity, because it's not the ending that the film deserves - in an ideal world, both characters should have been killed - and it's most definitely not the ending that Close's performance deserved. Having said all that, the film works well for 100% of it's running time on a purely thriller level (including the ending), and that's good enough for me once manage to ignore my problems with it. It's a film that thoroughly deserves its pop- culture status, and will be discussed and debated for years to come.

The story does get rather silly and contrived, with romances where while sweet it is not hard at all figuring out the outcome, and is occasionally more of a slow-mover more than a smooth-mover (a vast majority of the time it is the latter though). Harry Watson did to me come across like he was trying too hard and eager to please, and it irritated rather than amused. Am in agreement however that Joan Fontaine was the biggest flaw, have nothing against her overall as an actress and while there are signs of an aristocratic presence which suited the role just fine her acting inexperience here does show, her comic timing is flat (barely keeping up with the energy of the rest of the cast), her chemistry with Astaire is at times stilted and she is very ill at ease as a dancer, her work in Things are Looking Up is basically a walk-through.Fred Astaire however absolutely sparkles, who cannot love the grace and poise of his dancing or his charming, suave screen presence? He shines particularly in Stiff Upper Lip, his unconventional but quite clever routine with the drums and especially A Foggy Day. George Burns and Gracie Allen are hilarious in their comic relief supporting roles and their dancing comes off remarkably well, more than holding their own against Astaire in Stiff Upper Lip in a way where two different styles gel surprisingly effectively. In other supporting roles, Reginald Gardiner is brilliantly funny with a conniving character that could easily have been over-played, and the conniving side of the character is more than convincing, and Montagu Love is equally great value.George Stevens directs with grace and care throughout, the comedy elements are appropriately light and he doesn't lay it too thick or sentimental for the drama and romantic elements. Damsel in Distress looks lovely, with elegant production values and crisp, beautiful photography. The photography actually dazzles in Stiff Upper Lip, and is more than an ideal match for the cleverness of the choreography. The script is witty and light-hearted, enough to induce a number of laughs easily, and it's sweet and heart-warming as well.Other than Astaire, George Gershwin's songs and Hermes Pan's Oscar-winning choreography are what stand out. The songs are typically fine, as can be expected from Gershwin, One Foggy Day and Nice Work If You Can Get It are classic standards for good reason. The choreography is every bit as superb, Astaire's scene with the drums will delight and surprise fans but the highlight is indeed Stiff Upper Lip, set in a funhouse, it is so much fun and is the most imaginative and colourful the choreography gets.All in all, while Fontaine is disappointing, Astaire, the songs and the choreography are winning on every level.

Harry Watson did to me come across like he was trying too hard and eager to please, and it irritated rather than amused. Am in agreement however that Joan Fontaine was the biggest flaw, have nothing against her overall as an actress and while there are signs of an aristocratic presence which suited the role just fine her acting inexperience here does show, her comic timing is flat (barely keeping up with the energy of the rest of the cast), her chemistry with Astaire is at times stilted and she is very ill at ease as a dancer, her work in Things are Looking Up is basically a walk-through.Fred Astaire however absolutely sparkles, who cannot love the grace and poise of his dancing or his charming, suave screen presence? He shines particularly in Stiff Upper Lip, his unconventional but quite clever routine with the drums and especially A Foggy Day. George Burns and Gracie Allen are hilarious in their comic relief supporting roles and their dancing comes off remarkably well, more than holding their own against Astaire in Stiff Upper Lip in a way where two different styles gel surprisingly effectively. In other supporting roles, Reginald Gardiner is brilliantly funny with a conniving character that could easily have been over-played, and the conniving side of the character is more than convincing, and Montagu Love is equally great value.George Stevens directs with grace and care throughout, the comedy elements are appropriately light and he doesn't lay it too thick or sentimental for the drama and romantic elements. Damsel in Distress looks lovely, with elegant production values and crisp, beautiful photography. The photography actually dazzles in Stiff Upper Lip, and is more than an ideal match for the cleverness of the choreography. The script is witty and light-hearted, enough to induce a number of laughs easily, and it's sweet and heart-warming as well.Other than Astaire, George Gershwin's songs and Hermes Pan's Oscar-winning choreography are what stand out. The songs are typically fine, as can be expected from Gershwin, One Foggy Day and Nice Work If You Can Get It are classic standards for good reason. The choreography is every bit as superb, Astaire's scene with the drums will delight and surprise fans but the highlight is indeed Stiff Upper Lip, set in a funhouse, it is so much fun and is the most imaginative and colourful the choreography gets.All in all, while Fontaine is disappointing, Astaire, the songs and the choreography are winning on every level. While not a must-watch, it is still highly recommended but the many good things are so impressive. 7\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"15 July 2015","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" TMA is definitely for fans who love Jane Fonda, and want to see her strut her stuff, where she's in top form, truly believable as an alcoholic ex actress, displaying a real range of emotions, all done so believably. She's wound up sleeping next to a very much dead guy, a knife sticking out of his belly. For very much of the movie, she's trying to piece together, what happened the night before, as her inebriation has of course, annihilated her memory of the goings on, where we learned she attended a Hollywood party, the night before. This dead body keeps popping up, where someone's obviously trying to frame her. She meets a cop, Turner Kendall (great name played well by Jeff Bridges) that has us very much suspecting him. He's always around where she is, and his car keeps conking out. TMA isn't a good thriller. There's a real weakness throughout the film, as really there's not much plotting, where you don't have to be a genius to see how this film unfolds. Jeff Bridge's other short running pic, the earlier 8 Million Ways To Die had much more going for it. Raul Julia is almost wasted really as Fonda's good friend, with a little bit of menace to his character, a homosexual. He tries to help Fonda a bit, trying to stray the Bridges character away from her. Really, connect the dots. The opening music score, after the bloody start, is kind of a drone but does work with that moment, with Fonda, strolling out into the L.A sun, after taking off from that bloody sight. Bridge's ex cop character is fun to watch, very much cause he's real, He has flaws, and too, is not normally like the tough guy he usually plays. Just compare him here to his character in 8 Million Ways To Die, which hit the screen three months earlier than this. The bloody climax is less than impressive if only for the exaggerated and unreal gore. TMA, despite a good concept, is really is a weak written film that could of been a whole lot better if the writers, weren't hanging about in Lazyville, which like other films, is typically the main fault here, yet it's a real colorfully entertaining film, which we owe greatly to it's topline actors.

The second is that the aliens are evil and we have to defend ourselves, as in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). All alien invasion plots were one or the other for a long time. Eventually, a third possibility emerged in which the aliens are good and we get along with them just fine, as in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).The Day the Earth Stood Still is a strange combination of the first two. Klaatu is an alien from an unspecified planet in our solar system. He has come to destroy every creature on this planet, if we don't do what he says. That's every creature, mind you, not just man, but animals too. So, he is evil and we need to destroy him, right? Wrong! Like a Necker cube, at various times the movie flips and it is Klaatu who is good while we are in the wrong. Helen Benson says that the spaceman may not be a menace at all, and that he is just afraid. The movie approves of her sentiment. Her fiancé, Tom Stevens, believes that the spaceman is a menace, but the movie wants us to regard him as narrow-minded and prejudiced. As a result, we get this incongruous depiction of an alien who is kind and lovable and good, but who will wipe out our entire planet if we don't obey him.What he insists upon, it turns out, is that we not extend out violent ways into space, thereby threatening his civilization and that of other planets. Because the movie is set contemporaneously, the year is 1951, and it will be several years before the Soviets even manage to launch Sputnik. So we are not about to extend our violence any time soon. But never mind that. Klaatu says he is losing patience and may have to level New York to get everyone's attention. That sounds pretty evil, but then the Necker cube flips, and he is seen having a warm conversation with Professor Barnhardt, who does not seem to be the least appalled by Klaatu's threats to kill everybody.Barnhardt, you see, is a scientist. In a right-wing movie, it is the government along with the military and the police who are good, while the scientists are dangerous, because they want to communicate with the aliens or study them. But this is a left-wing movie, where scientists are good and politicians are bad, or at least pigheaded and narrow-minded. Barnhardt agrees to get scientists from all over the world to listen to Klaatu (apparently it takes a scientist to understand Klaatu's threat to destroy all life on this planet).Earlier in the movie, when the Necker cube flips and Klaatu is basically a good alien, he decides to find out what earthlings are like. He seems impressed by the goodness of humans; he is deeply moved by the words of Lincoln; and he is fond of Helen and Bobby. But then the Necker cube flips back, and he is once again threatening us with destruction, as if we were the scourge of the universe, and that includes Helen and Bobby.Barnhardt suggests that instead of leveling New York, Klaatu should demonstrate his power without hurting anyone. Klaatu does this by neutralizing electricity all over the world, causing the electricity to go off, not only in buildings but also in engines, excepting only airplanes and hospitals. During the blackout, Klaatu and Helen are trapped on an elevator. By the time the power comes back on, he has confided in her and now she trusts him. He's not a menace, she says to Tom. But Tom thinks Klaatu is a menace, which he clearly is. So, to keep us from siding with Tom, he is revealed to be an unpleasant character. He lets Helen know that telling the army where they can find Klaatu will allow him to write his own ticket, be the biggest man in the country, get his picture in all the papers, and be a hero. We should have suspected something like this when we found out he was a life insurance salesman. Needless to say, that engagement is off.Finally, Klaatu delivers his message, saying that Gort is one of a race of robots who patrol the planets. If any planet steps out of line, it is incinerated. And they are like a doomsday machine, which cannot be turned off. Then Klaatu and Gort fly away.As I said, this is a left-wing movie. Conservatives have always been suspicious of the United Nations, fearing a loss of sovereignty, accusing liberals of wanting our nation to submit to some supranational government in charge of a new world order. This takes that idea to the next level. Now there is a kind of United Planets, and it is Earth that has lost its sovereignty. The attitude of this movie is that this is a good thing.I have always fantasized about a sequel, in which Americans capture one of the flying saucers with a robot on board, and reverse engineer them until we have an army of robots and a fleet of flying saucers of our own, which we then use to destroy all those arrogant aliens and colonize their planets.

The first is that the aliens are good, but we want to kill them because we just don't understand them, as in It Came from Outer Space (1953). The second is that the aliens are evil and we have to defend ourselves, as in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). All alien invasion plots were one or the other for a long time. Eventually, a third possibility emerged in which the aliens are good and we get along with them just fine, as in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).The Day the Earth Stood Still is a strange combination of the first two. Klaatu is an alien from an unspecified planet in our solar system. He has come to destroy every creature on this planet, if we don't do what he says. That's every creature, mind you, not just man, but animals too. So, he is evil and we need to destroy him, right? Wrong! Like a Necker cube, at various times the movie flips and it is Klaatu who is good while we are in the wrong. Helen Benson says that the spaceman may not be a menace at all, and that he is just afraid. The movie approves of her sentiment. Her fiancé, Tom Stevens, believes that the spaceman is a menace, but the movie wants us to regard him as narrow-minded and prejudiced. As a result, we get this incongruous depiction of an alien who is kind and lovable and good, but who will wipe out our entire planet if we don't obey him.What he insists upon, it turns out, is that we not extend out violent ways into space, thereby threatening his civilization and that of other planets. Because the movie is set contemporaneously, the year is 1951, and it will be several years before the Soviets even manage to launch Sputnik. So we are not about to extend our violence any time soon. But never mind that. Klaatu says he is losing patience and may have to level New York to get everyone's attention. That sounds pretty evil, but then the Necker cube flips, and he is seen having a warm conversation with Professor Barnhardt, who does not seem to be the least appalled by Klaatu's threats to kill everybody.Barnhardt, you see, is a scientist. In a right-wing movie, it is the government along with the military and the police who are good, while the scientists are dangerous, because they want to communicate with the aliens or study them. But this is a left-wing movie, where scientists are good and politicians are bad, or at least pigheaded and narrow-minded. Barnhardt agrees to get scientists from all over the world to listen to Klaatu (apparently it takes a scientist to understand Klaatu's threat to destroy all life on this planet).Earlier in the movie, when the Necker cube flips and Klaatu is basically a good alien, he decides to find out what earthlings are like. He seems impressed by the goodness of humans; he is deeply moved by the words of Lincoln; and he is fond of Helen and Bobby. But then the Necker cube flips back, and he is once again threatening us with destruction, as if we were the scourge of the universe, and that includes Helen and Bobby.Barnhardt suggests that instead of leveling New York, Klaatu should demonstrate his power without hurting anyone. Klaatu does this by neutralizing electricity all over the world, causing the electricity to go off, not only in buildings but also in engines, excepting only airplanes and hospitals. During the blackout, Klaatu and Helen are trapped on an elevator. By the time the power comes back on, he has confided in her and now she trusts him. He's not a menace, she says to Tom. But Tom thinks Klaatu is a menace, which he clearly is. So, to keep us from siding with Tom, he is revealed to be an unpleasant character. He lets Helen know that telling the army where they can find Klaatu will allow him to write his own ticket, be the biggest man in the country, get his picture in all the papers, and be a hero. We should have suspected something like this when we found out he was a life insurance salesman. Needless to say, that engagement is off.Finally, Klaatu delivers his message, saying that Gort is one of a race of robots who patrol the planets. If any planet steps out of line, it is incinerated. And they are like a doomsday machine, which cannot be turned off. Then Klaatu and Gort fly away.As I said, this is a left-wing movie. Conservatives have always been suspicious of the United Nations, fearing a loss of sovereignty, accusing liberals of wanting our nation to submit to some supranational government in charge of a new world order. This takes that idea to the next level. Now there is a kind of United Planets, and it is Earth that has lost its sovereignty. The attitude of this movie is that this is a good thing.I have always fantasized about a sequel, in which Americans capture one of the flying saucers with a robot on board, and reverse engineer them until we have an army of robots and a fleet of flying saucers of our own, which we then use to destroy all those arrogant aliens and colonize their planets.

Alison Doody, while stunningly beautiful, is a dreadful actress that will really makes you miss Karen Allen. The grail part with the knight tends to get a little silly, like what is he going to do there now? The Kirkegaardian Leap Of Faith was well done and had great spiritual power even to non Christians. Now, the movie is non stop action and Ford with Connery is why the film is such a treasure. Indy changes visibly under his baneful stare; the chemistry between the two actors with the constant running Junior joke is great. They play so well off of each other. The movie has many great action set pieces like a fantastic motorcycle chase. He even meets Hitler and gets the Grail diary autographed. There are lots of little touches of levity all through the movie that lighten it. Raiders had a little levity but nothing on this level. Who will ever forget how they say goodbye in Germany? What happens to people without a ticket? I am not a Steven Spielberg fan but I adore this and the first one. Temple of Doom, which I waited in the hot sun for three hours, in a huge line, I am still trying to forget. The pacing of this movie is like lightning.From the opening with young Indy, the movie does not stop it is Go Go Go. I watch it over and over on Blu Ray. The interactions between them is so well done, often Ford just wilts when Connery looks over at him. This is the treat of this movie; please, you want to compare Capshaw with Indy in Temple Of Doom? How about Short Round? The designated Asian character so Stevie gets out of the racism charge for his dreadful portrayal of Asians? I am not a Christian but even as a theistic existentialist I found it moving and inspirational. Glover is a great villain you may remember him as Cristados the villain in the Bond film For Your Eyes Only. He is a very good actor. Denholm Elliot is great here there is a line where Indy tells the villains how Brody is this genius and they are done for. The next scene Brody is wandering around, lost, talking to Arabs in English. The writing is so funny, the action scenes including one with a giant tank are without equal.I waited in line to see this when it came out. When Temple Of Doom ended, people quietly got up and some angry mumbling was heard. This got applause as they ride triumphantly away. Whatever I may have against Steven, the man could make an exciting action movie without equal. The casting of Connery was such a stroke of genius. It will make you return to the movie over and over. I love when Indy shoots a bunch of Nazis and yells,DON'T CALL ME JUNIOR!!!! While it is funny, it never gets silly or campy, it gets deadly serious at the end. I Adore This Movie. What a Treasure!!

It is a roller-coaster ride of pure entertainment. I couldn't care less what means this or that movies were meant to entertain. Did it say Kubrick on the poster? No? Then just enjoy it for what it was meant to be. Quintessential entertainment, great action, acting and suspense. Even for the non religious, it will entertain you. It is a throwback to the old action pictures of the 40s. Ronald Lacey steals the movie with his creepy SS portrayal; who will ever forget,Fraulein, let me show you what I am used to. He is so creepy; he makes your skin crawl. Freeman is alright, a trifle annoying at times. The pacing of the movie is the real hidden treasure of this oft imitated but never equaled classic.

When you revisit the movie, it is still as stunningly entertaining as it was when it was released thirty four years ago.Young people, this was the first VHS released at fifteen dollars. VHS commonly sold at sixty or even eighty dollars a tape. There was a stampede for this movie at fifteen dollars a tape. It also was the first VHS released in Stereo sound. I know, no laughing, but when stereo players were first released, this was the first title available. It set all kinds of sales records for Paramount. I love the third one almost as much but Alison Doody is no Karen Allen. Also, as good as Last Crusade is, it just cannot equal this one in its legendary pacing. It moves so fast that you will not believe the movie is ending. I just refuse to buy Temple Of Doom to complete my trilogy. It is fifty floors down from the first and third. When I saw this movie, it was a sneak preview after that awful Spilsbury Lone Ranger. People stood up and cheered for the movie after it ended. Only JAWS, in 1975, got that kind of reaction along with STAR WARS in 1977. The movie is quite simply a legend. Remember, I am not a Steven Spielberg fan. I only own these two, JAWS and Schindler's List. Most of his movies, due to their obsession with children, are quite overrated. This movie is not; I still love it all these years later.
