There's a Hitchcockian element throughout, actually, and I could imagine the Hitchster putting together a film very much like this were he still going.  Most of the movie is steeped in paranoia, aided by interesting camera work and tight close-ups that capture Kurt Russell's totally convincing acting the part of a man whose life has suddenly fallen to pieces.  The many faces of paranoia (justified paranoia, as we soon discover) in the film include the red-herring kind as embodied by the 'characters' on display in a desert diner.  The air of intrigue and bad deeds, and conspiracy, is palpable in the two scenes set within the diner but, in the end, the diner's manager and patrons turn out to be benign. Well, maybe.  I've spent a fair bit of time poking around the Mojave Desert (by the way, one apparent biogeographical error is showing a Joshua tree in what I believe is supposed to be Arizona) and can attest that you'll see the darndest things out there.  That includes people.  So the desert setting really struck a chord with me, too.  Taken as a whole, the encounter with the diner's denizens and a run-in with the 'necks who soon turn out to be the bad guys may give the viewer a feeling of deja-vu for something along the lines of Deliverance, but the menace here is far more prosaic and firmly focused on the bottom line.Kurt Russell is perfectly cast as the Massachusetts yuppie traveling with his wife to a new life in San Diego.  His aspiring yuppie credentials are established by the bright red SUV with leather interior, his powder blue polo shirt, and paper cups of designer coffee.  This is a pretty insipid Kurt Russell character -- certainly a 'wimp' in comparison to the larger-than-life (and inevitably self-parodying) heroes that he played with such tongue-in-cheek bravado in films like the stellar Big Trouble In Little China and Escape From New York.  But that's where the key to the effectiveness of his character resides.  He's so totally unprepared for brutality and action that most of us watching -- most of whom would also soundly qualify as 'wimps' when measured against the fictional prowess of movie action heroes -- can identify all too well with the situation that he suddenly finds himself in.  He does the best that he can with what he has, and the fact is that he is not as adaptable and resourceful as McGyver and not even in the same league (and therefore more truthful) as any of the larger-than-life action heroes that've proliferated in such abundance since the original James Bond movies.  It's also what makes so much more triumphant his victories over the bad guys, who have a definite advantage over him in terms of numbers, firepower, experience, and ability to deal violence.  But old Kurt's Jeff character has outrage on his side, once he finds out what's happening.  Before long his polo shirt is dirty and he has transformed himself into a makeshift action hero who feels about as real-life an example of that category as we're likely to see in a fictional Hollywood movie.  And so it makes it all the sweeter when he kicks the main bad dude in the head, or gets one up on the mustachioed psychopath who thinks he has him totally cowed.  It's hard not to feel redeemed when the tide begins to turn in the favor of Kurt Russell's 'everyman.'  This kind of thing happens, too -- how would we fare under identical, wholly plausible, circumstances?The supporting cast in this film is excellent.  Kathleen Quinlan, the wife who's kidnapped, doesn't have all that much screen time but is effective in her interaction with Kurt Russell's Jeff Taylor.  MC Gainey is wonderfully despicable in his role as desert redneck Earl, a man who possesses no obvious redeeming qualities.  Jack Noseworthy is also chilling as the young bad guy, Billy.  It's JT Walsh, though (the somewhat unhinged sergeant-major in Good Morning, Vietnam), who -- along with Kurt Russell -- really carries this film forward.  He was an inspired casting decision, and his icy calm and absolute believability as he denied his obvious actions to both Jeff and to the local Sheriff are pure menace, totally understated in delivery but there in the movie's context.  And when he gets nasty...well, then he's even nastier.Beautiful setting, too.  There's something about the American Southwest that speaks -- to me, anyway -- of freedom and possibility (try riding a motorcycle around it one day!) and those elements are subtly woven into this story with both positive and negative connotations.Having spent more than a few years in Georgia, I've experienced first hand the unwelcome attentions of some of the more drugged-out or perhaps just plain psychotic drivers who push their trucks across the country and this movie also plays on the fear of anyone who's ever had a belligerent trucker threaten to squish 'em.

The air of intrigue and bad deeds, and conspiracy, is palpable in the two scenes set within the diner but, in the end, the diner's manager and patrons turn out to be benign. Well, maybe.  I've spent a fair bit of time poking around the Mojave Desert (by the way, one apparent biogeographical error is showing a Joshua tree in what I believe is supposed to be Arizona) and can attest that you'll see the darndest things out there.  That includes people.  So the desert setting really struck a chord with me, too.  Taken as a whole, the encounter with the diner's denizens and a run-in with the 'necks who soon turn out to be the bad guys may give the viewer a feeling of deja-vu for something along the lines of Deliverance, but the menace here is far more prosaic and firmly focused on the bottom line.Kurt Russell is perfectly cast as the Massachusetts yuppie traveling with his wife to a new life in San Diego.  His aspiring yuppie credentials are established by the bright red SUV with leather interior, his powder blue polo shirt, and paper cups of designer coffee.  This is a pretty insipid Kurt Russell character -- certainly a 'wimp' in comparison to the larger-than-life (and inevitably self-parodying) heroes that he played with such tongue-in-cheek bravado in films like the stellar Big Trouble In Little China and Escape From New York.  But that's where the key to the effectiveness of his character resides.  He's so totally unprepared for brutality and action that most of us watching -- most of whom would also soundly qualify as 'wimps' when measured against the fictional prowess of movie action heroes -- can identify all too well with the situation that he suddenly finds himself in.  He does the best that he can with what he has, and the fact is that he is not as adaptable and resourceful as McGyver and not even in the same league (and therefore more truthful) as any of the larger-than-life action heroes that've proliferated in such abundance since the original James Bond movies.  It's also what makes so much more triumphant his victories over the bad guys, who have a definite advantage over him in terms of numbers, firepower, experience, and ability to deal violence.  But old Kurt's Jeff character has outrage on his side, once he finds out what's happening.  Before long his polo shirt is dirty and he has transformed himself into a makeshift action hero who feels about as real-life an example of that category as we're likely to see in a fictional Hollywood movie.  And so it makes it all the sweeter when he kicks the main bad dude in the head, or gets one up on the mustachioed psychopath who thinks he has him totally cowed.  It's hard not to feel redeemed when the tide begins to turn in the favor of Kurt Russell's 'everyman.'  This kind of thing happens, too -- how would we fare under identical, wholly plausible, circumstances?The supporting cast in this film is excellent.  Kathleen Quinlan, the wife who's kidnapped, doesn't have all that much screen time but is effective in her interaction with Kurt Russell's Jeff Taylor.  MC Gainey is wonderfully despicable in his role as desert redneck Earl, a man who possesses no obvious redeeming qualities.  Jack Noseworthy is also chilling as the young bad guy, Billy.  It's JT Walsh, though (the somewhat unhinged sergeant-major in Good Morning, Vietnam), who -- along with Kurt Russell -- really carries this film forward.  He was an inspired casting decision, and his icy calm and absolute believability as he denied his obvious actions to both Jeff and to the local Sheriff are pure menace, totally understated in delivery but there in the movie's context.  And when he gets nasty...well, then he's even nastier.Beautiful setting, too.  There's something about the American Southwest that speaks -- to me, anyway -- of freedom and possibility (try riding a motorcycle around it one day!) and those elements are subtly woven into this story with both positive and negative connotations.Having spent more than a few years in Georgia, I've experienced first hand the unwelcome attentions of some of the more drugged-out or perhaps just plain psychotic drivers who push their trucks across the country and this movie also plays on the fear of anyone who's ever had a belligerent trucker threaten to squish 'em.  Disclaimer  I'm not some rabidly bigoted anti-trucker type...my father drove trucks for a long time, my favorite performer -- Elvis -- started out as a truck driver, and I bought the whole trucker and Convoy craze in the '70s and, indeed, love the Peckinpah movie of that particular song.  In real life, in the US, I've just had some unfortunate encounters with various defective members of that subculture.The renegade truck driver thing's been done before -- Steven Spielberg's freaky and excellent Duel in 1971 being a notable film -- but this film definitely stands alone as a uniquely effective whodunnit\/journey\/revenge movie.  Jonathon Mostow wrote and directed it and I give him full credit for creating a suspenseful masterpiece on only his third outing in those combined roles.  Unfortunately, he then went on to make U-571 on the strength of this movie's success.
