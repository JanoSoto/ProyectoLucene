Two guys happen upon a woman named Tampopo (Dandelion) trying to manage a run-down noodle shop and they decide to help her turn the place into an economic and gastronomic four-diamond establishment.  They succeed.  That's the plot.  The whole plot.But the film is fleshed out with episodes, usually unrelated to one another, some of them as amusing as anything ever put on the screen.  Every single sidesplitting one is played and directed in a straight-faced way.I'll give just one example.  A gangster and his beautiful moll are about to make love.  They kiss passionately.  The camera moves in for a closeup of their lips and we see that a raw egg is being slipped back and forth between mouths.  The couple progress to foreplay in the nude.  The foreplay consists of the man slapping a clear plastic pint of live shrimp upside down on his lover's belly.  The shrimp skitter around on her flesh and she titters and writhes with desire.  Later, alas, the young man is shot multiple times by rival mobsters.  He's sprawled on his back in the dirt, his white clothes soaked with blood.  She rushes to him and kneels beside him, weeping.  He goes into the cliche of the last dying words, barely able to gasp them out.  What does he tell her?  That he loves her?  That he regrets his disreputable life?  No -- he launches into an outrageously long story about hunting boars when he was a child.  The boars would eat nothing but yams, when the yams were ripe.

They became stuffed with yams and nothing but yams.  Then when they were hunted down, the boars yielded long strings of intestines that were packed with yams.  They were like yam sausages, you see.  I don't think I caught the tail end of his narrative because I was dissolved in laughter.The whole thing revolves around food in its various forms.  People rise from the dead to cook a final meal for their grieving families.  They prepare the most mouthwatering rice omelettes imaginable.  Proper young ladies learn how to eat noodles without making vulgar sounds.  They do all sorts of things with and about food.  Cuisine is to this movie what sex is to Italian comedies.Do not be put off by the fact that this movie has subtitles.  In poor movies subtitles are a distracting nuisance.  But in this case, you'll hardly notice them, hardly be able to read them through the laughter.

Grace sadly, and perhaps naively, awaits the return of her husband, who went off to fight. Currently Grace has no home help, but she doesn't have to worry for too long. One day three people knock on the door and offer to be her servants. Grace not only needs help for the garden and cleaning but also for her children, who are photosensitive, which essentially means they are allergic to light. Keeping the children away from all light, except for dim candle-light, is a hard job, and this has taken it's toll on poor Grace. But soon Grace will have something else to worry about.A weird noise here, a bizarre occurrence there. Strange things are happening in the house. Is it ghosts? Is it Grace's imagination? Or is she going mad? And do the three servants have anything to do with this, or are they innocent bystanders?When the credits started rolling, I didn't know what to make of this film. I had enjoyed it for the most part, but near the end I started to wonder whether the film really was as smart as it thought it was. I had heard the film contained a nice twist, and when I watched what I thought was supposed to be the twist I was greatly disappointed. But I was wrong, and the film had a little bit more to go. I enjoyed the twist, but I don't think it's of jaw-dropping quality. Which is quite like the whole movie, very understated. If you only like big action movies, this isn't for you. I enjoyed the slow pace of the film, and the score is very nice, along with the cinematography. I enjoyed all the performances, with the children being stand-outs, and Nicole Kidman as good as ever. One complaint is that I would have liked more scenes with Lydia.In the first half of the film there were several scenes, that while not boring, I thought weren't as amazing as the movie seemed to make of them. However, upon finding out of the twist I feel these scenes would have a bigger impact on me. So I certainly will be going back for a second viewing.I have seen the other film by writer\/director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los ojos, and enjoyed it greatly, and I look forward to seeing more films from him.Whether this is a good or great film doesn't really matter, have no doubt, this is a very fine film. I just didn't know how good it was. I couldn't decide whether to give it an 8 or 9. If I could, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10.

Instead of story, Landis fills the screen with gimmicky sequences that undermine the impact of the truly substantial ones that work.  Provided that the dialogue, which is really quite awful throughout the film, be reworked--the nightmarish home-invasion, the second visitation of the protagonist's savaged friend, the protagonist's transformation, the hilarious balloons-in-the-park and the haunted theater sequences are all keepers.  The rest of the script should be scrapped and replaced with a story that makes sense.Further, the film's lovers, David and Alex, are virtual strangers--not only to the audience, but to one another.  The audience needs to know who these people are and understand what motivates their love.  Given that Alex invests the most and is willing to put her life at risk, it is especially important that we be given some clue as to why she apparently comes to love David so much.  Reducing David's and Alex's relationship to what appears to be a casual affair while depicting acts of great devotion is confounding and seriously undermines the impact of the film's horror.  Also, the film's comedic element is introduced too early in Landis' version.  This should not occur until after the romantic element is well established.Landis' film is a B-movie, unconsciously presented as something more, but not in the tradition of the great, classic noirs of the 40s and 50s.  This film really is mediocre.Not withstanding, the film's makeup, for which it deservedly won its only Oscar, and some of its special effects are really quite excellent and continue to hold up against today's standards.  And though its effectiveness is somewhat undone by the film's shortcomings, the juxtaposition of real horror and comedy is stunningly imaginative.I give it a 5 out of 10 for creativeness and effort, and strongly recommend it to film lovers, as this is a potentially great film still waiting to happen and should not be allowed to languish as a cult classic, namely because it isn't, i.e., a classic.

All of this is easy to overlook, due to the overwhelming witticism and self-acknowledging irony cudgeling you brutally about the head right through the end.  I know, I know, many critics love the sensibility that in today's era, who says a movie has to be ABOUT something?  Fine.  A movie, like this one, does NOT need a purpose, or an objective, or consistency, or to be anything but clever.  Filmmakers delight in not giving viewers what they're expecting, and I'm all in favor of that.  But this movie is clever only insofar as the deeply uneducated can ever be.  If you're going to be purposeless, at least be informed - at least know what you're talking about.  This film seems to suffer from the misapprehension that if you're FUNNY you don't have to be RIGHT.  It isn't true.  Many people have commented on the sensitivity with which the handicapped characters are treated - commending the screenwriters for arguing that the mentally challenged have feelings too.  I would hope that in this day and age this isn't something we have to be told, and would argue that a large part of the reason this is common knowledge is due to GOOD films that deal with the mentally ill or handicapped (see Awakenings, or Rain Man.  Really.)  I would also argue that the handicapped people in Pumpkin are treated as carelessly and shamefully as any movie I've seen.  They are treated as set pieces, as an emotive device to hide the film's complete lack of awareness.  Argue that Pumpkin is never even diagnosed in order to challenge our system of classification and assignment.  Go on.  As near as I can tell, Pumpkin is not so much handicapped as he is overwhelmingly lazy.  His transformation by the end of the movie, while not complete- as the last shot signifies- is absurd to the point of obscenity.  That a handicapped young man could be wheelchair-bound and near-catatonic in the beginning and winning a marathon race and spouting aphorisms on the nature of pain by the end is an insult to the people who spend their lives trying to help challenged teens.  Obviously we're not supposed to like or dislike any of the characters - they're all flawed and human and satires of themselves, and in a movie this clever, that's expected.  This film had many tremendously clever scenes, dealing with the concepts of beauty, wealth, sororities, social charity, suicide, sex, and other popular targets, and these scenes are, indeed, laugh-out-loud funny.  So it's that much more unfortunate that the movie's makers chose to make a movie about something they so clearly do not understand.  As a straight social satire, ignoring the ENTIRE Pumpkin plotline, this could have been a great movie.  As it is, they've named the movie after and centered the film on its weakest plot point.  Are we supposed to believe that Carolyn has learned anything by the end?  She obviously knows no more about the handicapped, or Pumpkin's particular situation, in the end than she does at the beginning.  Are we to believe that her efforts, while misguided, are forgivable because they were well-intentioned?  They are not.  She hasn't thought about anything.  She brings a wheelchair-bound boy to the beach (ever try to push a wheelchair on sand?) to play volleyball and hopefully make a love connection with Carolyn's charity-case friend, somehow equating the loneliness of an overweight young woman surrounded by beautiful people with the biological short-circuitry that caused Pumpkin's situation, whatever that is.  But it's cool, because this isn't a movie about a character who learns anything, or who grows, or who does anything in particular of any note.  Christina Ricci attempted a similar character (one who is incapable of empathy or redemption) in The Opposite of Sex, and that's fine.  As a modern audience, we can appreciate that not everything is about anything.  But at least you can be accurate.  I hated The Other Sister for similar reasons that despite good intentions, the screenwriters insisted on having the handicapped characters wax philosophical about the nature of their disorders.  Happy or not, there is such a thing as a person who is incapable of overcoming the obstacles that have been put in their way.  But the way Pumpkin's writers treat the handicapped is just abusive.  I fear that some people who will see this movie will think that Pumpkin's transformation can happen in real life.  It can't, unless I was right, and he's just been malingering for his first sixteen years, enjoying the comfort that being considered a vegetable has afforded him.This movie is pure fantasy.  There is nothing of any value attached to the plot - all scenes with any humorous value have nothing to do with Pumpkin.  The car crash, the suicide attempt, the sorority recruiting scenes, are all as tongue-in-cheek funny as they can be.  But as much as the movie IS about anything, it's not about these scenes, which is regrettable.  I'm amazed that Roger Ebert, someone who is usually aware that being clever is not enough to make a good movie, gave this movie three and a half stars.  He originally claimed that he would only give movies zero stars if they were, not necessarily badly made, but actually damaging to the people who saw them.  This movie has nothing good to offer other than a few laughs, and has the potential to dramatically undermine people's ability to understand the handicapped.  People might actually think this movie's ideas are serious.  At least movies like Scary Movie or Very Bad Things are obviously satire, and leave others (What's Eating Gilbert Grape or Rain Man) to set the record straight.  I give this movie my most vehement zero stars, because it was bursting with intelligence and creativity and visual style, and it was all ruined because the writer wouldn't spend an afternoon at the library.

It's got everything a Hallmark feature should have -- plus profanity. A love story between a brilliant lower-class boy and a young girl at Harvard. (In the original Love Story it was more or less the other way around.) A tortured boy barely out of his teens who is a miscreant and unable to expose himself to others and who is not in touch with his feelings. (I've always wondered how you get in touch with your feelings.) Well, it's worked dozens of times before -- Blood Brothers, David and Lisa, inter alia. In this instance he's wary of others because he was abused as a child; cf., any of two or three dozen Lifetime Movies for Women. A very human but somewhat remote academic mentor, and a warm, humanistic, unpretentious bearded shrink, as in Ordinary People. A score that tells us when we're supposed to laugh and when we're supposed to tear up. Good, evocative location shooting in Boston. Is Will Hunting going to be able to overcome his fear of commitment, leave Beantown, and find himself emotionally and intellectually? (How do you find yourself?) We viewers want him so badly to choose the right path, which we can discern amidst the murky and myriad possibilities even if he can't, that we feel like we're watching someone trying to shove a boulder and we find ourselves sitting in our seats and humping along with him. Does he make the right choice? Does a bear hibernate in the winter?Well, I'm sorry. I kind of enjoyed the first half hour or so, when Will Hunting's genius is being finally and painfully uncovered. It was kind of confusing though, in a technical sense. Mathematics is one of those creative talents that appears at an early age, rather like genius in music. It tends to peter out in early adulthood. (If you haven't made it as a professional mathematician by the time you're twenty-five you're considered over the hill in academia.) In other words, mathematical genius has a life course of its own, almost, but not quite, independent of what is generally recognized as intelligence. But Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, not only has this isolated talent, but something that resembles a photographic memory as well. He's remembered practically everything he's ever read, which is practically everything ever written, from law to organic chem, although we never see him reading a book. If a kid in my working-class neighborhood ever was caught reading Nietzsche, he'd be twitted to death. Well, eidetic imagery (or photographic memory) really does exist. You can hold up an ordinary comb in front of a kid who has it, for a few seconds, then put the comb out of sight and the kid will be able to tell you the number of teeth in the comb, because the image in his mind is so clear that he can count them. But, like musical or mathematical genius, it shows up early, in young kids, then tends to fade. And again, it's independent of ordinary intelligence. For one individual, especially at the age of twenty-one, to have both singular geniuses at the same time, is so unlikely as to constitute an irritation for someone watching the flick. I mean, it's like drawing two straight flushes, one after the other. And then too, it makes me squirm when I watch a scene in which a shrink brings up the abuse his client suffered in childhood and then tells him over and over (and over), It's not your fault, until the client breaks into a cascade of fulsome sobs and the two of them hug one another like Esalen grads.

I can see why this project was greenlighted. It's got everything a Hallmark feature should have -- plus profanity. A love story between a brilliant lower-class boy and a young girl at Harvard.

A tortured boy barely out of his teens who is a miscreant and unable to expose himself to others and who is not in touch with his feelings. (I've always wondered how you get in touch with your feelings.) Well, it's worked dozens of times before -- Blood Brothers, David and Lisa, inter alia. In this instance he's wary of others because he was abused as a child; cf., any of two or three dozen Lifetime Movies for Women. A very human but somewhat remote academic mentor, and a warm, humanistic, unpretentious bearded shrink, as in Ordinary People. A score that tells us when we're supposed to laugh and when we're supposed to tear up. Good, evocative location shooting in Boston. Is Will Hunting going to be able to overcome his fear of commitment, leave Beantown, and find himself emotionally and intellectually? (How do you find yourself?) We viewers want him so badly to choose the right path, which we can discern amidst the murky and myriad possibilities even if he can't, that we feel like we're watching someone trying to shove a boulder and we find ourselves sitting in our seats and humping along with him. Does he make the right choice? Does a bear hibernate in the winter?Well, I'm sorry. I kind of enjoyed the first half hour or so, when Will Hunting's genius is being finally and painfully uncovered. It was kind of confusing though, in a technical sense. Mathematics is one of those creative talents that appears at an early age, rather like genius in music. It tends to peter out in early adulthood. (If you haven't made it as a professional mathematician by the time you're twenty-five you're considered over the hill in academia.) In other words, mathematical genius has a life course of its own, almost, but not quite, independent of what is generally recognized as intelligence. But Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, not only has this isolated talent, but something that resembles a photographic memory as well. He's remembered practically everything he's ever read, which is practically everything ever written, from law to organic chem, although we never see him reading a book. If a kid in my working-class neighborhood ever was caught reading Nietzsche, he'd be twitted to death. Well, eidetic imagery (or photographic memory) really does exist. You can hold up an ordinary comb in front of a kid who has it, for a few seconds, then put the comb out of sight and the kid will be able to tell you the number of teeth in the comb, because the image in his mind is so clear that he can count them. But, like musical or mathematical genius, it shows up early, in young kids, then tends to fade. And again, it's independent of ordinary intelligence. For one individual, especially at the age of twenty-one, to have both singular geniuses at the same time, is so unlikely as to constitute an irritation for someone watching the flick. I mean, it's like drawing two straight flushes, one after the other.

Bruce Wayne will never get his parents back, I will never get my 90 minutes back, and the scar left on the name of a groundbreaking piece of cinema will never heal.I'll forgo the instinctual impossibility that a shark would camouflage himself near a piece of driftwood to eat a person on a boat rather than just swim up and eat another fish.  I'll forgo the logistical impossibility that a shark fearing widow would flee her island home to ANOTHER ISLAND!  As I type this I just watched today's best NHL goaltender come out of his zone, drop his stick and let an open ice puck crawl right between his legs for a goal in the Stanley Cup finals.  So people make stupid mistakes in times of pressure, I'll forgive you Ms. Brody, just as I forgave Mr. Brodeur.

I'll even forgo the physical impossibility of surviving the bends.This ending, although cannot be forgiven by Jesus Christ himself. The last twenty minutes is just an unbelievable orgy of every irrational idea conceived by filmmakers.  There was a method behind Spielberg's exiting finale in 1975.  He said that by that point he has his audience. After taking them on this thrilling yet conceivable ride, that for just a few seconds they would suspend their beliefs and allow a great white to swim around chewing on an oxygen tank.  Well he was right.  Maybe the makers of Jaws The Revenge had a reverse plan...  maybe their plan was to constantly bombard you with inconceivable acts of stupidity and impossibility until you are rendered retarded from the whole ordeal so when they unleash a plethora of insanity at the climax you barely realize it.Can there be any other excuse for a shark to walk on its hind fins, roar, catch a man in his razor sharp mouth in slow motion, let him survive, get poked by a stick, and explode!?  Ok let us look at this systematically. A shark on its hind fins  Maybe they were trying to out-do the original scene where Bruce capsizes the Orca.  Well a shark lunging out of the water to surface onto an already half-sunken, half decaying boat is pretty amazing.  Let's do something really amazing!  Too much of a good thing, no wonder this is a sequal.  And what they can't improve on from the original, they just steal.  Just random scenes of the original thrown in the movie, as if to say Hey, she's saying the same thing her husband said while fighting a shark, what a great example of.. bullshit! it's pointless and only reminds me of what film I SHOULD be watching!  And she's not heroically surviving one last face to face battle with the predator armed with only a rifle.  She's on a huge boat with all her surviving friends and family about to poke the gravity defying fish that's wearing some flash cube.  Not exciting at all, it's pathetic! Two last comments before I finish...  why would they make the shark roar? I suppose the filmmakers knew they weren't gifted enough to make a giant hungry silent eating machine about to attack be scary, so they made it roar to add a scary sound effect.  You know in slasher movies when they just make a nail-on-chalkboards sound whenever the murderer pops out?  That kind of cheap garbage.  But they can't have someone just scream, or have a loud wave crashing sound.  No, it has to be this insanely thoughtless roar. Finally, the explosion.

That satirical gag is EXACTLY what this movie pulls, and wants you to seriously accept it!  Try to think about that fact logically for more than a minute and don't blame me when you regain consciousness.  To see something like this even referred to as a serious idea is inconceivable for even half a second!Well, as I finish this review, the Devils paid for their mistake and lost the game.  So that piled on all these horrible factors that equal Jaws The Revenge, i must retire before i simply throw my computer out the window. To conclude, I hate this movie, you should hate this movie.  And it is NOT healthy to imagine Spielberg making a sequel to save this franchise. It should have never been a franchise anyway.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"31 May 2003","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Simon is good at barbed exchanges, as in most of The Odd Couple. But he has a tendency to get serious sometimes and it rarely works, even when the serious ones have some occasional good one-liners in them. His drama tends to be dull, and his comedies funny, especially in domestic contexts and when they're dialog dependent.This is different from his other familiar works. He really lets go here, forgets all about serious undertones, meaningfulness, depth of relationships, domesticity, continuity -- everything except the comic effect. He's the Edgar Allan Poe of comedy here. He hasn't written such a funny script since After the Fox.The plot itself, after the broth is reduced, is simple enough. Truman Capote invites five of the world's most famous detectives to a weekend at his spooky country mansion, tells them a murder will be committed at midnight, and challenges them to solve it or lose their reputations.What follows is hilarious. Not just sharply funny exchanges but entire situations that are in themselves outrageous, so that the verbal elements are like icing on the cake. It's the kind of movie in which a line like, My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle while standing outside in Chinese footprints, makes an idiotic kind of sense. A movie in which a character can offer this as an explanation for his having been found in a gay bar I hate them queeries. Lots of dames go in those places anyway. I never kissed nobody. And I never done anything to a man that I wouldn't do with a woman. A movie in which two old ladies are about to fall asleep in bed when one of them sniffs and says, I smell gas. The second says I can't help it. I'm old. The first says, No, no. Not THAT kind of gas. The other kind. The kind that KILLS. And the second begins a reply with, Sometimes MY gas . . . . I could go on with these gags but why spoil it? And anyway there are sight gags and situational discombobulations that are just as funny but would take far too long to describe.Not all of the gags and situations are equally funny. (How could they be?) Nancy Walker plays a mute maid who's purpose in the movie eludes me. And some of the gags are silly rather than funny. But the weaknesses are minor and more than made up for by the movie's many virtues. Especially good is Peter Falk's Sam Diamond, who does an insane impression of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade. The actor played the same character in the later, less-successful The Cheap Detective. Simon even allows himself to play with the frame at the end. Falk and Eileen Brennan (my secretary and mistress) are driving away from the mansion and Brennan says, I guess this means we won't be seeing each other anymore, Sam. Falk Well, Angel, you can never tell. I'll be around. And if you need me, all you gotta do is whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you? Brennan Well, of course I know how to whistle, Sam. What a silly question. Everybody knows how to whistle -- Falk looks disgusted, turns away from her to stare into the camera, and says, Allright, alright. Forget it.

But he has a tendency to get serious sometimes and it rarely works, even when the serious ones have some occasional good one-liners in them. His drama tends to be dull, and his comedies funny, especially in domestic contexts and when they're dialog dependent.This is different from his other familiar works. He really lets go here, forgets all about serious undertones, meaningfulness, depth of relationships, domesticity, continuity -- everything except the comic effect. He's the Edgar Allan Poe of comedy here. He hasn't written such a funny script since After the Fox.The plot itself, after the broth is reduced, is simple enough. Truman Capote invites five of the world's most famous detectives to a weekend at his spooky country mansion, tells them a murder will be committed at midnight, and challenges them to solve it or lose their reputations.What follows is hilarious. Not just sharply funny exchanges but entire situations that are in themselves outrageous, so that the verbal elements are like icing on the cake. It's the kind of movie in which a line like, My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle while standing outside in Chinese footprints, makes an idiotic kind of sense. A movie in which a character can offer this as an explanation for his having been found in a gay bar I hate them queeries. Lots of dames go in those places anyway. I never kissed nobody. And I never done anything to a man that I wouldn't do with a woman. A movie in which two old ladies are about to fall asleep in bed when one of them sniffs and says, I smell gas. The second says I can't help it. I'm old. The first says, No, no. Not THAT kind of gas. The other kind. The kind that KILLS. And the second begins a reply with, Sometimes MY gas . . . . I could go on with these gags but why spoil it? And anyway there are sight gags and situational discombobulations that are just as funny but would take far too long to describe.Not all of the gags and situations are equally funny. (How could they be?) Nancy Walker plays a mute maid who's purpose in the movie eludes me. And some of the gags are silly rather than funny. But the weaknesses are minor and more than made up for by the movie's many virtues. Especially good is Peter Falk's Sam Diamond, who does an insane impression of Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade. The actor played the same character in the later, less-successful The Cheap Detective. Simon even allows himself to play with the frame at the end. Falk and Eileen Brennan (my secretary and mistress) are driving away from the mansion and Brennan says, I guess this means we won't be seeing each other anymore, Sam. Falk Well, Angel, you can never tell. I'll be around. And if you need me, all you gotta do is whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you? Brennan Well, of course I know how to whistle, Sam. What a silly question. Everybody knows how to whistle -- Falk looks disgusted, turns away from her to stare into the camera, and says, Allright, alright. Forget it.

Anderson's Boogie Nights, but what makes this film stick with its audience long after the credits roll is the strong sense of family. OK, they're a family that makes the Louds look like the Brady Bunch (obligatory '70s ref there), but they are a real family, with a father figure, a mother figure, a distracted daughter, a rebel son, and a ton of aunt, uncle, and cousin-figures that each bring their unique issues to the mix.This is a recipe for overload in any fictional medium, but particularly a movie, where tight is usually right. Any other director would have trimmed away Little Bill and Becky Barnett faster than a disco downbeat, but P.T. Anderson does a very rare and brave thing. He not only puts these characters in, but allows his camera and script to linger on each of them, way past the point of no return in anyone else's movie. But rather than boring you, the result here is a depth of detail and lived-in feeling that brings you aboard for the whole run. It's what makes P.T. Anderson a great director. Yet it may also render him incapable of making a great movie. Discipline is not his strength.Boogie Nights is close, though. It's a very good film, a high 8 in my book, and a movie I can get lost in over and over again. Maybe it's because I came of age in the late 1970s, and see it recaptured here in a way it has never otherwise been, in all its confused, giddy, over-the-top glory. The pace of the first half of the film is languid and measured, never rushed, yet as a whole it chugs along with an assurance that makes it hard to accept the filmmaker was only making his second major picture.People talk about the opening scene, and it's very good, but there's other highlights. The pool party at Jack's, for example, is a marvel of storytelling economy, moving through several episodes without ever feeling like any are being shortchanged. We get an earful of Reed and Eddie's first meeting, awkward pauses and all, then get introduced to the Colonel and his coke-happy date, to Scotty Jay and his crush on Eddie, then Eddie rechristening himself (in a hot tub no less, how SoCal) Dirk Diggler. All that plot is thrown at us, but the biggest takeaway for us is a sense of the characters, because P.T. Anderson is the kind of director who makes character-driven films first.There's a lot of great detail on the porn industry subculture that feels very real and lived in, and the humor is outrageous at times (Dirk's audition with Amber, Scotty Jay's obvious gawkiness around his dream boy, Buck's image issues) without ever feeling pushed or artificial. You get a lot of depth here, the kind that rewards repeat viewings.The second half of the film loses me a little. I understand the story changes with the new decade, but it suddenly becomes so oppressively dire that the viewer, once swept into the story, has to pull away from misery overload. It's hard to pick a single excessive moment, maybe its just the way all of them come together to create a perfect storm of melodrama.That said, the Raheed Jackson sequence is the standout of the movie; a brilliant way of wrapping up Dirk's odyssey and bringing us back home. The suspense build up is incredible, and it's the one time that the film's main co-star, its soundtrack, is allowed center stage, transforming banal pop smashes like Jessie's Girl and Sister Christian into something operatic, even anthemic. We know Dirk's going nuts because the guitar break in Jessie's Girl tells us so.P.T. Anderson is a director I will always watch, but he does let his characters' emotions carry him away (more in Magnolia than here, but here, too). It's a tribute to his underlying genius that even at his most baroque, he manages to draw you into his world and hold you there like nobody else in the business. He's the kind of talent that will only improve with time, and it will be a pleasure keeping tabs on his development.
