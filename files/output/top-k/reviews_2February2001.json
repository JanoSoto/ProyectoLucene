The good people of the Magic Kingdom have been in a rut for a little while in my opinion. They've managed to make some the most classic and well loved stories into sugar-coated, campy musicals (who ever heard of singing gargoyles). Now these all work well for little kids, but I was ready for a movie that would stand out in some way, and I found that with Dinosaur.For one thing, the visuals are astounding. You could turn the t.v. on mute and still enjoy it. Some of the scenes, especially at the beginning, literally take your breath away. The viewer experiences a myriad of locations from the lush rainforests to sand dunes to caves and back again. The amazing thing is that all of the backgrounds are real.For another thing the story is great. Don't go in expecting an incredibly deep movie with sharp dialogue. These are dinosaurs. Their brains aren't that big. They can't use large words. Nevertheless, the story is compelling, and for once I actually felt some emotion with a Disney movie. You really pity the old Dinosaurs who can't keep up (one of whom is voiced by Della Reese, which made me incredibly happy). You really feel the love of the lemur family and you really feel the fear of a carnotaur attacking you. The plot may not by sophisticated, but there is substance.And for a third thing the music meshes perfectly with the rest of the film. The composers expertly use different world music combined with a dramatic orchestral score to provide a very dinosaur-esque soundtrack. It's really beautiful.This movie isn't for the faint of heart, but I think a mature audience will really enjoy it.

And i´m not saying this because it lacked action scenes and flashy special effects, as i´m definitely not that kind of person. I´m saying LOST SOULS is boring, because this movie must have one of the most predictable and uninteresting scripts ever to appear in recent years. I couldn´t believed how predictable this story was, there was nothing in this movie that wasn´t done before in much better horror stories.From the exorcism scenes, the little creepy girl, and the prophecy banal plot to the (wow what a surprise !), pentacle under the bed and final black mass where all the relatives and friends are involved, (oh, wow, i wasn´t expecting that at all, what an amazing twist !), this story is so devoid of surprises or original concepts that becomes incredible boring to endure.I tried very hard to like this movie as it had a promising beginning, and a good photography, but with such a weak plot how could anything else save what was left ? And for an horror movie it wasn´t scary. I mean this must have been the most relaxing horror or supernatural movie i ever saw such was the lack of creepy atmosphere. All because of its predectibility. And what gets realy annoying is the fact, that someone must have noticed this script wasn´t scary at all and so to scare the audiences instead of pure atmosphere they decided to make us jump on the chair by using the usual LOUD noise in a silent moment. What movie is this ?! A teenage horror(yeah right) slasher movie ?!!! Where are the naked babes ?...It´s this ambiguity that ruins LOST SOULS, it´s not interesting for true classic horror fans, but at the same time it´s not your usual commercial hollywood horror crap, so what´s the target audience here ? I don´t have anything against a story that mixed THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN and ROSEMARY´S BABY all together, it´s not because of this i disliked the movie, it´s because the ingredients are all there but we have no cake. Somewhere along the way someone didn´t knew how to mix them in a trully scary way, ruining a movie that could have been great, but it wasn´t and it sure was the script´s fault. I think it´s unfair to blame the director for with a weak script like this, how could anyone had done any better ?... It´s almost painful to feel the director trying to create a creepy atmosphere, but each time he´s almost succeeding in doing that, here comes that predictable script again. And i sure don´t think the film had a bad ending, as i can´t stand those happy hollywood endings when they are placed in the movies just to please the american test audiences. For a story like this LOST SOULS had a great ending. At least it was a logical one and it wasn´t condescendet to people who only like boy-keeps-girl endings. Probably the best thing in the entire movie. A story like this deserved a grey ending like the one it got. Not a dark one, after all the good guys won. So what´s realy wrong with LOST SOULS...the script wich could have made us think about its theme and religion in general, but instead just makes us think what a wasted opportunity this movie was. Anyway it could be worse, it could have been filled with computer effects and had a happy ending.Oh, and if you still want to see this movie, stay away from its promo-trailler, because it´s another of those which reveal the whole plot, even reveal the bad-guy and give away the only thing that could even pass for unexpected  in this mess of a story. Fortunately i saw it afterwards, or else this would have been a truly unbearable experience. And there are still people commenting in IMDB who still speak of a great final twist ?! I must have seen a different movie.Overall, wait for the DVD instead, for i´m sure it will be filled with removed scenes, as there are plenty of sequences appearing in promos, that aren´t even in the final cut of the movie.

It is a corny comedy, which ruins the genre of Superman. But I can also understand why some people would like it. Considering it was made five years after the original blockbuster, it was never going live up to the same sort of expectation. As a movie critic who cringes at some scenes in Superman III, I can also take away something from this mediocre sequel.Superman III follows Clark Kent as he ventures back to his hometown of Smallville, to attend his high school reunion and meet up with high school sweetheart, Lana Lang. Meanwhile, billionaire businessman, Ross Webster, wants to be that little bit richer and asks for the assistance of computer genius, Gus Gorman. But to ruin the plans of Webster is Superman! So Gorman is asked to kill Superman with kryptonite. Yet the kryptonite Superman is given does not kill him, instead turns him into an evil mean creature. It's Superman fighting himself, Good verus Evil. Can Superman save himself and the world in time?The only real shining light amongst the cast again is Christopher Reeve. He is amazing. In this Superman, not only is he Superman and Clark Kent, yet he has the diverse role of being the not so super Superman. This really is the highlight of a dull shot at a third film in the Superman series. Scenes such as Superman straitening the leaning tower of Pisa and blowing out the flame to the Olympic opening ceremony were different to see from Reeve, yet he portrays this role like only he can. But the best scene in this one by far would have to be when Superman fights himself at the Car Junkyard. This scene is compelling, filled with tension and acted brilliantly by Reeve. I must say I did enjoy the direction the film took in letting us see the homeboy side of Clark Kent. Being involved at his high school reunion and the way he involved himself with his best friend, Lana Lang.The other cast members that deserve a mention include Richard Pryor, who played the role of computer genius, Gus Gorman. It might not have been the funniest role he has done, but he was ok as the middleman in the evil money making scheme. The world has been robbed to not see the true talents of Richard Pryor. Unfortunately, Richard developed M.S. (Multiple Sclerosis) and in the last ten years or so he hasn't been on the big screen. The other role that deserves a mention here is that of Anne O'Toole. She was very attractive and portrayed the role of Lana Lang, just nicely.But there are some bad characters in this film. Firstly that of Ross Webster, played by Robert Vaughan was not that great. Neither was that of his Sister (Anne Ross) or his personal assistant (Pamela Stephenson). There is a gap in the cast and I can explain why there is. Firstly, Margot Kidder might as well have not been scripted in this movie. She only appears in two scenes, which hold virtually no importance to the make-up of the film. Plus without Lex Luthor, the evil side of the film does suffer. Gene Hackman was brilliant in Superman I and II and could have helped bring this film up to scratch. Some of the special effects in this film were ok. Scenes like at the acid plant were pretty good. I love it when the area is in a cloud of fire and to help put out the fire, Superman just flies off to a near by lake, freezes it up and lifts a huge iceberg. This was excellent to watch. The other memorable scene with special effects would have to be at the end with the computer, it wasn't bad. I won't give it away, but trust me if you like this film you will enjoy the end.In summary, I have read the book to Superman III. It was better to read than it was too watch on screen. But at the time of it's release, this movie would have had created quite a commotion. But without brilliant director, Richard Donner, it was never going to be as good as the previous Superman films. I don't know whether to say I hate it or like, because I can flick this movie on and get involved in what it is on about. But it is nowhere near the quality and greatness that you would expect the Superman legend deserves. I must agree with the general consensus, that this film could have been much better.Rating 3 out of 5 Stars or 6\/10.

As a movie critic who cringes at some scenes in Superman III, I can also take away something from this mediocre sequel.Superman III follows Clark Kent as he ventures back to his hometown of Smallville, to attend his high school reunion and meet up with high school sweetheart, Lana Lang. Meanwhile, billionaire businessman, Ross Webster, wants to be that little bit richer and asks for the assistance of computer genius, Gus Gorman. But to ruin the plans of Webster is Superman! So Gorman is asked to kill Superman with kryptonite. Yet the kryptonite Superman is given does not kill him, instead turns him into an evil mean creature. It's Superman fighting himself, Good verus Evil. Can Superman save himself and the world in time?The only real shining light amongst the cast again is Christopher Reeve. He is amazing. In this Superman, not only is he Superman and Clark Kent, yet he has the diverse role of being the not so super Superman. This really is the highlight of a dull shot at a third film in the Superman series. Scenes such as Superman straitening the leaning tower of Pisa and blowing out the flame to the Olympic opening ceremony were different to see from Reeve, yet he portrays this role like only he can. But the best scene in this one by far would have to be when Superman fights himself at the Car Junkyard. This scene is compelling, filled with tension and acted brilliantly by Reeve. I must say I did enjoy the direction the film took in letting us see the homeboy side of Clark Kent. Being involved at his high school reunion and the way he involved himself with his best friend, Lana Lang.The other cast members that deserve a mention include Richard Pryor, who played the role of computer genius, Gus Gorman. It might not have been the funniest role he has done, but he was ok as the middleman in the evil money making scheme. The world has been robbed to not see the true talents of Richard Pryor. Unfortunately, Richard developed M.S. (Multiple Sclerosis) and in the last ten years or so he hasn't been on the big screen. The other role that deserves a mention here is that of Anne O'Toole. She was very attractive and portrayed the role of Lana Lang, just nicely.But there are some bad characters in this film. Firstly that of Ross Webster, played by Robert Vaughan was not that great. Neither was that of his Sister (Anne Ross) or his personal assistant (Pamela Stephenson). There is a gap in the cast and I can explain why there is. Firstly, Margot Kidder might as well have not been scripted in this movie. She only appears in two scenes, which hold virtually no importance to the make-up of the film. Plus without Lex Luthor, the evil side of the film does suffer. Gene Hackman was brilliant in Superman I and II and could have helped bring this film up to scratch. Some of the special effects in this film were ok. Scenes like at the acid plant were pretty good. I love it when the area is in a cloud of fire and to help put out the fire, Superman just flies off to a near by lake, freezes it up and lifts a huge iceberg. This was excellent to watch. The other memorable scene with special effects would have to be at the end with the computer, it wasn't bad. I won't give it away, but trust me if you like this film you will enjoy the end.In summary, I have read the book to Superman III. It was better to read than it was too watch on screen. But at the time of it's release, this movie would have had created quite a commotion. But without brilliant director, Richard Donner, it was never going to be as good as the previous Superman films. I don't know whether to say I hate it or like, because I can flick this movie on and get involved in what it is on about. But it is nowhere near the quality and greatness that you would expect the Superman legend deserves. I must agree with the general consensus, that this film could have been much better.Rating 3 out of 5 Stars or 6\/10.

One may have been able to place it in a favorable light next to such uniquely honest films as, say The Last Exit to Brooklyn, The Electric Horseman and The Magic Christian. But Howard of course is no where near these other, more earnest fellows.

So, eventually, I saw the movie.  My lowest expectations couldn't have prepared me for the shock of this movie.As the story goes, in the sixth grade there once was a shy boy whom nobody liked, but he had a few secret crushes.  On the Valentines Day dance, he decides to confess his feelings and ask the girls to dance.  One by one, they turn him down, rather harshly I thought.  Then he comes to the last one, and she feels that he is 'the best she can do', so she decides to have a small romantic interlude with him (I was wondering if it was legal to make these sixth graders kiss for a horror movie).  They get caught, and she doesn't want to face the humiliation of kissing the most unpopular boy in school, so she denies it.  This, in turn, causes his life to go down the drain, going from Reform School, to Juvenile Hall, to an Insane Asylum.  Naturally, that made him a little mad.  So, he decides to brutally kill all of the girls that turned him down so many years ago.The mask he uses, which is supposed to be a Cupid, has no real significance to the plot.

I read all of them before I saw the movies that based themselves on the books with the exception of Hannibal for obvious reasons. And I will immediately say this.  I love Silence of the Lambs both the book and the movie.  Take away the incredible performances in the film, and it would still have a great plot and be a decent or even good adaptation. But the performances were excellent and it was a GREAT movie.  I tell you this to prove that reading the book first does not create bias.  If the adaptation on film is good, I will like it.  Manhunter is perhaps the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen.  It takes the story in the Red Dragon which is a psychological rollercoaster both in Will Graham's mind and the Killers mind and destroys it.  What we have with Manhunter, is a quite obviously Miami Vice influenced action movie that we would see late night on Cinemax.  Will Graham flipping Freddy Lounds onto the hood of a car breaking the windshield...i rest my case..I need not point to the boring generic shootout ending where the killer imitates Rambo before his unexciting demise.  Why do I say this movie is bad?  Not because the book was better, which it was...but because it totally left out everything that made the book great.  The book was named the Red Dragon...and now I know why they didnt just name the Movie that....maybe because the killer's obsession with the Red Dragon, one of the most interesting and important parts of the book (his immediate motive even) was no where to be found in this week Cop drama. Also, there was no backround on why he became such an insane, confused, troubled person...the book clearly explains his insane grandmother who threatened him with castration, and most importantly how uncomfortable he was with himself...his appearence, his speech...he wanted to belong...he wanted to be accepted...it was through this character of the Red Dragon that he got strenght to commit these crimes...to show everyone that he was someone...the killer in this movie hardly existed...he was totally unimportant...Also..the novel showed how Will Graham also had troubles in his life...his wife's trouble with him going back to work on the case...his step son from Molly's past husband who died(which doesnt exist in this movie...its his son) and their relationship, and most importantly the thoughts of these mad men becoming an obsession to him, filling his head to make him seem even psychotic at times....  The ending of the movie was so horrible I nearly got nautious....the book had an exciting twist filled ending...the movie had a horrible shoot em up action movie ending...suprised i didn't mention Lector yet? that's because the story hardly involves him...that is also the case in the novel...however, Lecter's involvment is so much more valuable, psychological, and disturbing in the book..and totally unecessary in this movie...I give this movie a 2 out of 10...and I am being generous The only reason it scored that high is because it kept my interest the whole time because i felt i was about to be pleasantly suprised with a great sequence or two, maybe a great ending.  Boy was i wrong... this was a huge disappointment and I would love to see it redone with good actors, a good screen play, and at least a clue about the dynamics of the great novel.  I did not dislike the movie because no film can live up to the book. Thats not true (Green Mile, Shawshank redemption, Silence of the Lambs, all equal to their written couterparts in my opinion)I simply did not like this because it was a horrible movie. As far as I am concerned...this could have been a half hour or hour long episode of Miami Vice.
