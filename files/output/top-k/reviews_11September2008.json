Doing this has seen me change my opinion on a film because I realise that I am speaking from accepted wisdom &#150; not firsthand experience. I could not remember Cinema Paradiso and maybe I have never seen it but just remember the bits I remember from the fact that everyone has seen them, whether they have seen the film or not. However, whether watching it or re-watching it, I found myself instantly caught up in the energy and colours of the film as we jump back to the boy Toto starting his father\/son friendship with Alfredo and his love of the cinema. This part of the film is hard not to love as it is funny and full of life &#150; I hate to use national stereotypes but, let's be honest, it is very Italian (in a good way).That this works is important because, to make the second, teenage, phase of the film work, the audience needs to share the passion of the characters and to care about them, so it is key that we are won over. Whenever the film enters into the teenage and adult stages of the story, I will say that the gear change is slightly jarring, even in the three hour director's cut that I was fortunate enough to be able to watch. It is here that the film gets more serious but, despite my initial concerns when the change comes, it doesn't do anything different in terms of quality because it stays high. What it does do is build on the warmth we already feel for Toto and those in his life by bringing in the challenges and changes that teenage life brings. Not even a slightly weak turn from Leonardi can hurt it as it moves forward. The look at the formative years comes full circle with the adult phase to the film as we get to look back and understand things with the 2020 of hindsight and it is responsible and moving. The final gift from Alfredo is memorable and moving and is one of those scenes that everyone knows, even if they haven't seen the film! What helps make this film work for film fans is obviously that the device that serves as the base for this tale of development and growth happens to be cinema (although it could easily have been anything). The sense of nostalgia in regards the magic of the cinematic experience is something that will unsurprisingly appeal to many people who still use IMDb despite being in their thirties and at a point where they should probably be spending their time doing something better. I loved the way the film captured this as a specific but also the way it used it within the story to make sure we can relate and understand the importance of it. In regards the media of cinema, I will repeat others by saying what a great job as director Tornatore did. The film has plenty of great shots but also the warmth you feel as a viewer is also somehow visually there as well &#150; I cannot describe it but I loved the way the film looked.The cast make it and, although he is technically a supporting character, Noiret is large over the film with a great performance of warmth and wisdom. OK he is slightly idealised in terms of the film, but it is carried by the general sense of warmth and nostalgia and thus forgivable. He works particularly well with Cascio, who is cute and funny enough to avoid falling into a condition I like to call Culkinism &#150; which is the state where a child actor pushes for cuteness and loses naturalism and gains a saccharine precociousness instead. Cascio is really well directed in the film and he is an engaging and lively child. Leonardi is not as good but in fairness he has the hardest job of the three actors and he manages to make it work; perhaps what I took as stiffness was just part of him being a teenager &#150; not the best stage in life for confidence and flowing naturalism! Perrin is a solid presence to draw the film to a close and he is helped by the level of engagement we have in his character by the time we properly reached his parts. The support cast provide a lot of the comedy and have too many great characters to mention and, although they are often broadly painted, this again fits the tone of the film.Cinema Paradiso is one of those films that you are supposed to have seen because it is a classic and frequently makes people's best of lists, however this is not necessarily a guarantee that you will enjoy the film or see what others see &#150; sometimes films have just managed to get reputations they do not really deserve. In this case though it is very much deserved as the film is a warm and moving joy; delivered in a typically Italian fashion it is as cheerful as it is cheering and I find it hard to imagine that some would think this was not a great film.

Sinbad, accompanied by Kassim's beautiful sister Princess Farah, as well as the Prince himself in his monkey form, sets sail in search of a cure. This being a Ray Harryhausen film, much of the plot involves the heroes struggling against various monsters, all animated by the stop-motion process which Harryhausen pioneered. This must be the only film in which the hero gets to fight a gigantic killer walrus. The title Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger may refer to the fact that, having seen off the walrus, Sinbad then has to battle a sabre-toothed tiger, although I am not sure how the eye part fits in.This was the third and last of Harryhausen's films about the legendary hero Sinbad the Sailor, the others being The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. It was not, however, Harryhausen's final film; that was to be Clash of the Titans from four years later. In the fifties and early sixties his techniques of film-making (which he named Dynamation or Dynarama), combining stop-motion animation with live action, seemed something new and exciting, opening up new possibilities for fantasy films. By the late seventies they were starting to look old-fashioned; there is little in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (which came out in the same year as Star Wars) to distinguish it from The Seventh Voyage which had come out nearly twenty years earlier.Today, of course, films made using the Dynamation process have a very retro feel to them, but I have long had a soft spot for Harryhausen's work ever since I was taken, as a child, to see a double bill of The Seventh Voyage and Jason and the Argonauts as part of a friend's birthday treat. I would not rate Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger quite as highly as either of those films. The acting is variable; neither Patrick Wayne as the hero nor Taryn Power has the talent or the charisma of their famous fathers, but Margaret Whiting as Zenobia makes a splendidly over-the-top villainess, former Doctor Who Patrick Troughton is good as the wise old philosopher Melanthius and Jane Seymour as Farah looks as lovely as ever. With its fairy-tale Arabian Nights atmosphere, this film can perhaps best be described as the cinematic equivalent of a pantomime, and like most pantomimes serves as very enjoyable family entertainment. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Prince Kassim, the young heir to the throne of Baghdad, is magically transformed into a baboon by his evil stepmother, the witch Zenobia, who wants the throne for her own son, Kassim's half-brother Rafi.

No, neither film can really be considered a great film, but great movies? Hell, yes! The difference between the two is the difference between a great novel and a great comic book. Great films really move one to think more deeply about life, whereas a great movie does that a bit, perhaps, but more often simply greatly entertains, and is well made. Both versions of Godzilla easily qualify on that score, and both films, with their anti-atomic messages, and unflinching look at destruction, are better films than the original King Kong, which is still a great movie itself. What raises Godzilla, and especially Gojira, above King Kong, despite the rubber suited monster which is scoffed at by stop motion action enthusiasts, is that the Japanese monster tale still has resonance today, and can be seen as an allegory, whereas King Kong is essentially just a ripping good yarn. In short, King Kong is more akin to Paul Bunyan while Godzilla is more like the Olympian or Norse gods.Yes, Godzilla owes a great debt to King Kong, whose re-release in 1952 was a box office smash, far greater than its original release in 1933, but it even owes more to the box office success to The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (based upon Ray Bradbury's short story The Fog Horn)- which was a 1953 box office hit, just a year before Gojira was made and became one of the most expensive Japanese films made to that date. Yet, Godzilla had a political resonance and emotional depth, especially in its human characterizations, that both King Kong and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms lacked. Kong was basically a victim and the Beast was just a hungry lizard, incidentally called a Rhedosaurus. Godzilla was a byproduct of the atomic age, even if, cleverly, Honda covered his ass by never explicitly showing this to be true. This posit of the beast's origins is all from a modern human perspective, for we know that Godzilla, like Kong, is a small island's legendary native god. In Godzilla the island is Odo, in King Kong it's Skull Island. The Beast, on the other hand, is explicitly shown as being created by an atomic blast, just as other creatures in 1950s films were, even if that's merely an excuse for it to just go hunting. Godzilla's motives are never made clear. It does not seem to be seeking food, so is it nature's revenge on humanity, or a cosmic random bit of fury? Yes, both films have manifest flaws. There are logical gaps in the plots of both why, for example, do the Japanese only seek to protect Tokyo? How do they know the beast won't rampage across the country, or go to Korea? The building of the electric fence to defend the city is nonsensical, and occurs with a rapidity that, even assuming politicians agreed on a plan of civil action, simply could not be done in a few days- especially if this Tokyo was the same one that Shimura's character from Ikiru worked for as a bureaucrat. Also, Godzilla seems to often change shape, size and appearance, within seconds- although this can be dismissed more easily in the more oneiric American version, and there are visible wires on the missiles and airplanes; but both films, especially in Gojira, more than make up for such lapses and shortcomings with the passion and, yes, vision, of the works. The monster in both films is indiscriminate carnage, yet there is the shot, just before Serizawa kills them both, when we see Godzilla peacefully napping in the sea, almost yawning, and we realize that the carnage wrought is not retribution nor evil. It just is, and it will be either it or us, humanity, that survives, for we've seen the bodies in hospitals, the burn victims, the radiation poisoning. It can be no other way. And, unlike most other monster films, the heroes in these films, especially Gojira (where the true lead character seems to shift throughout the film, almost like Godzilla's size and appearance), are fallible little mortals whose heroism comes from their choices, not their strength nor super abilities.And this is what humanizes these monster movies, not films, and makes them affect a viewer willing to suspend their disbelief. After all, is a giant, rampaging atomic reptile really any more unbelievable than a huge ape who lusts for a woman a twentieth its size, bloodsucking vampires, aliens who grow out of pods, or have acid for blood? I think not. No, neither Gojira, nor Godzilla, King Of The Monsters, is a great film. So what? They are great movies- a thing that is a rarity enough, and amongst the four or five best monster movies ever made. This DVD set should finally debunk claims to the contrary and let Godzillaphiles come out of the closet and proudly proclaim themselves what they are. I am one; long live the roar!

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 September 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" After watching both films, with and without the commentaries, I have to say that my appreciation for the original film, directed by Ishirô Honda, and written by Honda and Shigeru Kayama, as well as the American version, often derided as a bastardization, only grew. No, neither film can really be considered a great film, but great movies? Hell, yes! The difference between the two is the difference between a great novel and a great comic book. Great films really move one to think more deeply about life, whereas a great movie does that a bit, perhaps, but more often simply greatly entertains, and is well made. Both versions of Godzilla easily qualify on that score, and both films, with their anti-atomic messages, and unflinching look at destruction, are better films than the original King Kong, which is still a great movie itself. What raises Godzilla, and especially Gojira, above King Kong, despite the rubber suited monster which is scoffed at by stop motion action enthusiasts, is that the Japanese monster tale still has resonance today, and can be seen as an allegory, whereas King Kong is essentially just a ripping good yarn. In short, King Kong is more akin to Paul Bunyan while Godzilla is more like the Olympian or Norse gods.Yes, Godzilla owes a great debt to King Kong, whose re-release in 1952 was a box office smash, far greater than its original release in 1933, but it even owes more to the box office success to The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (based upon Ray Bradbury's short story The Fog Horn)- which was a 1953 box office hit, just a year before Gojira was made and became one of the most expensive Japanese films made to that date. Yet, Godzilla had a political resonance and emotional depth, especially in its human characterizations, that both King Kong and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms lacked. Kong was basically a victim and the Beast was just a hungry lizard, incidentally called a Rhedosaurus. Godzilla was a byproduct of the atomic age, even if, cleverly, Honda covered his ass by never explicitly showing this to be true. This posit of the beast's origins is all from a modern human perspective, for we know that Godzilla, like Kong, is a small island's legendary native god. In Godzilla the island is Odo, in King Kong it's Skull Island. The Beast, on the other hand, is explicitly shown as being created by an atomic blast, just as other creatures in 1950s films were, even if that's merely an excuse for it to just go hunting. Godzilla's motives are never made clear. It does not seem to be seeking food, so is it nature's revenge on humanity, or a cosmic random bit of fury? Yes, both films have manifest flaws. There are logical gaps in the plots of both why, for example, do the Japanese only seek to protect Tokyo? How do they know the beast won't rampage across the country, or go to Korea? The building of the electric fence to defend the city is nonsensical, and occurs with a rapidity that, even assuming politicians agreed on a plan of civil action, simply could not be done in a few days- especially if this Tokyo was the same one that Shimura's character from Ikiru worked for as a bureaucrat. Also, Godzilla seems to often change shape, size and appearance, within seconds- although this can be dismissed more easily in the more oneiric American version, and there are visible wires on the missiles and airplanes; but both films, especially in Gojira, more than make up for such lapses and shortcomings with the passion and, yes, vision, of the works. The monster in both films is indiscriminate carnage, yet there is the shot, just before Serizawa kills them both, when we see Godzilla peacefully napping in the sea, almost yawning, and we realize that the carnage wrought is not retribution nor evil. It just is, and it will be either it or us, humanity, that survives, for we've seen the bodies in hospitals, the burn victims, the radiation poisoning. It can be no other way. And, unlike most other monster films, the heroes in these films, especially Gojira (where the true lead character seems to shift throughout the film, almost like Godzilla's size and appearance), are fallible little mortals whose heroism comes from their choices, not their strength nor super abilities.And this is what humanizes these monster movies, not films, and makes them affect a viewer willing to suspend their disbelief.

Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic, and that is what makes Valentine the best. As the first basic and iconic element, the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth.

In fact, somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted. Just because the story line and the direction is very weak, we are not as satisfied as we deserved.

Filmed on a shoe string between his larger budgeted remakes of Ocean's 11 and Solaris, this film was almost universally panned by critics. No, it's not one of the greatest films ever made, but it's certainly not as bad a film as panned, nor a bad film at all.This film revolves around the lives of some low level movie types who are all invited to a party for a film producer who ends up dead in his motel room due to his kinky perversions. There's a married couple, Lee and Carl (Catherine Keener and David Hyde Pierce), on the rocks- he's a depressed screenwriter who's just been canned and she's an adulteress who's getting banged by the star of the film Carl wrote. That star, Calvin (Blair Underwood), is having problems both in his real and reel lives. Calvin with juggling his many lovers, including Lee, and his character Nicholas, from the film in the film called Rendezvous, who struggles through life as an actor, until he gets a break in a Brad Pitt cop film (which is a film in the film in the film) directed by real life director David Fincher. Soderbergh, himself, also appears X-ed out as himself. In the mere film in the film, Rendezvous, Nicholas is being interviewed and pursued by Catherine, who is played by Francesca in the actual film (Julia Roberts in real life). Francesca and Calvin end up at the party for Gus the producer, along with Lee and her sister Linda (Mary McCormack), the hotel masseuse who earlier in the day gave Gus (David Duchovny) a blowjob for $500. Having felt guilty over her prostitution- as well as stealing an extra $500 from Gus- it is Linda who discovers the body&#133;. Yet, one can only help but admire Soderbergh's willingness to adeptly go back and forth between the mainstream and his indie roots, especially since his critical and financial dufecta of Erin Brockovich and Traffic has allowed him to abandon the small film if he wanted. While there is truth to criticisms that Soderbergh has made too many remakes in recent years (and I, personally prefer the smaller, personal feel of The Limey and Full Frontal) I doubt that it's due to laze, merely a restiveness and desire to see how he can veer from already tried conventions. The DVD's features are worth checking out, even if the film is not what most viewers expect. Soderbergh is, along with Francis Ford Coppola, one of the few film directors adept at discussing both film and art in general, as well the making of the film under commentary. His explication of scenes, along with the screenwriter, is top notch, as is a feature that has the characters in the film being interviewed by Soderbergh 'in character'.

But, it is more than that. It is a film that totally subverted the dominant themes and forms of Hollywood cinema, at the time, showed that 'adult' films, truly adult, not a euphemism for pornography, could have mass appeal, and paved the way for the great auteur decade of American film-making that was the 1970s. That things have regressed severely, since then, only shows how much a young Cassavetes is needed these days.But, it was totally different from the European auteur films of the 1960s, in that it eschewed symbolism, framing, and Post-Modern techniques of storytelling. Faces is a raw film that is laced with searing, realistic dialogue, and gives the impression that the viewer is truly eavesdropping on the private lives of people who could be them, for there are no Hollywood goddesses nor buff Adonises to be found in any scenes. And, unlike a master like Ingmar Bergman, who also focused on the inner emotional and psychological lives of individuals, Cassavetes' characters are not philosophizing nor posing in neatly framed boxes. This is not so much a criticism of the European poetic approach to film, merely to state that Cassavetes' style was far more revolutionary, and felt like actual cinema verité. In that sense, while one can argue ceaselessly over the relative excellence of certain directors, it is impossible to deny Cassavetes' importance in the pantheon of film's first century.Nor can one deny Faces' importance, at least as a landmark, if not having lasting influence in Hollywood's Lowest Common Denominator output. The film follows the demise of the fourteen year marriage of Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin), two LA suburban children of the post-World War Two boom, at the height of American affluence, just before Vietnam, Watergate, and the 1970s allowed the Conservative movement of the 1980s send standards of living into a spiral that has yet to stem. Why are they breaking up? We are never directly told. He's the head of a large company, and she a bored housewife, and while they still have things in common, and enjoy each other- as shown in a terrific scene of the couple in bed, laughing their heads off over lame jokes Richard tells, their marriage has just died. Neither could probably pinpoint where, much less why. But, the fact that they are still chuckling over the most inane jokes, just to please one another, says it all about most relationships- that they almost all end up as zombies. That's what makes this film so real, potent, and discomfiting. Contrast this to the Hollywood paradigm of the mid-1960s, Doris Day comedies, when the film was first started, and the difference is stark&#133;.But, the real stars of this film are the writing and acting. Cassavetes reaches Chekhovian heights of drama, admixed with Tennessee Williams' poetic realism, in his Oscar nominated Best Original Screenplay. It is truly among the greatest screenplays ever written, even if, as rumored, there was much improvisation in the dialogue. Here, for one of the few times on screen or stage, one gets to see the actor as creator, not merely collaborator. Lynn Carlin, in her first film role, is authentic as the clueless abandoned wife, and got an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress. Seymour Cassel, as he lover, is also fantastic, as a gigolo with a soft side, and also got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Gena Rowlands, as the prostitute, is neither victim nor saint, just a real person struggling with real problems, and gives her usual great performance, as one of the great actresses of all time in film. But, this film is dominated, from start to finish, by the towering performance of John Marley. How many of us have worked for a son of a bitch like him? How many women know a bastard like him? How many men reading this are a Richard Forst? The supporting actors- Fred Draper as Richard's drunken pal Freddie, Val Avery as the drunken Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, the old lady Chet deigns to kiss, when she drunkenly pleads for affection- are uniformly terrific, as well.The title of the film is based upon the notion that we all act in ways that are mere role playing for others, mere faces, and this has never been more true than in this film. A more apt title, though, might have been Personae, but since Bergman's singular Persona had recently been released, to great acclaim, this title suffices. No scene better and more aptly depicts why it suffices than in the terrific, nearly twenty minute opening scene, after the title sequence, which hints at the fact that, as Bergman was doing in that era, this film may all be a film some of the characters are watching, as a presentation to Forst as 'the Dolce Vita of the commercial field.' That this meta-narrative aspect has not been commented on by many critics I find curious, but understandable, since no more than two or three minutes into the nearly twenty minutes that follow, we are given a bravura performance of drunkenness never before equaled, for its realism, on screen. The strengths of this film are so many and so potent that things that in other films that would be weaknesses, such as fashions and dated slang, become strengths for this film has not dated. Its characters are as fresh as they were four decades ago, even if the film, itself, serves as a time capsule of the 1960s, yet one that is timeless.

He's the head of a large company, and she a bored housewife, and while they still have things in common, and enjoy each other- as shown in a terrific scene of the couple in bed, laughing their heads off over lame jokes Richard tells, their marriage has just died. Neither could probably pinpoint where, much less why. But, the fact that they are still chuckling over the most inane jokes, just to please one another, says it all about most relationships- that they almost all end up as zombies. That's what makes this film so real, potent, and discomfiting. Contrast this to the Hollywood paradigm of the mid-1960s, Doris Day comedies, when the film was first started, and the difference is stark&#133;.But, the real stars of this film are the writing and acting. Cassavetes reaches Chekhovian heights of drama, admixed with Tennessee Williams' poetic realism, in his Oscar nominated Best Original Screenplay. It is truly among the greatest screenplays ever written, even if, as rumored, there was much improvisation in the dialogue. Here, for one of the few times on screen or stage, one gets to see the actor as creator, not merely collaborator. Lynn Carlin, in her first film role, is authentic as the clueless abandoned wife, and got an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress. Seymour Cassel, as he lover, is also fantastic, as a gigolo with a soft side, and also got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Gena Rowlands, as the prostitute, is neither victim nor saint, just a real person struggling with real problems, and gives her usual great performance, as one of the great actresses of all time in film. But, this film is dominated, from start to finish, by the towering performance of John Marley. How many of us have worked for a son of a bitch like him? How many women know a bastard like him? How many men reading this are a Richard Forst? The supporting actors- Fred Draper as Richard's drunken pal Freddie, Val Avery as the drunken Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, the old lady Chet deigns to kiss, when she drunkenly pleads for affection- are uniformly terrific, as well.The title of the film is based upon the notion that we all act in ways that are mere role playing for others, mere faces, and this has never been more true than in this film. A more apt title, though, might have been Personae, but since Bergman's singular Persona had recently been released, to great acclaim, this title suffices. No scene better and more aptly depicts why it suffices than in the terrific, nearly twenty minute opening scene, after the title sequence, which hints at the fact that, as Bergman was doing in that era, this film may all be a film some of the characters are watching, as a presentation to Forst as 'the Dolce Vita of the commercial field.' That this meta-narrative aspect has not been commented on by many critics I find curious, but understandable, since no more than two or three minutes into the nearly twenty minutes that follow, we are given a bravura performance of drunkenness never before equaled, for its realism, on screen. The strengths of this film are so many and so potent that things that in other films that would be weaknesses, such as fashions and dated slang, become strengths for this film has not dated.

But, it is more than that. It is a film that totally subverted the dominant themes and forms of Hollywood cinema, at the time, showed that 'adult' films, truly adult, not a euphemism for pornography, could have mass appeal, and paved the way for the great auteur decade of American film-making that was the 1970s. That things have regressed severely, since then, only shows how much a young Cassavetes is needed these days.But, it was totally different from the European auteur films of the 1960s, in that it eschewed symbolism, framing, and Post-Modern techniques of storytelling. Faces is a raw film that is laced with searing, realistic dialogue, and gives the impression that the viewer is truly eavesdropping on the private lives of people who could be them, for there are no Hollywood goddesses nor buff Adonises to be found in any scenes. And, unlike a master like Ingmar Bergman, who also focused on the inner emotional and psychological lives of individuals, Cassavetes' characters are not philosophizing nor posing in neatly framed boxes. This is not so much a criticism of the European poetic approach to film, merely to state that Cassavetes' style was far more revolutionary, and felt like actual cinema verité. In that sense, while one can argue ceaselessly over the relative excellence of certain directors, it is impossible to deny Cassavetes' importance in the pantheon of film's first century.Nor can one deny Faces' importance, at least as a landmark, if not having lasting influence in Hollywood's Lowest Common Denominator output.

I'm pretty sure that this gory affair is not Lovecraft had in mind when he wrote the story many decades ago, but this is what it is and I suppose it sort of fits in with the video nasty phrase that was around in this period.

It does differ in humour though because, although some reviewers have said it is tongue in cheek I actually thought it did a good job of playing it as straight as possible and, although excessive in tone and gore, it is certainly not a comedy in the way that the Evil Dead films could be described. It is not a restrained chiller either so don't expect a ghost story but the straight playing does create a tension during the film that helps build to the gore, rather than the effects being the all.The effects are impressive even if they are dated now.

The effects have dated but still work to produce some watch through your fingers moments to compliment the overall sense of creepiness and doom that the film captures. Remade nowadays this film would just be about the body count so in a way it is a snapshot of a happier time in the genre and can still be enjoyed today.

They both get off on fighting and at times there seems to be a very odd chemistry between them. During the course of their friendship, Pitt shows Norton how to be more and more and more bizarre and wrapped up in a weird hobby they created, the Fight Club where testosterone-hyped idiots experience the joy of beating each others' brains in so they can prove their manliness. However, as the film progresses, the club becomes more like a club for anarchists and Norton begins to question where they are headed.This is a movie that had lots of interesting little touches and twists. However, in many cases, they were very cool but also didn't particularly make much sense. The last 20 minutes of the film in particular is really cool--but it just doesn't make sense psychologically and seemed more interested in wowing the audience instead of ringing true. Because of this, I felt that this cult film is impossibly overrated--especially since it's now #25 all-time on IMDb! I won't spoil the surprises, don't worry but suffice to say that by the movie is finished you have absolutely no idea what actually happened.As a high school teacher, I also was alarmed that this film actually encouraged the growth of a sick subculture. A group of boys in my school started their own fight club and took great pleasure in proving their manliness. I guess if they didn't get off by hurting each other UFC-style, they'd have to prove their manliness by shooting bunnies or some other mindless guy way--but I hate to see that supposedly civilized people LIKE the idea of watching others become hurt.Additionally, the film is packed with some of the most brutal violence you'll find on celluloid and there is tons of nudity, sexuality and terrorism--just the sort of stuff you'd never want your teens to watch. Unfortunately, among teenage boys, this film is practically a must-see. Parents, exercise some common sense and keep this nihilistic and cruel film away from your kids.

George A. Romero's 1968 masterpiece is, without any exaggeration, one of the most important and influential films ever made as it basically recreated the Horror genre and influenced everything to come - and all that with a low budget and actors most of whom had never been in a film before. Literally every Zombie flick ever made after 1968 took its influence from Night Of The Living Dead, and it is debatable that the world of Horror cinema will ever see classics of a comparable influence again. This immensely creepy and genuinely scary stroke of genius is one of the most brilliant masterpieces the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth, and no Horror lover or cineaste in general could possibly afford to miss it.The film delivers everything one could possibly desire in Horror constant tantalizing suspense, genuine scares and shock moments and an incomparably creepy atmosphere which is intensified by a stunning black and white cinematography. The plot is, as one could guess, about the dead coming back to life. Dead people rise from their graves and walk the earth as living dead, hungry for the flesh and blood of the living. The reasons for their awakening are only vaguely explained, with an undefined radiation. The film ingeniously explores a small group of people who are forced to form an alliance in a small remote farmhouse, desperately trying to prevent the masses of flesh-hungry fiends from getting in. Hardly another film could claim a mood as genuinely creepy and menacing as it is the case in Night Of The Living Dead. The masses of brainless, flesh-eating zombies looking for the living to feed on are doubtlessly one of the creepiest sights a cineaste will ever stumble upon. Arguably THE classic shocker of its time, Night Of The Living Dead has long become one of THE all-time classics in cinema.Zombies had walked the world of cinema ever since Edward Halperlin's 1932 masterpiece White Zombie, in which Horror icon Bela Lugosi enslaved the dead via Voodoo. It was George A. Romero, however, who established the idea of flesh-eating Zombies with Night Of The Living Dead - which makes this one of the most innovating films ever brought to screen. The film itself also had its influences - Italian director Ubaldo Ragona had created a masterpiece with an equally apocalyptic atmosphere four years earlier, in 1964, with The Last Man On Earth (starring Vincent Price!). Another film that influenced this one is Herk Harvey's Carnival Of Souls of 1962. All three films are masterpieces that no Horror fan could afford to miss, yet it is this one which single-handedly changed the entire Genre forever. The gore is extreme for its time, and it is save to say that people back then must have been shocked about the explicitness of graphic violence. The main shocks, however, are provided by the stunningly creepy atmosphere that will leave audiences breathless even after repeated viewing.

Like watching 2046 first before In the Mood for Love, or right now, watching Fallen Angels before Chungking Express, where I have both movies on DVDs sitting on the shelves, but decide to pick Angels before Chungking, knowing jolly well that this one came after, and was like the film that expanded itself so much that it had to break away and stand alone on its own two feet.Deciding between Chungking Express and Fallen Angels also boiled down to pure laziness on my part to want to pop a Region Free DVD into my default player, hence the latter. And I can't help but to chuckle at how Leon Lai's killer character Wong Chi Ming paralleled this laziness of mine, in wanting things on a sliver platter, of getting the preparation work all set out for him, and he just enters the scene with his swagger as the executioner. And the woman behind him acting as his agent and cleaning lady, is played by Michelle Reis.As his agent, she gets the contracts, does the legwork to draw up plans, and with time as she hangs out at his apartment to clean it up, she nurses an aching heart, knowing that perhaps in their profession, to fall in love would spell doom. And it doesn't take one too long to identify with such longing, of being so near yet so far, and she exorcises her unrequited passion by either visiting the places he visits just to hang on to his lingering presence long after he's gone, or by pleasuring herself on his bed. Kinda kinky, don't you think?While Chungking Express dealt with the relationship issues that two cops had to experience (from my fuzzy knowledge of it anyway), Fallen Angels seemed to be its evil twin, again dealing with relations of the heart, but now from the viewpoints centered on two criminals, one in Lai's character, and here the other in Takeshi Kaneshiro (who was also in Chungking Express) with his mute He Zhiwu, who breaks into shops and plays plenty of make belief. In his story arc, his unrequited love stems from his chance encounter with Charlie Young's Charlie, who too suffers a broken heart, but goes over the bend. In fact, I would have thought that Eating Air took a huge leaf out of certain aspects of their courtship, especially with the lovers on a bike careening through Hong Kong's underground highways. And Charlie Young I thought did substantially more than the flower vase roles she's more famous for perfecting.While Zhiwu can't speak, it is perhaps this arc that has a lot to say about love in classic WKW pathos. We listen in to the thoughts of Zhiwu as he narrates them in Mandarin voiceovers, such as topics of relationships having their expiration date, and the keeping of someone's memory alive. With Chi-Ming, he consciously rejects someone who takes an extreme liking of him, to go for a random, temporary lover in the form of Karen Mok's Blondie, who again might be another throwback to a similar character back in Chungking Express. But being cautionary here, is yet again the tale of not incurring the wrath of the wrong woman, though I chose to interpret the events in his story thereafter as being one of a set up, or a fix, versus just being a case of coincidental bad luck.And you cannot get away with not talking about frequent WKW collaborator Christopher Doyle's cinematography in this film, with its obtuse angles like a fish eye twitching all around with plenty of kinetic energy, boasting of shots within shots with its use of captured mirror images. Time lapse also gets used quite frequently, giving it a sense of broad fast forwarding motion, with the devil in the details treated quite casually. With a variation of Massive Attack's Karma Coma by Roel Garcia featured in an eclectic soundtrack, it already bowled me over with its collection of songs featured, whereLove stories that don't go anywhere except to serve as personal reminders, familiar pathos as presented by WKW, a star studded cast and excellent visuals and music, easily make this film one of my firm favourites.

Like watching 2046 first before In the Mood for Love, or right now, watching Fallen Angels before Chungking Express, where I have both movies on DVDs sitting on the shelves, but decide to pick Angels before Chungking, knowing jolly well that this one came after, and was like the film that expanded itself so much that it had to break away and stand alone on its own two feet.Deciding between Chungking Express and Fallen Angels also boiled down to pure laziness on my part to want to pop a Region Free DVD into my default player, hence the latter. And I can't help but to chuckle at how Leon Lai's killer character Wong Chi Ming paralleled this laziness of mine, in wanting things on a sliver platter, of getting the preparation work all set out for him, and he just enters the scene with his swagger as the executioner. And the woman behind him acting as his agent and cleaning lady, is played by Michelle Reis.As his agent, she gets the contracts, does the legwork to draw up plans, and with time as she hangs out at his apartment to clean it up, she nurses an aching heart, knowing that perhaps in their profession, to fall in love would spell doom. And it doesn't take one too long to identify with such longing, of being so near yet so far, and she exorcises her unrequited passion by either visiting the places he visits just to hang on to his lingering presence long after he's gone, or by pleasuring herself on his bed. Kinda kinky, don't you think?While Chungking Express dealt with the relationship issues that two cops had to experience (from my fuzzy knowledge of it anyway), Fallen Angels seemed to be its evil twin, again dealing with relations of the heart, but now from the viewpoints centered on two criminals, one in Lai's character, and here the other in Takeshi Kaneshiro (who was also in Chungking Express) with his mute He Zhiwu, who breaks into shops and plays plenty of make belief. In his story arc, his unrequited love stems from his chance encounter with Charlie Young's Charlie, who too suffers a broken heart, but goes over the bend. In fact, I would have thought that Eating Air took a huge leaf out of certain aspects of their courtship, especially with the lovers on a bike careening through Hong Kong's underground highways. And Charlie Young I thought did substantially more than the flower vase roles she's more famous for perfecting.While Zhiwu can't speak, it is perhaps this arc that has a lot to say about love in classic WKW pathos. We listen in to the thoughts of Zhiwu as he narrates them in Mandarin voiceovers, such as topics of relationships having their expiration date, and the keeping of someone's memory alive. With Chi-Ming, he consciously rejects someone who takes an extreme liking of him, to go for a random, temporary lover in the form of Karen Mok's Blondie, who again might be another throwback to a similar character back in Chungking Express. But being cautionary here, is yet again the tale of not incurring the wrath of the wrong woman, though I chose to interpret the events in his story thereafter as being one of a set up, or a fix, versus just being a case of coincidental bad luck.And you cannot get away with not talking about frequent WKW collaborator Christopher Doyle's cinematography in this film, with its obtuse angles like a fish eye twitching all around with plenty of kinetic energy, boasting of shots within shots with its use of captured mirror images. Time lapse also gets used quite frequently, giving it a sense of broad fast forwarding motion, with the devil in the details treated quite casually. With a variation of Massive Attack's Karma Coma by Roel Garcia featured in an eclectic soundtrack, it already bowled me over with its collection of songs featured, whereLove stories that don't go anywhere except to serve as personal reminders, familiar pathos as presented by WKW, a star studded cast and excellent visuals and music, easily make this film one of my firm favourites.

It is no time at all before Brad Jr learns of his father's profession &#150; as head of a crew of thieves working to order across the state. Brad Jr pushes to become part of this, while at the same time bringing his younger brother and his new girlfriend into the secret of what he is doing. At first it all seems like an exciting, if risky, way of making a living but, when a grand jury investigation into the gang starts getting closer, the stakes immediately start getting higher.It was the cast that drew me to this film because on paper what you have is a deep and sumptuous cast that offers a lot if the material can come through for them. In this regard the potential was also there as this is based on a true story and centres around crime and father\/son relationship. It should have depth, it should crackle and it should be tense. Sadly it is weighed down by its own self-importance and is delivered with a terribly slow pace that the material cannot totally support. The second half is better as more starts to happen but the first half is quite hard work as it is full of silence, looks and, lest we forget, that bl00dy Madonna song which seems to be solidly in the background for the twenty minutes at least. It isn't that anything about it is bad, it is just that it didn't need to be so ponderous as it was.The second half is better though as things do start to come to a head in all the threads and the worthy deliver has less of an impact on the telling. The main reason it is worth seeing though is the cast. A young Penn does well and he has strong chemistry with Walken, doing more than his usual shtick and also years from becoming more famous for people doing impressions of him than he is himself. Masterson reminded me why I used to love her when I was young as she is strong alongside the heavy male cast. Meanwhile support is solid from Walters, Strathairn, Sutherland, Penn, Glover and others. It is just a shame though that the script didn't give them more to work with and that the rather heavy delivery did somewhat prevent them from really playing off one another to as great effect as the cast list suggested would be the case.Overall then, At Close Range offers much in the casting but somehow fudges the potential somewhat by being a bit too worthy and full of itself. That said it is still worth seeing because it is a good drama and the acting is mostly strong, just be warned that the first half in particular requires a lot of patience as it meanders forward with no rush to do anything in particular.

I also remember seeing a poster for the Dungeons and Dragons movie (avoid that one) and thought maybe that was the movie for the trailers. And later, I stood corrected when I saw the spectacular cardboard announcement for Fellowship of the Ring. Shortly, I went with my dad to see it.First off, the prologue is beautiful! You get a summary of the rings, and Sauron's rise, and, then bang!, battle scene. A huge orc army forward the last alliance of men and elves. Stunning! Spectacular! Later the prologue goes a tad too long (consider the movie's total length) but serves as a proper back story so you can understand much of what happens in the actual story. After the prologue, we get the title card. This tells you there's going to be other movies next, (though, how foolish of me, I believed they were separate stories).The first third of the movie is about Frodo and company trying to find Gandalf and see what happens with the ring. The scenes following are enjoyable and very exciting. We also have the introduction of Strider and Arwen, and, of course, the black hooded eerie dark riders (the Nazgul). To this point, good.The next third starts off with Frodo arriving to Rivendell, the most beautiful setting in the trilogy. Then, the eponymous Fellowship is formed and so they set to the quest to Mordor to destroy the ring. This section of the movie has my personal favorite sequence of them all, The Bridge of Khazad Dum (both scene and music).Unfortunately, after Gandalf's death (spoiler, everyone?), you start stretching and lean on another position in your seat. The movie just went too far. The last third of the movie, involving most of the forest parts are the reason why Fellowship is my least favorite of the trilogy. This is a cue for me to change channels or turn off the set when I see it on TV. Although much of what happens is thematically important for the next parts, they just go too long. You lose all interest and amusement, mainly the scenes involving Galadriel and also Boromir's breakdown.There is still action, but it drags even farther than before. And, worst of all, there isn't a real ending. The Fellowship tears apart, the ring isn't destroyed, Frodo is not even near Mordor, nothing's resolved. That makes you feel disappointed, and you almost feel cheated to waste three hours of your life.Still, the movie proved to be entertaining and fun, and quite engaging with it's colorful characters, it's stunning musical score and, hat's off to the special effects. You leave the theater talking of just how awesome it turned out to be. And it was. Why a 9 rating, do you ask? Well, because even with the first and second acts you're thrilled, the third act kills all of the excitement. So, if you watch it again, and again (as I do), stop watching after Gandalf dies. You won't miss much.Just as the movie is part of a trilogy, this comment is also part of one. Feel free to read the next one, there's more to come.
