This might be because the ending is famously bad, but for all of the film's many faults, the mystery portion of the movie is crafted together with such directing and editing skill that it's a travesty that it should have been so overlooked. Of particular note is the movie's uninterrupted first shot. I don't know how long it is exactly, but it goes on for several minutes, which is an enormously difficult thing to pull off. It requires massive amounts of planning and preparation, and they pulled it off brilliantly here, reminding me of similar shots in GoodFellas, Boogie Nights, and The Player. But the real problem with the movie is that it gives us 90 minutes of an exciting thriller and then caves in to a cheap, contrived ending that only calls more attention to itself by coming on the heels of such an otherwise good movie.Brian de Palma's previous film was the brilliant remake of Mission Impossible, and while the action and pace of that movie were both well-suited to the director's biggest talents, in Snake Eyes he has pulled out all the stops and given us a movie where every frame is packed to the edges with excesses in color, motion, gestures, and noise. Not that this is a bad thing, of course. In fact, for the most part all of the visual chaos only makes the movie fascinating to look at even as we struggle to figure out what's going on. But man, it's just too bad about that ending. Nicholas Cage plays Rick Santoro, a detective and boxing fan who happens to be in the front row of a heavyweight champion fight where prize-fighter Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) is defending his title. Hurricane Jezebel is pounding on the outside of the arena as Tyler is getting pounded in the ring by an over-confident, wise-cracking challenger. A heavy hit sends Tyler down to the canvas and then gunshots ring out. The Secretary of Defense, sitting a few seats away from Santoro, is shot in the throat and the whole stadium erupts into a panic. What follows is a multiple point of view presentation of the event, which shows us 20 minutes or so leading up to the gunshots and some time after, and then cuts back and shows the same time period but at different locations within the stadium. Santoro's best friend is Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is in charge of the Secretary's security for the event. Not a good job to have when the guy gets assassinated. Sinise gives a subdued and collected performance, especially when compared to the exaggerated excess of much of Cage's performance, but the problem is that he and Cage have not a scrap of chemistry on stage. We're told that they have been best friends since childhood, but none of that comes through in their limited shared screen time, which pulls the rug out from a scene late in the movie that is supposed to be powerful and moving. Sadly, it's not.De Palma succeeds best in the way he presents the events leading up to the assassination from several different points of view, not the least reason for which is because we don't know which of them, if any, we can trust entirely, which makes the mystery element of the movie even more interesting. Stan Shaw deserves some credit for his performance as while he never for a second looks like a boxing champion, there is a scene in the ring where his eyes show a depth of sadness and remorse for what he has to do that might be the single best piece of acting in the entire movie. An extra layer of realism is also added as the movie takes us behind the scenes of a major prize-fight, showing us what the boxers do just before and after a major fight and a little bit about how casino security is handled. There is another plot below the assassination involving doctored missile test results and a subsequent conspiracy, but it really serves no other purpose than to give a reason for the assassination, which itself drives the rest of the movie. But unfortunately Snake Eyes is one of those movies that is really good and then hugely disappointing, leaving you with a feeling somewhere between regret that the movie wasn't better and just feeling cheated.

For most movie directors this quality work would have been the zenith of a career; for Kubrick it was just another stepping stone in his directorial progression! Kubrick was only 32 years of age when he directed this masterpiece; years younger than all but one of the primary actors that he directed in this film. The fact that he was the undisputed director and given the due respect by these performers shows his already acknowledged talent.All the actors, with the possible exception of James Mason, turn in stellar performances. Mason probably wanted to, but seemed to be uncertain as to how far he could push the envelope with his part of a dirty old man in that day and age. Some commentators have mentioned the constraints faced by Kubrick due to the Hays Moral Code. However, what most people fail to realize is that in that day and age (and I was there and remember it) the entire subject was something that most people did not like to talk about or even think of. Society was much more formal back then, and the actions and\/or attitudes shown on the majority of TV sit coms today would not have been tolerated in most of society. Or, at least tolerated in movies or TV. Please remember, back in 1962 the term Gay meant happy and joyful. The term homosexual was not even allowed to be mentioned on TV; let alone allow a person of that sort to be depicted. People, of course, knew about such individuals and dirty old men; but the attitude was Why show that kind of stuff on TV? Most people would have, grudgingly perhaps, admitted that there was a place on TV for artistic nudity, but outright vulgarity was not tolerated whatsoever! Strangely, even in our day and age artistic nudity is still not allowed on open air TV, but vulgarity is and in abundance. Go figure.So, Kubrick had to present this movie properly; no easy task. He did so despite an, at times, awkward performance by James Mason. Compensating for this were incredible performances by Shelly Winters (she acted the role of a romance and sex starved matronly widow that I would not be surprised if, in fact she was- at least sex starved). By the way, the bedroom scene of her with James Mason, though innocent by our standards today, was almost scandalous by the standards of that day and age. Please remember that in the Dick van Dyke show of that era the husband and wife had separate beds in the same bedroom! Peter Sellers was absolutely magnificent in this pre Inspector Jacques Clouseau role and one can certainly see why Kubrick was so eager to use him again in Doctor Strangeglove. Also of great interest was the United States of 1962; when seat belts were not in cars and gas stations were full service. A great look at a past America; shows that not all high school dances ended in a drunken or drug induced sexual orgy. A time when typewriters were used to type letters; not word processors. Actually. one really has to be of a certain age or even older to fully appreciate the nuances in this film though even the younger (under age 45) viewer can appreciate most of it. By the way, Mason got over his jitters over showing a dirty old man and a few years later was lead male actor in Age of Consent; showing his renewed male appreciation of the lovely and (then young) Helen Mirren. Older man chasing a naked young filly on a tropical beach! A great movie, and so is this one.

Since 1986's very good Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, they've been cheap and too easy to produce. So, literally, just about everyone looking to make a name for themselves has made some kind of serial killer movie. The success of 2002's direct-to-video masterpiece Dahmer even started a series (Gacy, Bundy, Ed Gein). Also, multiple films based on the Zodiac killer, dozens of home invasion themed films, hundreds of based on a true story clones, and even parodies such as 2006's Behind the Mask The Rise of Leslie Vernon. It's out of control. Reality in horror has never been more popular. Yet, the reality of these serial killer films is no more real than the masters of the sub-genre. Henry, for one. Also- 1991's The Silence of the Lambs, 1995's Se7en, 1973's Deranged, Wes Craven's immortal The Last House on the Left, and perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho. This genre screams, Been there. Done that. A new film about a serial killer needs a fresh approach.Enter American Psycho. This 2000 adaptation of the controversial Brett Easton Ellis novel took almost a decade to be made, but I think the film dares to go where almost no other killer film will- blaming its' killer on the culture of America itself. Being a rich, handsome, well-dressed bachelor in the New York business and club scenes of the mid-to-late 80's gives him a wealth of opportunities to meet women he would spend only a night with. Prostitutes, models, drug users, friends of friends. Patrick Bateman is one of the most sickening serial killer characters ever put on screen. He is a member of the sort of Wall Street Elite- a soulless, robotically judgmental bunch who go anywhere they want, do whatever they want, say whatever they want to - with no consequences. But even with this group, there is a chain of superiority. Built by acquiring certain status symbols. And with Patrick being toward the bottom of said chain, he's grown so needy of the status and yet, always receiving less of the validation that his fellow suits are pulling in. With that urge for utmost entitlement not satisfied, Patrick is becoming a blank rage.Now, that sounds rather cold and boring. It is, but it's also meant to be. The film captures the empty artificiality of Bateman and his type, which are hollow shells. Like an assembly line of pods which factory workers fill with raw material that are shaped by machines into products. Products that all look the same and are hard to tell apart. And that's the key to the film. Psycho is a world where the vultures (the werewolves of Wall Street, if you will) and their prey are equally hard to differentiate between. Patrick's victims are as faceless or nameless as he is (Patrick is all throughout the film mistaken for different people). And that's where the story gets interesting. Because, now the concept of things like alibis are irrelevant. Patrick lives in a who's-who society of people who are all on drugs or can't be bothered to pay attention to where they've been because their focus is on where they have to be next. It's almost a dark fantasy world, one where again, there are no consequences because there is zero sense of accountability. And in this world, that won't change. The system is too fed by the powers in charge of the nation. If one changes, the other has to change too. In a movie like this, change is nothing more than a lyric in a Michael Jackson song.The film remains purely fascinating. It's always updating itself with new information, and Patrick does undergo a crude character arc of sorts. I especially find it intriguing how his class of victims begins to change as the film progresses. Moving from prostitutes and homeless beggars to his rich friends and business associates. Even though he kills the man he sees who in his mind has it all, Paul Allen (played by 90's TV heartthrob, Jared Leto), no one notices that he's even missing. Patrick also assumes the identity of one of his other clones, no one notices. No one cares to notice. A fascinating turn of the knife from a similar set-up, for instance in 1999's The Talented Mr. Ripley- where, people actually do notice when the guy who has-it-all goes missing. The horror of American Psycho is the manner in which the film feeds Bateman his victims. Some of them have a human side, which is all we're given to relate to in the film. Otherwise, we're just sitting back and watching the horrors taking place on screen served up cold with no morality and no end in sight to the story.Lastly, the relevance of American Psycho today is how shockingly the film predicted a piece of history that was about to take place. How much the character portrayals of Bateman and his gang of clones have in common with former U.S. President George W. Bush and his administration of evil minions. Other than the obvious heartless and soulless quality to these people, was how much Bush was like a fictional character. And like Bateman himself. His father was a huge power icon (Bateman's father in Psycho owns the company everyone works at), he was a drone selected to do an important job and took advantage of the position for his own personal gains, he's handsome and was dressed well, says everything his cronies wanted to hear even when he was just spitting and not saying anything, and untold numbers of people died because of him. He was so pathetic in fact, he could've been Bateman's brother. That truly makes American Psycho a horror film unlike any other. One that retroactively has its' finger on the pulse of real life terror and tragedy. Oliver Stone's character study, W., was too little, too late.

Jonathan E is a veteran Rollerball star, but when he is given orders to retire he starts to question what is behind the decision &#x85;Rollerball, like a lot of seventies cinema, is an interesting and thought-provoking film, but not without some problems. It has lots of intriguing themes going on; what gave rise to the corporate apolitical structure, why are dangerous gladiatorial sports so popular, are people so materialistic they would really give up freedom for glamour, and why are the power brokers so threatened by Jonathan's hero status. But for every interesting idea there are also scenes that fall flat; the boring society party full of pretty people we don't know or care anything about, a ridiculous bit with Richardson about a senile supercomputer, and almost all the parts with Jonathan's floozies (though Hensley, as the first one, at least has a personality). The other problem is the villain, Bartholomew, who is well played by Houseman but never allowed to actually do anything nasty, so we never feel Jonathan is in any danger and the tension is lost. Caan is strong in the lead, and handles both the physical performing and the internal angst with impressive skill, but is left floundering in a movie that is much too serious, unstructured and long for its own good. Shot in the UK for some reason, with a talented British crew, notably the excellent production design by John Box (Oliver!, Sorcerer, The Keep) and a heavy classical score featuring Bach's Toccata And Fugue In D Minor and Remo Giazotto's Adagio In G Minor. What is of course faultless in this film is the bone-crunching stuntwork, as the Rollerball players are smashed, mashed, crunched and thumped around the arena. A movie with good ideas, which could perhaps learn a lesson from Tank Girl, a more recent film about a future world controlled by an energy corporation; it has just as many imaginative notions, but is funny, exciting, fast-paced entertainment all the way, with vibrant, dynamic characters. Rollerball is an iconic sci-fi classic, but just a little too portentous and self-absorbed for my liking. Written by William Harrison, and remade (badly, by most accounts) in 2002.
