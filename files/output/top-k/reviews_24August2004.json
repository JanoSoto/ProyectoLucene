As we endure endless scenes with extras falling over for no readily apparent reason (although the golf balls sell the illusion effectively enough) or characters tanning the word dork onto each others' chests (and that is about as adult as the humour gets here), one of the great theories about family-friendliness is proven. The makers of Police Academy 5 might have made a Police Academy film that is suitable for four-year-olds to watch, but in so doing, they have made a film that only four-year-olds would want to watch.If your four-year-old is able to read at what we laughingly refer to as an adult level such as I was at that age, they will most likely turn to you when the credits roll and say something along the lines of well that was stupid, wasn't it?.The plot revolves around something that probably should have been done at the end of the last film putting George Gaynes out to pasture. After seeing him in previous Police Academy films and Punky Brewster (often within days of each other), I have a tremendous respect for the man, but he really is just getting too old to do this. By the time Police Academy 8 rolls out, he will be 88. Granted, there are actors who put in great performances at similar ages (Christopher Lee is only about five years his junior), but given that George has started to speak at a rate of about one word an hour, I don't think he's got another film left in him. Getting back to the plot, anyway, as Commandant Lassard is scheduled to retire, Captain Harris senses an opportunity to become Commandant of the Academy, while his old trainees sense an opportunity to pay respect to a man who had quite the positive impact in their lives.It sounds like a very flimsy foundation for a film, and to be quite frank, when you've got writers of this calibre putting it together, it is. As has been said earlier, the suitable-for-all-ages mentality is one element that makes the film boring. The performances are another.

Mahoney wouldn't merely sunburn a word into Harris' chest. We've seen Mahoney smear shoe-polish on a megaphone, cast dispersions on Harris' sexuality, as well as make a laughing stock of the man by spreading the word about an unfortunate accident involving a motorbike and a horse. And that's just in the first film. Sorry, Nick, but to call your effort weak is a form of flattery.All in all, I gave Police Academy 5 a one out of ten. I don't know what is scarier.

In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory.  Let's see if we can keep this straightTurkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid).  Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija) &#150; or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'.  Did you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC.  The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.

While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.

I do think this movie has its faults but it's so much fun, it's so exciting and adds so much to the Predator universe including the start of the 14 year wait for Alien Vs Predator which ended up not being really worth the wait for. It's all about another Predator who lands near Los Angeles in the middle of a blisteringly hot heatwave.

The characters are just as deep as the original too. We find out more about the predator too in this. The only thing that maybe irks me a bit is that realistically Danny Glover is nowhere near capable of defeating a predator mainly due to the fact that he is just a cop and he is kind of fat unlike Arnie's character in the first who was an elite commando leader but that can be explained away as luck.

Regardless of AVP's lack of quality Predator 2 is amazing so i'm giving it 10\/10  ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"24 August 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Now i love the original to this but unlike the majority of people i think that this one is the best of the two. It doesn't have Arnie, true but did Arnie really make the first one so great? I don't think so. Gary Busey is in this along with Danny Glover. I do think this movie has its faults but it's so much fun, it's so exciting and adds so much to the Predator universe including the start of the 14 year wait for Alien Vs Predator which ended up not being really worth the wait for. It's all about another Predator who lands near Los Angeles in the middle of a blisteringly hot heatwave. It witnesses a cop played by Danny Glover take on a couple of warring drug gangs which impresses it no end so it decides that Glover is the worthy prey it needs to hunt whilst being hunted itself by a top secret Government organisation lead by Gary Busey.*Slight Spoiler*Predator 2 is full of thrills, excitement, spooky terrifying atmosphere just like the first and gore. The characters are just as deep as the original too. We find out more about the predator too in this. The only thing that maybe irks me a bit is that realistically Danny Glover is nowhere near capable of defeating a predator mainly due to the fact that he is just a cop and he is kind of fat unlike Arnie's character in the first who was an elite commando leader but that can be explained away as luck. Danny Glover is one lucky S.O.B. in this.In Predator 2 we have drug gangs, drug wars, drug lords (gotta love King Willy who says the coolest line ever in movie history), top weapons, action, excitement, tension and of course, a bad ass predator. The effects are great, the acting is good and the music and sound effects in this are pretty much the same from the original so huzzah! You will probably disagree with me but this has a slight edge over Predator 1 and Aliens. It definitely beats the crap out of the rather disappointing Alien Vs Predator.

The new Blob is directed by Chuck Russell, a very underrated director in My opinion. His direction with this film is superb.

Everyone will be glad to learn that Con Air is an action film that is able to have a great story to accompany it.Originality and believability are two more keys to the success of a film because if nobody believes the story, success can be thrown out the window. Con Air revolves around a plane carrying high-risk prisoners being transported to a maximum-security prison. However, the prisoners have other ideas.Action films cannot survive without the right cast in place to portray the heroes and villains; therefore, the director must locate the right talent who has the correct chemistry to make it work. For Con Air, the director chose five immensely and incredibly talented actors who fit this formula. Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames lead an all-star, stellar cast in Con Air. Chemistry between cast members is key to the success of every movie. It didn't take long to realize these five actors contained a massive amount of chemistry.Cage stars as Cameron Poe, a parolee on his way home to his wife and daughter until he runs into a problem and save the day. Cage is one of the most versatile actors I have come across. Playing everything from a romantic lead in It Could Happen To You and Moonstruck to dramatic roles in Leaving Las Vegas and Bringing Out The Dead to comedic roles in Trapped In Paradise and Guarding Tess. Cage is the ultimate action star combining all of these elements to bring home the role of Cameron Poe. For this reason, I'm proud to call him one of my favorite actors.Monica Potter and young newcomer Landry Albright star as Cameron's wife and daughter to whom he is flying home to after being paroled. Potter's beauty radiates off the screen with such heat and force I almost melt.She may not be a veteran, but Potter's poise, beauty, talent and presence has proven that she could be mistaken for one. I relish every opportunity I had to watch her on screen because I knew what I was seeing was something special. Potter is on the rise with awards in her future and great films on the horizon.Albright's performance as Casey brought smiles to my face because she is one of the cutest and most talented newcomers to hit Hollywood in recent years. Albright may not have a lot of dialogue, but her presence on screen is a sight for sore eyes, her beauty is hypnotizing and her energy is electric.Albright will have a long, bright future in acting if she decides to pursue the profession because she has the special sparkle in her eye and aura surrounding her. I can't wait to see her next film.Malkovich is Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, the ringleader of the hijacking. Malkovich's face oozes with villainous intent, which is one of the reasons he is so great at playing one. With his role in Con Air, he proves once again he is the best. Cyrus was calm, cool, and collected in the face of danger as he led his group of convicts.I have gained a new respect for Malkovich because I was able to see the true range and versatility he brought to the role.However, the best was yet to come as I learned that the supporting cast was a welcome surprise. For example, Rhames is Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones, Cyrus' right hand man. Mykelti Williamson stars as Baby-O O'Dell, Poe's only friend on board The Jailbird. John Cusack is Vince Larkin, a federal agent, who from the ground is doing his best to bring down the plane full of convicts. At odds with Larkin is Duncan Malloy, played by Colm Meaney.Another aspect of Con Air I enjoyed was the writing because the film was able to tell a story with substance without letting the action take over. Creating great character development and story depth are just a few examples how the writers were able to win me over.The special effects in Con Air is great that it made me feel as if were part of that flight right along with the convicts. I commend director Simon West, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer on how well they put together the action sequences and bringing together the tremendous cast without any clash of egos.Finally, the one thing that signed, sealed, and delivered this movie was the signature song performed by Trisha Yearwood called How Do I Live. It remains my favorite song even today, five years after Con Air was released.This is an action packed film from start to finish that has a believable plot; as well as comedic moments at times with great one-liners by various actors. I urge everyone to see Con Air for a great action film with substance.

But then Michael Haneke decided to make La Pianiste, one of the dullest movies I've ever seen bad dialogue, lack of characterisation, characters acting out of character, a bad structure, and your typical ambiguous ending that can mean a million things but ultimately means nothing! I should have enjoyed La Pianiste on the surface, the main story is amazing; the exploration of a woman's repressed sexual life and the dark perversions that are born from it; the psychological exhaustion of leading such a life of loneliness without a soul-mate to share her fantasies; and the effects of her perverted fantasies on an innocent young man. I can just see David Lynch making a modern masterpiece out of this material. But in the hands of Haneke, with his poor execution of ideas, it's all dull and meandering and not as captivating as it seems.The protagonist, Erika, a repressed piano teacher, and her domineering mother are badly established at the start of the movie. For one thing, Haneke seems to know little about subtlety in his eagerness to show the conflicted relationship between Erika and her mother, he starts the movie with such an extreme situation it's almost ludicrous Erika comes home late, her mother enquires her whereabouts, the two argue and quickly engage in physical violence and name-calling. This could be a nice scene towards the end, but not in the beginning as Haneke forgets these two women who almost killed each right now are going to live together for another 120 minutes of the movie, and obviously it doesn't look realistic to have two people who hate themselves so much living so peacefully afterwards. Haneke should have started with a small incident and slowly raise the bar until culminating in a scene of physical violence. Because, in fiction, once you reach this point the logical step is to top it with murder. You don't just apologise your mother after hitting her in fiction&#133; that causes another problem Erika acts out of character; first she hits her mother, which is fine, but immediately apologises, thus taking two steps backwards from her initial characterisation. And how can it be that a grown up woman who hates her mother so takes her around everywhere? Their relationship does not convince me - I don't believe a grown up woman would act like this towards someone she hates; if Haneke had had the grace of showing it's impossible for her not to live without her mother, that'd have been fine, but it seems Erika could leave her mother's house at any moment but never does for no apparent reason.The whole movie is this melodramatic - the characters' actions just fluctuating as it pleases the film-maker, not because they'd actually act like this. The initial scene would have been better tied with the later one where Erika tries to have sex with her mother. This way Haneke could make another connection between love\/sex\/violence, which is a running theme throughout the movie. Even so, the scene where she tries to have sex with her mother stands out as a good one in itself - one really understands how Erika finally feels alone as her last hope, Walter, abandons her and she retreats to her source of hatred for consolation. Walter, one of her students, is a so-so character he's interesting at times, but unfortunately he's also poorly developed; the movie never convinces me enough that Erika's fantasies could have messed up his mind so much to the point of turning him into a rapist and woman-beater; the &#145;seduction of the innocent' theme is always an interesting one, but Haneke just didn't push it far enough, which is strange considering he was pretty uncompromising throughout the rest of the movie.Indeed, that's one of the things I appreciate in this movie - Haneke's uncompromising stab at Mankind's darkest side and the creation of very gruesome characters. Even so, this movie isn't as disturbing as hype would have one believe what passes for disturbing are really just great little touches Erika visiting porn booths to watch sex, later indulging in voyeurism and watching a real couple having sex in a car; her smelling tissue papers with semen; her writing long letters with her sick fantasies; her cutting her vagina with a blade&#133; those are all fine touches, which in the hands of a better film-maker would have turned La Pianiste into a masterful exploration of the human nature. The ambiguous ending shows Haneke didn't really know what he was doing with the movie, as a lack of resolution ends the movie in an unnecessary cliff-hanger. I suppose it's an end because nothing else comes after it, but it's not a resolution of the story in the sense Michael Corleone killing the five families of New York is a resolution to The Godfather, or the Photographer throwing the imaginary ball back to the mimes is a suitable resolution to Blowup. La Pianiste only has an end because it has nothing else afterwards, and it's a ridiculous one. This isn't a really bad movie, as it has great material, but quality is always in the execution of the ideas, and Haneke just didn't have the talent to pull it off.

You don't just apologise your mother after hitting her in fiction&#133; that causes another problem Erika acts out of character; first she hits her mother, which is fine, but immediately apologises, thus taking two steps backwards from her initial characterisation. And how can it be that a grown up woman who hates her mother so takes her around everywhere? Their relationship does not convince me - I don't believe a grown up woman would act like this towards someone she hates; if Haneke had had the grace of showing it's impossible for her not to live without her mother, that'd have been fine, but it seems Erika could leave her mother's house at any moment but never does for no apparent reason.The whole movie is this melodramatic - the characters' actions just fluctuating as it pleases the film-maker, not because they'd actually act like this. The initial scene would have been better tied with the later one where Erika tries to have sex with her mother. This way Haneke could make another connection between love\/sex\/violence, which is a running theme throughout the movie. Even so, the scene where she tries to have sex with her mother stands out as a good one in itself - one really understands how Erika finally feels alone as her last hope, Walter, abandons her and she retreats to her source of hatred for consolation. Walter, one of her students, is a so-so character he's interesting at times, but unfortunately he's also poorly developed; the movie never convinces me enough that Erika's fantasies could have messed up his mind so much to the point of turning him into a rapist and woman-beater; the &#145;seduction of the innocent' theme is always an interesting one, but Haneke just didn't push it far enough, which is strange considering he was pretty uncompromising throughout the rest of the movie.Indeed, that's one of the things I appreciate in this movie - Haneke's uncompromising stab at Mankind's darkest side and the creation of very gruesome characters. Even so, this movie isn't as disturbing as hype would have one believe what passes for disturbing are really just great little touches Erika visiting porn booths to watch sex, later indulging in voyeurism and watching a real couple having sex in a car; her smelling tissue papers with semen; her writing long letters with her sick fantasies; her cutting her vagina with a blade&#133; those are all fine touches, which in the hands of a better film-maker would have turned La Pianiste into a masterful exploration of the human nature. The ambiguous ending shows Haneke didn't really know what he was doing with the movie, as a lack of resolution ends the movie in an unnecessary cliff-hanger. I suppose it's an end because nothing else comes after it, but it's not a resolution of the story in the sense Michael Corleone killing the five families of New York is a resolution to The Godfather, or the Photographer throwing the imaginary ball back to the mimes is a suitable resolution to Blowup. La Pianiste only has an end because it has nothing else afterwards, and it's a ridiculous one. This isn't a really bad movie, as it has great material, but quality is always in the execution of the ideas, and Haneke just didn't have the talent to pull it off.

What a pedigree it had  Billy Wilder, Jack Lemmon, Shirley Maclaine, Fred MacMurray, and a build-up as one of the all-time great romantic comedies.  Indeed, it did have the romantic comedy structure, it did have fine cinematography, it did showcase sometimes adorable chemistry between Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine, and it did have a few clever moments.  Still, I found the movie unforgivably offensive in certain parts.Remember the trick employed for laughs in almost every Three's Company episode, where miscommunication or lack of understanding lead to trouble for the characters but laughs for the better-informed viewers?  Imagine if, instead of Mr. Furley making a bad assumption about what Jack Tripper was doing in the kitchen, the situation involved Janet being unaware that Chrissy had just attempted suicide and would soon die if Janet doesn't catch a clue.  Would you laugh?  Would you resent the writers and director trying to play that for laughs?  I found the answer to that question in The Apartment  yes, I resented it, and was offended by it.I was also put off by the fact that every character in the movie was either despicable or at least very difficult to like.  The protagonist is an insurance company drone who desires to climb the corporate ladder.  He lets the executives who could help him in that quest use his apartment for their adulterous affairs, and in return, they recommend him for promotion.  The female lead is involved in one of those affairs (her great line  Women in love with married men shouldn't wear mascara.), and she is willing to forgive that louse even when she discovers she's but one in a series of his conquests.  Those two, the protagonist and female lead, are the characters we're supposed to root for.  The other characters are mainly wicked, and we're doubtful they will ever actually get what they have coming to them.This film is the work of exceptionally talented people.

Most of the dialogue in the English language version is spoken in a halting and hesitating way without inflection as if the actors don't understand the lines they are saying.

Those sad eyes perfectly reflect a character that we know is doomed.Klaus Kinski has one of the strangest faces ever and here he is transformed into a rodent-like vampire in the Max Schrek tradition.

But I watched it on TV the other night, and was pleasantly surprised. This would be the type of thing you would think of when someone says horror film. Dark lonely road, to teenagers scared out of their minds, mysterious, scary monster, and the good old chase scenes.The film can be split into two parts, the first 40 minutes before the creeper is revealed which will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, and was brilliant. And the last hour, which had a few scary moments but does not really compare to the opening 40 minutes. The creeper being revealed half way through the film ruined it, it would have been better to reveal the creeper nearer the end of the film. I didn't think this film was that gory, but that's just my opinion. It did get a bit far fetched at times, but I think that just added to the film, and helped to make it funny. This film did have quiet a few funny moments, such as the end scene, which helped lighten the dark plot.There were a few moments where the characters seemed to state the obvious, like `You know the part in horror movies when somebody does something really stupid, and everybody hates him for it? This is it.' This didn't really need saying. My favorite thing about this film has to be the look of utter terror on Darry's face practically throughout the whole film.

The movie was Ed, not to be confused with the Whoopie Goldberg abortion of celluloid Eddie, that premiered during that same year. In Ed award-winning documentary filmmaker Bill Couturie employs the technique of cinema verite that lets the camera capture a true slice of sporting Americana... a monkey playing minor league baseball. Ed is not merely, as Brad Laidman of filmthreat.com raved, a movie some would say that kids may like, but rather the examination of the symbiotic relationship between man and monkey. Despite their outward appearances, can a clear distinction really be made between the monkey Ed and his human counterpart, Matt LeBlanc? In the film, excel at baseball (although the monkey is the star), both delight in flatulence, and both have giant cartoon teeth. And wonderfully, when the film reaches it's glorious climax, it is the monkey that most clearly embodies our notions of humanity, imbibing LeBlanc with the confidence to again throw his curve-ball, the pitch that eventually paves his way into the Big Leagues (this is despite LeBlanc's supposed ability to throw a 125 mph fastball). Although there may be some factual inaccuracies in the film (in a conversation with LeBlanc, a teammate tells him that Carlton Fisk was a flop in Boston, but went on to find greatness in Chicago), the true essence of Ed is in it's spirit... and in the fact that it has a monkey as it's star. Watching this film for the first time, I realized that I was examining the very embodiment of greatness. This being the case, Ed became the basis on which I would judge all future films. Forget Siskel and Ebert (especially Siskel) with their thumbs... forget Leonard Maltin with his stars... and forget A.O. Scott with his homosexual, liberal bias. The only scale worthy of film review is the Banana Scale. Based on 3 bananas (because really, who needs five?) this scale cuts through all the other ridiculous criteria such as plot, character development, acting and direction commonly used by other critics in their evaluations, and judges movies based on three essential elements. These elements are1. Does the movie contain a character from Friends? 2. Does the movie contain a monkey? 3. Is the movie about baseball? As you probably realize, there is only one film in history that contains all these elements, and, therefore, it is the greatest movie ever made. Citizen Kane by comparison, the film often mislabeled as the greatest, contains none of the essential elements of greatness. Therefore, it is hardly worth mentioning. But a movie such as M.V.P. Most Valuable Primate, centers it's story around a chimpanzee that plays for a youth hockey team. This is one of those interesting films that strives for greatness, but lacks certain characteristics that would've put it over the top. One may ask what director Robert Vince was thinking when he cast Rick Ducommun in the role of Coach Marlow when he could certainly have had David Schwimmer. And instead of hockey, why not youth baseball? But decisions such as these have presented film buffs with interesting fodder for years, wondering what could have been if, say, O.J. Simpson had in fact played the title role in The Terminator, or if instead of Leonardo DiCaprio, director James Cameron had cast Dustin Diamond, as he originally planned? But judging on it's finished product, MVP receives 1 1\/2 bananas... one for containing a monkey, and 1\/2 for being about a sport other than baseball. Not bad, judging against the current, deplorable standards of Hollywood. Based on it's greatness, it comes as a surprise to most that an Ed sequel has never been attempted. I have always assumed that the movie has become a victim of it's own greatness. Much like Roberto Clemente, who walked away during the apex of his career, knowing that he had reached a level of greatness that would doom his future endeavors to failure in the public eye by comparison, Ed director Bill Couturie knows that another installment would be severely overshadowed by it's predecessor. But taking matters into my own hands, I penned a letter to Mr. Couturie, outlining my ideas for a suitable sequel. The idea goes like this Both LeBlanc's character and Ed the monkey are playing in the major leagues... one for a team in the National league, the other for a team in the American. By coincidence, the two teams meet in the World Series. Although LeBlanc is now recognized as one of the greatest pitchers of all time, he is no match for the hitting prowess of Ed the monkey. And when they square of, mano-e-monkeyo, Ed the monkey is forced to make a decision whether to allow his friend LeBlanc to strike him out, or propel his team to victory by hitting a home-run, which he can do at will. I argue that this will be the first film that allows it's viewers to really get inside the mind of the monkey... to see his thought process, to witness what makes the monkey tick. By the time the last pitch is thrown, there won't be a dry eye in the house... and those tears will be both tears of laughter and tears of empathy... a rare combination. Although I haven't heard back from Couturie as of yet, I expect a response before too long. Ideas like this don't come around everyday. If not Couturie, I imagine a Hollywood heavyweight director will jump on board. From what I understand, Kubrick was considering optioning my treatment before his untimely passing. Although the idea was intriguing, I thought that perhaps Kubrick would understate the levity in a project such as this... opting for lingering shots, subtle dialog, and a brooding score by Beethoven, instead of the sped up action scenes, screaming monkey dialog, and circus music score that I believe the film Ed II Monkey in the Majors calls for.

Simpson had in fact played the title role in The Terminator, or if instead of Leonardo DiCaprio, director James Cameron had cast Dustin Diamond, as he originally planned? But judging on it's finished product, MVP receives 1 1\/2 bananas... one for containing a monkey, and 1\/2 for being about a sport other than baseball. Not bad, judging against the current, deplorable standards of Hollywood. Based on it's greatness, it comes as a surprise to most that an Ed sequel has never been attempted. I have always assumed that the movie has become a victim of it's own greatness. Much like Roberto Clemente, who walked away during the apex of his career, knowing that he had reached a level of greatness that would doom his future endeavors to failure in the public eye by comparison, Ed director Bill Couturie knows that another installment would be severely overshadowed by it's predecessor. But taking matters into my own hands, I penned a letter to Mr. Couturie, outlining my ideas for a suitable sequel. The idea goes like this Both LeBlanc's character and Ed the monkey are playing in the major leagues... one for a team in the National league, the other for a team in the American. By coincidence, the two teams meet in the World Series. Although LeBlanc is now recognized as one of the greatest pitchers of all time, he is no match for the hitting prowess of Ed the monkey. And when they square of, mano-e-monkeyo, Ed the monkey is forced to make a decision whether to allow his friend LeBlanc to strike him out, or propel his team to victory by hitting a home-run, which he can do at will. I argue that this will be the first film that allows it's viewers to really get inside the mind of the monkey... to see his thought process, to witness what makes the monkey tick. By the time the last pitch is thrown, there won't be a dry eye in the house... and those tears will be both tears of laughter and tears of empathy... a rare combination. Although I haven't heard back from Couturie as of yet, I expect a response before too long. Ideas like this don't come around everyday. If not Couturie, I imagine a Hollywood heavyweight director will jump on board. From what I understand, Kubrick was considering optioning my treatment before his untimely passing. Although the idea was intriguing, I thought that perhaps Kubrick would understate the levity in a project such as this... opting for lingering shots, subtle dialog, and a brooding score by Beethoven, instead of the sped up action scenes, screaming monkey dialog, and circus music score that I believe the film Ed II Monkey in the Majors calls for.

The movie was Ed, not to be confused with the Whoopie Goldberg abortion of celluloid Eddie, that premiered during that same year. In Ed award-winning documentary filmmaker Bill Couturie employs the technique of cinema verite that lets the camera capture a true slice of sporting Americana... a monkey playing minor league baseball. Ed is not merely, as Brad Laidman of filmthreat.com raved, a movie some would say that kids may like, but rather the examination of the symbiotic relationship between man and monkey. Despite their outward appearances, can a clear distinction really be made between the monkey Ed and his human counterpart, Matt LeBlanc? In the film, excel at baseball (although the monkey is the star), both delight in flatulence, and both have giant cartoon teeth. And wonderfully, when the film reaches it's glorious climax, it is the monkey that most clearly embodies our notions of humanity, imbibing LeBlanc with the confidence to again throw his curve-ball, the pitch that eventually paves his way into the Big Leagues (this is despite LeBlanc's supposed ability to throw a 125 mph fastball). Although there may be some factual inaccuracies in the film (in a conversation with LeBlanc, a teammate tells him that Carlton Fisk was a flop in Boston, but went on to find greatness in Chicago), the true essence of Ed is in it's spirit... and in the fact that it has a monkey as it's star. Watching this film for the first time, I realized that I was examining the very embodiment of greatness. This being the case, Ed became the basis on which I would judge all future films. Forget Siskel and Ebert (especially Siskel) with their thumbs... forget Leonard Maltin with his stars... and forget A.O. Scott with his homosexual, liberal bias. The only scale worthy of film review is the Banana Scale. Based on 3 bananas (because really, who needs five?) this scale cuts through all the other ridiculous criteria such as plot, character development, acting and direction commonly used by other critics in their evaluations, and judges movies based on three essential elements. These elements are1. Does the movie contain a character from Friends? 2. Does the movie contain a monkey? 3. Is the movie about baseball? As you probably realize, there is only one film in history that contains all these elements, and, therefore, it is the greatest movie ever made. Citizen Kane by comparison, the film often mislabeled as the greatest, contains none of the essential elements of greatness. Therefore, it is hardly worth mentioning. But a movie such as M.V.P. Most Valuable Primate, centers it's story around a chimpanzee that plays for a youth hockey team. This is one of those interesting films that strives for greatness, but lacks certain characteristics that would've put it over the top.
