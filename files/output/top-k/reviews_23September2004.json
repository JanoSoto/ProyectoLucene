It tells the story of a poverty level family and their constant struggle to stay on top. It is the story of a mother, a daughter, and her daughters who grow up in a world of constantly changing fathers. The main daughter that we follow through this film is Anney Boatwright (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). After a horrible accident where Anney was thrown through the windshield of the car she was sleeping in, she goes into labor. Sleeping through all of the birth and through the next couple of days she learns that she has just given birth to her first daughter named Ruth Anne Bone Boatwright (played amazing well by Jena Malone) by a man that is no longer in her life. At the hospital she is ashamed when the stamp of illegitimate is placed on Bone's birth certificate. Anney does not want Bone, her first daughter, to have the same burden that she has had all of her life. So, she tries to find a suitor to clear her children's less-gratifying mark. Her men are not the best chosen, as one dies and the other begins a violent path of indiscretion and abuse that will rock all the way down to the roots of this simple family. What a powerful film this was and wasn't. I think that this is one of those films that will last the test of time, that the message that it carries will always be relevant in our society of sexual and physical abusers. Every day that we turn on the news, I see that there is at least one report of physical or sexual assault every day. While this is a major battle being fought in our country, this film tries to cover too many issues during one viewing. I have read several reviews that praise this film to no end. Speaking how it will touch us all and force us to open our eyes to the cruelties to the world. I did see this, and it was very emotional, AND I do applaud the direction of Anjelica Houston, but there were too many factions happening in this film to fully appreciate or take in the brunt force of this film. We realize what hardships are befalling Bone, wondering what she will turn out like in the future, and how her extended family will handle the facts of the issue, but we loose sight out of all of the other surroundings. This should have been a much longer film. There were some ideas that were not formulated, but yet introduced (i.e. Glen's family). I never would have though that he came from a high society family, but what I think that Houston was trying to show here was that anyone anywhere can do these deeds of violence. I knew that there was the topic of abuse in this film, but I didn't understand enough about the family or secondary characters to truly immerse myself in this film. I also felt that Anney's family was too stereotypical for South Carolina residents. The old mother sitting on her rocker, cranky and wrinkly, shouting words of advise to her family ... advise that everyone should have listened to ... but nobody does. How many times have we seen this in a movie? Overused and overplayed. This needed to have crisp writing to create a story that will not only last the test of time, but not loose the message. Finally, if you are going to make a film about abuse, I would always suggest never using Lyle Lovett to have a part in the storytelling. He played a man named Wade. He had this line that made me laugh because you can image this line coming from Lyle Lovett. I like that man, and I don't ... I feel like he could turn wrong like a batch of whiskey in a bad barrel.Overall, definitely a film that will last the test of time, a message about the evils of our society, but not a film to be viewed again and again.Grade ** out of *****  ","genre":null},{"date":"23 September 2004","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Bastard out of Carolina is more than just a movie, it is more like a swift kick to the gut.

This was a gem hidden in the darkness. Looking at the cover, you would never guess that this would be such a powerhouse of a film, but let me be the first to say that it was. Berenger and Winger are amazing in their roles. Winger giving the best performance that I have ever seen her do, while Berenger takes a character riddled with evil and makes him human. When I first began this film, I was expecting a very true Hollywood production. One that would be dark at first, but all of the sudden create this happy world at the end. This film did nothing close to that. What was amazing about this film was that it let the audience make it's own decisions. Not much was handed to you on a silver platter. Upon the first ten minutes of this film, you would probably assume that it was a love story. It is anything BUT a love story. It is a crime\/thriller\/drama film, and quite possibly one of the strongest that I have seen in some time. There are some scenes in this film that I couldn't believe I was watching. The sheer brilliance of the director left me wondering if this film was really made in 1988. The cinematography was outstanding. There is one scene that stands out the most in my mind. After Berenger tries to put down his dying horse, he can't pull himself to shoot a living creature, so he has his side-kick do it. After it is done, he runs out into the rain behind Berenger wrapped in a plastic tarp. The image here is of the devil riding close behind. It is so vivid and so beautifully done that you can't help to wonder what that may represent. There are a couple of scenes very similar to this as well. Now, this isn't a film without some small flaws. The young girl was annoying. Perhaps I find young children in these types of films always to be annoying, but in this case it was especially bad. Also, there were some dopey scenes to this film. There were some parts that I felt I was the director of the film watching some bad lines happen between Berenger and Winger ... but it was only a couple. Betrayed ends like an open-ended question. It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated. It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film. Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist. But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever. The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy?

It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated. It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film. Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist. But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever. The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy? Dark and impressive ...

I went with a small group of friends and we decided on going to the late showing to avoid the possible protesters. We were right, there were two people there holding forlorn looking little signs warning me about something or other.Upon seeing the film, I concluded that the protests were much ado about nothing, and that if anything Scorsese appreciated the buzz the protests generated since this film was not all that great on its own merits.Peter Gabriel's score was tremendous. It conveyed an authentic feel as the scenes unfolded without the music being so intrusive as to become a distraction. As another commenter noted, the sound track may have been the best single feature of the film.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Christ was quite engaging as well. It was understanding and captured the essence of the struggle that the novelist, Nikos Kazantzakis, and Scorsese were trying to capture. Although it doesn't get a lot of attention from present-day theologians, the possibility of internal struggles between the human and divine sides of Jesus Christ was a topic debated vigorously, often bitterly, in the early existence of the Christian faith. Dafoe deftly captures the idea of an internal struggle -- sometimes confident, sometimes terrified, the human Jesus portrayed by Dafoe wrestles endlessly with who and what he is. Finally, I think Scorsese's portrayals of the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness are quite creative and extremely well done. The idea that Satan appeared to Jesus in attractive forms makes considerably more logical sense than do the traditional portrayals of a hoofed and horned Satan skulking in the background whispering temptations to Jesus. Otherwise, the film was not wildly impressive. Harvey Keitel could have lost the Bozo fright wig he wore to make his character more credible. Harry Dean Stanton as Saul, after conversion the Apostle Paul, gave a decent enough performance, but the words he was given to say in the script were generally ludicrous. The notion that Paul didn't need the living Jesus, but relied on the dead Christ, is an important piece of theological and church history, but it came off too satirical to make the point. As it was, the portrayal of Judas as the disciple whom Jesus loved, and as the most worthy of the disciples, was predictable, even trite. The other male disciples mainly wander through the film in search of a clue. The controversial scenes, of course, were those which constituted the last temptation of Christ. Appearing as a beautiful child, Satan (with an English accent), offers to Jesus a chance to be a regular Joe. Marry Mary and then when she gets knocked off by the Romans, marry her sister. After all, there's only one woman in the world. Therein lies a problem with this film. There is more than one woman in the world, but there was only one woman in this film, and her name was seductress. With the exception of the little English devil-girl, all the women in this film seemed to have getting laid by Jesus as their primary purpose in life. That portrayal of women is not one of Scorsese's finer moments. Frankly, it seemed to me that if Christians were going to get upset by anything in this film relating to sexuality, it would have been the scene early in the film where Jesus sits by and watches and waits while Mary Magdalene, the prostitute, services her clientele. That scene caused one of the little group I was with to exit the theatre and wait for us in the car. This film is not for the theological faint of heart. If you are open to the idea of a graphic depiction of one of the great controversies of ancient Christianity, then go for it. If it bothers you to think through the metaphysical and practical implications of a man being both human (frail, limited) and God (omnipotent, eternal) then this film is not for you.

Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor).The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years). The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955. This sets off a change of events in the past so that when Marty and the Doc, now in the future, are ready to go back to 1985, suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar hell. With Biff changing the past, he also changed the future, creating a desolate, alternate 1985. One where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley, though still the sleaziest. And where a lot of other things have changed as well. Now, Marty and the Doc have to go back to 1955 and get the magazine from Biff if they expect to restore the future and erase the alternative 1985.This is a great sequel to a great movie. You get the 1989 version of the future (I don't know that 2015 will make the kind of progress we see in the movie with cool flying cars and dehydrating pizzas and hoverboards). This is the special effects and visual beauty of the second, whereas in the first one, it was recreating the past. Marty had to once adapt to 1955, now he has to do the same for 2015, even if only for a moment. But, it also ties in another creative aspect when Marty and the Doc must return to 1955, they only know the whereabouts of Biff based on where they last saw him in that year--the school dance and all of that which took place in the first movie. Going back to that past means that a Marty Calvin Klein McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects\/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015? So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had).So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.

Going back to that past means that a Marty Calvin Klein McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects\/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015? So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had).So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.

He has no name, and that is for a reason. This film wants to show the animosity of the character. It wants to create a sense that Keitel is playing an everyman. Not necessarily a cop with a specific name, but anyone...almost showing us that this type of corruption happens in the least expected places, by the least expected people. The film opens with Keitel taking his children to school. We are disillusioned by the idea, that he has strong family values, perhaps he isn't the bad cop that everyone is expecting. After 10 minutes into the film, that idea changes dramatically. We see him trying to steal drugs out of a car, looking at the breasts of a shot girl, by taking money from a grocery store owner, and finally by doing mass amounts of cocaine and heroine. After about thirty minutes of no story line, just graphic sex and drug use, we are pushed into yet another horrifying scene. This is supposed to be the plot of the film. An inexplicable act of violence takes place that makes Keitel reconsider his chosen path of life. His world gets changed all around as he tries to hunt down the criminals of this case, and also dramatically use religion to look back at his soul. Can both these criminals and Keitel be saved? Too much character development can hurt or help a film. In this case, it hurt it. With very small amounts of dialogue, but extra elongated drug scenes, we are forced to have the impression that Keitel is a bad cop. Alright, after five minutes I get it...but why show more? Why take about three-fourths of the film to show all of the evil deeds that this Lieutenant is capable of doing? This could have been a very dark and disturbing film, but instead it fell into the problem that 'The Deer Hunter' had. The director chose to use the leave the camera running technique. This means, that he thinks that the true nature of the character will come out the longer that he leaves the camera running during a scene. This can be true in some instances, but for this film it did not. I understood that he was a corrupt cop, I mean, I got that much from the title. Tell me more...why was he a bad cop? This might seem like a small point, but it would have helped when trying to get into the mindset of the character. I felt that the director left too much up for the viewer to assume. For the two big drug scenes, there were some random people that Keitel was with, and I had no clue who they were. Develop these smaller characters too, this will allow you to build a believable world for the main character. If you don't do this, then when your big central moment does occur the viewer will not be lost. When Keitel begins looking back at his own life actions, he begins to worry that he doesn't know what to do to make things right, or how to do the right thing. For too long he has been bending the rules, and living the lifestyle that he has become accustomed to...that when he wants to change his life, he doesn't know how to. BUT I will tell you this that by doing more drugs and by allowing crime to continue does not push him in the right direction.Overall, there wasn't enough development of Keitel's character to justify being shocked by this movie.

So he takes her out, to get they're fortune read with one of the woman's friends. Well anyway, the woman's friend ends up getting attacked by a wolf. Larry runs to her rescue, and ends up killing the wolf, but not before the woman is killed, and Larry ends up getting a terrible bite in the process of killing this beast.But not very long after, we come to find out that it was not your average wolf that Larry killed. It was a werewolf, and now that Larry has been bit, he is going to turn into a werewolf himself!Now don't get me wrong, just because I was disappointed in this movie does not mean that you will. Just don't get your expectations too high. It is a very good movie, with some very shocking moments. Just don't be expecting to see another Frankenstein or Dracula. Now quit reading things online and go pick up the Universal Monster Box Set!

You are not interested in the movie any longer, all you want is for the film to end. Quick and simple, you have better things to do today.To begin, I couldn't stand Quaid's accent. I realize that we are deep into the world of Louisiana, but it almost felt forced from Quaid. It felt as if he had been practicing all night, only to forget most of it in the morning and continue to try to do his best. Second, the chemistry between Barkin and Quaid seems forced as well. Neither one of them seem to be in love, it just seems like it is more a convenience relationship then a full fledged love affair. I have trouble believing that a couple is going to be happy together after just spending an evening together at a bar OR that a love could form when you are trying to convict the man on corruption charges. I felt that some sort of ethics question should have been brought up, but it wasn't. The secondary characters in this film made no sense either. I didn't care, or know, who Bob, Dick, or Jane were in the background of this film. I did notice John Goodman playing a small part ... but he has done better. I felt that with this film, the director had swayed from the overall point of the film. Jim McBride tried to bring a story of romance with the backdrop of crime in the unlikely of places.

I think something was missing when they were trying to establish a sense of family bond between all the major characters, but I still didn't realize that Ned Beatty was trying to marry Quaid's mother.

I could see Quaid doing Gambit, but it would have been sloppy and poor. Perhaps I was hoping that somewhere in the middle of this film Quiad would turn into Gambit and perhaps ... just perhaps ... throw some of those explosive cards at everyone around him. Chaos could have been better created than this film. Finally, I would like to end on a note of science.

One of the great things about ED is it's simple timeless tale of a group of friends going away for the weekend at a secluded and seemingly run-down cabin. The horror begins even before they get there, with a near fatal car crash, and a porch chair that seems to have a life of it's own. That's probably one of the great things about the ED, we are led to believe that all the trouble starts with Professor Knoby's reciting of text from the Necromonicon, but it's quite clear there is something evil in the woods, with Professor Knoby's recording only giving it the kickstart it needs to start Mayhem.One stand-out performance in this film is Betsy Baker, who plays Linda - the ill-fated girlfriend of Ash, who when possessed by the ED is turned into a giggling demon who chants hilariously We're gonna get you, not another peep... It is an absolutely brilliant and comedic portrayal, especially when you see Baker as Linda before she becomes possessed, in which she is a quiet and reserved. The horror and gore in this film isn't as gruesome as some of the stuff we see these days, but to put it in retrospect at it's time ED was rather controversial and was put in the same category as snuff-films by a lot of right-wing anti-movie violence and horror protesters. Though some might find the scenes with demons biting off their own arms, genitals being mutilated(the scene with Ash & the Scott-Demon) and a tree raping one of the females a bit too much to stomach.All in all, this is a classic horror film.

Bogart is a WWII vet paying a visit to the widow (Bacall) & father (Barrymore) of a dead soldier, late under Bogie's command.Crooks have taken over the hotel for a week during this tourist off-season, evidently awaiting a fellow mug who'll relieve the gang of its stash, counterfeit money. Edw. G. Robinson is Johnny Rocco, gang executive, who's now back in the USA illegally, years after he was deported.Movie is a great study in the breakdown of group relations gang members @each other's throats; aimless Bogie's ambiguous relations with Bacall & Barrymore characters. All while anticipating the hurricane.Along the way, Bacall realizes that Bogie character was the real hero of the battle, not her late husband. & They realize that Rocco was deported years ago. Review the scene where hoods tease Pop Temple (Stand your ground!) Barrymore had been disabled with arthritis for years when the scene calls for him to get up, take a swing @Rocco, & fall down. Also note simmering disdain betw. Ziggy & Rocco (No more blasting away at each other!). It's pretty intense cinema. Anybody notice that the shootout on the boat is more or less a recreation of the battle on that hill in Italy? Bogie alone, against the forces of evil. The last scene, with Bacall throwing open the curtains, is still a tearjerker for me.Stellar cast includes Thomas Gomez as Curly (Hotel Central. We're all together.), Harry Lewis as Toots (It's guaranteed for life.), the incredible Claire Trevor as gang moll Gay Dawn (How 'bout a drink? It'll help chase the blues away.), Monte Ming the Merciless Blue as Sheriff Wade, & Dan Seymour as Angel he was also the doorkeeper @Rick's in Casablanca. Jay Silverheels (Tonto in the TV series The Lone Ranger) is Tom Osceola.

Well, after seeing this movie, all I have to say is that Speilburg has a debt of gratitude to pay to the Cross of Iron. For a 1977 movie, the horrific detail of the frontline is incredible. There as a seen where a troop transporter rolls through the mud, and over a long dead soldier whose smashed body is barely visible. It was a small but great detail. When bombs exploded, bodies, and body parts flew. I couldn't believe how graphic this movie was allowed to be for being so old. The quick stop action like filming was sort of John Wooish, only pre John Woo. The only complaint I have is the accents seemed British and they tended to fade in and out.
