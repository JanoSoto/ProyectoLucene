The graphics were incredible, the characters were good and the plot was very dark and appealing to all the sci-fi lovers out there.THE GRAPHICSThe graphics were breathtaking. the helicopter scene made my heart beat at an unhealthy rate, the harvesting field churned my stomach and the sentinels just plain scared the crap outta me. i was looking for any slip-ups like stunt double face-shots times where the camera might show up on the reflection of someone's glasses (i failed miserably, and i was glad to see only a confused Neo on that of Morpheus's kick-butt shades.) my only frowny face moment was when the, uh....well, actually, i can't think of any right now....THE CHARACTERSKeanu Reeves is a very underrated actor. i can't really see why half the reviews on here are about how much he sucks. he plays a very good dark hero. if any anti-keanu types out there would like to kick my butt unless i insult him somehow, then here goes he was especially good at being CONFUSED when he first boards the ship in the REAL world. happy? Laurence Fishburne fits the role of Morpheus like a glove. he's not a supermean, anti-social hero that remains mean 'cuz he lost his family at the hands of a sentinel or anything, and he's not some hack that occasionally gets a cheesy one-liner that pretty much represents the movie, either. Though sadly, i've never seen any of Carrie-Anne Moss's other work,  i DO think she kicks butt as Trinity. she has a very no-sense attitude, and i liked her one-liner when she disarmed neo's assailant during the bullet flo-mo scene. Joe Pantoliano is up there on my list of nifty kickers of @$$. he emphasizes it once again with his witty retorts and slightly malevolent look. NOT the kinda guy you wanna meet in a collection of data bits and binary codes AHEM, i mean, a dark alley. The other guys (i prefer not to use all 1,000 of my words right now) are good, too. Matt Doran was given a very good nickname. it fits him well. i wonder if he could hook me up with the Lady In Red?THE PLOTI dunno you guys, but i got most of the plot the FIRST time i saw it. sure, the second time explained it a little better, but i don't quite get all the reviews out there. They're just jealous because they can't quite grasp the concept of a movie where you actually have to THINK for once, instead of commenting on how big that leading character's gun was or that they have the same pair of glasses, but their friend Damon stole it, and that's why the person listening has never seen them on the idiot talking. you just gotta keep on your toes. and The Matrix helps doesn't make it hard for you to do that. I also like the fact that the previews for the movie never told me anything about the 'fields'... i was TOTALLY caught off guard by that. i think that's what i like best about this movie. Mr. Scary (you know who you are) can back me up on this the preview didn't tell you the whole movie, or the ending (which i also thought was a disappointment for the matrix) it only tells you enough to make you say, hey, fred, wanna go see the matrix? that guy from point break is in there! then you find out that the actual movie isn't too much like you expected, which was a lot of blood(hey, can you honestly tell me there was a lot of blood flyin' around for that purpose?) and a lot of cleavage. also, the martial arts scenes were terrific. i didn't quite approve of the kicking and rolling in mid-air, but at least there wasn't too much of it. i admit, though, there WERE a few plot holes. observehow DID tank recover from the big gun blaster-thingy? is he part robot, or what? after all, he was hit like, three times. also, dozer is practically twice as big, and he was only hit like, once, and he's laying on the ground looking like somebody went at him with a flamethrower! and boy, that's one mean looking gun... i'll have a well-done char-broiled Dozer, please....also, what was the point of neo diving into plot spoiler prevention in order to kill him? (not really a plot hole, just my personal critique, which this is all about right?) how would neo find out about morpheus and the matrix in the beginning of the movie? wouldn't the agents walk into his house or something and just kind of, um, misplace him? i mean, come on. the friendly robot squids at the matrix control center HAD to have seen that and 'deleted' it, even though morpheus would just put it back on again... this has been my really long list of things a lot of people want to beat me up and possibly steal my money me for because they are closed-minded and probably haven't even seen the movie, they just heard it all from people like me. ya don't like it, tell it to my cyberface!

Be warned that I'm not going to examine The Matrix on a metaphysical level, or compare it directly to anything as some people have done. I went in with no preconceptions or expectations, and obviously walked out more satisfied than many who did.I'll discuss the plot line of the Matrix down further, but for now I will say the only problem I had with any character was Reeves' whoa. This, combined with his accent, can't help but remind you a little of two guys in bright clothing having excellent adventures in a phone booth.Reeves plays very well the hacker suddenly exposed to the truth, adapting to his environment with the ease of those enamored of information technology. He hungers for knowledge, seeks the truth, and wants answers to his questions. He doesn't receive all the answers, but he knows his battle with the AI society of the Matrix will bring him closer.Fishburne is great as the enigmatic Morpheus. At first complex, his simple belief that Neo is The One pushes him on in his quest, and we see his simple dedication to humanity evident in the pains he goes through to protect Zion.Carrie Anne Moss is excellent as Trinity. (I have to say that Dodge this was one of the cooler moments for me in the film - yeah shallow I know). She does the kick a** female with a confident, yet fragile femininity that she only exposes in humanity's hour of need.Hugo Weaving. What can you say? As a proud Aussie, I am completely satisfied with his performance as the spine-chilling Agent Smith. A lot of people I talked to were really annoyed by his accent, but I felt that it suited an AI program attempting to fit into a human society and develop human traits. His icy, blank faced portrayal of Agent Smith (with Agent Jones and Agent Brown), really carried the uncaring authority figure of the Matrix into the human world.Weaving, along with other Australian\/New Zealand actors (Matt Doran as Mouse, Belinda McClory as Switch, and Julian Arahanga as Apo, along with the agents and a host of extras) gave good background to the other characters, even though their roles were short lived. Hopefully we will see a lot more local talent in upcoming features (Star Wars Episode II, Mission Impossible II).Joe Pantoliano makes a great Cypher - the disillusioned follower of Morpheus.The parts of Tank and Dozer were ably played by Marcus Chong and Ray Anthony Parker, as the only two real humans we saw in the whole film. You see in Tank and Dozer a happier, more positive attitude, having been born in the human outpost of Zion, and believing implicitly with Morpheus that Neo is The One.The special effects strength were nothing short of unique, with the combination of Hong Kong wire cradles combined with unreal, computer generated settings and wardrobe, and slow-mo moment in time multi-camera techniques. That is all I have to say on the matter, because they have to be seen to be believed.I have a problem with people who knocked the film. Most of their reasoning probably stems from the fact that they are addicted to their own flavour of sci-fi (and there is NOTHING wrong with that), or expect high philosophy every time they walk into a cinema. I accept that there were parts that they didn't like, but I feel that rather than trying an all-encompassing tale told from start to finish, the Wachowski Brothers were showing us a small, but important part of the world of the Matrix.Everyone who has watched a sci-fi feature film knows that in no real way can the director(s) give us the entire history of their unique world in 3 hours or less. The Star Trek movies, for instance, have whole series' to back them up before they hit the big screen. Conversely, Dark City stood alone, and people who didn't like it often said that not enough was explained (as they did with the Matrix), or compared it to other, better established series\/films. Was everyone disappointed with Star Wars when it was first released? NO! They went in, saw a good film with simple plot ideas and characters, got their money's worth and walked out. I think somewhere along the line we just got too fussy, and we forget that it's a movie - entertainment for a couple of hours.I had no preconceptions that this movie would give me the history or end of the world. I say honestly went in to the cinema looking for a story on lotsa guns and kicking heads, not to mention the unique special effects. I was pleasantly surprised.The concept of the Matrix running our lives was an important part of the film. I accepted this, but did NOT wait for some quasi-religious justification to develop from this. It was simply a fact taken into account by Morpheus and his disciples when combating the Matrix in their search for The One. It was no character's task to analyse this on a metaphysical level - their task was to begin destruction of the Matrix, and this was all that the Directing and Editing crew could fit into this movie time frame.There is room for sequels here, (like others, I want to see Zion) and I hope that it will again be the Wachowski brothers at the helm, to continue their vision in the style to which we have become accustomed. The Matrix gets 10\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 April 1999","score":"","review":"  For pure entertainment value and a film that left me wanting more, this is it!

Be warned that I'm not going to examine The Matrix on a metaphysical level, or compare it directly to anything as some people have done. I went in with no preconceptions or expectations, and obviously walked out more satisfied than many who did.I'll discuss the plot line of the Matrix down further, but for now I will say the only problem I had with any character was Reeves' whoa. This, combined with his accent, can't help but remind you a little of two guys in bright clothing having excellent adventures in a phone booth.Reeves plays very well the hacker suddenly exposed to the truth, adapting to his environment with the ease of those enamored of information technology. He hungers for knowledge, seeks the truth, and wants answers to his questions. He doesn't receive all the answers, but he knows his battle with the AI society of the Matrix will bring him closer.Fishburne is great as the enigmatic Morpheus. At first complex, his simple belief that Neo is The One pushes him on in his quest, and we see his simple dedication to humanity evident in the pains he goes through to protect Zion.Carrie Anne Moss is excellent as Trinity. (I have to say that Dodge this was one of the cooler moments for me in the film - yeah shallow I know). She does the kick a** female with a confident, yet fragile femininity that she only exposes in humanity's hour of need.Hugo Weaving. What can you say? As a proud Aussie, I am completely satisfied with his performance as the spine-chilling Agent Smith. A lot of people I talked to were really annoyed by his accent, but I felt that it suited an AI program attempting to fit into a human society and develop human traits. His icy, blank faced portrayal of Agent Smith (with Agent Jones and Agent Brown), really carried the uncaring authority figure of the Matrix into the human world.Weaving, along with other Australian\/New Zealand actors (Matt Doran as Mouse, Belinda McClory as Switch, and Julian Arahanga as Apo, along with the agents and a host of extras) gave good background to the other characters, even though their roles were short lived. Hopefully we will see a lot more local talent in upcoming features (Star Wars Episode II, Mission Impossible II).Joe Pantoliano makes a great Cypher - the disillusioned follower of Morpheus.The parts of Tank and Dozer were ably played by Marcus Chong and Ray Anthony Parker, as the only two real humans we saw in the whole film. You see in Tank and Dozer a happier, more positive attitude, having been born in the human outpost of Zion, and believing implicitly with Morpheus that Neo is The One.The special effects strength were nothing short of unique, with the combination of Hong Kong wire cradles combined with unreal, computer generated settings and wardrobe, and slow-mo moment in time multi-camera techniques. That is all I have to say on the matter, because they have to be seen to be believed.I have a problem with people who knocked the film. Most of their reasoning probably stems from the fact that they are addicted to their own flavour of sci-fi (and there is NOTHING wrong with that), or expect high philosophy every time they walk into a cinema. I accept that there were parts that they didn't like, but I feel that rather than trying an all-encompassing tale told from start to finish, the Wachowski Brothers were showing us a small, but important part of the world of the Matrix.Everyone who has watched a sci-fi feature film knows that in no real way can the director(s) give us the entire history of their unique world in 3 hours or less. The Star Trek movies, for instance, have whole series' to back them up before they hit the big screen. Conversely, Dark City stood alone, and people who didn't like it often said that not enough was explained (as they did with the Matrix), or compared it to other, better established series\/films. Was everyone disappointed with Star Wars when it was first released? NO! They went in, saw a good film with simple plot ideas and characters, got their money's worth and walked out.

It's a practice as old as time in Hollywood.  Most of these movies fail miserably.You leave the theater thinking `It was funny enough, why couldn't it just stay silly?'

It tries to make you pee your pants with its jokes, and yet slap your emotions around with the drama.  And damn the odds, it fits like a glove. `Life' is also a film that defies much criticism.  You either love stars Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, or you don't.  I'm in the first category.  As the main characters, the two comedians prove just how valuable they are.  Murphy is coming off a uniquely horrific year. `Dr. Dolittle' was a smash, but a career setback to say the least. `Holy Man' was an unmitigated disaster, but one that didn't effect Murphy with any real damage. The greatest gift `Life' gives to Murphy is a chance to show off range.  Murphy is a very talented actor, and this movie makes you wish he would try a straight drama for once. Murphy can be devastatingly funny. But he can also be very dramatically convincing.  With each new movie, Murphy grows as an actor. I really think he's set for brighter things. Martin Lawrence shares many of the same attributes as Murphy.  He's terribly funny, and yet able to win your heart with a depth most comedians don't have. `Life' has Lawrence with the quieter role.  He uses that chance to provide the film with a backbone. He eventually comes out the best rounded character in the fractured storytelling.  It's a good performance, but even better, it's a brilliant pairing with Eddie Murphy.  The two are seamlessly funny.  Squeezing every moment for comic and emotional juice.  It's refreshing to watch a movie with two actors who seem to be trying something different, all the while living up to previous expectations. Ted Demme is a solid director, a thought that immediately puts me in the minority.  His `Who's The Man?' was a strictly silly romp, but was actually funny. `The Ref' was the critically lauded and sharp black comedy. `Beautiful Girls' is a film that every time I sit down to watch, feels as comfortable as an old cardigan. He's yet to falter in my eyes.  I like his attention to detail, and his gift for trusting his actors. `Life' wouldn't work as well as it does without a specific amount of direction and free will. Demme manages to keep the film on track without ever succumbing to an over-reliance on improv.  The best scenes in `Life' are the quiet ones the gay inmate who's release from prison provides a dilemma, the passage of time montage, and Lawrence's moment with the freshly baked pies(which is actually comical, but who's counting?).  The film seems like it was longer at one point, but the film on display here really pleased me. I would recommend this film to anybody that has lost faith in Eddie Murphy.------------- 9 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 April 1999","score":"25 out of 34 people found the following review useful","review":" I cannot even begin to count how many `comedies' I have sat through that try to reach for the `timeless' formula by interjecting some lame dramatics to engage the audience even more than the comedy ever could.

For once the monster was not a slow animal walking on 2 feet. For once the animal didn't have a grudge against the human race. I heard a lot of complaints, including that Godzilla looked like a big iguana (duh, Godzilla IS a big iguana, but due the radioactive radiation he became Godzilla) and that Godzilla looked like the T-rex from Jurassic Park.

The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes.

The trailer opened with typical period drama pretentiousness before turning into a punkish, rebellious wild ride. When I went to see it at the cinema (during its extremely limited theatrical run) I hadn't even planned on it that day. I just turned up in time and decided to take a chance. A wise choice indeed, as I was in a bad mood that day and this movie really cheered me up.It's London, it's 1748, Robert Carlisle and Johnny Lee Miller play the titular highwaymen from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Will Plunkett brings the highway know-how while Captain James Macleane makes the connections to high society. Lord Gibson takes personal offence to their antics after being robbed, but her Niece Lady Rebecca (the lovely Liv Tyler) falls in love with Macleane, and his unusual gentlemanly ways. Ken Stott plays the truly vile Chance, the police inspector determined to see the men hang at any cost, and one of the nastiest villains in recent film history.Jake Scott (son of Ridley, nephew of Tony) directs with a style that fuses Gothic tones with post-modernism. This is no Pride and Prejudice. Plunkett & Macleane is glam rock on acid while retaining all of the usual gritty, earthy production designs of previous Ridley\/Tony films. Amazingly, Jake Scott would not direct another film until 11 years after this got released.There is a strange rumor persistent on the Internet that Plunkett & Macleane (inspired by true story, don't you know) began life as a completely different film. I recall seeing production stills in magazines in 1996 (three years before its release), and there have been suggestions that it was originally called 'The Lady Highwayman' with Liv Tyler as the lead and Carlisle and Miller merely as supporting characters. The original screenplay by Selwyn Roberts apparently featured bizarre mathematical subtext before being heavily re-written by Bond-scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. I'm not sure if any of the original material made it into the final, 99-minute, cut of the film.A score by Trevor Jones was also apparently rejected in favor of Craig Armstrong. While I have no idea what Jones may or may not have recorded for this film, there is no doubt that Armstrong's work is utterly amazing, probably his career best.Plunkett & Macleane seems to have fallen into obscurity since its release. Don't let it pass you by though, it's loads of fun and deserved a wider audience.

Ken Stott plays the truly vile Chance, the police inspector determined to see the men hang at any cost, and one of the nastiest villains in recent film history.Jake Scott (son of Ridley, nephew of Tony) directs with a style that fuses Gothic tones with post-modernism. This is no Pride and Prejudice. Plunkett & Macleane is glam rock on acid while retaining all of the usual gritty, earthy production designs of previous Ridley\/Tony films. Amazingly, Jake Scott would not direct another film until 11 years after this got released.There is a strange rumor persistent on the Internet that Plunkett & Macleane (inspired by true story, don't you know) began life as a completely different film. I recall seeing production stills in magazines in 1996 (three years before its release), and there have been suggestions that it was originally called 'The Lady Highwayman' with Liv Tyler as the lead and Carlisle and Miller merely as supporting characters. The original screenplay by Selwyn Roberts apparently featured bizarre mathematical subtext before being heavily re-written by Bond-scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. I'm not sure if any of the original material made it into the final, 99-minute, cut of the film.A score by Trevor Jones was also apparently rejected in favor of Craig Armstrong. While I have no idea what Jones may or may not have recorded for this film, there is no doubt that Armstrong's work is utterly amazing, probably his career best.Plunkett & Macleane seems to have fallen into obscurity since its release. Don't let it pass you by though, it's loads of fun and deserved a wider audience.

But then the film's plot quickly deals with a series of very tragic events. Now this movie could have turned out like My Life which was so painful that I stopped watching it after 20 minutes. But instead, I very much enjoyed What Dreams May Come.The film makers made a wise decision not to show much suffering until the second half of the film and build to it slowly. But even more importantly, this is a movie built on beautiful photography and images that carry the first half of the film. The art of computer animation, photography and art direction have never been more stunning than in this movie.After such a visually spectacular run of one great image after another the film runs into several problems. After a while the images of the afterlife become less imaginative and more uneven in quality. It may be that the film tried to show and explain too much. This over reaching also begins to affect the plot. The story slowly begins to sound too much like psychology 101. Too much weight is given to psychological problems and mental illness as the answer to many great questions in life and death. Sometimes things cannot be explained. Along with psychological problems we get a psychiatrist. The interaction between Williams and Max VonSydow which starts out contrasting and interesting becomes too much like a therapy session to feel natural. Finally and most importantly the film shifts too quickly from gloom and doom to happiness. It undermines the naturalness of the feelings brought about by most of the movie.With all of that said, what saves the second half of the film is that all of the performances are solid. While Williams is good as always it is Sciorra especially, giving the best performance of her career, which made me believe. Her torment becomes the heart of the film almost to the end.Even with the shifting of images, plot and mood, this film worked for me as a series of special moments. What Dreams May Come has beauty, pain and endurance. On top of that, I sense the sincerity of the film makers who try to answer the big questions of life, who explore mysteries of emotion and pain.

Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what you're told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.

For those of us who are addicted to `Saturday Night Live', you may come away from `Lost' a little lost yourself. While this film is tailored made for the predictable snarkiness and cynicism that is Spade's humor, I was shocked to be sitting through probably the most vanilla film in the last 10 years.There isn't much of a pulse to `Lost', in fact, without Spade, there isn't much going on at all in this comedy. David Spade, who co-wrote this, does a fine acting job. I would consider him one of the five comedians who can make me laugh when they say just about anything.  He mixes his usual one-liners with minor attempts at range and depth. Amazingly, he does make an effective romantic leading man. Sophie Marceau, who plays the love interest, uses her Sheena like mane of hair and a tiny bit of California sun to make the sexiest impression from an actress since Catherine Zeta-Jones blazed across the screen in `Mask Of Zorro'. She brings her bag of cutes with her as well. I found it really funny to watch this French actress try to get her lips around some of Spade's jokes. I'm betting Marceau doesn't have a clue what she's saying.  She does make a pleasant couple with Spade, it's just too bad the film adheres so much to the weak plot.  I could have watched a film of just both actors playing off each other. With a running time about 20 minutes too long, you would think they're would be more scenes of that. No luck. Director Jeff Pollack doesn't bring much to the table here.  With boring locations, uninteresting camerawork, and a poorly selected supporting cast (with Artie Lang blatantly in the Chris Farley role), he cannot bring much life to `Lost And Found'.

I was disappointed in a few of the last movies that I went into with high anticipations for (Dragonheart, Spawn and a few others). I was not to be left wanting this time.The Matrix is a ground breaking film with outstanding direction and cinematography, a sold story and good acting.  Even Keeanu Reeves nay sayers shouldn't be able to really pick his performance apart that badly.This movie will do for the cyber-punk genre what Star Wars did for Fantasy\/Sci-Fi, especially with the rumors floating about that this is the first in a trilogy.  From start to finish, I was on the edge of my seat, riveted and throughly entertained.  The last two minutes of the film wasn't the strongest ending ever, but after hearing the trilogy rumors, I forgot my complaints about that.  This wasn't your typical Hollywood, leave it open ended for a sequel, it was planned.The Wachowski brothers are the new hot shot directors in the biz.  Between the independent Bound and now The Matrix, I see an innovative genius in their work.  They know how to blend classic themes and techniques keeping everything fresh and exciting.  I rank them with the short list of directors that I will draw me to a movie by name alone (Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppela among others on said list.)Lawrence Fishburn is solid as usual.  He looked like he was having fun during the filming which will always increase the quality of an actor's performance.  New comers to big budget features Carrie-Ann Moss and Hugo Weaving were great.  Moss was far more than just eye candy (though her patent leather costumes were to die for) and Weaving was truly sinister. Both should have a bright future in Hollywood.The special effects are top notch.  While I'm sure the Phantom Menace will amaze even more, the reported 60 million dollar budget makes what they did in The Matrix just that much more impressive.The Kung-Fu.....  Wow.  The choreography was amazing.  It was very apparent of the long hours of training that the actors spent during pre-production. They made Keanu, Lawrence and Hugo look like they had been doing martial arts for many years.All in all, one of the best movies I have ever seen and easily the best movie of recent years.  Not since Braveheart have I seen a film that has drawn me back for repeat viewings so  many times in its first few weeks of release.I give it a nine only because tens are ratings that I have only given out once or twice ever.A MUST SEE for any fan of the genre.

The last two minutes of the film wasn't the strongest ending ever, but after hearing the trilogy rumors, I forgot my complaints about that.
