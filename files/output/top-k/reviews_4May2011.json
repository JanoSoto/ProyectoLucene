[{"date":"4 May 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Danny Cannon direct's I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, a film that is senseless and unnecessary to have been made. The film attempts to come off as a decent sequel with a storyline which I believe was intended to be clever, but the film seems rather out of place and slightly offbeat from its successor. Jim Gillespie's I Know What You Did Last Summer was a different breed of horror genre basing it more on suspense, instead of the typical horror movie elements which deals with sex, drugs, and excessive gore. Moreso with a screenplay by Scream screenwriter Kevin Williamson, it couldn't go wrong. However Trey Callaway's screenplay for this predecessor has made the mood and setting in this film entirely different. Disregarding the style of the first film. Having said that there is still an entertainment value, as the film does have its moments of humour, cringing brutality, with a few cheap scares. But with no great or memorable chase scene and or well developed characters like in I Know What You Did Last Summer, the film is just a below average sequel and cash-in on the success of the first film. *1\/2 Stars Out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Danny Cannon direct's I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, a film that is senseless and unnecessary to have been made.
