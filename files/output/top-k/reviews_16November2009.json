All I can say is that I really liked this one.The story is very basic A well to do American couple (played by the inevitable James Stewart the lovely Doris Day) is vacationing in Morocco, where their son is kidnapped and taken to London. This is because the father stumbled upon some information about an assassination that is to take place in the near future. Of course they're not to inform the police, etc. They follow the trace of the hoodlums to London, where they try to rescue their son.As always in his films, Hitchcock excels in building the tension by using the conflicting worlds one world where everyone seems to act normal and business is as usual, while at the same time a drama unfolds. This kind of tension is often missing from modern day thrillers. Hitchcock also makes a great deal of the dilemma the parents are faced with. As the moment of the assassination draws nearer and nearer, they realize that the lives of two hang in the balance. This tension reaches its masterfull conclusion in the famous Royal Albert Hall sequence, where Day proves to be a very convincing leading lady. It's one of Hitchcock's best scenes (the obvious inspiration to Scorseses Key to Reserva).It is not one of Hitchcock's very best (it ends rather odd, not to say hasty and the storyline is not really brilliant anyway), but it is basically an almost flawless production. Scenery and cinematography are great and so are Stewart and Day. In fact I find them the best Hitchcock-couple I have seen so far (North by NW is close). Highly recommended to anyone who likes to enjoy good film-making.

This movie has it all - action, adventure, romance, comedy, suspense, witty dialogue, terrific acting, and a great plot. Set in the fictional Central European country of Bandrika (One of Europe's few undiscovered corners), THE LADY VANISHES details the trials and tribulations of one Iris Henderson (Margaret Lockwood), a world-weary sophisticate (I've had caviar at Cannes and played baccarat at Biarritz. What else is left for me but...marriage.) on her way home to an aristocratic fiancée about whom she seems unenthusiastic at best. On her last night in her Alpine hotel, she meets two people who will change her life a charming middle-aged spinster who calls herself Miss Froy, and an impoverished musicologist with a sarcastic mouth named Gilbert (Michael Redgrave in the role which made him an international star & you will see why!), whose company she immediately finds less-than-delightful - although she will change her tune soon enough...On the train the following day, Iris renews her acquaintance with Miss Froy during tea, only to awaken from a nap sometime later to be told by everyone around her that there was no Miss Froy. After a totally fruitless attempt to garner support from the other first-class passengers (all of whom have seen Miss Froy and all of whom deny it for different reasons of their own), Iris decides to take up the search herself, running into Gilbert and reluctantly enlisting his help. At first, Gilbert is merely humoring Iris, and he too comes to the conclusion that she is delusional after she pulls the emergency brake in a rage and faints...but then, he stumbles across a bit of evidence which proves to him that Iris is telling the truth and since she is, that there must be something very, very suspicious unfolding on the train. From this point on the movie goes into high-gear, becoming the mother of all action films, chock full of kidnappings, chase scenes, battles-of-wits, shootouts, and last-minute escapes. Don't worry - if it all sounds complicated, it isn't - I just don't want to spoil the many marvelous plot twists! Perhaps not until 1963's THE BIRDS would Hitchcock have as many delightful character roles as he does here, with an Italian spy, an adulterous couple, an imperious Baroness, a sinister psychoanalyst, and a nun with inappropriate footwear all playing their parts in the unfolding adventure. Special mention should go to the team of Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford as Caldecott and Charters - a pair of dimwitted, xenophobic, sports-obsessed English gentlemen whose definition of catastrophe is being unable to learn the scores of the latest cricket matches but who can be trusted to do the right thing in a tight spot. They are delightful comic relief and play these stereotypical roles with such ease and chemistry between them that they themselves were elevated to stardom in the UK and spent the next decade replaying similar characters in a host of other movies, even doing a few films where they took top billing. Looked at from the point of view of today, the film exudes a very peculiar atmosphere - the atmosphere of Europe in 1938, of a world about to end and a terrible time to come - but Hitchcock accomplishes this by indirect means. The terrifying political situation of Europe in 1938 is never referred to directly, except to make a ironic joke. Bandrika itself could be any of the countries which were drawn into the Third Reich (the Bandrikan language is, for those who are curious, NOT an actual language but a combination of modern Italian, Hungarian, Greek and German filtered through Pig Latin) and in a way it is all of them. But one doesn't watch this movie for a history lesson - THE LADY VANISHES is one of the all-time great pieces of cinematic entertainment, as fresh, witty, exciting and pleasing today as it was 70 years ago. Every time I watch this film to study its construction, I get caught up in the irresistible flow of the story and skip the analysis in favor of a rollicking good time!

The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms.In 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13\/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that.

But something more was needed than just two concurrent stories with the same characters and same actors and good writing could have avoided farce, and we could have had a great deal more tension as we wondered if the two universes would intersect rather than it being established pretty quickly that this was just two different options proceeding relentlessly without letup.

Be warned - this is not a film for the faint of heart, and you probably won't want to sit through this more than once, because in this case, once is definitely enough. FRENZY in many ways brings Hitchcock full circle, back to THE LODGER in 1926 - the setting is London and the tale concerns a man falsely accused of murder - but whose suspicious behavior makes him an excellent suspect. Unlike THE LODGER however, our protagonist, Richard Blaney (superbly played by Jon Finch) is one of Hitchcock's least sympathetic central characters. A veteran (of precisely which war is never stated) of the RAF, the down-on-his luck Blaney seems unable to reintegrate himself into civilian life (we might say today that Blaney is obviously suffering from PTSD) with any success. He is highly intelligent, but impatient, rude, aggressive, pride-filled and generally disliked by everyone around him except his current girlfriend, a barmaid called Babs (Anna Massey), and his ex-wife, Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt), who still has a soft spot for him - which will lead to some very unfortunate consequences for them both. The only other friend Blaney has in the world is Bob Rusk (Barry Foster), a Covent Garden greengrocer. Rusk's apparent kindness to his friend, as we shall see, is in fact nothing of the sort...As the story opens, London is being terrorized by a serial killer nicknamed the Necktie Murderer for his particular choice of strangulation device. We are led to believe that Blaney is the killer, but this is quickly revealed to be a bit of Hitchcockian misdirection when Brenda Blaney is brutally raped and murdered before our very eyes - by the mild-mannered greengrocer! This particular scene is without doubt the most hideous, ugly scene in any Hitchcock film. Rather than glamorize the assault through a fetishized presentation of a beautiful actress in peril (see DIAL M FOR MURDER or PSYCHO), Brenda Blaney's death is presented under flat office lighting and we are forced to endure it in real time. Afterwards, due to an unfortunate sequence of events, Blaney finds himself arrested and convicted as the Necktie Murderer, while we of course know him to be innocent. Blaney knows that Rusk is the real murderer, and he breaks out of prison to catch and kill the man who framed him. He is prevented from doing so only by Inspector Oxford (Alec McCowen) of Scotland Yard, who, unbeknownst to Blaney, has been on Rusk's trail for some time. FRENZY disturbs because the wrongly accused man, is a far from sympathetic character. Blaney is crude, violent and selfish, is certainly capable of murder, and indeed, we see him sink to Rusk's level by the end of the film. On the other hand, the actual killer, like PSYCHO's Norman Bates, seems like a calm, generous man who loves flowers and fruit, and has things to give, but is actually a volcano of rage and hate. These complex characterizations leave the viewer in an uneasy frame of mind, as we are forced out of our usual Hollywood good guys-bad guys conditioning to identify with characters who are morally ambiguous, to say the least! The film's treatment of women is also horrifying. The rape-murder of Brenda Blaney is indeed drawn out to a near-excruciating length. The camera dwells on the sight of Brenda's violation and strangling with an unbearable explicitness. Brenda wears a pale green sheath similar to Melanie's dress in THE BIRDS, and it seems that Hitchcock symbolically extinguished the figure of the chilly blonde who preoccupied him for so long. Also, FRENZY makes a constant connection between women, food, sex, filth and pollution that is as repugnant as it is thought-provoking. Look for the perfect comic relief provided by Inspector Oxford's ditzy wife, who serves her husband gourmet French meals which are totally inedible! FRENZY fascinates because it is so well-made, so elegantly directed, and so humorous. Our emotions are quite spectacularly manipulated by this film - you will find yourself cringing in revulsion one moment and laughing out loud the next, and this strange dichotomy makes for a - to say the least - unique viewing experience. Special kudos must go to Jean Marsh as Brenda Blaney's secretary - look out for a scene where her powers of recall stun the police, to which she replies, In my work, I've learnt to keep a sharp eye on men. Hitchcock's eyes were never sharper & at 70-plus, he gave us a film whose dark perspective will haunt your mind and make you wonder whether or not everything we like to tell ourselves about humanity is nothing but a bad joke.

Needing money fast, Evans gets thrown a financial lifeline when a reward is offered to escort a recently captured outlaw, Ben Wade Glenn Ford, on to the 310 train to Yuma prison. But as Wade's gang closes in to free the shackled outlaw, and the clock starts to tick down, Evans finds himself torn between a sense of social duty and an easy option courtesy of Wade's mind game offer.Based on a story by Elmore Leonard, this is a tight and tense Western that harks to the wonderful High Noon five years earlier. Directed by Delmer Daves, 310 To Yuma sees two of the Western genre's most undervalued performers come together in perfect contrast. Heflin's Evans is honest, almost saintly; but ultimately filling out his life with dullness and too much of a safe approach. Ford's Wade is the other side of the coin, ruthless the opening sequence sets it up, handsome and very self-confident. This coupling makes for an interesting story-one that thankfully delivers royally on its set-up. As Wade's gang closes in, led by a sleek and mean Richard Jaeckel, Wade toys with Evans, offering him financial gain and gnawing away at him about his abilities as a husband, the tension is palpable in the extreme. Nothing is ever certain until the credits role, and that is something that is never to be sniffed at in the Western genre.The comparison with High Noon is a fair one because 310 To Yuma also deals with the man alone scenario. A man left alone to deal with his adversaries and his own conscience; money or pride indeed. Daves' direction is gritty and suitably claustrophobic, with close ups either being erotically charged watch out for Felicia Farr's scenes with Ford in the saloon or tightly wound in room 207 of the hotel; where Heflin & Ford positively excel. His outdoor work, aided by Charles Lawton Jr's photography, also hits the spot, particularly the barren land desperate for water to invigorate it. While the piece also has a tremendous George Duning theme song warbled (and whistled by Ford in the film) by Frankie Laine. Great acting, great direction and a great involving story; essential for fans of character driven Westerns. 8.5\/10Footnote The film was very well remade in 2007 with two of the modern era's finest leading men, Russell Crowe & Christian Bale, in the dual roles of Ben & Dan respectively. One hopes, and likes to think, that they remade it purely because it was such a great premise to work from. Because Daves' film didn't need improving, it was, and still is, a great film showcasing how great this often maligned genre can sometimes be.

Would it be easy for us to look at the other side of the coin?

At the time of course, I thought it was amazing and couldn't wait for a sequel to come out. But when I asked several years later, it turned out that their had already been other Star Wars movies, which I promptly watched and enjoyed. Then I compared Episode 1 to the originals and realised that the originals were leaps and bounds ahead of the new Star Wars. In fact, I soon realised that Episode 1 had a lot of flaws and I just forgot about it completely.Recently however, I re-watched the movie again on TV and whilst the flaws were apparent I realised that this Star Wars actually had some things going for it. The flaws of this movie have been addressed on over a million occasions so I'll focus on the positive points mostly.Here are some points I want to bring up, some negative some positive.1) The acting. Some of the actors do try very hard to give a good performance, i.e Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. Both of whom are very good actors and try their best with the scripts they have been given. However, even though the Star Wars prequels have gained notoriety for their truly awful and cringe-worthy dialogue. The Phantom Menace is probably the least cringey movie in terms of dialogue out of the prequels. There are no moments where you start shouting 'Noooooo' at the screen, except for two particular characters which I'm just about to get to.2) Anakin Skywalker. A number of people consider Jake Lloyd to be the reason that Anakin is such a terrible character, but I myself blame George Lucas. Anakin serves almost no purpose in this movie. Why is he even in this movie? I know Lucas must have wanted to throw some homages in, which he does successfully with Yoda and Jabba the Hut. However Anakin is not necessary and is portrayed as one of the most unlikeable and annoying children in cinema history. Bad choice Lucas, bad choice.3) JarJar Binks. What a lame, cringe-worthy and pathetic excuse for a character. Lucas has created characters like this in the original trilogy, with far more success. I'm talking about C-3PO, in the originals he was always getting into absurd situations and managed to be annoying in a GOOD way. But JarJar Binks just has no appeal whatsoever as a character and should have lost the stereotyped Jamaican accent. The only good thing I can say on behalf of JarJar is that he does play a role in the plot. He isn't just (horrifically failed) comic relief.4) CGI. This was made in 1999, a year before the new millennium so cgi was an inevitable inclusion. However the cgi in this film is not terrible. It was nice to see a non-cgi Yoda for the last time and also George Lucas uses the cgi in a way to improve the story and introduce new landscapes. The only scene of gratuitous cgi was the pod race scene. It looked cool for the first lap, then it just got boring.I personally don't think that the Star Wars prequels are terrible, well okay they are terrible when you dissect them and discuss them at great length. However they do have good watch-ability factor, JarJar, Jake Lloyd and bad dialogue aside.I rate this movie 6\/10 for the potential that it has and for the things that it has going for it. I don't think that it's in league with the originals, how could it be? I believe that prequels are often doomed from the beginning. Movies which HAVE to end a certain way often have a lot of restrictions and have difficulty turning out the way people want them to. However taking this into account, I think Lucas did okay.

I watched it for the first time during the first half of 2006. By then, I had seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Hughes' teen comedy released the year before this adult one, which I thought was funny, and knowing Planes, Trains & Automobiles was also a widely appealing comedy, I was expecting it to be funny as well. As a result, it was far from disappointing to me, as I found it hilarious for the most part! It took me 3 ½ years to get around to watching it again, but a second viewing definitely didn't change my opinion.Neal Page is an uptight advertising executive who is on a business trip in New York and really wants to get home to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving. First, he hails a cab for a ride to the airport, but the ride is taken by another passenger. At the airport, he meets the guy who took his ride, who turns out to be a motor mouth. On the plane, the ad exec meets this guy for the third time, having to sit beside him! The motor mouth introduces himself as Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman, and continues to get on Neal's nerves. Unfortunately, Neal's bad luck isn't about to end. Due to inclement weather in Chicago, the plane lands in Wichita, Kansas instead, and the two of them find themselves stuck there for the night! From here, Neal's frustrating journey continues, as he faces a number of mishaps, often because of Del's clumsiness, and is unable to ever get away from the shower curtain ring salesman for very long as they are both forced to try more than one mode of transport! The lead roles in this energetic comedy are played by Steve Martin and John Candy, and these two comedians really carry the film. Candy really stands out in the role of a loud and clumsy but well-meaning and lovable character. He is deservedly remembered as a great comedian, and his role here is one he has been widely remembered for since his premature death over fifteen years ago. Martin also contributes a lot to the humour in this movie, with his irritated faces and freak-outs. Planes, Trains & Automobiles is made continuously funny (very often hilarious) with Neal's constant bad luck, Del getting on Neal's nerves with his chattering and clumsiness, some slapstick mishaps, etc. Also, it isn't ALL about the laughs, as there is also character depth, and it sometimes gets poignant, especially during the last bit of the film. These things added to all the hilarious gags make a great combination, and a great film! John Candy passed away in 1994 at the age of 43, and John Hughes, who wrote, directed, and produced this movie, left us a little over three months ago at 59, the age Candy would have turned last month. Both deaths were caused by heart attacks. Even though I was about 7 ½ years old when Candy died, and I never heard of him until later in the 90's, to me it seems kind of strange that he's been gone that long. With Planes, Trains & Automobiles, both Hughes and Candy really showed their talent, and may they both R.I.P. Steve Martin obviously deserves credit for his performance in this hit 80's comedy as well, and so do some of the cast members who played smaller roles. If this wacky comedy and partial drama isn't quite perfect, it does come close, and for me, watching it twice made it clear that it's not one of those films that are just good for one viewing!

She could have been dropped and I wouldn't have noticed. They could have developed Dennis Ratkin more, but he is the best human character as it is.

And that other girl, Katrina or whatever her name is, is quite unidimensional (huh, looks like the female characters need some polishing in this movie).However, the main plot and the story device (most salient is the invented Black Zodiac signs) are pretty good, and the ghosts' design is pretty creative. They could have been scarier or darker, but they are good enough and well developed. In fact, the reason why I bought the DVD was because of the extras where the history of each ghost is revealed. It's one of my favorite easter eggs in a movie, hands down. The creepiest character by far is not a ghost, but the kid! What does that say? A brat being all psyched up by a decloplotated (read decapitated) man near a donut store? What the hell? Maybe if they have pushed this kid more into the dark side during the whole movie, it would have had scarier moments. Perhaps he could have been brainwashed by the Latin chants and become some sort of a lure for his parent and sister to be drawn to the ghosts or something.Oh, and my favorite scene is the intro (where the Juggernaut is caught). The only truly suspenseful moment of the movie.Anyways, good flick, good story, amazing concept of the twelve ghosts. 7\/10, because it could have been better, to be honest.

In the late 1960's, Schlesinger won an Oscar for Best Director in the classic Midnight Cowboy and has been nominated for many more during that period. Then his star status slowly began to plummet. With Marathon Man being his best in the 1970's and Believers has his best work in the 1980's, and in the 1990 season, he has been reduced to shifting into mediocrity with Pacific Heights (though Michael Keaton was was very sharp). It would be safe to say that around this time, Schlesinger's best days have long past him. That is until 1996, when he released his forth film in the 1990's, the gripping, morbid and vengeful drama, Eye for an Eye. Leading star Sally Field plays mother Karen McCann, a loving and devoted mother who while stuck in a hectic traffic jam receives the news via cell phone that her teenage daughter (Olivia Burnette)has been raped and murdered by some deranged lunatic. Robert Doob (Kiefer Sutherland) who was charged and arrested for this dastardly deed, is let go due a technical glitch. Karen, feels it is her own destiny to track down this evil man before he attempts to commit the same act to another unfortunate soul. Det. Denillo (Joe Mantegna) can't help her in her dilemma, which leads to Doob walking freely and on the hunt again and found another victim to rape and kill. Her motives keeps her apart from her husband Mack (Ed Harris) as her revenge becomes an obsession to the point where she decides to handle the situation, personally.

In the late 1960's, Schlesinger won an Oscar for Best Director in the classic Midnight Cowboy and has been nominated for many more during that period. Then his star status slowly began to plummet. With Marathon Man being his best in the 1970's and Believers has his best work in the 1980's, and in the 1990 season, he has been reduced to shifting into mediocrity with Pacific Heights (though Michael Keaton was was very sharp). It would be safe to say that around this time, Schlesinger's best days have long past him. That is until 1996, when he released his forth film in the 1990's, the gripping, morbid and vengeful drama, Eye for an Eye. Leading star Sally Field plays mother Karen McCann, a loving and devoted mother who while stuck in a hectic traffic jam receives the news via cell phone that her teenage daughter (Olivia Burnette)has been raped and murdered by some deranged lunatic. Robert Doob (Kiefer Sutherland) who was charged and arrested for this dastardly deed, is let go due a technical glitch. Karen, feels it is her own destiny to track down this evil man before he attempts to commit the same act to another unfortunate soul. Det. Denillo (Joe Mantegna) can't help her in her dilemma, which leads to Doob walking freely and on the hunt again and found another victim to rape and kill.

It was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. At the end of the decade Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup.That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. In this film Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay.The city's top mobster Big Boy Caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition. The film opens with him rubbing out Lips Manlis's henchmen in a Valentine Massacre style shooting and then Lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat. But Caprice's moves are making him a target for Tracy.In the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple Caprice himself. Will our hero sort out this thicket of crime?The spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author Chester Gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham, you've got to love this film.Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but any of these guys could have, it's only that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time. Only Beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. Dick Tracy won Oscars for Best Art&Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact he was even able to get somebody like Sondheim to write a score for this film only shows Sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. As for Madonna, the Material Girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer Breathless Mahoney.Before this film, Dick Tracy movies were consigned to the B pictures and worse as Saturday afternoon serials. The only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for Armed Forces Radio during World War II that got to vinyl. Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, and the Andrews Sisters? Try and find a recording of that gem.Until then Warren Beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely.

But novelty does not equal brilliance.Henry Fonda is the title character, a club musician named Manny Balestrero mistakenly pegged for a hold-up man while trying to borrow some money from his wife Rose's (Vera Miles) life insurance policy. The arrest forces Manny to not only prove his innocence but fight to keep his family intact.Bleak and dour is the best way to describe this movie. Every step a journey in darkness is the trailer's tagline, and it is only a slight exaggeration. Hitchcock even does a voice-over telling us how unusual a story this is for him to tackle, because every word of it is true.The problem with The Wrong Man is the way it makes real life feel like a trip to the dentist's. Fonda feels wrong in the central role, not because he is not a convincing everyman but because he seems so uncomfortable in his own skin. Even before he is charged with anything we watch him regard his surroundings with a strange, strained, sheepish smile. Prison doesn't seem much of a change.Hitchcock fans might enjoy this detour into Kazan territory (minus the method acting) for the way it sets up some unique camera work. Sequences of Fonda's head revolving inside a lens and later of him seen through a cell latch hole get much of the attention, but just as interesting, and more in keeping with the realistic aesthetic, are the numerous POV and high-angle shots that play up the claustrophobia in less showy ways.I have a hard time understanding how people might view The Wrong Man as an underrated masterpiece. The central story is too thin, takes way too long to develop, and is resolved with offhanded ease following one of the least interesting trial sequences ever shot. Hitchcock himself seems to lose interest in it, going full-tilt into a second story about Rose's mental meltdown. Miles certainly has effective moments in her spotlight scenes, enough to make one wonder what she would have done with the part she was offered in Vertigo, but her crack-up as written is too abrupt and capped by a laughably pat end frame.Once you get used to his no-frills performance, Fonda is interesting to watch in his offbeat way, and the secondary players are all good. Especially worthy of notice are Harold J. Stone as the lead detective in the Balestrero case and Doreen Lang as maybe the most awful of the many awful witnesses gathered by police.That the police make so many mistakes is undoubtedly the point Hitchcock wants to make here, and there are times where the frightening arbitrariness of life grabbing one by the throat is made very real. Just when you thought it was safe to walk into the insurance office could be this film's tag line.But after a few scenes of this, I was ready to move on. Hitch, alas, was not, and The Wrong Man suffers for it.

Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it. A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in college those days in the nineties. In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back 'for me its rocky', he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes. I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends. It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out of my jail. I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it already and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..AND i expect some of my friends also did it. This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans. I hope that answers some of your doubts...... This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living.
