Spoofs are, by their very definition, subversive and deliberately comic in their attitudes towards popular generic convention. A characteristic of popular generic convention includes that of the sequel; that of the franchise; that of the series &#x96; when a spoof is produced, and it's as amusing as the first Austin Powers film was, it cannot be anything but both thoroughly shameful and wholly hypocritical to induce the continued adventures of its hero. Is it not wholly detrimental to the original notion and a complete anomaly? Was there a joke or a sight gag that was missed the first time round that the audience really ought to have seen? The answer is No - at least it is to the last of those three questions. For everything else, the response ought to come in the form of a mumbled agreement that Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me is a bit of a waste of time and just not particularly funny.The 'spoof' in question in Austin Powers was that of the Bond franchise; something which was playfully mocked without ever really being thoroughly undermined anyway nastily. But hold on, for in spite of the evident references to Oddjob and the master villain stroking his white cat, what was it about the film that so evidently made it a Bond spoof? If it was at all, it was subtle; the references were dropped in around amusing scenes depicting Powers try to win at blackjack with a 5. The pastiche is here a hundred times more aggressive and, as a consequence, a hundred times less funny. True, one cannot help but chuckle at the opening ballad being belted out in the mould of a Shirley Bassey theme tune but a mere few of the references here go an awfully long way. You need not be anybody in particular to notice that International Man of Mystery was never intended to have a sequel. For our troubles of sitting through some of the less-bearable sequences in said 1997 feature, we get what is essentially a lazier; cruder and more infantile film than before which makes the golden error of thinking that because it's a comedy playing on something popular, and by definition things that are most popular in contemporary cinema are often crass and infantile, it thinks it has to provide us with a film that is as puerile and often as disgusting as The Spy Who Shagged Me is.Shamelessly defiling everything that made the first one the solid experience it was, we begin on the honeymoon of the titular Austin Powers (Myers) and his bride Vanessa Kensington and witness the film throw us a vicious curveball in revealing Hurley's character to have been a robotic imposter all along. I think we'd invested a certain amount of energy and time in these people, we witnessed them begin their relationship on contemptible grounds, as varied attitudes towards sex from different eras clashed, before seeing them come to quite like one another after a series of instances wherein Powers turns down the offer for sex from a drunk Kensington and they end up saving the world together.In spite of all that, how does Powers react to the revelation? Why, to celebrate. Myers' other creation, the hunched Dr. Evil whose appearance was always designed to call to mind the best of the Blofeld depictions in Donald Pleasance's is back. Where freezing oneself in time so as to be thawed in the future and wreak havoc in the era was the idea before, the notion of time travel is here ill-advisedly introduced into proceedings - one is reminded of that line from Michael Hanke's Funny Games when, upon observing a character in possession of a shotgun ideally used to quell the reign of terror being inflicted upon him, the primeval component of that film's antagonistic force merely grins and utters words along the lines of Oh, you've brought us a new toy... What unfolds is essentially a reversing of the joke that was the whole point of International Man of Mystery in the first place; that is to say, removing people from the 1960's and placing them in the 90's for shock and amusement. The gag, of course, revolved around how sensible and chaste we all were in the modern world where, before, we couldn't keep out of one another's beds. The reality is actually the other way around, but the idea of this swinging 60's rouge from London being catapulted to modern Las Vegas worked to a basic degree. Here, Evil and Powers dart back to the 60's again; Evil to steal Powers' inherent sexual prowess while he's still frozen (prior to events from the first film) and Powers to ultimately stop him. Of course, the film realises how shallow all this is and by the end opts for a sub-narrative revolving around a giant laser Dr. Evil is to shoot from space to see it home.Where one was perhaps tempted to genuinely think Hurley's character might work for the government in the first film, and her resistance to Powers' initial advances saw her informed enough to batter each of them away, the female accomplice here is the opposite. Practically begging for sex from the off, Heather Graham's American agent Felicity Shagwell fulfils the role of what is essentially eye-candy to Hurley's (dare we say it?) actual characterisation. The dynamic of their relationship reads where before, Kensington wouldn't take what Powers wanted to give he is now stuck not being able to receive what Shagwell is crying out to provide. For that to be your central joke, on top of everything else that's wrong with it, means that this is a messy entry indeed.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"24 September 2013","score":"","review":" I suspect that this book is a very hard book to turn into a film, in particular with the hallucination that Jesus has at the end of the film where he comes down from the cross and lives his life as a good man. The problem with this is that it is difficult to portray this section of the film as an hallucination, and thus when we get to the final scene where he repents, it feels as if time is suddenly rewound and that he gets to change the decision that he originally made (or appeared to make) and that is to come down off of the cross.We are all probably aware that when this film was released there was a huge amount of controversy over the film, namely coming from a segment of society that really did not understand what Kazantzakis was exploring, and they simply took the film at face value. This to me is not surprising since the segment of society that were outraged at this film tends to also read the entire bible literally and sit down and try to map out future events based upon the books of Revelation and Daniel. There particular people simply do not understand allegory, and would not see allegory even if it smacked them in the face.However, this film is not a Christian film, it is a gnostic film. The reason I say that is because it deals with the struggle between the spirit and the flesh, and this is outlined right at the beginning of the film. The story uses the life of Christ to explore this struggle. The idea is that that which is of the spirit is good and that which is of the flesh is evil, and as such anything pertaining to the flesh, and in turn, to the physical world, exists to drag us away from the purity of the spirit. Thus, to reach enlightenment, one must reject the physical and embrace the spiritual.The bible does not necessarily see things that way at the bible sees the spiritual and the physical world as being intertwined and evil exists both in the spiritual and physical world, in the same way the goodness also exists in both realms. The biblical view of marriage and of sex is that it is a good thing that should be embraced, but not to the point that it overwhelms our lives and distracts us from the spiritual. In the same way the one should not wonder around rejecting the physical and focusing on the spiritual because in the end one loses connection with humanity and the world, and thus is no good for anybody.While the main focus of the film is the temptation that Christ experiences on the cross, which is the last temptation (and the bible does have him tempted in that way when the crowds cry out to him to come down from the cross and prove that he is the Son of God), the lead up to this scene has him experiencing numerous temptations as well. For instance there is the temptation to become a political leader as opposed to a spiritual leader, and this temptation takes the form of Judas throughout the film.What we also have in this film is that Jesus does not know or understand his destiny at the beginning. In a way Jesus journeys from being a simply man who does a despicable job, to becoming the Son of God. He actually does not realise that his destiny is the cross until he actually comes closer to the cross. Granted, he begins making crosses for the Romans, but that is a reflection of his destiny that he does not understand. Further, he begins by asking forgiveness for his sins namely because he does not understand his nature and who he is. We see this journey as he tries various means, to come to an understanding of what his destiny is, and even angers Judas by repeatedly changing his mind.I guess this film is very much reflective of our own journeys through life, whether we be Christian or not. It is interesting that when Jesus meets with Paul near the end and rebukes him for his lies, Paul simply responds that the truth is irrelevant and it really comes down to what people want to believe, The reality of the death and resurrection is actually irrelevant because what people want is hope and what the resurrection offers is hope. Those who go around attacking and destroying Christianity really have no hope and are only doing that to take hope away from people. In the end we spend our time (or even waste our time) arguing for the reality of the resurrection, when in the end it is irrelevant &#x96; if somebody wants to believe then they will believe whether it is true or not.It reminds me of some of my experiences in church. My faith not only gives me hope, it also gives me freedom. In the end that freedom does not come through the reality of the resurrection, but it comes through the fact that I have faith and that I trust God at his word. However, there are many inside the church and out that want to take that hope and that freedom away from you, and they will try to undermine you at every corner to try and do that. The thing is that we simply cannot let them do that because the reason they are doing that is because they are jealous that they do not have the hope or the freedom that you have.

When this movie came out, I was 5. It wasn't like I was going to watch it because all of my friends suggested it, in fact none of my friends have even heard of it. It was just myself in my big house, dark outside, and the TV screen playing. I was ready&#x85; well as ready as I could be. I was confused from minute one to minute one forty-seven. To me, the story made no sense. There were a variety of different characters, with different stories and problems throughout the film. What made it worse about understanding the different characters conflicts is that, each scene would basically cut off and not have an ending. It never felt like each scene was final. It go to a scene of Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Harring) then just transfer to Justin (Adam Kesher) talking to a group of people around a table. I honestly wish I could tell you the story line, but I, myself don't even quite understand. Before watching this movie, I read a summary that one line stuck with me. In a twisting venture beyond dreams and reality. Thinking of that one line throughout the film really made me wonder was this all reality or dreams? Then it started to remind of the movie Memento. I took the idea of Memento and the review this being reality or a dream and decided that since I was so confused that it had to be a mix of both. Meaning that not everything was chronological and instead of it being a dream, it was all a nightmare. The nightmare is from the dark type of film and the actual darkness in the film.The lighting, was very unique. It always had a darkness to it, like it was comparing itself to the darkness of the movie. It would always get dark when it was either leading up to something or when something 'bad' was occurring. Which made it predictable after awhile that you knew something was going to happen. Maybe not exactly what every time but what it could be. The only time it was actually light, was when the characters were outside on the streets. Otherwise there was some type of darkness to each scene.With that being said, the sound was quite interesting in this movie. Most of the time it was silent of everything else except the background noise. This means cars on the street, the sound of people going by, which can be natural but they made it occur very loudly and having no other type of sound during that time period. It would either be that, a character talking, or mysterious music leading up to something. Every time it got really dark, that typical creepy\/mysterious music played I knew something was bound to happen. I am not one to watch creepy movies, I actually get scared very easily but after awhile due to it happening a lot it just got annoying. When a movie gets predictable it really isn't fun to watch.For sure, not everything was predictable. Since this movie like I said multiple times was, confusing to me, I felt like I was totally missing something. It caused me to pay attention more and really only try to focus on the movie. Basically to see if I could get 'context clues' or just realize what I wasn't getting at first. As you may guess, it didn't really help. The storyline of the movie, not my favorite because I really couldn't comprehend it. Maybe if I understood it better and really got the concept I would enjoy it. I want to suggest watching it a second time, right after the end might help, but I didn't do that. After it was over, I felt relieved.BUT...I really liked the way it was filmed. They would change shots, angles, and perspectives a lot. Now you probably wouldn't notice, unless you were looking for it which is great. That means it was done well. They would switch to what the character would see in their perspective to the characters reaction. It gave me more information, and it was less guessing I had to do!I really believe they did a great job of filming, sounds, and editing the movie. With that being said, that really only shows to people who are looking for it, like me. Did I like the movie? No. Did I hate the movie? No. It was more grasping the underlying problem. I wouldn't go suggest everyone to watch it, but if someone wanted to I wouldn't tell them absolutely not! Everyone thinks different and may understand it in a totally different than I did. Who knows, maybe the director, David Lynch made it like that on purpose. The point was to leave you confused trying to understand it in your own way. It just wasn't a movie that got my attention (except when I was trying to focus EXTRA hard), and I would never pick this movie out of a choice. That is also something to consider. If I was given movies to watch, this type of mysterious\/drama movie is not my type of genre so it would be a last choice of mine. Also watching this at the age of sixteen, is different than watching it at the age of sixty. So many different things play a role in the understanding and opinion of the movie.No matter what, I still really enjoyed the shot, and angles of this movie.

With that being said, that really only shows to people who are looking for it, like me. Did I like the movie? No. Did I hate the movie? No. It was more grasping the underlying problem. I wouldn't go suggest everyone to watch it, but if someone wanted to I wouldn't tell them absolutely not! Everyone thinks different and may understand it in a totally different than I did. Who knows, maybe the director, David Lynch made it like that on purpose. The point was to leave you confused trying to understand it in your own way. It just wasn't a movie that got my attention (except when I was trying to focus EXTRA hard), and I would never pick this movie out of a choice. That is also something to consider. If I was given movies to watch, this type of mysterious\/drama movie is not my type of genre so it would be a last choice of mine. Also watching this at the age of sixteen, is different than watching it at the age of sixty. So many different things play a role in the understanding and opinion of the movie.No matter what, I still really enjoyed the shot, and angles of this movie. To me, that was the best part of it, which made it semi bearable to watch. Meaning that I was focusing more on how it was filmed, then what was being filmed.

Giving the viewers an inside look at a typical split up family with major problems that can be fixed, with a touch of love and explaining to do. From the entire eye catching scenes to the amazing roles being played, thus created a story worth watching. The Parent Trap is a family video that involves two young twin girls Hallie and Annie, both being played by Lindsay Lohan, who never knew they were twins until they both attend the same camp at the same time. Without knowing they were twin sisters, the competition was on and a series of pranks were being pulled on each other. With all that happen they were brought closer than they could have ever imagine, and it just so happened to be a life changing experience for them both. Meanwhile, trying to restore what they have missed out about the other parent, they decided to switch places, I'll teach you to be me, and you can teach me to be you, quoted by Hallie Parker. With all of the chaotic planning, switching of homes, and getting rid of the soon to be evil step mother, the two girls bring everyone together as one big family again. One important factor in having a good film is to see if the acting seems natural, without it being too awkward or overboard. In the film the young Lindsey Lohan played both of her characters very well, knowing that in reality she's not a twin, but pulling it off as if she really was a twin. One of the main roles in the movie was to speak in a British accent in which Lohan spoked it flawlessly. Another two character that gave this movie a little romance in the air were Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson) and Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid). Asides from Quaid's good looks and stunning blue eyes, we catch Richardson and Quaid eye locking in scenes that really did seem like they were meant to be after all. Another important element is the plot. Overall this movie was pretty easy to understand giving the viewer's good details, like the switching up places. The producer gave a very good two to three minutes just showing the twins teaching each other how to be each other. The flow of the storyline was smooth and the scenes transitioned easily. After all The Parent Trap is a comedy based genre, giving a family a good laugh out of it. It's not completely boring to watch, because all the action and the teasing keeps the film entertaining. Like when the soon to be stepmother woke up in the middle of the lake and getting attacked by a bird, the viewer's definitely knew who planned all of this. Asides from one happy ending, this movie is inspiring to us all, because of how each of the characters never gave up. It only showed us of them striving to be one big family again, by how convincing the characters might of been.

The star-studded cast, lead by the likes of Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, and Ted Knight, excellently meshes to form the great underdog story of Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe). Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) perfectly fits the typical country club hot-shot but oddly enough, is one of the most likable figures due to his generosity and fun-going personality. His nemesis in the film is the cheap and uptight Judge Smails (Ted Knight) who tries to encourage young Danny Noonan to go for the esteemed caddy scholarship. What truly makes the film a classic is the slew of one-line jokes, supported by a tremendous cast, excellent originality, and admirable animations, which are easily able to recite and hilarious in many different settings.Caddyshack can be better thought of as many small movies put together, never really developing a plot but instead, letting the actors' brilliance control the true comedy. In this case, it really worked. Director Harold Ramis uses Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield's hilarious antics combined with Chevy Chase's laid-back, lovable nature to keep the dull moments few and far between. The way Ramis gives each individual character their own time to shine makes them all likable and gives the urge to experience more with each and every one. This phenomenal cast leaves you looking for a sequel, or at least to be a part of the typical, and at the same time hysterical, day at Bushwood Country Club.The film's originality draws you into new territory in the comedy world. No other film of its kind previously chartered the waters of pure amusement at a relatively serious setting, Bushwood Country Club. On any given day, one can find the slob groundskeeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) using extreme tactics such as dynamite to take down the likes of the enemy varmint gopher or a slew of Al Czervik's caddies watching television from the side of his enormous golf bag right in the middle of the fairway.Being from 1980 and not having the same technological capabilities of our modern era, the movie excels in the animations department. Some action scenes are even ahead of their time, including the fire shooting through the gophers' hole as it tries to frantically escape the blaze set off by the crazy groundskeeper Carl Spackler. Another includes Al Czervik using a video game like putter to automatically make shots. Both of which produce laughs that will last for days.Ramis' genius script includes the one-liners that can be laughed at in almost any setting. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) is the master of this; don't sell yourself short judge, you're a tremendous slouch. Lines like this and others such as Al Czervik's he called me a baboon, he thinks I'm his wife can be funny regardless of context, but when put in action by the characters and their individual interactions, they become hysterical.

With the American Navy unable to launch their own recuse operation they hire an oil drilling crew working on an experimental underwater oil platform. The US SEALs, the crew and the platform's designer, Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) personalities start to clash underworld, with the SEALs' leader, Lt. Coffey (Michael Biehn) suffering from pressure madness, America and the Soviet Union moving closer to war and the potential discovery of alien life in the depths the ocean.The Abyss is a very tight, claustrophobic thriller which is very much about paranoid and distrust like The Thing and about the delicate state the world was in during the Cold War. The Abyss is a very character driven film, with all the characters being very distinct and memorial. I personally feared that some of the characters were going to only defined by their quirks or traits such as one of them being a conspiracy theorist and has a pet rat and other one is a woman in a cowboy hat and listens to country music, but the characters slowly get more fleshed out and likable as the film progress, particularly the relationship between Lindsey and Bud (Ed Harris). The team is as memorable as the Marines in Aliens, but there still leave an impression. Compared to most of Cameron's filmography, The Abyss is an action light film and more like a sci-fi film of old. As already mentioned that The Abyss does share similarities to The Thing because of its themes and basic settling (a group of highly trained personnel isolated in an extreme environment). At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010 The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament.For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them.Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence.The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens.The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

At the end of the special edition The Abyss in the Special Edition also shares a lot of similarities to The Day the Earth Stood Still, with a little bit of 2010 The Year We Made Contact near the end and this is when Cameron goes on his soapbox about war and nuclear disarmament.For the time the special effects were incredible, using a combination of models and minitures and CGI. The water effects particularly hold up, especially when you still see water effect being very hard to do, like in The Last Airbender. The aliens too also had a unique design, looking like glowing stringrays with the pink, purple and blue lights and the aliens themselves had a mix of a classic grey alien look with more colour to them.Composer Alan Silverstri was also able to add to the visuals with an excellent score, using many different styles. There were heavy drums for the military to a softer choir when we see the aliens are present, giving them a divine presence.The Abyss is a long film and the Special Edition is over two and half hours and near the end the film The Abyss does start to drag. This is not helped when Cameron becomes more preachy and a little cheesy when Bud meets the aliens.The Abyss is a thoughtful, character driven sci-fi from Mr Cameron that reflects more older sci-fi films and shows that special effects should be used more then just for spectacle.

Basically this is filmed like it is a fly on a wall documentary, as a camera crew follow serial killer and thief Ben (Benoît Poelvoorde) around as he goes about his everyday routine and life, good and bad, and with holding nothing back. Ben boasts his architectural failures, his interest in writing poetry and listening to classic music, and we see him spend time with his girlfriend, but also boasting and carrying out murders, which he sees as his craft. With the cameras capturing his activities Ben soon involves the camera crew in his escapades, and they question whether what they are filming and continuing with their film is really a good idea. When Ben murders he has no specific victims, he targets random people, most being the older generation, but also he is profoundly misogynistic, a racist xenophobe (hates foreigners) and finds postmen his favourite targets kills these types. In the end Ben finds himself the victim of crime when he finds parents and girlfriend have been murdered by someone taking revenge, and he makes his farewells on camera to the crew, but an unseen gunman kills him and the crew members one by one. Also starring Rémy Belvaux as Reporter, André Bonzel as Cameraman, Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert as Ben's Mother, Nelly Pappaert as Ben's Grandmother, Hector Pappaert as Ben's Grandfather, Jenny Drye as Jenny and Malou Madou as Malou. I can imagine the controversy that this film brought in its day, where it would have got complaints for sensationalising violence and murder (Natural Born Killers did a similar thing years later), but whatever people think of it, it is a bold contribution to the genre, I admit I couldn't follow it all fully, but in general it is a worthwhile satirical black comedy.

Another odd touch is the way Sophia and David draw so well, they produce portraits of each other that would have done Norman Rockwell proud, but there is no explanation for their talents.

Another odd touch is the way Sophia and David draw so well, they produce portraits of each other that would have done Norman Rockwell proud, but there is no explanation for their talents. David's affair with Sophia triggers a murderous obsession in Julie who tries to kill David and herself in a car smash. David survives but is disfigured, and his life is dramatically changed. The film takes a leap forward in time to David's challenged future. David is in a mental institution awaiting charges of murder. He wears a full-face mask, which must be said, does not aid audibility. A psychiatrist, Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), attempts to unravel David's problems.Nearly all the leads play against type. Especially Kurt Russell who brings a great sense of integrity to his role as a psychiatrist. Cameron Diaz also gives her role depth.Tom Cruise plays privileged and spoilt perfectly. During the course of the film his character is assailed with facial disfigurement and a limp. These are the kind of characteristics that can lead to acting with a capital A. From Richard III to the Hunchback of Notre Dame, and not forgetting Frankenstein, actors find it hard to restrain themselves when the heavy make-up is applied and the foot is dragged. Fortunately, Tom only succumbs occasionally to the overwhelming theatrics of it all.Unfortunately, it is the movie that cannot stay the course &#x96; before the end, Vanilla Sky blinks.Unlike Mulholland Dr where very little is explained, Vanilla Sky introduces a character, Edmund Ventura (Noah Taylor), to explain things. The explanation is a get-out-of-jail-card. Taylor's character provides a reason for what has occurred &#x96; to a point. It is not a totally satisfying resolution. Although the denouement is unexpected and left field, those who hung in there could have expected an ending more in keeping with the human drama that had gripped their imaginations up until this point. The truth is that the script for Vanilla Sky painted itself into a corner and cheated a little to get out.Despite this, Vanilla Sky remains a complex, intriguing story that breaks away from easy formulas. It really does deliver something different. ","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"24 September 2013","score":"","review":" The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino. Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters trying to work out who betrayed them to the police. Set mainly in a warehouse in the aftermath of a failed bank robbery. Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth lead the fantastic ensemble, despite one of them having a bullet in there gut for all of the movie. Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi co-star as the psychotic maniac and the weaselly coward who doesn't believe in tipping. Chris Penn (who looks and sounds exactly like Jonah Hill) and Lawrence Tierney are the two minor members of the gang but make there mark on the movie and still have memorable performances. All of the actors, especially Buscemi, do a brilliant job and are one of my favourite movie line ups ever.Although it sounds quite simple at first the plot of Reservoir Dogs stems out into flashbacks and each gangsters account of what happened. Much like Tarantino's next (and best) movie Pulp Fiction, the dialogue and script is what really makes the movie a classic.Reservoir Dogs has two famous musical scenes which you will have definitely seen many parodies of even if you didn't know it. Both have retro 70's soundtracks because while all the chaos and double crossing is going on, the radio is having a Super Sounds of the 70's Weekend. Without the jazzy backing tracks neither of the most memorable scenes in the movie would be as - well - memorable.Finally the ending of the movie, which is perfect. Tarantino does the impossible and gets us to feel sorry for the evil murdering Reservoir Dogs.I give Reservoir Dogs an excellent rating of 8.9\/10. Definitely in my Top 50 Movies of All Time. http\/\/www.IMDb.com\/list\/AoqmUADYknU\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2013","score":"","review":" The first movie by legendary director Quentin Tarantino.

Among the best of his films are Home Alone and The Breakfast Club, but they still make John Hughes look like an immature stereotype. Sadly, the brat pack films were what defined comedies of the 1980s, while films like A Fish Called Wanda, Clue and this one, remained underlooked.At some point in his career, Hughes must have realized that he was better than the films he was confined to, so he decided to make an adult-oriented film. That turned out to be, Planes, Trains and Automobiles. What a fantastic movie this is! Spawning so many inferior imitators and numerous clichés, this movie was and still is comic gold. The scene at the hotel, going the wrong way down the interstate and, of course, the car rental scene, have become staples in American culture. Hilarious comedy, superb drama and ground truth - few movies would even dare to try and combine these themes. Planes, trains and automobiles does, and it succeeds brilliantly. Martin and Candy deliver stellar performances that work at all of these levels. Definitely one of the best movies ever, and vastly underrated. The real strength of the movie is that just below the surface, the chemistry of the two leads. The two can be hilarious and heartwarming at the same time, and some parts are genuinely hilarious, others genuinely tragic. The ending of this film brought tears to my eyes. PTAA is a drama and a comedy, but the drama is so subtle that you don't notice it at first. Unlike other dramadies which smother the film in drama and ultimately fall flat on their face, PTAA is the real deal. I could go and sum up the entire film for you, but I can't do that. This is a film that must be experienced. And since everyone else has either ratted out the ending or described the plot to a T, there's no need for my involvement, so that's that. John Candy gives his best performance here (and his personal favorite), going from gut busting hilarity to somber loneliness the next scene. It's truly an amazing performance. Steve Martin gives another great performance, as a man so consumed with cheap success that he lets it control his life. The fact that this film takes place at Thanksgiving is no coincidence. The whole movie is about not taking your life for granted, as Martin's character is doing. Candy's character has little yet he is one of the happiest people you'll ever meet. At the end of the film, Martin's character learns that he has to appreciate what he has before it is gone, and Del even remarks You're a lucky guy, Neal., to which Martin responds I know. PTAA is a simply hilarious comedy as well as a superb drama. Might I also add that the film's soundtrack is marvelous, and only helps this film to succeed brilliantly. Definitely one of the best movies ever, and vastly underrated.

Robert DeNiro shows, once again, why he is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation. A former Chicago police detective who has fallen foul of the authorities, he plays private investigator Jack Walsh who hires himself out to catch criminals. Charles Grodin plays a former mafia accountant Jonathan Mardukas who has embezzled 15,000,000 dollars from them & gone to ground in New York. The mafia bosses have sent out hit-men to take him out before he is taken into custody. Walsh is being paid 100,000 dollars by a bail-bond agency to track him down & transport him to Los Angeles. All manner of comical situations befall them en route, beginning at the airport where Mr. Mardukas feigns he has a phobia about flying. So, they have to board a bus out of the big apple which does not please Jack Walsh. The dialogue between them is just great with the captive constantly nagging Walsh about his bad habits. (Smoking & eating junk food etc.) Walsh warns him that if he doesn't shut up he will soon be suffering from fistophobia. Another great comic verbal exchange occurs travelling on board the train. Walsh tells his captive that when he turns his arse in & collects his money he was thinking of retiring from his job & opening up a coffee shop. Mardukas warns him as an accountant not to do so. More than half of them go under in the first six months, he informs him. Well, you're not my accountant!, retorts Walsh becoming more & more irritated by his travelling companion. He dislikes him intensely at first but as the movie progresses warms to him, eventually ending up liking him in the end. Great, too, is John Ashton playing a rival private investigator hired because Walsh's paymaster thinks he is fucking it up. Yaphet Kotto is also excellent as CIA agent Alonzo Mosely also involved in bringing Mr. Mardukas to justice. Mosely arranges a meeting between himself & Walsh to try & find out what he knows. Walsh tells him nothing much, of course, but steals the CIA agent's ID card leading to more comic moments. The scriptwriting in this movie is top-notch & its overall feel-good factor is just wonderful. There is never a dull moment &, eventually, it turns into one of the all-time great buddy movies. Charles Grodin has never been involved in a better movie than this & it is also one of Robert DeNiro's best. As I said at the outset, what is not to love about this movie?.
