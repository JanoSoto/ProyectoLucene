The lighting and effects did a great job of helping this movie have a creepy eerie feel. There was a great use of light and dark contrast with the shadows in Dr. Frankenstein's lab to create this effect. This movie is truly a horror classic and one of the first original monster movies. However i felt it could have done a better maybe more elaborate job of explaining the plot. I wanted to see more of the monsters rampage through the town, Blissfully ignorant as it may have been.

In this film, Monco played by Clint Eastwood, and Colonel Douglas Mortimer played by Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters chasing the same bounties, namely one El Indio (The Indian) played by Gian Maria Volonte.As one of the so called spaghetti westerns I personally feel that it was better in story and context than the previous Fistful of Dollars but not quite as good as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In cinematic terms the director utilized parallel cuts at different points in the film when the scene jumps back and forth from Monco to Colonel Mortimer throughout the entire movie. The extreme close-up shots were seen through the entire film as well, such as when El Indio laughs hysterically about some evil deed or another that he perpetrated. This is especially noted early on in the film when they freeze frame on El Indio's face and then the screen darkens into a wanted poster. Leone also uses inside\/out editing to his benefit at multiple places within the film. The one that stands out the most is when El Indio and Monco are talking as the camera comes in for a close-up shot. When we fade back out from their faces we are transferred to a totally different location in an establishing shot of the new location at an abandoned adobe town.The use of lighting in the filming of this movie was done quite extraordinarily. The majority of the light seems to be natural lighting as they are outdoors. However, when they are filming their night shots the use of low-key lighting is well worth the effect they are attempting to create. There is one point where Monco's face is so dark that you will swear he has black face paint on (and he may) but as he descends into the light his face is just shadowed. The one effect that I have always enjoyed in Sergio Leone films is the use of music to heighten the scene. It is not like the music used in today's films because there are no accompanying lyrics to help set the mood, just the acoustics. In all three movies in the trilogy this is an apparent trend that sets the bar for all films to emulate.All in all if you enjoy Clint Eastwood films and Italian directors this movie is a must see for you. For a Few Dollars More is not my favorite of the trilogy by any means, but it is interesting to watch for the similarities and changes in Leone's directing style. Let's just say if it is on the television, I'm not going to change the channel to watch something else.

The amount of unbelievable journeys he has gone on has been unparalleled to say the least. The Last Crusade just adds to the fun with Sean Connery portraying Indi's father. Raiders did a great job in establishing this laid back tone with glimpses of darkness along the way. Where as Temple of Doom in my opinion steered away from the tone of the franchise and never seemed to capture my attention as much as the book ends did. It's very hard at this point to pick which out of the two i liked more, but the franchise is most definitely cemented as one of the greatest of all time.Out of the three The Last Crusade has the most action and the pacing is brilliant. You get a 15-20 scene of chases and adventure and then 10-15 minute of key dialog in the over all story. Much like Big Fish and About Time this film is an adventure film with plenty of mystery, but when it comes down to it, its a story about father and son reconnecting. The story is heartfelt and some of the better acting both Connery and Ford have done. When you get two actors of their caliber you can count on that they will deliver the performances needed to sell this bond between father and son. The film is on the shoulders of those two, and they carried this classic to the very end.It also helps when a movie actually makes you believe the leads are in true danger. With huge franchises it is often tough to sell the audience into thinking our favorite character may actually die, but this film did that. But i can say this film is not without it's problems. While Raiders was special because of the villain, Crusade wasn't anything too spectacular. A villain needs a good back story and motivation to do the things they do. I didn't feel at all intrigued by the Nazi leader. It was just great to see Indi kick his butt in the end.

The movie starts with the marines getting their heads buzzed down to hardly any hair but rough stubble from the very beginning of boot camp through the mental trials and tribulations of boot camp. Most of the characters in this movie when by nicknames, which is in most cases happens in any branch of military where your fellow soldiers take your last name and make a nickname out of it or just give you a simple word connection from a story you might have told about your hometown. The main characters in this movie got their nicknames from the senior drill instructor in the barracks as he is communicating with them as they have arrived at boot camp. The main two roles are of joker whom makes a smart comment under his breath and the drill instructor hears him, then their his weak counterpart Private Pyle aka Pyle then there is Jokers friend Cowboy whom he meets later in the movie at his duty station during the war. There were others but the one I found most ironic was Snowball because he was a black gentlemen. I felt through this movie that Stanley Kubrick did a great job with camera angles to make you feel as if you were part of the platoon. Many of the close-up camera angles I feel were to make you feel what the marines were going through during their training, mentally and physically. The lighting through the movie seemed very normal so that you could pay attention to the detail that was unveiling before your eyes, hence the detail because the military is very detail oriented. The only time the lighting seemed to get darker was when Pyle shot himself in the head in front of Joker and the drill instructor and then towards the end where they the platoon was being taken down one by one by a female sniper.

There are so many movies that have taken cues from it, it's honestly amazing. 300, Sin City, and a Scanner Darkly all smack of influences from the movie. So, here we have a movie based on a comic strip that utilized a lot of the visual styles of the comic. The costumes, cars and sets all look like they belong in the Sunday funnies. The comic strip itself originally started in the early 1920's and for most of its run imitated the daily real life of the world around it. With the exception of the character Big Boy and maybe a few others, most of the villains in the comic strip were individual's not affiliated with organized crime. The movie however, visually sets itself in the mid 1930's. No exact date is given, but it sets itself up as an essentially stereotypical gangster movie, complete with the mob boss and the goons with funny names. Thematically, its essentially your run of the mill good guys win at the end of the day procedural police film, you don't need to watch much of it to find out that there is going to be A) silly bad guys that are more funny than bad B) super sexy objects of sexual desire &#x96; after all, Madonna mid 1990 was smoking hot, as the very svelte, very sensuous Breathless Mahoney &#x96; Britany Spears could have taken notes. Comic relief is supplied by the gangsters themselves and the very dramatic over acting of all of the actors, something that we saw in shows like the TV series of Batman from the 60's. Along that line the use of color, most notably Tracy with his white\/eggshell colored coat is denoted as the good guy while Breathless, is continually shown in various black dresses, obviously to highlight her as the main provocatrix in the story. As the story evolves Breathless has a change of heart, you see her in the last scene in the club in a white dress, before the last scene with her alter ego Faceless, when it is revealed to Tracy that she is the one who not only set him up for murder, but is also the one who drives the situation in which Big Boy is killed, relieving him of his arch nemesis. Much like another movie The Crow, Dick Tracy makes special use of its choice of color, especially in terms of how the mood is set and for whom you should be paying attention to in the story. Whereas The Crow is essentially very dark with only small amounts of color, most of which is during the happier scenes, the use of bright color throughout Dick Tracy suggests a light and almost comedic mood in relation to its much darker theme elements and with the main characters, Breathless and Tracy, being shown in strikingly contrasting colors, until the end of the film.With all of the emphasis on theme and its gentle poking at social issues such as organized crime, police abuse of power, and child abuse the film can seem a little drab. Its silly characters and its bright colors seem almost out place when discussing these issues and today's movie going audience would be better served by something that looked more like Sin City. All that said, Dick Tracy is a classic film, if you haven't seen it you need to, if you have seen it, watch it again and think about what the film is actually about and then realize that it was truly ahead of its time, buts definitely a great film.

Thematically, its essentially your run of the mill good guys win at the end of the day procedural police film, you don't need to watch much of it to find out that there is going to be A) silly bad guys that are more funny than bad B) super sexy objects of sexual desire &#x96; after all, Madonna mid 1990 was smoking hot, as the very svelte, very sensuous Breathless Mahoney &#x96; Britany Spears could have taken notes. Comic relief is supplied by the gangsters themselves and the very dramatic over acting of all of the actors, something that we saw in shows like the TV series of Batman from the 60's. Along that line the use of color, most notably Tracy with his white\/eggshell colored coat is denoted as the good guy while Breathless, is continually shown in various black dresses, obviously to highlight her as the main provocatrix in the story. As the story evolves Breathless has a change of heart, you see her in the last scene in the club in a white dress, before the last scene with her alter ego Faceless, when it is revealed to Tracy that she is the one who not only set him up for murder, but is also the one who drives the situation in which Big Boy is killed, relieving him of his arch nemesis. Much like another movie The Crow, Dick Tracy makes special use of its choice of color, especially in terms of how the mood is set and for whom you should be paying attention to in the story. Whereas The Crow is essentially very dark with only small amounts of color, most of which is during the happier scenes, the use of bright color throughout Dick Tracy suggests a light and almost comedic mood in relation to its much darker theme elements and with the main characters, Breathless and Tracy, being shown in strikingly contrasting colors, until the end of the film.With all of the emphasis on theme and its gentle poking at social issues such as organized crime, police abuse of power, and child abuse the film can seem a little drab. Its silly characters and its bright colors seem almost out place when discussing these issues and today's movie going audience would be better served by something that looked more like Sin City. All that said, Dick Tracy is a classic film, if you haven't seen it you need to, if you have seen it, watch it again and think about what the film is actually about and then realize that it was truly ahead of its time, buts definitely a great film.

If the screenplay is faulty, everything is at fault. La Femme Nikita had every single potential element to be a classic and even cult movie but the screenplay failed the whole thing from the very beginning. Why the French secret service recruited Nikita in first place? A junkie (Dark grey almost rotten teeth) murderer of a policeman who proved to be completely insane as they could not even let her in common ward in fear of her causing harm to other inmates, basically a sick persona who belonged to mental hospital rather than a prison. Granted that they wanted a killer walking dead to do their dirty and most dangerous job (I'll emphasis on this subject later) but the killer ghost is not supposed to be the crazy untamed animal as Nikita was. The whole Idea was a child's dream, a very big defect in screenplay from the very start. As the movie continues, we see no development in Nikita's training as an assassin. First she does not cooperate and then all the sudden she decides to cooperate because she realizes that she has only 2 weeks to prove herself worthy but we would not see what happened in next 2 weeks and in reality nothing can happen in 2 weeks but anyways, couple of vague scenes follows and then we see her at her 23rd birthday, 3 years passed and we saw nothing of her training and her character development from that early wild animal to a classy lady assassin. It appears that there is a romance going on between her and Rico but that's just a guess from the following acts so I wonder what's the point of making a rated R movies if it's supposed to appear like a PG-13? Another gross failure. Now let's see how is she doing as an assassin\/secret agent. I hoped to see something extraordinary to compensate for the previous failures but no! nothing. Her first job is to deliver a bugged plate to a room in a hotel. Her second assignment is to shoot a lady with sniper rifle. Really? did they go through all that to recruit her to do these kind of jobs? and then comes the embassy mission. Again a gross failure in development of the story. 6 months to plan for a very simple mission made complicated. The whole idea of kidnapping the senior diplomat and impersonating someone else as him was one big joke aside from the fact that it doesn't make sense for the secret service to plan 6 months on a mission as basic as that. Anyways, that mission was supposed to be the climax of the movie but still the question remains. Didn't they have normal decent agents to do this job? and at the end she leaves\/escapes. leaving her fiancé behind and of course a final confrontation between to lovers\/supposed to be rivals and that's it. Actions never justified the causes. The whole thing became a big joke. I would say there was entertainment value in the movie to some extent but it was a cheesy B movie at its best.

Whoopi Goldberg, in her first film role, is excellent as the shy, weak-willed Celie.

Her character is strongly defined as the movie progresses and her personality makes a unique change. There is a shed or two to be shed at times.

You can't just stumble upon it as you can when looking for an action or comedy movie. Not to say that it can't happen, but if you're going to watch this movie, you have to focus on it and watch it all the way through within a week. I don't know if it is a good representation of modern prisons or prisons from the time it takes place, but regardless of that, you feel for the two protagonists. I found the predicament of Andy to be completely horrific and unfair (though I wish I could find a better word to use here than unfair). Some people might find the message of hope to be kind of corny, which is a view that I can understand but don't share and I'm a guy that finds many things to be corny. The life of the prisoners is brutal, partly because of the guards, but partly because of the conduct of the prisoners. Andy is easy to sympathize with, but also easy to root for because of his perseverance and hope. I like Morgan Freeman's character, Red, too. There is an air of dignity that sets him and Andy apart from the other prisoners. The one rather implausible character point that I found was Andy's selflessness. His ability to sympathize with his fellow inmates and his willingness to better their lives does not necessarily do anything to his desire for the same benefits that they reap. His motive is certainly to help his fellow inmates, but I don't feel like he would as a human just let his hard earned rewards be wasted. The one other main character is the warden, who can either be viewed as a good heartless villain or a guy that the screenwriters forced a mean personality onto with no good reason. I'm not saying that either one is true, it just depends on where you're coming from. I read another review that criticizes the way the warden's quoting of the bible is sort of demonized and was a biased act by the producers. Personally, I disagree with that, because there are plenty of people in real life who use biblical passages and religious motives as an excuse to do bad things. One thing about his character that I didn't really understand was why he is so reluctant to let Andy go free. The story is rather like that of Mr. Holland's Opus in the sense that it is divided up by the minor characters that come and go throughout. You can see how Andy and Red make a difference in the lives of the other inmates and each other. The mystery of how Andy escapes at the end is pretty good, but not something that requires you to have remembered a lot of things from earlier to understand. For anyone considering watching it, I would recommend that you watch it alone or with someone who won't talk through it. Also, don't watch it if you're looking for anything outside of a good or emotional story.

Steven Taylor could have found a lot less complicated way to kill his wife for her money and by involving a known criminal in the mix all he does is throw in a lot more loose&#x97;and unreliable&#x97;ends.The final death struggle was preposterous. The guy had already attempted to kill her yet she confronts him alone in their apartment? Why not just invite him down into the unlit cellar instead? And then we have the ridiculously cliché dead-but-not-really-dead bad guy who gets yet one more chance to do her in. This tripe seems to be written by people who do nothing but watch crappy movies.Profoundly mediocre at its core.

This adventure sees indy, Dr Elsa Schneider, salah and Marcus Brody looking for Indy's father and also beat the Nazis to finding the holy grail. Harrison ford is once again utterly fantastic as Indiana Jones and this film is the one in my opinion that solidifies him as one of the greatest characters in film history. A big problem for me with the previous film was the weak supporting cast but have no fear because this film has an excellent supporting cast. Sean Connery is superb as Indy's dad ans the chemistry the two have is phenomenal and really carries this film. Also returning from raiders was Marcus Brody and salah given bigger roles and they both succeed in providing great moments and bring a good sense of comic relief needed for the film. The new love interest Elsa was also really good and her chemistry with Indy was also decent and was much better then the previous romance in temple of doom. The story is great too with the father son bonding done really well mixed with the search for the holy grail makes this story riveting and ridiculously entertaining. Overalls the script is awesome with the exchanges between Indy and his father being enough they also provided the other characters with great dialogue and back stories. The style is back to form with obviously the legendary theme, whip and hat being intact but also the reintroduction of the Nazis was a great decision as I always believe Indiana Jones is always more fun when fighting the Nazis. Overall this is an epic film and one that I can watch over and over again.
