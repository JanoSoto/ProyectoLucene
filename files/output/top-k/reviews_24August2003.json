Margaret Rosenthal & Jeannine Dominy Dangerous Beauty will have you laughing, becoming in intrigued and tug at your heart within the first 6 minutes. In great traditions of other time piece movies; Legends Of The Falls, Empire Of The Sun, Angela Ashes and Dangerous Liaisons - Dangerous Beauty draws you in and keeps hold of you till the end. This is truly Catherine McCormack (Veronica Franco) of Braveheart and Rufus Sewell (Marco Venier) of A Knight's Tale movie. McCormick is elegant and Sewell is magnificent looking. It is enticing and engaging! One you'll want to own. With a score of music that runs through the heart and tugs at your emotions as the intelligence of the script fascinates your mind, you will be completely captured by it's beauty. Filmed entirely on location in Italy, you truly are wrapped up in the 16th century Venice.An strong supporting cast that includes Jacqueline Bisset (Paola Franco) in an role that captivities and blows you away. It truly shows the strength of her acting. Completely charming is the scene at the table where Paola (Bisset) is demonstrating how to be sensual as she eats and an annoyed Veronica repeats everything back with rough playful mocking. Oliver Platt (Maffio Venier) as a brilliant poet who is drawn into the fantasy of sexual desirer of the young new Venetian courtesan (McCormack). He's charming, delightful and portraying a character that brings out the best in him. Naomi Watts (Guila De Lezze) plays the bride-to-be to Marco Venier (Sewell). Has a woman who stands by her husband as she was raised to do and she finds herself competing against Veronica for his affection & respect. Fred Ward (Domenico Venier) as you've never seen before. Moira Kelly (Beatrice Venier) as an devoted sister who yields to her family wishes instead of remaining strong and independent. I highly recommend Dangerous Beauty you'll love it.Director Marshall Herskovitz (Thirty Something, My-So-Called-Life and Once and Again) captures the beauty of 16th century Venice in all it's distinguished glory. One of the most passionate and sexiest films ever! My favorite line is `Love love, but do not love the Man or you will be in his Power' with that one line you understand what each wife desire from her husband and each courtesan uses. As the priests and senators accuse Veronica Franco of witchcraft towards the end, an emotional and extremely powerful scene plays out. McCormack and Sewell simply light up the screen. Dangerous Beauty will take you on an amazing journey. Gorgeous! Radiant! Truly romantic and sizzling! This is how love should be! Rating R for some scene of strong sexuality, some nudity and language.

The acting is superb, and cannot be faulted, particularly Ellen Burstyn's.The reason I didn't like this film was because of the way the cuts were used. I can see why they were used in the way they were, but I felt that at times they got in the way a little bit, almost as if instead of more scenes the director just decided to fill up the time with lots of cutting of short scenes which seemed to be almost the same every time. Because of this, I felt it got boring.Also I felt there was a slight lack of explaination in the film as to why the people got hooked on drugs in the first place, with the exception of Ellen Burstyn's character. I understand that in some films, explainations are not always necessary, but I feel that more explaination would have worked better in this film.The plot itself isn't overly complex, but I felt some things were hard to follow, though this could just be that in some scenes the score was louder than the people talking.

It is been designed specifically to offend as many people as conceivably possible - its protagonists have no feminist agenda - they are women simply because the filmmakers can get away with more gratuitous sex and violence than if the protagonists were male and this way we get to see Karen Bach posing with guns in her underwear.I put a spoiler alert just to be on the safe side but theres really no point in a synopsis. One girl gets raped (she doesnt mind too much - I can't recall another film where a rape victim shrugs off the attack in the same way and its another example of the reckless disregard of the filmmakers and I bet that p**sed off loads of people) the other is a prostitute at the beck and call of some junkie loser (who looks a little bit like Gary Oldman but isn't) for reasons which aren't defined.  They both kill someone in anger and meet up by chance at the local train station after the last train has left. They kill a woman for her cashpoint card despite only seconds earlier one of the characters saying she has 10,000F to spend (told you it doesnt make any sense) I could go on but won't - watch it and decide for yourself, its only on 77 minutes.And finally - clear up some of the misinformation from earlier comments1.

Nadine just seems to go along with it cos she's got a bit of a screw loose and she has the hots for Manu, besides its fun and fun is number one.3.

While  not the best romantic tear jerker to run through a projector, it is certainly not the worst either.  It does have it's strong points, and if someone had dared to break away from Erich Segal's novella, then perhaps it would have been a very good film.  Unfortunately, since Segal also wrote this screenplay, and he stayed faithful to his best selling book almost to the letter, it ends up with the same problems as his novella.  When the first line of your novel or screenplay, tells the audience that one of the main characters is going to die at the end, you had better put that death and what leads up to it on the screen in such a way that it will pull some kind of emotion out of those watching.  Though I'm sure many people weeped heavily into their handkerchiefs at the end of this film, I am more or less inclined to believe that many of them did so because it was either expected of them, or maybe it was like some sort of communicable disease.  I had read the book, enjoyed it, but the ending affected me little as did the ending of the film.  More about that later.Many reviewers have been extremely critical of both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw in their criticism of Love Story.  Though neither is a particularly gifted actor, I found them quite pleasant as Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavilleri.  The role of the preppy son of a millionaire seems to have been made for O'Neal, and MacGraw's Jenny has just the right amount of brashness, that we actually like her spunk instead of being put off by it.  MacGraw makes us believe that a baker's daughter could harangue a rich millionaire into falling for her, and that she could love him back.  Most of Jenny's and Oliver's scenes together are of two people, who use their own brand of verbal sparring, to express how much they care for each other.  Some say that is not possible, but speaking from experience I know for a fact that it is.  And in this film, it's always fun to watch.Ray Milland plays Oliver Barrett III, and does it with a cold austere demeanor, but yet we can still sense his love for his son.  John Marley, as Jennifer's father, Phil, is delightful in his few scenes, and his relationship with Jenny draws a sharp contrast to that of Barrett III and Barret IV.  His scenes near the end of the film, are the best Love Story has to offer, and won him an Academy Award Nomination.So what went wrong?  Since we know from the very first line in the film, that Jennifer is going to die (so you know I'm not giving anything away here), you would think that when we reach that crucial point, her death would be gut wrenching.  Unfortunately, when Oliver learns of Jenny's impending doom, Segal in his novel and in this screenplay, rushes to the death scene so fast it's as if he had an airplane to catch when he was writing it.  After Oliver returns from the doctor's office with the bad news, we get three quick meaningless scenes between Oliver and Jenny, so poorly written and staged even worse, that it leaves us feeling quite empty during the most important part of the film.  Even at the end, when either director Hiller or writer Segal could have redeemed themselves in a scene between O'Neal and Milland, they totally blow it.   A first year film student could have done better.  So instead of being moved to tears, we are simply left high and dry.  It also doesn't help matters that when Jenny does become ill, she never really looks it, and even in her final scenes looks as if she could get up and go out for dinner and a movie.  It is frustrating that the way this ending was filmed, almost destroys the good will it had built up before getting to that point.So what do we end up with?

I had read the book, enjoyed it, but the ending affected me little as did the ending of the film.  More about that later.Many reviewers have been extremely critical of both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw in their criticism of Love Story.  Though neither is a particularly gifted actor, I found them quite pleasant as Oliver Barrett IV and Jennifer Cavilleri.  The role of the preppy son of a millionaire seems to have been made for O'Neal, and MacGraw's Jenny has just the right amount of brashness, that we actually like her spunk instead of being put off by it.  MacGraw makes us believe that a baker's daughter could harangue a rich millionaire into falling for her, and that she could love him back.  Most of Jenny's and Oliver's scenes together are of two people, who use their own brand of verbal sparring, to express how much they care for each other.  Some say that is not possible, but speaking from experience I know for a fact that it is.  And in this film, it's always fun to watch.Ray Milland plays Oliver Barrett III, and does it with a cold austere demeanor, but yet we can still sense his love for his son.  John Marley, as Jennifer's father, Phil, is delightful in his few scenes, and his relationship with Jenny draws a sharp contrast to that of Barrett III and Barret IV.  His scenes near the end of the film, are the best Love Story has to offer, and won him an Academy Award Nomination.So what went wrong?  Since we know from the very first line in the film, that Jennifer is going to die (so you know I'm not giving anything away here), you would think that when we reach that crucial point, her death would be gut wrenching.  Unfortunately, when Oliver learns of Jenny's impending doom, Segal in his novel and in this screenplay, rushes to the death scene so fast it's as if he had an airplane to catch when he was writing it.  After Oliver returns from the doctor's office with the bad news, we get three quick meaningless scenes between Oliver and Jenny, so poorly written and staged even worse, that it leaves us feeling quite empty during the most important part of the film.  Even at the end, when either director Hiller or writer Segal could have redeemed themselves in a scene between O'Neal and Milland, they totally blow it.   A first year film student could have done better.  So instead of being moved to tears, we are simply left high and dry.  It also doesn't help matters that when Jenny does become ill, she never really looks it, and even in her final scenes looks as if she could get up and go out for dinner and a movie.  It is frustrating that the way this ending was filmed, almost destroys the good will it had built up before getting to that point.So what do we end up with?  About two thirds of a good movie with good characterizations by the four main actors, and an involving story.  It's just too bad the ending goes as sour as a fresh lemon.

He produces movies for the mass audience, which are more indicative of the perception of coolness within the era the movie is produced. &#145;Top Gun' is a prime example of this. It is Eighties personified. The only thing missing is the big hair. We were saved this due to the fact that the movie is set within the Air Force. I am not criticising what the producers have done. It will take a lot of guts to put the elements together to create a big bucks bonanza. I just feel that movies such as these do not do full justice to the big stage that they occupy. It did not have enough story to fill the gap between action sequences. The story is inconsequential and the main focus was on the exaggerated dogfight scenes and the less than subtle courtship of Cruise and McGillis. As it turned out it was enough to achieve the big box office draw, with a little help from a mammoth soundtrack. Considering that this was the prime objective, they got the targeted success.A pulsating soundtrack supplemented the testosterone inspired action sequences. This was a prime additive and each track was used to augment the emotion of the scene. Kenny Loggins' &#145;Danger Zone' epitomised the action adventure lifestyle of the fighter pilot, which the producers wished to emulate Hollywood style. It screamed out the personality of the main character. The man who lived for the adrenaline rush, scant respect for the rules and of very few words &#150; none being too sublime. Just listening to the track alone and you can visualise the jet fighter streaking through the air, barely noticeable to the naked eye, and the opponent's aircraft exploding. I am unclear as to the sales figures of the soundtrack, but I am sure it must have been one of the best of its era.In addition, Berlins' &#145;Take My Breathe Away' song was used to accentuate the secondary storyline, that is, the courtship of Cruise and McGillis. Any blockbuster action movie must have an electric female interest for the main character. The song did the work that could not be enacted on screen. The reason being is that Kelly McGillis could not generate the mixed emotions and seemed to stick with the same routine, that of the sophisticated, no nonsense ambitious girl. Notwithstanding the fact that Cruise's character was more adrenaline charged and would have naturally exuded the raw emotions, Kelly McGillis failed to progress beyond an emotional monotone which was adequate for the start, but fell short as the relationship grew with intensity. Considering the success the movie generated, this story element can have its success attributed to the song and Cruise's acting.Sharing centre stage with Cruise were the Tomcats. Creative camera shots and angles were used to capture the speed and finesse of flight. When they are set against the majestic backgrounds of the natural surroundings, it creates a memorable scene. That is, the grandness of nature set together with the powerful machines of man. The use of two &#150; seater aircraft enabled dialogue between the characters in the cockpit. This also facilitated greater rivalry on the ground between competing teams.The acting was solid for a popcorn movie. Even the boisterous, pale lines were done with good acting. The top performer, which is not always necessary for a blockbuster production, goes to the leading man, Tom Cruise. Some of his lines were mediocre, much in line with the superficial nature of the Eighties, but he still managed to attach some credibility to them. There is no doubt that Cruise has a massive ego and he enjoys the opportunity to showcase it. A natural and necessary trait for a Hollywood leading man. The powerful aircraft, the loud jackets and the monster motorbike, all personified his delight in being the centre of attention. The role therefore suits him. But given the fact that certain aspects of the role would have come naturally to him, his emotional turmoil concerning his father's disgraced history and that of the tragic passing of his flight buddy, show how Cruise can play a flawed character and make it believable.The attention to story, as previously mentioned, was minimal. To criticise this would be an exercise in futility &#150; it was never their intention to crate a multi &#150; layered plot or to deliver a message. This was pure entertainment engineered for short &#150; term massive cash flow. The story was spoon &#150; fed and there was absolutely nothing to give serious thought to. The filmmakers know the task at hand, and the mass audience were generally not disappointed. Of credit was the fact that the main character was given an overwhelming obstacle in the form of the disgraced history of his father. It was a burden for him and bought out the extremeness within. His flying was circus &#150; like death defying antics and he was in the face of superiors by negotiating illegal fly &#150; byes. Although more than stretching believability, these antics appealed to the cavalier side of the audience always wanted to unleash. Within the Eighties where this was cool, it is well understandable why the success was achieved. The obstacle also accentuated the relationship between himself and the commanding officer of Top Gun, who had flown with his father. Despite Tom Skerritt being his usual laid &#150; back self, it did not underscore the emotional turmoil the producers wished to project. Skerritt is one of the few actors who could pull that off. It is probably due to it being a natural part of him. &#145;Top Gun' is pure popcorn entertainment. It exemplified the Eighties for which It was created. It may therefore seem a little dated for today's audiences. Notwithstanding this fact and also that the fighter aircraft are long outdated, the racy soundtrack and beautiful cinematography do enough to provide entertainment. But do not brood over the lack of story, this will only lead to disappointment. View it for what it is.

She is a wonderful baddy however but herstilted delivery of the lines emphasizes that 'Sleepy Hollow' is the ideal kids' Halloween eve movie and not the spine-chilling thriller I had hoped for,something that I think is entirely within Burton's capabilites but hasn't been demonstrated by that very talented director yet.  I'd like to seem him tackle some verité mysteries ala Hitchcock.And the scary bits don't really come off.  There is a wonderful scarecrow in a September field of corn at the start of the film before the credits and the bloody tree is excellent, ditto the old crone in the cave in the Western Woods but we see all too little of those tasty aspects of the story.  The most interesting and truly frightening (and sympathetic) character is the headless horseman played byChristopher Walken.  His montrousness is akin to Danny DeVito's Penguin in'Batman Returns', repulsive, demonic and pathetic all at once, likeFrankenstein's monster.  Now THAT's a story I'd love to see Burton film!Christopher Walken could play the doctor and the monster!  Lisa Marie could be his bride.  She, by the way, is a fascinating screen persona.  Her performance as the Martian Girl in 'Mars Attacks!' was astounding, and not a word spoken, as in this film, playing Ichabod's ill-fated mother.'Sleepy Hollow' is a straight-forward telling of the old tale with no frills attached, beyond the limp romantic interest.  As usual with Burton the sets are beautiful but his 2 dimensional approach didn't fulfill my hopes for this film.  A comic book rendition that seems a bit tired-out.  Time for another direction for Tim Burton, I hope.Close, but no cigar.

Then it's off to Vegas to do a daring heist, so they all dress up as Elvis, because there is a convention in town. This is a real missed opportunity, as they could have done something clever with this, instead the just walk into the casino and open fire!  Soon after, a blink and you'll miss it killing of several gang members.  Then the film turns into a kind of road movie\/get the money back thing.  The main problem I found was the director (who you get the feeling may have been bullied by a certain leading actor) does not seen to know what direction he wants the film to go in it varies from daft sentiment (chracters you don't know die and sad music is played), excessive violence, unecessary plot development (let's use some the budget to blow up a petrol station for no real reason) and some laughable bonding particularly by Kurt Russell and the young boy. On the plus side Costner is unlikeable and you always feel Kurt Russell is taking the p*ss, but too many plot concidences and chance happenings of people running into each other in a huge country like the U.S gets too much to take.  This unfortunately is a draining movie and your just willing for the end and a certain person to just die.  The feeling of indulgence with this film is confirmed with the end credits and a Kevin Costner out take which just sums it all up.
