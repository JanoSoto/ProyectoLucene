[{"date":"15 December 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  As a British citizen who moved to Michigan in 1998, I have never seen Andy Kaufmann on TV. Indeed I had never heard of him before the release of this movie. But I responded to a free ticket offer and saw it for nothing at my local multiplex. For the first half hour or more I was mighty glad I had paid nothing as Andy's act did not tickle my sense of humour in any way. In particular, Jim Carrey's introductory chatter and the running of the end credits at the beginning of the movie were merely tiresome and irritating. To judge from the laughter around me, I assumed that he must be a nostalgic cult figure and the audience were reliving their teenage memories of Andy's antics, much as Brits of my generation can quote Monty Python verbatim. After a while I found myself laughing despite the seeming dumbness of much of the material, especially where Jim skates on the very edge of bad taste and political incorrectness - and frequently falls over that edge. I cannot judge how truthful an impersonation Jim delivers, but his typically dynamic performance seemed to be the product of really concentrated effort. The later sequences in particular, where Andy is diagnosed with a rare form of lung cancer, becomes progressively sicker and tries all manner of alternative therapies, are unreservedly touching and a portrayal of quiet courage. It was particularly fascinating to be reminded of the bizarre Philippines hand-on surgery without anaesthetic which I saw in documentaries of the early 1980s.As with all Milos Forman films, the craftsmanship is impeccable and the soundtrack highly enjoyable. At the end of it, I was still left wondering why Forman found Kaufmann so interesting that he was willing to invest the staggering effort which it takes to create any movie. As in the case of his last movie about Larry Flynt, though for rather different reasons , I could not see why he picked this guy out of the billions who have lived in this century to immortalise on film. Larry was just too loathsome and Andy was somehow not that distinctive. I will be surprised if the movie has much success in markets where people have no memories of seeing the original Andy first time round. I would give it 7 out of 10 for craftsmanship, acting and (against the odds) making me laugh.

The murder\/rape (in that order) a few minutes later confirmed my first impression, but for some reason I stayed.Maybe I stayed because I teach classes on film and watch a lot of movies, and I am more than willing to give ANY film a fair shot (and sometimes two or three).  I wanted this film to succeed.  But it falls down on so many levels that I felt my own calling from God, as it were, to wage a small battle against it.The reviews published by the San Francisco papers, NY Times and Chicago Sun-Times (Ebert) give a pretty good summary of what's wrong with this film, even though I think their two stars ratings are quite generous.To summarize my own thoughts on the film, I feel that the script doesn't know what story it's trying to tell, and Besson and Jovovich seem to have no sense at all for the complexities of Joan's story, as it has come down to us.The acting is as overwrought and void of subtlety as any I've seen in a long time.  The only highlights are a couple of performances from supporting characters (who unfortunately are shackled by the poor screenplay) and Dustin Hoffman's appearance toward the end of the film (way too little, way too late to save the film).  I felt particularly saddened by the clownish performance John Malkovich gives, although I can't help but think\/hope that he was forced to do it by Besson.

It feels as if Besson and Co. sat down and said, What is the absolutely most stereotypical image that the average moviegoer who knows nothing about 15th-century France or Joan of Arc or who has never thought about spiritual things in a meaningful way will expect when he or she sits down to watch this film?

The fact that people found this film moving is so so sad.SpoilerWhere do I even begin.  The opening scene of the film is a complete waste of time.  One astronomer spots a comet and in about 10 seconds realises it's going to hit the Earth, so what does he do, he tries to send an Email which doesn't work.  Now as this comet is about a year away what does he do.  Does he try to send the mail later, use the phone, send a disc in the mail, no that would be silly.  We must get this disk to Washington NOW.  Of course the car crashes, he is killed and you assume the disk is destroyed in the ensuing fire.Now some time later the president is perfectly aware of this and even has the now destroyed disk, so what was the point of the first scene. The film carries on is this pointless stupid manner.  There is a brief part of the film where there is some intrigue, but even that's handled is such a ridiculous way.   Why would the president personally meet a reporter to scare her.The rest of the film is some drivelling soap opera that bores you to tears.  I spent the last third of the movie hoping the comet could hurry up a bit and wipe out these sad whinging losers.Now the Earth (i.e. America) has a year (I think) to be able to come up with a number of ideas of how to stop this comet.  So what we (when I say we I mean of course America who represent the whole of planet Earth) do is send a bunch of young gun-ho Americans on some stupid mission to blow up the comet.  With comical timing they fail miserably.  So what now, bugger, we don't know, of course no one else on planet USA knows how to stop this thing.The stupidest scene is at least kept until the end.

I first saw it when I was 8 years old, and it scared the pants off of me. Top-notch acting accompanies amazing special effects (which are really good, considering that this movie was made in 1979).While Alien has launched a string of excellent sequels (especially the second and third installments) that probably won't end for quite a while (PLEASE, let there be an Alien 5!), this movie is complete on its own terms.

On the whole, it's not a bad film, but the problem is that none of the heart and soul that was poured into the other episodes is present here. Lucas had always said that this one would be just to set-up the story. Well Episode Four didn't have that problem. But it's the story, its the story, Lucas kept saying.

The plot isn't as nearly as compelling as the other three films either. The Trade Federation boundaries being in dispute sound as thrilling as the as the content of European sausages. And who cares if Portman as the Queen ever signs a stupid treaty or if Terence Stamp is voted out of the Senate? True the special effects are impressive, but without the rich characterisation of the previous films, we don't really care about the outcome. The action scenes seem rushed because Lucas has lost nearly all of his sense of timing and none of them come close to the fantastic Death Star assault at the end of the 1977 film. The nadir though has to be the suggestion of the virgin birth of Anakin Skywalker... please! None of the assurance and character of the previous films is present here and the only positive feeling you have coming away from it is that, hopefully it is setting up a stronger story for the next episodes.

As with Trainspotting three years ago, David Fincher's latest film burrows deep into your subconscious and stays there.Long after most of the year's releases are collecting dust on the video shelves of the world, Fight Club will still be there, lying dormant in your brain, just waiting for someone to trigger off the collective memory of this grimy, hyper-stunning tale.Edward Norton is Jack, the narrator who, as the story opens, is an insomniac suffering from life in the late 20th century. He exists to collect more must have items from the IKEA catalogue and achieve a nirvana-like completeness.In an attempt to find some sort of feeling in his vaccuum of a life, he starts attending support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis and the like. Finding comfort in the bitch tits of Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), our hero cries his heart out and realises he is still alive after all.Until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) arrives that is.Like our narrator, Marla is a tourist. A strung-out harpy of a woman who seeks some meaning to her own meaningless existence.Jack cannot feel happiness while he is aware that there is another imposter in the room so they reach a deal and a bizarre relationship constructed of mutual respect for one another's bizarre interest.When Jack meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a flight, his life is turned upside down by the soap salesman with a bizarre dress sense.The besuited hero goes back to his apartment to find the place has been gutted by a gas explosion and so in a fit of desperation, Jack rings Durden.They meet up at a local bar, have a few beers and eventually our numb yuppie gets to stay with Tyler.Before long the two men are living together in one of the most decrepit houses ever seen in a major motion picture. This makes The Bradbury in Blade Runner look like Mimi Rogers' apartment in Someone To Watch Over Me.One night they start clashing in a bar forecourt - no malice in these fisticuffs though. Just the affirmation that both men are alive in a world where consumerism has taken precedence over feeling.The scuffle leads to the eponymous organisation, an underground arena for businessmen, blue collar workers and the like to beat the crap out of each other and feel good about it.Jack starts turning up at work with bruises and the sort of manner that marks him out as a man to be avoided. He starts dressing down, bleeding onto his collar and sporting gashes that make his colleagues back away in fear.And so it goes. Fight Club spreads...The first hour of the movie leads you down one straight, dimly lit path, brilliantly executed with living catalogues creating themselves from thin air, close-ups of gas cookers releasing their invisible cargo to a doom-laden room and just the sort of eye-catching visuals that has made Fincher one of the best directors of his generation.What did it mean to me? Well, like one of the disillusioned masses that seeks solace in the comfort of pre-packaged food, franchise furniture stores and mind numbing TV, this is an epiphany of a film. A jet black comedy that left me feeling sick and in a state of altered consciousness - if you're driving home from the movies afterwards, you may need time to collect your thoughts as this is not one of the movies where you just go and get a burger afterwards, having forgotten the plot by the time you get to the counter.Ironically, Fincher's visuals will be lifted by the very companies he is taking the mickey out of over the next few years and this thorn in the side of the moral majority will achieve cult status on video - after all, everyone will want to freeze frame the subliminal moments when both Tyler and Marla appear.However, if you get the chance, catch this on the big screen with a decent sound system and an open mind.Although the actual bone-splintering fight scenes will leave you felling sick, this is not a movie about fighting. It's a film in which the disillusioned masses, born in a generation of TV and video games without soul, try to make sense of a plastic culture.Even if it means losing their minds in order to do so.

As with Trainspotting three years ago, David Fincher's latest film burrows deep into your subconscious and stays there.Long after most of the year's releases are collecting dust on the video shelves of the world, Fight Club will still be there, lying dormant in your brain, just waiting for someone to trigger off the collective memory of this grimy, hyper-stunning tale.Edward Norton is Jack, the narrator who, as the story opens, is an insomniac suffering from life in the late 20th century. He exists to collect more must have items from the IKEA catalogue and achieve a nirvana-like completeness.In an attempt to find some sort of feeling in his vaccuum of a life, he starts attending support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis and the like. Finding comfort in the bitch tits of Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), our hero cries his heart out and realises he is still alive after all.Until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) arrives that is.Like our narrator, Marla is a tourist. A strung-out harpy of a woman who seeks some meaning to her own meaningless existence.Jack cannot feel happiness while he is aware that there is another imposter in the room so they reach a deal and a bizarre relationship constructed of mutual respect for one another's bizarre interest.When Jack meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a flight, his life is turned upside down by the soap salesman with a bizarre dress sense.The besuited hero goes back to his apartment to find the place has been gutted by a gas explosion and so in a fit of desperation, Jack rings Durden.They meet up at a local bar, have a few beers and eventually our numb yuppie gets to stay with Tyler.Before long the two men are living together in one of the most decrepit houses ever seen in a major motion picture.

I cant help thinking that had Arnie's I Am Legend movie not fallen through we would have had both great cinematography and an interesting role for Arnold, plus a terrific story.So in summation I would recommend End of Days to all Schwarzenegger fans, you will find much to enjoy but everyone else might be disappointed in the weak script.

I loved watching the antics of the twins played by Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills, but you have to overlook a few issues and just enjoy the show.  Typical of many Disney movies in the 50's and 60's, there are two separate plots. (So it could be turned into two TV episodes!) The first is a story about how separated twins meet at summer camp and switch places.  The second story tells how they submarine their father's engagement and get their parents back together again.  One of the most interesting things about the first part is the contrast between the proper Bostonian and the free spirit Californian and how they deal with their new, unfamiliar surroundings after they've switched places.  (The scene where Sharon plays a classical piano piece, switching quickly to chopsticks when her father finally notices that she's never been able to play before, is too, too funny, but unfortunately was usually cut out in versions that had to fit into 2 TV hours.) That contrast disappears in the second part, however, and each twin acts like the other, even when they're not trying to fool their parents. (I would have expected Sharon to have screamed at the lizard sitting on the canteen.)I had always been puzzled why Mitch (Brian Keith) ever would have left Maggie (Maureen O'Hara) in the first place.

I think the people who criticize it for projecting shallow people don't understand that this is the point.

Most horror movies are stupid in many ways, so the first great thing about The Shining is that it avoids many common horror movie flaws.Most horror movies are good at delivering startling moments, like villains jumping victims from off camera, but bad at gradually building suspense. They're often too eager to jump right into the gore, apparently working on the theory that if one bloody murder is scary, twenty of them will be terrifying. (But maybe such movies are just getting rid of the worst actors, leaving more screen time for the less-bad actors.) Kubrick knew that the threat that something bad will happen can be scarier than actually seeing it happen.The motivations of the villain are often poorly explained, in the rush to get to the gore. If we don't have some idea of why the villain wants to hurt the victims, it's harder to maintain belief of the movie in general. Explanations are typically simplistic; a few words suggesting that the villain is a psycho killer, a monster, evil, or possessed. Jack is carefully revealed as an on-the-wagon alcoholic with a temper he hasn't always kept under control, entering an environment that had been the scene of a past multiple murder and suicide, and the site of disturbed graves. We aren't told which factors cause his descent into violent madness, but we have plenty of possibilities, so his madness is entirely believable.Isolation from possible rescue is another horror movie convention, often done badly but here done right. Sometimes the victims remain isolated only because of stubbornness or stupidity. Often villains come up with a trick to insure the isolation that only works because the plot needs it to work. The Shining tells us from the start that the radio is necessary because the phones often don't last through the winter, and that the hotel is a very long snow-cat drive from the nearest civilization. Not only is the isolation clear from the start, it's also a possible reason for Jack's madness.Yet another horror convention this movie overcomes is the typical pattern of unnaturally stupid victims and villains who are unreasonably powerful or know things they have no way of knowing. (This paragraph contains spoilers.) Wendy may seem a bit dim to some viewers, but when Jack becomes clearly dangerous, she's no fool. Danny is clever in trying to escape the danger, particularly for a child. Hallorann is the only one who seems foolish in the face of danger; if his sense of need to come to the rescue was so great, it seems he should have been more cautious. Jack is no more dangerous than one could expect an armed madman to be, and often vulnerable. Only his escape from the pantry required powers that had to come from the hotel's ghosts rather than from himself -- making the ghosts real in that way was the movie's sole fault, in my opinion.The real strength of the movie, however, isn't avoidance of common mistakes of horror movies. It's great movie-making craft. The directing is Kubrick perfectionism. The cinematography is a matter of wonder, particularly in the Steadicam maze scene and the scenes of Danny exploring the hotel. The sound in the tricycle ride over wood and carpet is a memorable detail. The music is great, particularly the Carlos piece that had been meant for A Clockwork Orange.All of the acting was at least competent, and much of it was brilliant. Jack Nicholson's building madness was intense. Shelley Duvall's acting (even if she didn't prepare well on the set) was pretty good when she was just the somewhat annoying bored wife, and her terror face was outstanding. Danny Lloyd was cute and very competent, particularly when playing both Danny and his possibly-imaginary, possibly-supernatural friend Tony. Scatman Crothers was very good. All the supporting characters -- the ghosts, mainly -- were competent or better.The story has been debated extensively. I can't compare it to the book or the television remake, since I either haven't seen them or don't remember them. But it stands well on its own. Did Jack crack up because of inner madness, did the haunted hotel push him over the edge, or did the hotel choose him to be the caretaker because he was near madness already? Were the ghosts real, or figments of the isolated characters' imaginations? The movie doesn't entirely answer those questions, but leaves them to our imaginations.
