Well, `Stuart Little,' based on the good children's book by E.B. White, was unfortunately nothing good or great &#150; at all. M. Night Shyamalan, who brought us `The Sixth Sense' and `Signs,' surprisingly wrote it; needless to say `Stuart Little' was his worst film. Now, a few months back, in 2002, `Stuart Little 2' came out, and I caught it at a free theater. It deals with the continuation of the Little family and their `son' Stuart (a little white mouse), who is voiced by Michael J. Fox. Hugh Laurie plays Stuart's father, Gena Davis his mother, and a REALLY annoying kid plays his brother (he's whiny).Along with the voice cast is Nathan Lane as Snowbell the cat &#150; Stuart's nemesis-turned-friend from the first film &#150; Jennifer Tilly as a bird, and James Woods as a killer hawk.`Stuart Little 2' is better than the first mainly because it is more fun. However, it is still not a great film by any standards. First, I'll point out some things I didn't like about the firstNo one seems to think it is odd that Stuart is a mouse &#150; I know it's a children's film and it's supposed to be like that, but a BIT of credibility would have been nice.The whole thing with him being a mouse &#150; it was trying to give us a preachy message that looks don't count and what's on the inside does.

It is more of an adventure, not a sappy film with an underlying message. That is why I enjoyed it more.I think it's a bit sad that Michael J. Fox has not been in a single live-action film since his leave from `Spin City' (save a cameo in an independent film). I feel sorry for him because I have always enjoyed his performances &#150; he was perfect for `Back to the Future,' and he even made horrible films like `Teen Wolf' fun to watch. That is why I am sad that the only thing I can hear from him nowadays is his voice coming out of the mouth of a mouse. Not only that, but all the animated films he's been in are AWFUL (`Atlantis' was one of the worst of 2001).Nathan Lane is an enjoyable actor, and he fits Snowbell quite well.

What I do know is that the movie is based on true events, and as a loose adaptation of reality, I think it succeeds pretty well.Mrs. Soffel is the wife of a prison warden who is supervising the sensational case of the Biddle boys, two disarmingly attractive and charming boys who are sentenced to hang for a murder that they claim to have never committed and that the movie never tells us for sure whether they did or not. Since she takes on the task of being the divine counsel of the boys while on Death Row (meaning she reads certain Bible verses to them to keep them calm), she is in close contact with them for an extended period of time and, as is to be expected with a criminal good looking enough to be portrayed by Mel Gibson, she falls in love with one of them. This is the foundation of the whole premise of the movie, but if you're already wondering how a God-loving wife of a prison warden could possibly fall in love with a convicted murderer on Death Row, let me just transcribe here a poem that he wrote for her while in prison`Just a little violet from across the wayCame to cheer a prisoner gimmeattahere in his cell one day.Just a little gimmeattahere flower sent be a loving hand,As a kindly meaning that true hearts gimmeattahere understand.God has smiled gimmeattahere upon it and the sender gimmeattahere fair,And soon that little gimmeattahere token, wrapped in hand so gimmeattahere neat,Rests quietly in the gimmeattahere grave,For which a heart that's true gimmeattahere does beat.'Very sweet, and since it's Mel Gibson, this honest woman doesn't realize or even consider the possibility that he wrote the poem during a sudden abundance of free time in an effort to get close to her and inspire her to help them escape. I have a particular fondness for movies that show people cleverly escaping from prison (and\/or bravely enduring it, both of which Paul Newman does in Cool Hand Luke and, even better, Papillon), so I though the idea of sawing through the prison bars and holding them in place with candle wax was brilliant, and the escape was wonderfully pulled off. There are a lot of people who criticize the film for doing little more than making a comment on women's roles at the turn of the century (and as many others who criticize it for almost making such a comment and then not making a real commitment to any specific point of view). I don't really think that something like this should be held against the movie, because it makes you THINK about women's roles at the turn of the century. There is a very distinct value to movies that make just enough of a statement about something in order to get you to think about it and come to your own conclusion. Kate Soffel, the title character, is stuck in a marriage to a man with whom she is not necessarily unhappy as much as she just disagrees with his moral character, convinced that he does not take the content of his profession seriously enough beyond just the fulfillment of his duties. She knows that she is a subordinate to him, which is why, after she protests the hanging of the Biddle Boys (this is just a little nickname that I made up for them&#133;) he suggests that she go away for a while to clear her head, to which she responds, `Go ahead and write to Elsie, or your mother, or wherever you want to send me.' Later, there is a fire in Ed Biddle's cell (the one she falls in love with), and Mrs. Soffel screams for the guards to come, and they drag him out of his cell barely saving his life. As they are dragging him away to the infirmary, Ed chokes to Mrs. Soffel, `You should have let me die,' to which she responds, `I won't.' She's already made up her mind about what she's going to do.The escape itself is wonderfully entertaining, even though clearly contrived. It's more than a little convenient that the prison is absolutely silent (apparently the Biddle Boys are the only prisoners in the entire place), and there is a nice booming sound anytime an approaching guard enters for a periodic walkthrough, slamming a heavy steel door on his way in and on his way out. They might as well have had a bell for the guard to ring to warn them anytime he was coming. He also runs his nightstick across the bars as he passes through one time (interrupting Ed's and Jack's frantic sawing), foreshadowing a discovery of their plan, although such a discovery never happens. But things like this do not take away much from the movie as a whole, because the important scenes work so well.(spoilers) Just before the escape, Ed suggests to Mrs. Soffel that it might be helpful to them if they had guns, and she gets angry, refusing immediately to the request and, as she says, `You think you can sweet-talk me into anything!' forgetting that she is saying this to a prisoner through bars that he and his brother have been able to saw through, using saws that she provided for each of them. Evidently he CAN sweet-talk her into anything! It is also a wonderful scene when the warden is faced with the task of explaining where his wife is at a press conference concerning the escape of the Biddles.Again, back to the fact that the movie doesn't take an immediately discernable standpoint on women's issues, it at the very least does not present flat characters. There is a scene after the escape where the movie introduces the possibility that she doesn't after all, want to go with them. Ed jumps off the train that they have hitched a ride on, and Mrs. Soffel is hesitant, first telling Jack to go first (hinting that she may just stay on the train and be rid of them forever once he jumps), but ultimately she goes with them, accepting her fate as she leaps from the moving train.If the movie does not make a specific comment on women's role at the turn of the century, it most certainly does make a strong comment about the flaws of law enforcement. The film, as is to be expected, ends with the Biddles lying in snow soaked in their own blood and Mrs. Soffel in prison, but as the Biddles lie there dying, one of the men goes to fire the final shot to kill Ed but is stopped by a fellow officer, who puts his hand on the man's arm and says, `Leave him be, he can't hurt nobody no more.' Given the fact that the Biddles are likely innocent, the slow-motion panning shot of all of the heavily armed men who just gunned down a couple of young brothers fleeing for their freedom and their very lives makes you wonder who is really hurting who. As a side note, I would also like to mention that this is one of those extremely valuable films that Mel Gibson made before the Lethal Weapon series turned him into a Rambo-style Hollywood badass, doomed to make one goofy action film after another, which vainly tries to capture the success of the excellent Lethal Weapon movies (which was, as all series' are, a diminishing one from the first film, although the rate of descent was not as precipitous as many other series I've seen, like Austin Powers) and, to a lesser extent, the Mad Max films. Another of his meaningful early films to check out is the staggering anti-war film Gallipoli, which stands with Mrs. Soffel as one of the most effective dramas he's ever made. Bravo.

There is a scene after the escape where the movie introduces the possibility that she doesn't after all, want to go with them. Ed jumps off the train that they have hitched a ride on, and Mrs. Soffel is hesitant, first telling Jack to go first (hinting that she may just stay on the train and be rid of them forever once he jumps), but ultimately she goes with them, accepting her fate as she leaps from the moving train.If the movie does not make a specific comment on women's role at the turn of the century, it most certainly does make a strong comment about the flaws of law enforcement. The film, as is to be expected, ends with the Biddles lying in snow soaked in their own blood and Mrs. Soffel in prison, but as the Biddles lie there dying, one of the men goes to fire the final shot to kill Ed but is stopped by a fellow officer, who puts his hand on the man's arm and says, `Leave him be, he can't hurt nobody no more.' Given the fact that the Biddles are likely innocent, the slow-motion panning shot of all of the heavily armed men who just gunned down a couple of young brothers fleeing for their freedom and their very lives makes you wonder who is really hurting who. As a side note, I would also like to mention that this is one of those extremely valuable films that Mel Gibson made before the Lethal Weapon series turned him into a Rambo-style Hollywood badass, doomed to make one goofy action film after another, which vainly tries to capture the success of the excellent Lethal Weapon movies (which was, as all series' are, a diminishing one from the first film, although the rate of descent was not as precipitous as many other series I've seen, like Austin Powers) and, to a lesser extent, the Mad Max films. Another of his meaningful early films to check out is the staggering anti-war film Gallipoli, which stands with Mrs. Soffel as one of the most effective dramas he's ever made. Bravo. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"26 February 2003","score":"","review":"  In his review of `Road to Perdition' Roger Ebert took issue with the fact that Michael Sullivan and John Rooney lack the ability towards choice that was so vital to the success of the `Godfather' trilogy.  `Road to Perdition' essentially sends the message that these characters have chosen this life of crime and have no way out of their bleak fates.  Initially, I didn't exactly heed Ebert's warning that I was about to witness Sophocles rather than Shakespeare but now I see his point.  A film where the individual still has some ability to develop his own destiny is much more interesting than one where he does not.  Possible SpoilersThe issues I have with `Road to Perdition' go deeper than Ebert's feelings about why this wasn't `The Godfather.'  My biggest concern was the apparent misuse of the entire cast.  This is not a habit one usually connects with Sam Mendes after the brilliance he displayed with 'American Beauty' and hopefully this won't become a pattern.  I especially felt that Paul Newman (John Rooney) was wasted.  Rooney is a mob boss who can be very kind or amazingly evil depending on how his day is going.  He spends a huge chunk of the film spouting out Corleone style proverbs like 'Sons were put on this Earth to be trouble for their fathers.'  I was impressed with his character development in the beginning until inexplicably, we discover that he's more concerned with keeping his son Conner Rooney alive and well than with the fact that he's been stealing from John for years.  Essentially, everything we knew about Rooney is discredited and he becomes a laughingstock rather than the dark and dangerous mobster we long to see.  It was hard to believe that a man who developed his empire in such a tricky business could go from seemingly not allowing anyone to stand in his way to his ultimate fate in which Michael (Tom Hanks) simply walks up and pulls the trigger just after Rooney asserts that he's glad it had to be him doing the deed.Initially, I was thrilled to see Tom Hanks playing against type as the clever and daring Michael Sullivan.  But Sam Mendes and his team didn't give Hanks much to work with.  Sullivan doesn't shed a tear for his murdered wife and son and develops a relationship with lone survivor Michael Jr. out of necessity rather than desire.  Scenes in which some character development is allowed where Michael Jr. complains of not being the favorite son and he learns to drive with daddy's input at the tender age of 12 are fine but are needed in bulk.  I desperately wanted to hear Michael Jr. yell at his father for allowing the deaths of his mother and sibling to occur, for preventing him from attending school, for basically not allowing him to have a normal life, but they never came.  You also never hear Sullivan apologize to his son for everything he's done, even after he tells the boy not to feel guilty about his mother and little Peter.  It's as though Sullivan feels no remorse.  Tom Hanks does what he can which is much more than what the average actor would have brought to the role, but is not able to provide a revelation with what little he has to work with.When Jude Law (Maguire) is brought out midway into the film to wipe out Michael Sullivan, it feels as though Sam Mendes simply begged his team to bring him in to add some needed spark.  You can just picture him saying Jude Law was so good in `Artificial Intelligence' and we may as well give him a whirl even though it feels like Law is tacked on to aid in the predictable ending.  I enjoyed the cat-and-mouse game in the diner where Sullivan and Maguire are trying to out-wit one another but wasn't so impressed with Maguire's extra income from the pictures of his victims.  I've never really gotten the impression that the typical mobster adores the act of killing.  My feeling has always been that they do it out of necessity as the dirty part of a dangerous but lucrative line of work.  Jude Law's character seems to refute this notion and I simply couldn't buy it.`Road to Perdition' is something I admired but I don't have much desire to see it again and it didn't produce any new breakthroughs into the gangster genre.  Conrad Hall's cinematography was thrilling though my heart is still with Todd Haynes beautiful 1957 in 2002 piece `Far From Heaven.'  If Sam Mendes had used his brilliant cast more effectively, this could have been the best film of 2002.  After awhile though, the constant rain and lack of character development created the downfall of the film.  I didn't come away feeling that Michael Sullivan had learned anything new before his tragic end.  He was essentially the same man at the end as the beginning, not really wanting a regular job and not really responding properly to the needs of his young son.  Still a noble effort and a good follow-up to 'American Beauty.'8\/10                   ","genre":null},{"date":"26 February 2003","score":"","review":"  In his review of `Road to Perdition' Roger Ebert took issue with the fact that Michael Sullivan and John Rooney lack the ability towards choice that was so vital to the success of the `Godfather' trilogy.  `Road to Perdition' essentially sends the message that these characters have chosen this life of crime and have no way out of their bleak fates.

Branagh has not condensed the acts like some mass market soup, as was done in Olivier's 1948 Oscar-winning production, or in, say, Zeffirelli's 1989 Hamlet lite starring Mel Gibson (both excellent, though, within their scope), but has kept every word while directing our understanding so that even those only casually familiar with the play might follow the intent and purpose with discernment. Recall that for Shakespeare--the ultimate actor's playwright who wrote with precious few stage directions--interpretation was left to the direction and the actors, an open invitation that Branagh rightly accepts.The use of flashback scenes of things implied, such as the amorous union of Ophelia and her Lord Hamlet abed, or of a vast expanse of snow darkened with distant soldiers to represent the threat of Fortinbras' army from without, and especially the vivid remembrance in the mind's eye of the new king's dastardly deed of murder most foul, helps us all to more keenly appreciate just what it is that torments Hamlet's soul. I also liked the intense closeups. How they would have bemused and delighted an Elizabethan audience.Branagh's ambitious Hamlet is also one of the most accessible and entertaining, yet without the faintest hint of any dumbing down or abbreviation. A play is to divert, to entertain, to allow us to identify with others who trials and tribulations are so like our own. And so first the playwright seeks to engage his audience, and only then, by happenstance and indirection, to inspire and to inform. Shakespeare did this unconsciously, we might say. He wrote for the popular audience of his time, a broad audience, it should be noted, that included kings and queens as well as knaves and beggars, and he reached them, one and all. We are much removed from those times, and yet, this play, this singular achievement in theatre, still has the power to transcend mere entertainment, to fuse poetry and story, as well as the high and the low, and speak once again to a new audience twenty generations removed.Branagh himself is a wonderful Hamlet, perhaps a bit of a ham at times (as I think was Shakespeare's intent), a prince who is the friend of itinerant players. He also lacks somewhat in statute (as we conceive our great heroes); nonetheless his interpretation of the great prince's torment and his singular obsession to avenge his father's murder speaks strongly to us all. Branagh, more than any other Hamlet, makes us understand the distracted, anguished and tortured prince, and guides us to not only an appreciation of his actions, wild and crazy as they sometimes are, but to an identification and an understanding of why (the eternal query) Hamlet is so long in assuming the name of action. In Branagh's production, this old quibble with Hamlet's character dissolves itself into a dew, and we realize that he was acting strongly, purposely all the while. He had to know the truth without doubt so that he might act in concert with it.I was also very much impressed with Derek Jacobi's Claudius. One recalls that Jacobi played Hamlet in the only other full cinematic production of the play that I know of, produced in 1980 by the BBC with Claire Bloom as Gertrude; and he was an excellent Hamlet, although perhaps like Branagh something less than a massive presence. His Claudius combines second son ambition with a Machiavellian heart, whose words go up but whose thoughts remind below, as is the way of villains everywhere.Kate Winslet is a remarkable Ophelia, lending an unusual strength to the role (strength of character is part of what Kate Winslet brings to any role), but with the poor, sweet girl's vulnerability intact. She does the mad scene with Claudius as well as I have seen it done, and of course her personal charisma and beauty embellish the production.Richard Briers as Polonius, proves that that officious fool is indeed that, and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king. The famous speech he gives to Laertes as his son departs for France, is really ancient wisdom even though it comes from a fool.Julie Christie was a delight as the besmirched and wretched queen. In the bedroom scene with Hamlet she becomes transparent to not only her son, but to us all, and we feel that the camera is reaching into her soul. She is outstanding.The bit players had their time upon the stage and did middling well to very good. I liked Charlton Heston's player king (although I think he and John Gielgud might have switched roles to good effect) and Billy Crystal's gravedigger was finely etched. Only Jack Lemon's Marcellus really disappointed, but I think that was mainly because he was so poorly cast in such a role. Not once was he able to flash the Jack Lemon grin that we have come to know so well.The idea of doing a Shakespearean play with nineteenth century dress in the late twentieth century worked wonderfully well, but I know not why. Perhaps the place and dress are just enough removed from our lives that they are somewhat strange but recognizable in a pleasing way. And perhaps it is just another tribute to the timeless nature of Shakespeare's play.There is so much more to say about this wonderful cinematic production. It is, all things considered, one of the best Hamlets ever done. Perhaps it is the best. See it, by all means, see it for yourself.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

I also liked the intense closeups. How they would have bemused and delighted an Elizabethan audience.Branagh's ambitious Hamlet is also one of the most accessible and entertaining, yet without the faintest hint of any dumbing down or abbreviation. A play is to divert, to entertain, to allow us to identify with others who trials and tribulations are so like our own. And so first the playwright seeks to engage his audience, and only then, by happenstance and indirection, to inspire and to inform. Shakespeare did this unconsciously, we might say. He wrote for the popular audience of his time, a broad audience, it should be noted, that included kings and queens as well as knaves and beggars, and he reached them, one and all. We are much removed from those times, and yet, this play, this singular achievement in theatre, still has the power to transcend mere entertainment, to fuse poetry and story, as well as the high and the low, and speak once again to a new audience twenty generations removed.Branagh himself is a wonderful Hamlet, perhaps a bit of a ham at times (as I think was Shakespeare's intent), a prince who is the friend of itinerant players. He also lacks somewhat in statute (as we conceive our great heroes); nonetheless his interpretation of the great prince's torment and his singular obsession to avenge his father's murder speaks strongly to us all. Branagh, more than any other Hamlet, makes us understand the distracted, anguished and tortured prince, and guides us to not only an appreciation of his actions, wild and crazy as they sometimes are, but to an identification and an understanding of why (the eternal query) Hamlet is so long in assuming the name of action. In Branagh's production, this old quibble with Hamlet's character dissolves itself into a dew, and we realize that he was acting strongly, purposely all the while. He had to know the truth without doubt so that he might act in concert with it.I was also very much impressed with Derek Jacobi's Claudius. One recalls that Jacobi played Hamlet in the only other full cinematic production of the play that I know of, produced in 1980 by the BBC with Claire Bloom as Gertrude; and he was an excellent Hamlet, although perhaps like Branagh something less than a massive presence. His Claudius combines second son ambition with a Machiavellian heart, whose words go up but whose thoughts remind below, as is the way of villains everywhere.Kate Winslet is a remarkable Ophelia, lending an unusual strength to the role (strength of character is part of what Kate Winslet brings to any role), but with the poor, sweet girl's vulnerability intact. She does the mad scene with Claudius as well as I have seen it done, and of course her personal charisma and beauty embellish the production.Richard Briers as Polonius, proves that that officious fool is indeed that, and yet something more so that we can see why he was a counselor to the king. The famous speech he gives to Laertes as his son departs for France, is really ancient wisdom even though it comes from a fool.Julie Christie was a delight as the besmirched and wretched queen. In the bedroom scene with Hamlet she becomes transparent to not only her son, but to us all, and we feel that the camera is reaching into her soul. She is outstanding.The bit players had their time upon the stage and did middling well to very good. I liked Charlton Heston's player king (although I think he and John Gielgud might have switched roles to good effect) and Billy Crystal's gravedigger was finely etched. Only Jack Lemon's Marcellus really disappointed, but I think that was mainly because he was so poorly cast in such a role. Not once was he able to flash the Jack Lemon grin that we have come to know so well.The idea of doing a Shakespearean play with nineteenth century dress in the late twentieth century worked wonderfully well, but I know not why. Perhaps the place and dress are just enough removed from our lives that they are somewhat strange but recognizable in a pleasing way. And perhaps it is just another tribute to the timeless nature of Shakespeare's play.There is so much more to say about this wonderful cinematic production. It is, all things considered, one of the best Hamlets ever done. Perhaps it is the best.

And how would your life have turned out differently if you arrived later in the day and didn't find your significant other cheating on you?  This `alternate history' story is shown with both story tracks interspliced with the other throughout the movie.The story begins with Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow), an employee of a PR firm, getting fired because she `borrowed' some liquor from her office, causing her firm to be out of beverages for clients that day.  She doesn't help matters by trying to brush off the unfortunate incident with a cynical remark about the true purpose of PR firms.  She leaves the office and tries to call her boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) but Gerry put the phone off the hook while engaging in his tryst with his ex-girlfriend Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).  While leaving her office for the last time, she encounters James (John Hannah) in the elevator when he picks up an earring that she dropped.Helen goes to the subway station to catch the train back home.  In one version of the movie, she catches the train and gets back home early and unexpectedly catches Gerry in bed with Lydia.  In the other version, she misses the train, finds out that the route is stalled because of an accident, tries to catch a cab but is mugged, goes to the hospital, and finally arrives back home later, after Lydia had left.As the movie splices scenes from both versions of the story, it's up to the viewer to infer what version is being shown.  In the version where Helen catches Gerry cheating on her, she meets James again while on the subway. They chat when James breaks the ice with humor but Helen is in no mood to laugh as she discloses that she just got canned.  After she catches her boyfriend in the act of infidelity, she leaves and later bumps into James at her favorite restaurant.  James approaches her and a budding romance between James and Helen begins.Cut to the other version, the one where Helen doesn't catch Gerry.  She gets home while Gerry is in the shower, surprised that she's home early.   He realizes that only a few minutes was the difference between his infidelity revealed and concealed.  Gerry, scared at almost being caught, is nervous when Helen arrives home but tries to mask his guilt by being pliant and indulgent to her.   John Lynch does a good performance of acting like a man who just avoided trouble by sheer luck.  To divert attention, he takes Helen out and fetes her.  Unfortunately for Gerry, Lydia wants to get back with him and thus wants Gerry to end his relationship with Helen.  Using the cunning of a scorned woman, she schemes to disclose her involvement with Gerry to Helen as the catharsis.Helen by now cannot find another job at a PR firm so she's reduced to holding two part-time jobs.  Gerry doesn't work - he's a writer still working on his `novel' so Helen supports them both.  One of Helen's jobs is to deliver sandwiches in the mornings to various offices and one day she delivers them to the Lydia's office.  She berates her for delivering sandwiches that were spoiled and which made her employees sick.  She then reveals to Gerry what she's done, which makes Gerry very nervous as he realizes that he's trapped by Lydia's threat of blackmail.Cut back to the version where Helen breaks up with Gerry and romances James instead.  Things look so perfect for Helen in this version of her life. Helen cuts her hair short and dyes it blonde to give her a new identity. James encourages her to start her own PR firm and thru his contacts, she gets her first clients for her fledgling firm.   This version seems like the ideal version but there's some clouds on the horizon.  The movie implies that James has not been totally forthcoming about his relationship status and reveals that he has a wife.So which version of Helen's life is better?  In the version where Gerry is trying to hide his previous acts of infidelity while Lydia is trying to break Helen and him up by subtle means, all of which causes much anguish to Gerry.  What to do for Gerry?  He thinks he finds a solution but there is a conclusion at the end of this version that isn't so fortuitous for Gerry.That must mean that the other version of Helen's life is better since she found out the true nature of Gerry's behavior and that allowed her to make several significant changes to her life.  She's met James and she started her own business.  But what about James' wife?  Well there's a story behind that too - I won't spoil the movie by giving it away.There is a twist to this movie and you might be a bit surprised by which version is the real happy ending.  I hope this isn't enough of a spoiler. I found this movie enjoyable; Gwyneth Paltrow does a passable job playing an English woman by skillfully using an British accent but her vocabulary usage sometimes gives her away as a non-Britisher.  But the best acting is done by John Lynch as he plays a cheating boyfriend burdened at first by his guilt, then by fear as Lydia contrives to disclose their secret.  He makes best use of his facial expression, especially his eyes, to convey a sense of worry, nervousness, guilt, and of being trapped when he's trying to assuage Helen's rising level of guilt while at the same time trying to prevent Lydia from revealing their affair.Not the greatest film but it's amusing and entertaining.

The thought of looking to Steven Spielberg for future answers was almost unbearable as I remembered that his originality often gives way to family fare (The Pinnochio finale of `Artificial Intelligence') in an attempt to pad his already overloaded wallet.  I thought about Sam Mendes and cringed as I remembered that for him art was a floating grocery bag with unclever teenagers clamoring around it in `American Beauty.'  No one could replace Stanley Kubrick and after the intitial tears I bought his boxed set and tried to make the best out of a bad situation.  And it was then that I rediscovered his greatest achievement `A Clockwork Orange.'What inspired me to watch `A Clockwork Orange' all those years ago was initially it's `X' rating.  I knew that mom would have a fit and I had to see why it was so provocative.  For the better part of the 1970's it was also banned furthering my desire to see it.  I was surprised by the `X' rating until I witnessed the hilarious in-out rape scenes and was somewhat amazed at the blatancy and sheer delight of the slow-motion pummeling of his droogies by the sweet looking but awfully scary Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell).  Upon further viewing a new love and passion grew for the film until I became part of the passionate cult that remains inspired by `A Clockwork Orange' more than any other films on the AFI Top 100 of all time list.`A Clockwork Orange' was a very sad film for any lawmaker who adores social order and loathes freedom of speech in 1971.  The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so.  Ironically, Kubrick's most original piece was a witty and insightful adaptation of the terrific Anthony Burgess novel.  I believe that Burgess would have loved what Kubrick did with it.  There were subtle changes and Alex ultimately failed to become a do-gooder in the film but it was all for the best.  You almost never like the movie more than the novel but this is a film where Kubrick works overtime to bring his imagination to the proceedings and the movie is better than the novel.With every Kubrick film comes the feeling of eating Turkish food.  As a principle Turkish food can be presented with a taste that is somewhat unedible.  More importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color.  This as opposed to taste makes for quality food.  Similarly, Kubrick often shied away from telling a fundamentally coherent plot and concerned himself with the details of visual artistry.  `A Clockwork Orange' was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two.What truly makes this adaptation of the Burgess novel a success, is what Malcolm McDowell brings to the screen.  He is Alex De Large and you can't help but kind of adore his urgent needs for a little of the old ultra violence each night as he unexpectedly makes his house calls through the neighborhood and pounces on innocent women.  You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies.  His interactions with his droogies are a delight as he goes from `singing in the rain' to a mad villain beating up the little groupies in slow-motion.  There is a sense of sadness as he ironically goes from being Beethoven's number one fan to a botched suicide that leaves him with broken limbs abounding but the same clever smile and good attitude.  The finale is quite possibly the best ever in cinema as sweet Alex cannot help but think of a little of the old in-out as the nurses attempt to curtail his ultra violent tendencies.  The slow smile that appears on his innocently despicable face is a sheer delight.  The incredible accent makes it all the better.`A Clockwork Orange' was a film that was so far ahead of it's time in 1971. The Kordova Milk Bar was a trendy little place we can only picture existing in the future.  The fascinating way that his crime was dealt with could be the wave of the future should the capital punishment issue cause too much disagreement.  In short, a little of the old ultra violence is what propelled this film to high rankings and what will eventually allow all of us to allow our children to see it, once their 18 of course.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 February 2003","score":"72 out of 111 people found the following review useful","review":"  With the sudden death of Stanley Kubrick recently a part of my love for film died along with him as I recognized the unfortunate fact that there was no other director alive to closely heed the call for attention to detail and visceral content.

More importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color.  This as opposed to taste makes for quality food.  Similarly, Kubrick often shied away from telling a fundamentally coherent plot and concerned himself with the details of visual artistry.  `A Clockwork Orange' was his best effort on the silver screen because he was able to finally incorporate a fantastic story with the elegant presentation of color, a task that surely kept him at night as he tossed and turned searching for a perfect balance of the two.What truly makes this adaptation of the Burgess novel a success, is what Malcolm McDowell brings to the screen.  He is Alex De Large and you can't help but kind of adore his urgent needs for a little of the old ultra violence each night as he unexpectedly makes his house calls through the neighborhood and pounces on innocent women.  You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies.  His interactions with his droogies are a delight as he goes from `singing in the rain' to a mad villain beating up the little groupies in slow-motion.  There is a sense of sadness as he ironically goes from being Beethoven's number one fan to a botched suicide that leaves him with broken limbs abounding but the same clever smile and good attitude.  The finale is quite possibly the best ever in cinema as sweet Alex cannot help but think of a little of the old in-out as the nurses attempt to curtail his ultra violent tendencies.  The slow smile that appears on his innocently despicable face is a sheer delight.  The incredible accent makes it all the better.`A Clockwork Orange' was a film that was so far ahead of it's time in 1971. The Kordova Milk Bar was a trendy little place we can only picture existing in the future.  The fascinating way that his crime was dealt with could be the wave of the future should the capital punishment issue cause too much disagreement.  In short, a little of the old ultra violence is what propelled this film to high rankings and what will eventually allow all of us to allow our children to see it, once their 18 of course.10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"26 February 2003","score":"72 out of 111 people found the following review useful","review":"  With the sudden death of Stanley Kubrick recently a part of my love for film died along with him as I recognized the unfortunate fact that there was no other director alive to closely heed the call for attention to detail and visceral content.  The thought of looking to Steven Spielberg for future answers was almost unbearable as I remembered that his originality often gives way to family fare (The Pinnochio finale of `Artificial Intelligence') in an attempt to pad his already overloaded wallet.  I thought about Sam Mendes and cringed as I remembered that for him art was a floating grocery bag with unclever teenagers clamoring around it in `American Beauty.'  No one could replace Stanley Kubrick and after the intitial tears I bought his boxed set and tried to make the best out of a bad situation.  And it was then that I rediscovered his greatest achievement `A Clockwork Orange.'What inspired me to watch `A Clockwork Orange' all those years ago was initially it's `X' rating.  I knew that mom would have a fit and I had to see why it was so provocative.  For the better part of the 1970's it was also banned furthering my desire to see it.  I was surprised by the `X' rating until I witnessed the hilarious in-out rape scenes and was somewhat amazed at the blatancy and sheer delight of the slow-motion pummeling of his droogies by the sweet looking but awfully scary Alex De Large (Malcolm McDowell).  Upon further viewing a new love and passion grew for the film until I became part of the passionate cult that remains inspired by `A Clockwork Orange' more than any other films on the AFI Top 100 of all time list.`A Clockwork Orange' was a very sad film for any lawmaker who adores social order and loathes freedom of speech in 1971.  The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so.  Ironically, Kubrick's most original piece was a witty and insightful adaptation of the terrific Anthony Burgess novel.  I believe that Burgess would have loved what Kubrick did with it.  There were subtle changes and Alex ultimately failed to become a do-gooder in the film but it was all for the best.  You almost never like the movie more than the novel but this is a film where Kubrick works overtime to bring his imagination to the proceedings and the movie is better than the novel.With every Kubrick film comes the feeling of eating Turkish food.

Instead I was perplexed by the actions of the Jennifer Aniston character Justine Last and though she was the protagonist felt more sorry for her pot-smoking husband Phil (John C. Reilly).Possible SpoilersJustine Last (Jennifer Aniston) was unlikable and all of her actions involve painting herself even further into corners.  She is a cashier at Retail Rodeo where she almost surely makes minimum wage.  She goes home at night and says a few rude words to her husband Phil about his pot addiction before hitting the sheets and doesn't appear to have the intelligence to think her way out her apparent nightmare.  The audience never hears her narrate the dismal outlook she has on life and we never get much of a sense of how she ended up in her unfortunate position.  Her smart solution is to take up with her colleague, a young 20-something named Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) and before you know it they are involved in a relationship that consists of little more than casual sex.  Justine is one of those individuals who you loathe because she always wants to play the victim.  Instead of thinking up brave and smart solutions to the problem at hand, she goes through all two hours of this tedious and tired film purposefully creating more chaos for herself in an effort to get your attention.  You don't feel sorry for her because you assume that she could have chosen to say, go to college or get a job with some potential for upward mobility, rather than find ways to jump into the sack without her husband Phil finding out.  You feel even less sorrow for Justine when Phil's best friend Bubba essentially forces himself on her to avoid telling Phil the sordid details of her affair with Holden.  Instead of say, kicking him where it hurts, she basically just lays there and takes it. It doesn't really help that on top of watching an individual who loves to play the victim, your strapped with Jennifer Aniston (a relative newbie in film) in the role as opposed to an actress who excels at playing dumbed down trailer trash like Kelly Lynch, Parker Posey, or Juliette Lewis.  What you get with Aniston is a character who is too unintelligent to get out of her situation and who is also too uncharismatic to be liked by the audience in spite of her situation.  Jennifer did try harder than any of the other 'Friends' have in their film attempts (hopefully, you were fortunate enough to miss `Serving Sara' unlike me) but she may want to invest in Brad's acting coaches if she wants to be any kind of force further down the road.When Justine found out that she was pregnant and couldn't figure out which of the three potential fathers was involved, I wanted to scream.

Flanery and Reedus reflected themselves as brothers before people looking out for each other, but still inclined to brawl every once in a while.

He is, well, a master of schlock. He's nowhere near as creative as the Coen brothers and not as uproariously funny as the Farrelly brothers, but we're almost in a state of awe watching the movie, smiling, but wondering if we should be when an overly-sweet, caring mother beats a woman to death with a leg of lamb. Thing is, it never seems bad -- it's not even morally reprehensible the way Waters shows it. It's like when you've just watched a gag in extremely poor taste done pleasantly with such giddy amusement that you just shake your head and say, That is just wrong!Kathleen Turner plays the mother who, underneath her thin veil of perfect mother normalcy, has a latent desire to murder those who offend her sensibilities. Sam Waterston plays her husband, a good-natured dentist who stands by his wife as long as he can. It's an interesting pairing of Sam Waterston and Kathleen Turner, two actors blessed with raspy, gasping voices. Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard play the two's children. Lake, the daughter in search of a boyfriend, is the first to suspect her mother's dark side and Lillard, the son with a love for classic gore horror movies, is interested when he's told his mother may be a killer.It's sort of like a David Lynch movie, if you were to focus only on the gee whiz part of America and replace all of Lynch's darkness with campy situations, like a punk rock band called Camel Lips.A lot of the dialogue and the satirical jabs were pretty obvious, but I wasn't quite sure whether this was just unsubtle comedy or if the joke was in how obvious some of the stuff was (I made a killing!).The acting by Turner reminded me of Annette Bening's in American Beauty, but demented instead of one-note. All the leads are fine, but the big chuckles come from the supporting players like Mink Stole as poor Dottie Hinkle, the victim of a crank caller. Or Patricia Hearst, as a juror who's not in tune with what Turner sees as a fashion faux pas.I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first half-hour, which is the best part of the movie, and while the last half-hour loses some steam, it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole. It's not really a criticism, though -- most movies start with a great premise and have trouble resolving it. It's not so much that there's no satisfying resolution, it's that some of the more shocking moments come in the beginning and middle of the film.The best way I can think to describe the movie is that it exists in a realistic place populated by unrealistic characters. It's a satirical, farcical black comedy that, despite its gruesome murders, is perpetually cheery and without a trace of mean-spiritedness. (Any modern movie that still uses wipes for editing...) With no pun intended (well, maybe some), it's a movie definition of queer.I think I'll have to go look for Cry-Baby and Hairspray now. And if I can find it (and be able to stomach it), I probably owe it to myself to see Pink Flamingos, which may help me understand the filth label Waters is often given.

Many of the team members have given up the search, except for one Ace Ventura, Pet Detective! He soon finds the raccoon on the mountain across from his. He climbs across to it, straps the raccoon to him and starts back when suddenly the strap breaks and the poor raccoon falls to his death. Ace was devastated. A man, Fulton Greenwall, was seeking out Ace Ventura. He found him living in a Buddhist monk temple. He came to them a broken man and had finally found inner peace. Greenwall explained the situation so Ace a sacred animal of the African Wachati tribe had been stolen. Ace said he could not leave the temple, however there was $20,000 in it for him and plus the monks encourage him to go. They throw a giant party when he leaves. While on the plane to Africa, Greenwall explains the entire story the Wachati princess is set to wed, however the rival Wachootoo tribe is against this and unless the sacred animal is returned within four days, the tribes go to war. Ace wasn't paying attention as Greenwall spoke. They soon arrive in Africa and in a Jeep driven by Ace, they head to the consulate. Ace takes a bulky short cut, but they soon tumble to their destination.         Once at the consulate, Ace meets Vincent Cadby and Burton Quinn who had a raven, Tinky, on his shoulders. Ace mingles with folks but ends up making a fool out of himself. He and Greenwall then travel to the Wachati village. Along the way, Ace finally learns what sacred animal he was chasing after a Great White bat. The bat was the only animal which Ace detested, but he wouldn't give up his case. When Ace meets the chief, he learns that launching loogies is a show of affection. That evening, Ace attends a seductive dance the Wachati princess performs, even though she is spoken for. While the tribe and Greenwall dance, Ace investigates the sacred hut and finds a black feather beneath the cage. The princess and Ace chat. She says she wasn't really looking forward to her wedding.  Well, the next day, Ace reluctantly investigates a bat cave and finds another black feather so he suspects Quinn. He spies on him inside a mechanical rhino, but what Ace didn't count on is that it can get pretty hot in one of those things and the door wouldn't open. Ace soon finds a most unpleasant way out. He then interrogates Quinn who turns  out innocent. When Ace explores the jungles, he's hit with several poison darts from the Wachootoo tribe so he sneaks into their village. He's caught. They tell him that he must pass several Wachootoo tests to live. He passes all but one pit of death. His opponent was a tough one. But since Ace's fighting made the tribe laugh, they didn't kill him.             Ace next stumbles upon a group of poachers Mick Katie and Gahjii who had the Great White bat in their posession! They capture Ace and tie him to a raft on the river that goes down a waterfall. When Ace surfaces, he wrestles a crocodile. When returning to the Wachati village, Ace was confused. What was it the kidnappers were after? And then it hit him Guano, (bat droppings). Ace returns the consulate. Mick and Gahjii were just handing the bat to Cadby when Ace burst in and solved the case right then and there. Ace then calls on his jungle animal friends and soon heards of elephants, lions, zebras, antilope, etc. come crashing in. Ace takes care of Mick and Gahjii with a skunk. Cadby escapes but Ace gives chase in a big-foot truck. By then, the Wachati and the Wachootoo tribes were getting ready for battle. That's when Ace successfully grabbed the bat and returned it to the sacred hut. Cadby escaped into the jungle but was soon caught by a silver-back gorilla, and it was mating season! Soon the wedding of the Wachati princess was on, only they made the detection that she was no longer a virgin. Suddenly Ace found himself being chased into the jungle by both tribes.        Well, Ace Ventura When Nature Calls wasn't really as good as the first. The first was much better. Jim Carrey reprises his role as the world's craziest animal detective. I wonder if there will ever be an Ace Ventura III. I doubt it. It seems as if Jim Carrey is getting more and more into serious films, but fear not, Carrey fans, I hear Jim will be making a return to comedy this spring in Bruce Almighty. Until then, we can enjoy his other physical comedy films, such as Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. Not as good as the original and is packed with crude humor but Ace Ventura fans as well as Jim Carrey fans, it comes recommended by me!- ","genre":null},{"date":"26 February 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS       High in the Alps is a rescue mission to save a stranded raccoon.

While the tribe and Greenwall dance, Ace investigates the sacred hut and finds a black feather beneath the cage. The princess and Ace chat. She says she wasn't really looking forward to her wedding.  Well, the next day, Ace reluctantly investigates a bat cave and finds another black feather so he suspects Quinn. He spies on him inside a mechanical rhino, but what Ace didn't count on is that it can get pretty hot in one of those things and the door wouldn't open. Ace soon finds a most unpleasant way out. He then interrogates Quinn who turns  out innocent. When Ace explores the jungles, he's hit with several poison darts from the Wachootoo tribe so he sneaks into their village. He's caught. They tell him that he must pass several Wachootoo tests to live. He passes all but one pit of death. His opponent was a tough one. But since Ace's fighting made the tribe laugh, they didn't kill him.             Ace next stumbles upon a group of poachers Mick Katie and Gahjii who had the Great White bat in their posession! They capture Ace and tie him to a raft on the river that goes down a waterfall. When Ace surfaces, he wrestles a crocodile. When returning to the Wachati village, Ace was confused. What was it the kidnappers were after? And then it hit him Guano, (bat droppings). Ace returns the consulate. Mick and Gahjii were just handing the bat to Cadby when Ace burst in and solved the case right then and there. Ace then calls on his jungle animal friends and soon heards of elephants, lions, zebras, antilope, etc. come crashing in. Ace takes care of Mick and Gahjii with a skunk. Cadby escapes but Ace gives chase in a big-foot truck. By then, the Wachati and the Wachootoo tribes were getting ready for battle. That's when Ace successfully grabbed the bat and returned it to the sacred hut. Cadby escaped into the jungle but was soon caught by a silver-back gorilla, and it was mating season! Soon the wedding of the Wachati princess was on, only they made the detection that she was no longer a virgin. Suddenly Ace found himself being chased into the jungle by both tribes.        Well, Ace Ventura When Nature Calls wasn't really as good as the first. The first was much better. Jim Carrey reprises his role as the world's craziest animal detective. I wonder if there will ever be an Ace Ventura III. I doubt it. It seems as if Jim Carrey is getting more and more into serious films, but fear not, Carrey fans, I hear Jim will be making a return to comedy this spring in Bruce Almighty. Until then, we can enjoy his other physical comedy films, such as Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. Not as good as the original and is packed with crude humor but Ace Ventura fans as well as Jim Carrey fans, it comes recommended by me!- ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"26 February 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS       High in the Alps is a rescue mission to save a stranded raccoon. Many of the team members have given up the search, except for one Ace Ventura, Pet Detective! He soon finds the raccoon on the mountain across from his. He climbs across to it, straps the raccoon to him and starts back when suddenly the strap breaks and the poor raccoon falls to his death. Ace was devastated. A man, Fulton Greenwall, was seeking out Ace Ventura. He found him living in a Buddhist monk temple. He came to them a broken man and had finally found inner peace. Greenwall explained the situation so Ace a sacred animal of the African Wachati tribe had been stolen. Ace said he could not leave the temple, however there was $20,000 in it for him and plus the monks encourage him to go. They throw a giant party when he leaves. While on the plane to Africa, Greenwall explains the entire story the Wachati princess is set to wed, however the rival Wachootoo tribe is against this and unless the sacred animal is returned within four days, the tribes go to war. Ace wasn't paying attention as Greenwall spoke. They soon arrive in Africa and in a Jeep driven by Ace, they head to the consulate. Ace takes a bulky short cut, but they soon tumble to their destination.         Once at the consulate, Ace meets Vincent Cadby and Burton Quinn who had a raven, Tinky, on his shoulders. Ace mingles with folks but ends up making a fool out of himself. He and Greenwall then travel to the Wachati village.

The U.S. version released in the late 80's, and the original, longer cut. I resolved to watch both in one night, and let me tell you, it was not a smart idea. No, I didn't get bored, but one can only be wracked with the emotions of this film so much. I was physically and emotionally drained after staying up into the wee hours to experience both versions of the film, and I must say, I enjoyed every second of it, no matter how long it took.I have heard two dissenting opinions here. One is that the original version we saw, the one released here in the states, is the superior of the two versions. The other camp feels that the new, longer version is better because of some fleshed out character development added in. I however am of the opinion that the 123 minute of the cut is more effective and better than this 3 hour cut. As so many people have reviewed this film, I will only state why I feel this way. (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)The shorter version of this film truly held some magical qualities and made the whole movie seem ethereal. I could watch that version over and over again. This longer cut, however, seems to drag on a bit after what should be a natural end to the film. Yes, the extra scenes of Toto and Elena in the 60's was nice to see, but I felt that changing the focus from his love of movies to his love of Elena was a bit sudden. I also didn't like him finding Elena, and that, quite oddly, she was married to Boccia?? This made the film feel too pat, and robbed it of it's magical qualities I fell in love with in the original version of the film. Although the end does take on a new light, it also has a very different impact, since the moment of emotion came before in Elena's car, not in the theater. This however, is only one man's opinion. No one is right or wrong in which version they prefer, but it is strictly a matter of opinion. I for one feel as though knowing what happened to Elena was like being a little kid asking about Santa Clause's reality. you want to know, or at least you think you do, but as soon as you have the answer, you wish you'd never asked.For that reason, I would give the original version a 10\/10, and the longer cut 9\/10, that one point being taken away because of the mystery of Elena being solved. That being said, I will, in closing, respond to those of dissenting opinion that this movie is not that good. Sometimes, a movie doesn't need big epic shots like Lawrence of Arabia or concentrated, art-house directing a la Martin Scorsese. I love Lawrence, and I love Martin Scorsese, but sometimes films can be great for the story, the actors, and the emotions they make you feel. All technicalities aside, (even though this is a very well-directed and the photography on this film is great), this is still one of the best films of all time, and ties with Godfather Part II and Amadeus as my favorite film of all time. See it, then see it again. But for my money, I'd steer clear of the longer cut.
