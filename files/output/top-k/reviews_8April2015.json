I was really annoyed throughout the entire movie. I read a little bit more about the movie afterward and it enlightened me to the film's strengths that gave it classic status, which helped a little bit, but I can't ignore the fact that this was a really annoying movie.I don't usually pay too much attention to film titles, but this one truly says it all. Bunch of angry suburban kids causing mischief for no reason, essentially. I get that there was an element of emotional neglect from adults, which fueled their teenage debauchery, but it played out like a bunch of spoiled white kids messing everything up for everyone else because they didn't know how to deal with their problems. It's a real issue, this painful separation between generations, but this movie was so melodramatic about it. I hate to compare negatives (because a negative is a negative and that's that), but there are a multitude of other more important, more devastatingly horrible issues out there. I don't expect every movie to tackle an societal problem, I get that some movies are just fun, but if they wanted to make a drama about a problem, they should have picked something else. I just didn't care. I didn't feel bad for these kids.It was so dramatic, the story was weak, a vessel for the studio to make money off of Dean more than anything. That's like every Zac Efron movie. Not much substance, but with an exceptionally attractive male displaying both strength and sensitivity- it's a formula to make profit. That's why I'm surprised this is a classic. Seems like something a 1950s Teen Nick might put out for a quick buck or something. The story-telling was bizarre, also. They tried to do some kind of let's get this story started and fill in the blanks of his past later, which I've seen work many times, but it just didn't work here. I felt like I came into a movie halfway through, too many details merely implied, too many rapid jumps in story\/relationships, just made it frustratingly mysterious for no reason. Pacing was so strange. Starts out ominous and tense, then after bad things happen, it gets light-hearted and silly.The only things I really enjoyed were the aesthetics, and I'm not sure how much credit they should get for that considering the ~aesthetics~ I enjoyed so much were just how things looked back then. I also did see the spark that has made James Dean so legendary despite his short career\/life. His acting was over-the-top, in my opinion, at some points, but he really did have something about him that was fascinating.Such a bizarre film to me. By the time it was over I had more questions than I had answers and that is enormously frustrating. I really, really didn't like it but I'm so confused that I didn't enjoy such a widely beloved film so I might try to give it a viewing again but I highly doubt it.5\/10 Bye love you ","genre":null},{"date":"8 April 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I was really excited about this one because of how iconic James Dean is and because I had never seen something with him in it before, and honestly, I was disappointed.

Welles was so gifted. The cinematography is beautiful the whole way through. Fantastic use of lights and shadows. He was so artistic with his techniques, every scene was planned down to each detail. And the variety! Wow, so many different techniques with Welles' touch on them. His style is like visual candy, and every shot is sweet.All performances were excellent! Amazing they all came from the same place, and this was the first film for all of them. I was especially blown away by Welles, of course, considering he created one of the most iconic characters in film history. His performance was spectacular, from 25 year old Kane to old Kane, brilliant. The make-up applied to age the characters was so impressive. It looked better than some of the make-up work I see these days even. The character development was impeccable. The script was great. Good dialog, never lags, was always interesting. The non-chronological format was expertly executed, the transitions passing through years, transitions from flashback to present- seamless every time.There is nothing about this movie that I don't like. Such a monumental achievement, it's such a shame that Orson Welles had so many problems with the film industry. Can't imagine what he'd have left behind had the studios let him have total control.

I am shocked that this is a classic and won so many awards- shocked, to an extent. I'm aware that society was ~different~ back then but I can't just ignore the blatant sexism prevalent in films from this time. In the same way that a racist movie would infuriate me beyond my ability to ignore for entertainment's sake, the disgusting misogyny in this film made it nearly unbearable. People say, it was a different time! but I don't care. It's disgusting now, it was disgusting back then, and no art\/entertainment gets a pardon just because it was a hit when it came out.Despite this film having a female lead, she was nothing but a plot device. How the main character could make a total of ONE decision of her own within the span of an entire feature film is truly beyond me. Summaries of the film cushion the plot with things like, she agrees to help him if he keeps her secret but in actuality this was a woman on the run from a controlling father who was threatened with violence into giving that sleazy reporter a story or else he would give her up to that controlling father. Literally romanticized Stockholm's Syndrome. This is described as a romance movie but there was nothing romantic about it. This is a movie about men wanting a woman to do what they want instead of what she wants. The word demented popped into my mind multiple times while watching in reaction to things these men would do to her.The characters were really annoying, all of them. The things that were supposed to be romantic were just gross. There must be a million ways to make a story about a runaway heiress, you know? It's an interesting premise but it was executed incredibly poorly, with totally unlikeable characters and multiple disturbing dynamics in play. Plot holes so enormous even the male lead's gigantic head would get lost in them. Professional appearance, decent sound, standard cinematography- not a particularly artistic film. Weak story, poorly told, no character development besides developing them from strangers to creepy, controlling jerks.

Some classics make me question the sanity of the people who made them, but luckily The Wizard of Oz deserves its title.No need for an extensive review, honestly. Everything was great. The performances were wonderful, the story was brilliantly adapted, and the music was just delightful.

It was completely unconventional and offbeat, and the leading (and supporting) characters were incredibly well-developed, making them feel as if they could be your friends, people you would want to go out with and get happily caught up in the mess that is their lives &#x96; that's how engaging they are.Douglas is Grady Tripp, a novelist whose first book was remarkable, and whose second book seems to be running away from him with its unattainable ending. We meet him in the class room of a university where he is a teacher, reading a short story by one James Leer (Maguire). The other students hate it, as they always do, and they all seem to hate Leer, possibly because he is more talented than the lot of them combined &#x96; and they know it. Tripp and Leer meet up again later that night at a party and from there the strangeness unfolds; including the murder of a dog and the theft of a Marilyn Monroe jacket.This is a movie I can (and have) watch again, and again, and again. And after each viewing it will always leave me feeling warm inside, almost as if I have personally gone on Tripp and Leer's adventure with them &#x96; and I suppose in a way I have. It is always a magical feeling when a movie can transcend barriers and captivate the audience, taking them in and far away on its strange little journey &#x96; and I believe that is exactly what a movie should do; that's why people go see them, to be carried from their reality into a fictional world, to be absorbed by them.Michael Douglas is wonderful here as the somewhat shabby stoner-possibly-still-talented writer, and he is backed up superbly by Maguire; they in turn are supported very commendably by Frances McDormand, Robert Downey, Jr., and Katie Holmes. This is a very rich story, and as I have already said, populated by likable, incredibly relatable characters. I would highly, highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in being delighted; this movie will assuredly leave you feeling happy and content, and if you're looking for even more I would DEFINITELY recommend reading Michael Chabon's The Wonder Boys, the novel on which this film was based.

You threw me at him!Alfred Hitchcock's 1946 classic romantic spy thriller has tried to be imitated many times by lesser films over the decades, but nearly 70 years later its style and fabulous camera-work continues to leave its mark on audiences everywhere. The master of suspense lived up to his name once again with a slightly different film focusing more on the characters than on the thrills. Set in 1946, with the Second World War recently over, Ben Hecht's screenplay captured the spirit of the era where the fear of a nuclear war breaking out was eminent. American spies were focused on hunting down the remaining German Nazis that had spread throughout the world. The story begins in court where Alicia Guberman's (Ingrid Bergman) father is convicted of being a German spy. Alicia has a reputation of being a heavy drinker and dating many men, and she is ashamed of her father's activities. During one of the parties she hosts at her home she meets Devlin (Cary Grant), an American spy who falls for her beauty and charm, but isn't willing to admit it. He convinces her to travel with him to Rio de Janeiro using her father's connections to spy on his friends. She's asked to approach Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), an old family friend who they suspect is also involved with other Nazis in the area. Alicia wins his affection easily, but at the same time it distances her from Devlin who she has feelings for. Once she's in Alexander's home she begins uncovering their secrets, but risking her life at the same time. Notorious relies heavily on the romantic chemistry between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, two of the most talented actors of their era. Honestly, I found the romance between the two of them was rushed, and I didn't buy into it very easily. One has to consider the restrictions however (the Hayes Code for example which restricted kisses to less than three seconds on screen) so there wasn't much more they could do. But that was what made the on and off kiss between the two actors all the more passionate for audiences at the time. Today, however it doesn't have the same effect. I had a difficult time buying into the romance and that affected my enjoyment of the film during the first half. But once the plot settles in Rio de Janeiro, the film has a couple of thrilling scenes. The wine cellar scene was one of the most gripping moments of Notorious and Hitchcock masterfully combined different camera shot and edits to build the suspense accompanying it with Webb's suspenseful score. The final ten minutes also had me at the edge of my seat so the second half of the film made up for the tedious first half. Notorious isn't among my favorite Hitchcock films because he's mastered the suspense in other better movies like Psycho, Vertigo, or Rear Window, while I found his work in Rebecca a more compelling character driven film. Notorious does bank from the strong lead performances from Grant and Bergman, who despite not being able to sell the romantic element at first, they still give engaging performances. Devlin's stubbornness and unwillingness to share his feeling for her, and Alicia's attitude towards his indifference becomes the soul of the film. Claude Rains plays Alexander extremely well, and he gives the strongest performance in the film. He falls in love with Alicia very quickly and that prevents him from seeing what his mother has suspected all along. The influence of Alexander's mother over him is a trademark from Hitchcock and in this film Leopoldina Konstantin plays the mother better than most. It's a fascinating story that slowly builds up to a memorable finale. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 April 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" You could have stopped me with one word, but no, you wouldn't.

As I said before and I'll say it again, these type of films have no personality, no fleshed-out characters, no well-developed story and bloated pacing surrounded by too many subplots.But there are some blockbusters that attract your attention and actually TRY to improve on the flaws I was addressing. Films like Oblivion, Guardians of the Galaxy and Edge of Tomorrow have tried to improve on the flaws of what I was addressing. They have interesting characters. They had true style. They had nice ideas. They proved not all blockbusters have to be bad or bland to make funny. They gotta put effort into them. Then along came Dark City, a surprisingly underrated visual gem from the year I was born. I was actually interested in seeing this because of the trailer and the premise of the film. But I couldn't find the film until I got a new phone and got ShowBox. I wanted the director's cut because I didn't want to be treated like an idiot and wanted to see for myself.Now what's the story?A man (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in the bathtub all naked and with blood on his head. After he puts on some clothes, saves a fish and remembering a place called Shell Beach, he receives a call from a doctor (Kiefer Sutherland. Y'know, Jack Bauer) and tells the man to run from his room, but it's not too long until he sees a murdered hooker and runs out of the hotel. Soon, we discover his name is John Murdoch, has a wife named Emma and he has strange powers. But every night, some humanoid aliens known as Strangers come in, put people to sleep (except for John) and rearrange the city (I dare you to see it for yourself) and the people wake up like nothing happened. While this is going on, John is hunted by Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt), who believes John to be the killer, and tries to prove his innocence and the city's strange secrets. What kind of city is this? What are the Strangers? What is the purpose of the City? Is John is who he thinks he is? It's up to you to find out for yourself.Now. Let's get to the reasons why it's good.1. The visuals. Even if you don't like Dark City, it's still worth it for the visuals. Everything is dark, gloomy, nightmarish, confusing, Just how the movie should be. I hear director Alex Proyas came up with the movie based on a nightmare he had and the movie shows. There is a lot attention of detail. The design of the city and the Strangers' lair is staggering to look at. It reminds me of a 1940's film noir and Blade Runner. The cinematography matches the tone too. It has use of greens, blues and yellows. It feels more like a painting and less of a summer blockbuster. Anyone who is looking for a visual spectacle than can top the heights of Blade Runner and Star Wars, look no further (If you can find it in the UK & Ireland)2. The Story. I like the story and the way it's told. It first starts off like a nightmare, like something out of Slender. You don't get told what happens, you're left on your own to figure out what happens. There's no clichéd exposition voice-over (I watched the director's cut if you're wondering), no backstory. No nothing. You just start out with John waking up in the bathroom. None of this is revealed until the third act. I like how a movie can tell a story through visuals and how it forces us viewers to come up with our own answers on what's going on. It gets the noggin going and interests us in the mysterious nature of the city. It's a story reminiscent of classic film noir with science fiction and horror and they blend together perfectly. It's mysterious, horrifying and allows the viewers to see for themselves.3. The character development. The movie puts us through the eyes of John and reveals mysterious traits about him, the Strangers and everyone else. John transitions from a man with no memory to badass with the powers of Tuning. The friendship between the Dr. Schrieber and John has tension. They begin as a bit uncomfortable, but at the end they become friends and defeat the Strangers. The conversations between John and Emma are interesting and have real human drama. John realizes that everything is not what it seems, but Emma doesn't and they talk about their problems. The Strangers are nice, too. They're the villains, but when you think about them, their mission is to find a way to survive before their race is extinct. They may look like simple characters to you. But once you know the rules of Dark City, they are complex and real. The development is amazing. Like a game of chess, once you know the rules, you get the whole thing.Overall, Dark City is a complex, interesting and unsettling movie. It's a feast for the eyes, heart and brain. The story is well put together. The characters are simple, but turn out to be complex and the visuals are eye-popping amazing. It's science-fiction, film noir and horror thrown together in a blender. It could have been a failure, but thanks to Alex Proyas' direction, the movie weaves the elements together like a team. Anyone who is a fan of science-fiction or film noir or horror or all of them, see this movie now. If you live in the UK and Ireland, the DVD'S are quite rare. But you can get them off YouTube or watch it on Showbox, so not all hope is lost.

As I said before and I'll say it again, these type of films have no personality, no fleshed-out characters, no well-developed story and bloated pacing surrounded by too many subplots.But there are some blockbusters that attract your attention and actually TRY to improve on the flaws I was addressing. Films like Oblivion, Guardians of the Galaxy and Edge of Tomorrow have tried to improve on the flaws of what I was addressing. They have interesting characters. They had true style. They had nice ideas. They proved not all blockbusters have to be bad or bland to make funny. They gotta put effort into them. Then along came Dark City, a surprisingly underrated visual gem from the year I was born. I was actually interested in seeing this because of the trailer and the premise of the film. But I couldn't find the film until I got a new phone and got ShowBox. I wanted the director's cut because I didn't want to be treated like an idiot and wanted to see for myself.Now what's the story?A man (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in the bathtub all naked and with blood on his head. After he puts on some clothes, saves a fish and remembering a place called Shell Beach, he receives a call from a doctor (Kiefer Sutherland. Y'know, Jack Bauer) and tells the man to run from his room, but it's not too long until he sees a murdered hooker and runs out of the hotel. Soon, we discover his name is John Murdoch, has a wife named Emma and he has strange powers. But every night, some humanoid aliens known as Strangers come in, put people to sleep (except for John) and rearrange the city (I dare you to see it for yourself) and the people wake up like nothing happened. While this is going on, John is hunted by Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt), who believes John to be the killer, and tries to prove his innocence and the city's strange secrets. What kind of city is this? What are the Strangers? What is the purpose of the City? Is John is who he thinks he is? It's up to you to find out for yourself.Now. Let's get to the reasons why it's good.1. The visuals. Even if you don't like Dark City, it's still worth it for the visuals. Everything is dark, gloomy, nightmarish, confusing, Just how the movie should be. I hear director Alex Proyas came up with the movie based on a nightmare he had and the movie shows. There is a lot attention of detail. The design of the city and the Strangers' lair is staggering to look at. It reminds me of a 1940's film noir and Blade Runner. The cinematography matches the tone too. It has use of greens, blues and yellows. It feels more like a painting and less of a summer blockbuster. Anyone who is looking for a visual spectacle than can top the heights of Blade Runner and Star Wars, look no further (If you can find it in the UK & Ireland)2. The Story. I like the story and the way it's told. It first starts off like a nightmare, like something out of Slender. You don't get told what happens, you're left on your own to figure out what happens. There's no clichéd exposition voice-over (I watched the director's cut if you're wondering), no backstory. No nothing. You just start out with John waking up in the bathroom. None of this is revealed until the third act. I like how a movie can tell a story through visuals and how it forces us viewers to come up with our own answers on what's going on. It gets the noggin going and interests us in the mysterious nature of the city. It's a story reminiscent of classic film noir with science fiction and horror and they blend together perfectly. It's mysterious, horrifying and allows the viewers to see for themselves.3. The character development. The movie puts us through the eyes of John and reveals mysterious traits about him, the Strangers and everyone else. John transitions from a man with no memory to badass with the powers of Tuning. The friendship between the Dr. Schrieber and John has tension. They begin as a bit uncomfortable, but at the end they become friends and defeat the Strangers. The conversations between John and Emma are interesting and have real human drama. John realizes that everything is not what it seems, but Emma doesn't and they talk about their problems. The Strangers are nice, too. They're the villains, but when you think about them, their mission is to find a way to survive before their race is extinct. They may look like simple characters to you. But once you know the rules of Dark City, they are complex and real. The development is amazing. Like a game of chess, once you know the rules, you get the whole thing.Overall, Dark City is a complex, interesting and unsettling movie. It's a feast for the eyes, heart and brain. The story is well put together. The characters are simple, but turn out to be complex and the visuals are eye-popping amazing. It's science-fiction, film noir and horror thrown together in a blender. It could have been a failure, but thanks to Alex Proyas' direction, the movie weaves the elements together like a team.

However, he feels as if he's already dead, and he sees the rest of the survivors in the same way.

Jeff Bridges has by far the best performance in the film, and showed much of the needed emotion to keep the movie afloat.

The beginning was great, and so was the end. In the middle, I felt some ups and downs, and some scenes fell flat in contrast to some of the better scenes in the film. After the beginning, the film constantly flashed religious themes without much subtlety, but those stopped after the middle of the movie. The relationship between Max and Carla, another survivor, was interesting enough - but I didn't feel the actress playing Carla did the best job she could. The psychiatrist was rather superfluous to the story, and Max's wife was rather ignored in the first half of the film and didn't get enough depth afterwards in my opinion. The directing was interesting at times and unnoticeable in others, but it was overall solid.

To sum up, even though I found the film good, there were too many flaws in it which kept taking me out of the movie. The ongoing themes of Christianity felt rather annoying and preachy, some characters didn't contribute much to the emotional depth of the film, and some of the dialogues felt extremely fake to me.

Every time I am watching this movie, I am crying and this happens very rare in life. And My conclusion is,life is unfair, but it is still good to live, because there are many good people and are miracles too, if you open your eyes wide.

Why does it seem like they did more with their films when they had less technology available to them? They don't have that ~Hollywood Magic~ that does their effects for them, it was all camera tricks and carefully strategized, one-chance-to-get-the-shot filmmaking and it is beyond impressive.I enjoyed watching this! Full of cool and clever special effects and plenty of moments to make you laugh. Chaplin did such a good job of creating such a silly little character. The story was creative and fascinating, with imaginative concepts and energetic cinematography. It was a fun watch for sure. Delightfully absurd, yet it did give voice to the woes of unemployment and the voracious appetite of capitalism at the price of some disposable human equipment. Silliness with a sting. I recommend it! 8\/10 Bye love you ","genre":null},{"date":"8 April 2015","score":"","review":" I love these black and white, old classics!
