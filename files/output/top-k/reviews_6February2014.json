That's an argument that you could probably debate for weeks, but I have a feeling that it would end up owing the general consensus. Just look at the 20 year span between 1940 when he made Rebecca, his first film for an American studio and his only film to win Best Picture at the Oscars and 1960 when he made Psycho, his most popular film. In that span of time he made Notorious, Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, Suspicion, Saboteur, Rope, The Trouble With Harry, The Man Who Knew Too Much, North By Northwest and Vertigo. These are not little-known pictures and any director would be proud to have such a resume. Yet, something strange happened to Hitchcock's work once he got into the 1960s, with the exception of Psycho, his work lost its edge. This was the decade in which the great director moved to television and, with that his film work seemed to suffer. In this decade he only made two films that anyone really remembers &#x96; Psycho in 1960 and then The Birds three years later.Hitchcock's best films are always exciting to break apart. There are buried levels to the characters and to the stories that are fun to unearth, yet when it comes to The Birds, I always seem to come up a little frustrated. Here is one of his most popular films, yet revisiting the film again recently &#x96; thanks to TCM's one-night-only performance in movie theaters &#x96; I find the movie somewhat empty.Given account of everything that happens in this movie, if you stand back and view it as a whole, you find that it isn't much more than a simple monster movie. It is well-crafted but it is not exactly deep. It is possible to delve into this story and unearth a deep psychological analysis, but it requires most of the heavy lifting on the viewer's part.The problem, I think, begins with the lead character. Hitchcock loved women and his most accomplished characters were his female leads. He was never willing to simply head his films with an empty-headed ninny. The women in his films always seemed to have some sense of depth and complexity and were more effective the more we delved into their damaged past.That's why Melanie Daniels is such a baffling case. There's nothing really wrong with her, and that's the problem. She's beautiful, inquisitive and loves birds, but there's something about her that the movie isn't telling us and that makes her motivations a little bit muddy. What's going on in her mind? Where did she come from? Who is this woman? Is she responsible for the plague of killer birds? These are questions that the movie never really answers. In the pantheon of Hitchcock's favorite blondes, Melanie is not exactly complex. Her motivations are unclear and when we get to the bird attacks, there doesn't seem to be any connection other than the fact that she is in the wrong place at the wrong time.The story you already know. Wealthy socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) drives from San Francisco to the seaside village of Bodega Bay to deliver two lovebirds to a man named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) whom she met in a pet shop. Arriving there, she finds herself mixed up in a bizarre phenomenon when flocks of birds begin attacking the town's populace for reasons that the movie never explains.The pieces are all there. There is a development of Melanie in relation to the people (mostly women) that she meets in Bodega Bay. The two key supporting players are at odds with Melanie over her possible intentions with Mitch &#x96; his former lover Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) and his clinging mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy). Yet, there is something halting in these relationships and they never seem to come to any real conclusion.The ending of the movie always has me a little stumped. All of the main players &#x96; Melanie, Mitch, Lydia and his daughter Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) - are holed up in Lydia's house after Mitch has boarded up the windows and doors. After some attacks, in which Mitch has to come to the rescue, the others fall asleep. Melanie hears something upstairs and goes to check it out. Alone, she goes upstairs and finds that the birds have chewed a hole in the ceiling and are perched on the daybed. There they are, waiting for her and she is attacked.Story-wise the movie may be a little empty, but on a technical level, it is a masterwork. What Hitchcock achieves in this film is mood and atmosphere. This is a film in which sound is the most effective tool. The movie contains no musical score so we are left to the sounds provided by nature. The only thing close to music is an effectively eerie song heard from a children's choir at the school. The scene is chilling as Melanie walks outside for a cigarette and the bird gather on the monkey bars just behind her.The sounds of the birds themselves have an unreal quality about them; there is a sort-of squelching sound that sounds closer to pigs then to birds. The special effects are inevitably dated but that crudeness gives the birds a chilling presence.Perhaps Hitchcock was so busy with the technical side that the story fell by the wayside. Perhaps he was too preoccupied with his television work.

From the west, there's the massive gorilla that was worshiped by natives and went on to climb the Empire State building. From the Far East, the giant fire-breathing lizard spawn from the atomic age that crushes entire cities. This film unites the two iconic titans in a vicious match of pure bestial muscle power.As cool as it all sounds, the film may inspire more absurd laughter than actual thrills. When the two beasts collide, King Kong throws his arms around in a hokey ape-like manner, while Godzilla throws a hissy-fit and flaps his arms erratically. In the confines of gaudy rubber suits, it looks incredibly silly. The actual mass destruction is plentiful, but these scenes seem so few and far-between. By the film's end (after a ridiculous scene where Kong is airlifted by balloons), the conflict just kinda fizzles out with no clear winner or loser. It's a cheap and dated film with horrid special effects and bad costume work; even if you look past that, the execution is so weak that it can't be taken seriously.Of course, if you don't take it seriously (and you probably shouldn't for monster flicks anyway), then it's still pretty fun. Fans should get a kick out of the epic clash, despite all its cheesiness and flaws.The story is pretty standard stuff; most characters exist to simply to provide a human conduit for the audience to follow as the monsters roam around. The plot does take a few stupid turns (seriously, King Kong flying around on balloons? And since when can he grow stronger with electricity?).This film is pretty cheap, featuring okay photography and editing. Acting is pretty cheesy, and is made even worse with terrible English dubbing. Writing is pretty nutty (possibly marred by the changes of the US cut). This production uses some cheap and gaudy sets, props, costumes, model-work, and some horrid-looking compositing effects. Music is okay.This film has had a pretty spotty history. For the US, parts of it have been cut out, and many new footage has been cut in, in a manner similar to Godzilla King of the Monsters. I don't know what the exact changes are, but the added news reports and exposition feel quite forced, and some of the explanations given seem misinformed, and possibly biased to appeal to Americans. Even in Japan, parts of the film have gone missing (some of which has been restored for home video releases), and the overall condition of the film has been poor. This film is probably best seen for watching the two titular beasts duke it out, in all their cheesy rubber-suit glory.

While it isn't John Hughes, it's an interesting drama thanks to it's performances, especially Downey's, this role hitting a bit too close to home, and James Spader, as an oily drug supplier, while McCarthy basically just has to look sharp, smile and not say much, while I almost don't know what Gertz has to do, but just look independent. When graduating at the start, McCarthy had gone away for a while, and now he's back, only to find friend, Julian (Downey) at his worst with his drug habit, spiralling into a darker hell as referred to the movie's title, while Gertz is overly concerned. All three are from privileged families, Downey's father disowning him cause of his addiction. Downey shows some powerfully acted moments, too convincing you might say, like when he's really strung out, his supplier Spader, a really bad influence, ha ha, (different Spader movie reference) acting as a kind of pimp, when funds are short or due, making him do some weird stuff. Less Than Zero is a flashy energetic drama, all the more conflict driven, in Downey's character refusing to be helped. Based on Brett E Ellis, novel, Gertz uses the same line regarding snorting coke, as Jessica Biel does in 2003's Rules Of Attraction, based on another novel by Ellis. The film does have some messy areas, and it's ending, tragic for one, is thought provoking, but if you want John Hughes, go somewhere else.

But other elements of the film have dated. The most courageous thing about it, from today's standards, is that it closes without an obligatory happy ending, and an audience that has watched for 187 minutes doesn't get a tidy, mindless conclusion.The movie was inspired by a best seller by Howard Fast, and adapted to the screen by the blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo. Kirk Douglas, who produced the film, effectively broke the blacklist by giving Trumbo screen credit instead of making him hide behind a pseudonym. The direction is by the 31-year-old Stanley Kubrick, who realizes the ideas of Douglas, Fast and Trumbo but cannot be said to add much of his own distinctive style to the film.Two things stand up best over the years the power of the battle spectacles, and the strength of certain performances - especially Olivier's fire, Douglas' strength, and Laughton's mild amusement at the foibles of humankind. The most entertaining performance in the movie, consistently funny, is by Ustinov, who upstages everybody when he is on screen (he won an Oscar). Some of the supporting performances now seem dated and the line readings stilted, as well as some cheesy dialogue.Balancing against those dated elements are some that were ahead of their times, including a muted but sophisticated understanding of sexual motivation. Olivier's character becomes more complex in this revival than it was at the time, because of the restoration of a key scene, cut by censors, in which he and Tony Curtis share a bath together, and he confesses, I like both oysters and snails, leaving little doubt where either is to be found as far as he is concerned. That brings his desire for Jean Simmons into focus He wants her not merely to possess her, but as a form of victory over Spartacus.Perhaps the most interesting element of Spartacus is its buried political assumptions. The movie is about revolution, and clearly reflects the decadence of the parasitical upper classes and the superior moral fiber of the slaves. But at the end, Spartacus, like Jesus, dies on the cross. In the final scene, his wife stands beneath him and holds up their child, saying He will live as a free man, Spartacus. Yes, but the baby's freedom was granted him not as its right, but because of the benevolence of the soft-hearted old Gracchus. Today, that wouldn't be good enough.

He has to save the world.We have some pretty bad special effects. The scene where the Albino smashes into pieces looks like a PS1 game and the scene where Satan makes love to the woman and her daughter and they morph together like a Bosch painting looks unconvincing. However, Satan himself looks okay and the scene where the Church is being destroys looks good. I actually thought they built a giant church set and destroyed it all, but it was a miniature.

Those subjects being Sex and Race. Here in America, the strain of hypocrisy that runs throughout these issues is astonishing and makes objective analysis a formidable and daunting task.People tend to forget that all this started when a journeyman writer working for Playboy magazine landed an interview with this firebrand only then beginning to come into renown. That writer was Alex Haley who, in my opinion, later went on to be for African American History what Homer has become for Greek History. Haley explained to his audiences and me, a cocky and arrogant high school playwright at the time whom he wanted to take down a peg, how hard it was to get Malcolm to open up and speak freely about his life. At the outset, Malcolm presented himself as the proselytizer of the honorable Elijah Muhammud and prefaced many of his statements to Haley with the Spiritual Leader's name. During one of these interviews, Malcolm reminisced about his times as a Lindy Hopper in the dance halls of Harlem and apparently the memory was so vivid he got up out of his seat and started to cut a rug with a few steps. Haley recounted this incident as a breakthrough in the course of the interviews and after that, it was much easier to get Malcolm to talk about his earlier life.This series of interviews became, to a large extent, the basis for THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X, later published by Grove Press. You'll notice in the beginning of Spike Lee's MALCOLM X prominent footage is given to Malcolm X's days as a Lindy Hopper and that this is where the narrative seems to take off.

These films presented incredible events that usually were the result of nuclear radiation, alien invasions, mutation, and body snatching influences. In addition to the film plots, special effects were added to complete the cinematic experience. The film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, suggested an individual's unimportance in a complex, modern world. Beneath the unimportance was the political concern of conformity and loss of individuality among the residents of Santa Mira, California. Invasion of the Body Snatchers illustrates the difference between America's collision of Individualism and the collective culture of conformity. Although Invasion of the Body Snatchers did not intend to become an allegory of political work according to director Don Siegel, it is evident that through specific instances, the film became a symbolic contrast of individualism and collectivism. The office scene between protagonist, Miles Bennell played by Kevin McCarthy and former girlfriend Becky Driscoll played by Dana Wynter occurs as they are escaping the pod people, launching the chase sequence. As Miles and Becky hide themselves in a doctor's office, Miles goes into a moralistic speech about the pod people. In this instance, the pod ideology is revealed and ultimate goal of conformity is discovered; to convert the residents of Santa Mira for a collective, classless, Communist-like society as well as to promote the purpose to suppress individuality, to make life easier. In reality, this scene is a symbolic parallel to Senator Joseph McCarthy's pursuit for social conformity in the 1950s. This scene is packed with conspiracy and paranoia. Also, metaphorical of McCarthy's claims that there were Soviet spies and Communists inside the government system and among the general population. While Miles and Becky hide in the doctor's office, they an abundance of take pills to stay awake. Sleep stands as an allegory to suggest the burgeoning of a mass conformity; where the pods take over the residents while they fail to be alert, meaning sleeping. In the film, it is said that, the pods will absorb your minds, your memories, and you're reborn into an untroubled world. This untroubled world represents the world of classless, ambition-less, emotionless, simple society, where every individual is no longer individual, rather, a hollow drone of a collective socialist culture. As stated earlier, in the 1950s McCarthy made claims of covert Communists inside the government; Invasion of the Body Snatchers also has a covert concept in regard to ignoring what seems to be out of the ordinary. This concept concerns the role of the authorities in the film. Miles is taken in by authorities on the invasion of the pod people, when the psychiatrists and police attempt to turn the bizarreness of the situation into a simple matter, as if it is Miles who is delirious. This scene alludes to authority figures and the effort to encourage normalcy in the most mind-boggling situations. Invasion demonstrates society becoming less individual and more depersonalized with the characterless collective society replacing America.

From the early moment we see a spy infiltrate enemy territory and then reveals a tuxedo but is soon out of sorts when he has to blend in during a metal concert.Blending in as the new century arrives is not a problem for Xander Cage a big muscular, tattooed extreme sports addict who has been recruited by Samuel Jackson doing an early Nick Fury impersonation to go on a mission and do his bit for the Stars and Stripes.The plot involves renegade Russian anarchists who want to destroy major cities by way of biological weapons and install a new world order. The group has already been infiltrated by Russian agents and unite with xXx to take out the bad guys and weapon.The plot is indeed pure Bond with its European setting but Diesel does not cut it as a super-spy but extreme sports addicts might enjoy Diesel trying to out ski an avalanche.The film is also too long, it needs to be tighter, the bad guys are unmemorable and as the years since this film has shown. Bond is still the man whilst Diesel bailed out for the sequel.

Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a cheap entertainment thrill and strength and honor. Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more. Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.4\/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.

He is received by Nicholas' sister Catherine Medina (Luana Anders) that invites Francis to have dinner with her brother and her.Francis learns that their father Sebastian Medina was a cruel torturer of the Spanish Inquisition and Nicholas is a traumatized man that has witnessed the murder of his uncle Bartolome (Charles Victor) and his adulterer mother Isabella (Mary Menzies) being tortured and killed by his father when he was a kid. During the dinner, the family's friend Doctor Charles Leon (Antony Carbone) unexpectedly arrives and Francis discovers that his sister died of heart attack after visiting the torture chamber in the dungeons. Soon the place is haunted by strange events and Nicholas suspects of his servants Maximillian (Patrick Westwood) and Maria (Lynette Bernay) but Francis is convinced that Nicholas is the responsible for the death of his sister. Pit and the Pendulum is one of the best Roger Corman's movies despite the poor scenario that shakes in many scenes. The last time that I saw this movie was on 16 November 1999 on cable television and today I have just watched it again on DVD. The creepy story of Edgar Allan Poe is still engaging even when the viewer watches more than two times.
