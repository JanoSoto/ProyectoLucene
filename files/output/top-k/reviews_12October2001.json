He feels if he makes a fuss the choices are she will stay and they will both be unhappy or she will still go and he will have lost his stiff upper lip.

(hey I would be happy to console Cary Grant)  The script is a hoot the dialogue lively and cunning.  The only real action is a duel at thirty paces that shows who is willing to give his life for the love of his life.

As it turned out, no expectations were fulfilled. Not because it's not a good film, but because it is so different from all other SF films nowadays.  This film is truly a fairy tale. If you look at it any other way, you may feel deceived... But what a fairy tale. Haley Joel Osment plays his part extraordinary well. And the film gave me the same feeling I got from E.T.. And it felt good. I do believe that Kubrick would have had a different ending and I believe the ending is the only part of this film I could not really appreciate. Of course the whole movie is surreal, but the ending is over the edge.Admitted, there are a lot of wholes in this movie. E.g.

The film is a twisting, meticulously crafted and acted cinema piece about many a lot of things. At FIRST, the basic plot a woman (Laura Elean Haring) survives a car crash and stumbles down the hill next to Mulholland drive and walks into a woman's house she has never met before. She also has amnesia, and when the woman (Naomi Watts), an actress, who is currently occupying the place lets her stay for a few days to get her memories together, the plot unfolds. Other side stories are interestingly blended into the rest of the movie involving a troubled director (Justin Theroux) who is forced into things he didn't intend on, the woman living in the house who tries and goes for auditions, etc.But the plot (even the part involving Haring) isn't even the big part of the movie. Lynch, like he did in Eraserhead, exposes the audience to logical and realistic (er, in Lynch's sense) scenes and then sidesteps into a surreal and dreamlike world...or what one might THINK is the dreamworld. Yet it's really about dreaming, one might think, as reality and fantasy become part of the pieces of Lynch's method. What is it to have a dream, anyway, Lynch may be essentially asking the audience? And what is it to have things both idealized and ugly in equal measure, reflected in the subconscious, and drifted back during sleep like some kind of wavelength that is personal but psychologically sound, more or less? And, most importantly, why do we need fantasy? Well, there needs to be a divide, Lynch may be supposing, between fantasy and reality, but at the same time, for the sake of art and cinema, the line needs to be blurred as well to reach underlying truths about what it is to create, what it is to act, what it is to be controlled in the measures of creation and reinterpretation.These might be pretentious points presented by another filmmaker, but Lynch, for all of his abandoning of conventions (albeit with a firm, knowing embracing of the intent in conventions, archetypes and clichés from Hollywood films), is nevertheless a superlatively entertaining writer\/director\/sound editor, who makes some of the most profound and everlasting statements ever about Hollywood and the illusions created from reality (whether manufactured ala 50s singers in a booth then put on film, or in some capacity regarding a dirty dude behind the Winkies) while never losing the power to make it one hell of a ride. And by 'ride' I mean the ride of a filmmaker overwhelmingly yet carefully confident in what he wants to convey of the corny light and contorted ideals that comes out of the darkness of Diane's dreams (I'll relent and say that it makes the most sense, even though I'd love it just as much if it didn't go so easily for sense), and that, of course, it's all about emotional response.In short, it's one of the must-see films from the 2000s, not just for Lynch fans but for those who might never think of going near a Lynch film it's funny, it's tragic, it's mysterious, and it's both dense and simple in equal measure. Like music, it'll either rock your boat or leave you dry and for me it still rocks my boat to this day.

This is the first work of a man that later went on to direct the extremely VISUAL movies like Frighteners (very visual), and soon, Lord of the Rings.  Jackson was picked up for the Lord of the Rings not by a drawing, but because he has talent and is a masterful director... he just has strange content choice.  If you are a fan of directing this is a perfect example of someone who does NOT have lots of money to fork out on postproduction effects and the best actors in the world, but works with what he has, and ends up with a very entertaining film.  It's all from the mind of one man, which makes the movie more flowing and less produced, and it's just plain fun.  THAT is why this movie is so good.  And it's pretty crazy too... =)  The bad reviews here are from people who do not appreciate this old and low budget way of making a good movie.  If you are the same, I might pass, but give it a shot.  Rent it if you haven't.

The stories were interesting at the start and you were looking forward to the ending to see what was happening and what connection they had to each other.

Yet, this last day (and night and morning) of school film with its ensemble cast is a wonderful take on life 25 years ago.  There were many great performances by many great actors and actresses, but I can't remember their names off hand. (One of them later appeared in EDTV and another one made a movie with Robin Williams and Matt Damon and yet another one was done away with in Scream 3). The guy from EDTV (Matthew Something) has a haircut just like I did in high school, so I can attest that this movie is trying to be realistic.  The pants are something else. Back in my day, we didn't dare wear anything like that.Hilarious dialogue such as the part about George and Martha Washington and their hemp growing and smoking habits run through the movie. Richard Linklater, who did a great movie called Slackers, seems to have a thing for American presidents, what with the earlier bit about the nerd who had the dream about a woman who looked like Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure Nixon was mentioned in this movie too, but I can't think of the reference now.There are some parts of the movie that are a bit slow, but the characters are drawn pretty well.  Some times it is a bit confusing and dazing to keep track of who is who; hence the title. Another actor named Wiley Wiggins (I do remember his name) really does a great job at playing one of the freshmen who gets to hang out with the seniors. Extremely amusing scene when he buys beer from a Jamie Cromwell like store clerk.  The football coaches are right out of North Dallas Forty.At any rate, this movie is well worth renting or even buying. I think I've seen it five or six times.  It's like one of those movies you want to see over and over but don't really know why.  It's sort of a middle ground between a gabfest like The Last Days of Disco and American Graffiti.  The final scene, as the group goes off to buy Aerosmith tickets, really must be analyzed and thought about carefully. Very very deep. Later, dude.
