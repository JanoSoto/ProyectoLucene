It is a very good film with a well-written script, artistic directing, effective musical score and wonderful acting by the cast (especially Ralph Fiennes). I watched it in my English class and even though it was an enjoyable film, I think it is very, very overrated.Starting with the positive side, Spielberg's directing is as good as always. The script is well done with some clever dialogue and memorable quotes. Characters are pretty good and Liam Neeson proves to be very versatile, and Ralph gives a disturbingly well done performance as the truly evil Amon Goeth. Ben Kingsley, like he usually does, brings his character to life as Itzhak Stern, Schindler's assistant. John Williams received a well-deserved Oscar for his score and the soundtrack is filled with the great music like the theme at the end of the film with the piano. The final few minutes were perfect, seeing the real life people and an obvious figure whose face you do not need to see to know who he is, standing at Schindler's grave. Spielberg has used clever artistic symbols by keeping only a couple of things in colour to help you pay attention to those things in the film. Surely, there were few flaws with most of these things.Those are the positives, but I want to encourage you to read the ENTIRE comment so you can also see what is bad about the film. I fear the negative side I will talk about for longer. This film has several problems as well too biased, too long, not fully accurate, and has pretty boring moments at times. I was surprised when I saw that it is among the 100 greatest films of all time, because it has flaws that I cannot overlook.I am a full anti-nazi, but I am aware (apparently unlike some people) that not all believed in the nazi policies. Just because a film is about the holocaust, it does not mean it is a good film. The thing that angered me so is how stereotypically portrayed the Nazis and Jews were. My own country (not New Zealand, where I am) had people being sent to concentration camps yet I don't act anti-German as Spielberg sadly makes the film. Steven Spielberg of all people, should be making realistic war films which don't feature stereotypes. I know he is Jewish himself and I have no doubt about the terrible things these Jews did not need to suffer, but that is no excuse to make them look like the most innocent people in the world and German soldiers to be the most inhumane. I think Spielberg is a great man, but he clearly did not put much thought to making realistic characters in this film. Nazis may have committed awful acts, but they were not emotionless aliens.MAJOR SPOILERS The only part I did like was when near the end of the film, Schindler gives the soldiers the option to carry out their orders of exterminating any Jew there is before the allies arrive, or to go home as ordinary people. They choose the second idea. However, even then, the film has a very biased tone. I thought it was bad enough that the German soldiers were made to look indescribably evil, but when I watched the scene with Schindler bursts out weeping for not saving enough Jews because he did not have the money, I really thought that it was overdone. That event NEVER even happened. These whole points does not only offer a Hollywood-style look, but also glorifies Jews in a way. I mean, Jews were not the only people who suffered. Is it true that every Holocaust movie excludes other victims that were in the camps for different reasons or were from different nation, and they tell about 'Jews only' instead? This film is among the 100 greatest of all time, but there is no way it truly deserves it thanks to these reasons especially.Plus, the film was interesting, but not interesting enough until it actually got to the violent parts and Amon Goeth. Its not that I am an action film fanatic. Spielberg is a very clever man and one of the most intelligent in making entertainment in scenes filled with nothing but dialogue. He should have been able to make dialogue sequences interesting, but some of those parts were hard for me to get into. That, and such a long movie doesn't make it as enjoyable as it should be unfortunately.I sound like I hate this film, but I don't really. However, I cannot help but feel annoyed by the fact that there are other films which are interesting from start to finish, have just as powerful moments and message and are more realistic and not stereotypical, yet they don't get the praise that Schindler's List gets. I mean, when I heard its praise, I thought it would be a very realistic and honest film about the human mind without featuring stereotypes and favouring one culture\/religion over the other. I got no such thing here. This film is good to watch if you want to learn about Schindler and a bit about the holocaust. Just don't take this film too seriously, because some stuff you will see is not accurate.

Why is a review even being written? Star Wars A New Hope revolutionized and forever changed the game for American cinema back in 1977, and stands tall today as one of the greatest films of all-time. Back in 1977, there was absolutely nothing quite like it the blend of epic music, incredible sets, spectacular ahead-of-its-time special effects, superb action sequences, and an overall complete package of film-making that before and since has rarely ever been met. You are immersed in a totally different world in a totally different time period, and thanks to George Lucas and the talented staff behind him that obviously gave their all in this movie, Star Wars is one of the 15 best movies you'll ever see guaranteed. For the first time in history, you really felt like you were in an alternate universe in space (Hush 2001 A Space Odyssey fans, Star Wars didn't separate its audience from the subject with ridiculously sublime yet frustrating subtle imagery that never quite explained what was going on).Based loosely off of The Hidden Fortress (A Akira Kurosawa film) and the Hero's Journey outline of Joseph Campbell, Star Wars follows a simple farmboy (Mark Hamill) rising to become a major threat to a rising evil led by the sinister and heartless Darth Vader (Voiced by James Earl Jones). Along the way, he meets the self-centered yet reliable Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and a feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Basically, Luke's tale is a hero's journey, copying the same timeline that Campbell laid out for all writers to imitate. Written by George Lucas, it was a script that at the time was presumed to be impossible to imitate because of its lush settings, amount of visual effects needed, and of course, the mammoth sets required (See Death Star).Luckily for all of us, they delivered. The biggest part of the movie (and the franchise) is how the special effects not only enhanced a scene and brought it to life, but also blended with the actors, actresses, and sets. The special effects were achieved in a variety of ways; whether it is small models (extensively used for the final battle), tricks with lighting, and motion control photography. Industrial Light and Magic, one of the top special effects studios in history, got its mammoth start here. Of course, you need good acting to bring the effects to life, and our main cast does a decent job even when the dialogue is less than satisfactory. Alec Guinness gives the best performance however as Luke's mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. Last but not least, let's praise David Prowse as the intimidating, powerful, and downright scary Darth Vader. Just imagine having him as your boss.How many other ways can I praise this movie? John Williams gives us the musical score of a lifetime as he combines soft, lighthearted music, with bizarre tunes (like the one in Cantina) and epic tracks that resemble (and outperform) the best of 18th century classical music like late Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. George Lucas, despite his modern-day reputation, established himself as one of the better directors of the 70s with a combination of epic shots with ever-growing tension and mammoth cinematography. While he didn't take the director's seat in the two accompanying sequels, A New Hope displayed his absolute love towards his creation.Bottom Line So where would we rank Star Wars among the best? We have the acting, the talent, the special effects, the music, the sets, the pacing, the tension, the action, the costume design, and even the puppet work as among the best you'll ever see&#x97;especially considering the year it was made. Lucas created an entirely new world for everyone to see, and delivered it with amazing craftsmanship, precision, and detail. The techniques of Star Wars has been copied and mimicked ever since. Surely The Empire Strikes Back would practically perfect any insignificant shortcoming this film had to offer, but A New Hope was the beacon for blockbuster cinema. No longer were the movies establishing this higher-class reputation; Star Wars bucked a trend of huge Hollywood blockbusters with full intention of blowing you away quality-wise by any means necessary.The Annie Halls, Godfathers, Space Odysseys (your pretentious films full of dialogue, symbolism, and feeeeeeeeelings&#x85;) were now put aside because of your Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Aliens, Terminators, and eventually, your Pirates of the Caribbeans. I rank Star Wars as one of the 15 greatest movies of all-time simply because of its effect on cinema, usage of special effects, and execution of a hero's journey and execution of the handing of a villain. Name a villain that was even close as scary or intimidating as Darth Vader. Now name a movie that has a bigger effect on blockbuster cinema than Star Wars. Can't name one? That's because (aside from Raiders of the Lost Ark) there honesty isn't one. If you haven't seen this movie, it's because you are simply trying to avoid it. If you hate this movie, it's simply because you are trying to hate it. If giving Star Wars a 10 is morally, spiritually, and emotionally wrong, then I shall never want to be right.May the force be with you.

Of course, you need good acting to bring the effects to life, and our main cast does a decent job even when the dialogue is less than satisfactory. Alec Guinness gives the best performance however as Luke's mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. Last but not least, let's praise David Prowse as the intimidating, powerful, and downright scary Darth Vader. Just imagine having him as your boss.How many other ways can I praise this movie? John Williams gives us the musical score of a lifetime as he combines soft, lighthearted music, with bizarre tunes (like the one in Cantina) and epic tracks that resemble (and outperform) the best of 18th century classical music like late Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. George Lucas, despite his modern-day reputation, established himself as one of the better directors of the 70s with a combination of epic shots with ever-growing tension and mammoth cinematography. While he didn't take the director's seat in the two accompanying sequels, A New Hope displayed his absolute love towards his creation.Bottom Line So where would we rank Star Wars among the best? We have the acting, the talent, the special effects, the music, the sets, the pacing, the tension, the action, the costume design, and even the puppet work as among the best you'll ever see&#x97;especially considering the year it was made. Lucas created an entirely new world for everyone to see, and delivered it with amazing craftsmanship, precision, and detail. The techniques of Star Wars has been copied and mimicked ever since. Surely The Empire Strikes Back would practically perfect any insignificant shortcoming this film had to offer, but A New Hope was the beacon for blockbuster cinema. No longer were the movies establishing this higher-class reputation; Star Wars bucked a trend of huge Hollywood blockbusters with full intention of blowing you away quality-wise by any means necessary.The Annie Halls, Godfathers, Space Odysseys (your pretentious films full of dialogue, symbolism, and feeeeeeeeelings&#x85;) were now put aside because of your Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Aliens, Terminators, and eventually, your Pirates of the Caribbeans.

You know the music. Why is a review even being written? Star Wars A New Hope revolutionized and forever changed the game for American cinema back in 1977, and stands tall today as one of the greatest films of all-time. Back in 1977, there was absolutely nothing quite like it the blend of epic music, incredible sets, spectacular ahead-of-its-time special effects, superb action sequences, and an overall complete package of film-making that before and since has rarely ever been met. You are immersed in a totally different world in a totally different time period, and thanks to George Lucas and the talented staff behind him that obviously gave their all in this movie, Star Wars is one of the 15 best movies you'll ever see guaranteed. For the first time in history, you really felt like you were in an alternate universe in space (Hush 2001 A Space Odyssey fans, Star Wars didn't separate its audience from the subject with ridiculously sublime yet frustrating subtle imagery that never quite explained what was going on).Based loosely off of The Hidden Fortress (A Akira Kurosawa film) and the Hero's Journey outline of Joseph Campbell, Star Wars follows a simple farmboy (Mark Hamill) rising to become a major threat to a rising evil led by the sinister and heartless Darth Vader (Voiced by James Earl Jones). Along the way, he meets the self-centered yet reliable Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and a feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Basically, Luke's tale is a hero's journey, copying the same timeline that Campbell laid out for all writers to imitate. Written by George Lucas, it was a script that at the time was presumed to be impossible to imitate because of its lush settings, amount of visual effects needed, and of course, the mammoth sets required (See Death Star).Luckily for all of us, they delivered. The biggest part of the movie (and the franchise) is how the special effects not only enhanced a scene and brought it to life, but also blended with the actors, actresses, and sets. The special effects were achieved in a variety of ways; whether it is small models (extensively used for the final battle), tricks with lighting, and motion control photography.

What it does right is downplaying the creepy hallucinogenic moments and ghostly specters to where they're not shoved in your face, and to where you'll miss them if you don't pay attention.

It's a very disturbing and dark movie where everything that can possibly go wrong, does, and everything that can possibly make sense never happens until the very end. Special points go to the hospital scene for being one of the creepiest and most disturbingly gleeful that I've ever seen. This takes pleasure in making sure you are as uncomfortable as possible and that you never forget it, and it is brilliant.Regarding the ending, well...I don't like twist endings that much anymore. Too often they're flashy and gimmicky and don't really add much to the cinematic experience, and it really takes a good director to do it right.

Among them are Maureen O'Hara as the fiery, tempestuous Mary-Kate, Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaker Flynn, and Ward Bond as the upright Father Lonergann.One of the many elements that make this a timeless and utterly enjoyable film is the fact that Ford includes many more issues than just a romance, which of course is the main focus here but not all. We also get much information on differences between cultures and how it is important to understand that one cannot come from one culture and force his way through another. We also see the sheer innocence of a small Irish town that has little to do but take care of their own land. These people paint their house, grow crops, raise cattle and sheep, go to mass every day, and otherwise take it easy. This is the good life.Among these great actors, Wayne gives the best performance perhaps because it is so anti-John Wayne. He isn't so macho and intimidating as he usually is.

By the way, that fight lasts about 7 or 8 minutes and it is funny and joyful all the way. This could be considered a perfect film. Bad things happen but you just know these people will get through them. After all, they have all the time in the world. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"26 August 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a film that needs no introduction. One of the best films of the nineties, it made Tarantino ubiquitous and landed an impressive seven Oscar nominations.The film is comprised of three related stories. One story involves hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) & Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) as they pay a visit to some 'business partners' of their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Another story revolves around Vincent Vega once again as he is instructed to take the boss's wife (Uma Thurman) out on the town while he's away. The remaining story focuses on an aging boxer (Bruce Willis) whom Wallace has bribed to throw his next fight.As you can see by the names mentioned above, the cast is chock full of talented individuals. Travolta, Jackson & Thurman all got awards recognition, though none of them were lucky on Oscar night. In my opinion, Jackson in particular should have won an Oscar for what is arguably the best performance of his career. The rest of the cast includes the likes of Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel & Christopher Walken. Definitely an enviable cast.The film's sole Oscar win was for the original screenplay, which is arguably the film's strongest point. The script is loaded with memorable dialogue, the plot is original and the film manages to elevate itself above other crime films by mixing violence & redemption. It is not hyperbole when this screenplay is ranked among the very best of all time.As for Tarantino's direction, that's superbly handled as well. The film looks great and it also sounds great. The soundtrack is exceptional, including standout tracks by Dick Dale (Misirlou), Kool & the Gang (Jungle Boogie), Urge Overkill (Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon) and Chuck Berry (You Never Can Tell), among others.All in all, Pulp Fiction is a top-notch film. Personally, I think that the 'Gold Watch' storyline isn't quite as good as the other two segments but that comes down to it being merely good and not excellent. Needless to say, if you've never seen Pulp Fiction you owe it to yourself to do so post-haste.

Before Cronauer's arrival at the radio station, the harried and weary American troops had been served a diet of boorish drone music and droopy health awareness programmes. Cronauer tore down the schedules and cranked out the likes of The Beach Boys, James Brown and Motown standards, all linked by Cronauer's spitfire patter and propensity for close to the knuckle humour.

I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful! And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition. It just feels too forced; they could have done it in a better and more interesting way. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good movie anyway. The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it. Memento is a perplexing case and I would recommend it if you like thrillers - although you could always do better, this one definitely stands out.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Mystery"},{"date":"26 August 2009","score":"","review":" When Harry Met Sally... is among the elect posse of exceptionally valid romantic comedies, because each scene ends, in whatever way, significantly different from our expectations. Many girls, and guys, like my dad, which is strange, are drawn im perpetuum to films that have been made since that ride roughshod over nuance in favor of embellishing every emotional cue to the degree that we won't be surprised if leafhoppers just began feeding off of them. But only seldom has a modern romantic comedy with all the button-down ingredients---Manhattan yuppie life, New Years' Eve drama, man-to-man hoo-ha in the batting cage, humor drawn from a woman's uptightness---really worked on a sincere and disciplined level like this film, which even has the shrewdness to make a Harry Connick, Jr. soundtrack appealing.Minus the machismo complex, a chick flick is slang for a film designed to appeal to a female target audience. Including the macho dismissal would mean reference to films that are heavy with emotion or contain relationship-centered themes. Including the macho dismissal, this movie is not a chick flick. As for minus If it's good, it doesn't matter. With a combination of imagination and realism, Nora Ephron's big breakthrough script raises the question Can men and women ever just be friends? and advances many notions about love that have become household concepts now, like the high-maintenance girlfriend and the transitional person.Ephron never seems to have a problem with crafting very tight-knit self-contained plays from scene to scene, aligning broad comedy and seasoned pondering so that they spring from the same catalysts. Rob Reiner keenly gift-wraps it for us, with the thematic progress and humor reassured, but it is never disingenuous. Yes, that's Meg Ryan. Yes, that's Billy Crystal. But they come off just as real as Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher effortlessly do. The beats and timing, even when exaggerated, are unflappably natural. Caryn James said it was like the sitcom version of a Woody Allen film, full of amusing lines and scenes, all infused with an awkward familiarity. In spite of my normal defensiveness of this film, not to mention any and every Woody Allen one, I think I can live with that assessment on the grounds it is succinct and indeed comparable.

Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan star as Jeffrey and Amy Taylor, an urbanized couple crossing the Nevada desert and running into more trouble than they ever imagined.After a near accident they stop at a convenience store where they encounter a rough hewn local (M.C.Gainey), who unbeknownst to them sabotages their vehicle. Little do they realize, they have been targeted by a gang that specializes in kidnapping, robbing and killing out of state travelers.Later, in the middle of the desert, their vehicle stalls. An eighteen wheeler rolls up to assist them and the helpful driver, Red Barr (J.T.Walsh), gives Amy a ride to a nearby diner.Jeffrey meanwhile tinkers with their Jeep, gets it running and soon arrives at the diner. Amy is not there and hasn't been seen. Frantic, Jeffrey begins searching for her and runs into Red who denies having ever met either of them.Eventually Jeffrey is taken prisoner by Red's gang who are holding Amy hostage. They want the $90,000.00 Jeffrey has in the bank back in Massachusetts. The money doesn't really exist, but is a ploy Amy is using to stay alive.Events really ignite as Jeffrey uses his wits to escape and turn the tables on his adversaries.After freeing Amy, a wild, edge of your seat, chase scene ensues. There is some spectacular stunt driving and car crashes sure to please the action aficionado in all of us, followed by a final, cliff hanging confrontation.Performances by the cast were top notch. There is great chemistry between Russell and Quinlan. The late J.T.Walsh, M.C.Gainey and Jack McGee are superb character actors and were well cast in their respective roles.Jonathan Mostow both wrote the story and directs. His stylish use of bizarre camera angles really adds to the terror and suspense. The only flawed aspect I detected, was that Red Barr's wife was unaware of his activities in spite of him having a barn full of stolen property right next to their home. All in all however, an action packed nail biter.
