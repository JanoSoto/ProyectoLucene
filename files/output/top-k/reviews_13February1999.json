Even today, it exudes a feeling of tension throughout as though something bad is going to happen very soon. The rushed, clipped dialog serves to intensify this.Although devoid of many special effects, this movie does not need them. It seems that Howard Hawks realized that the technology wasn't available and made use of psychological effects instead of visual ones in order to make a credible film. By the way, is the debate still going on as to whether Nyby or Hawks really directed?I thought the acting was excellent and all characters were believable in their roles. Several subtle issues were touched upon; the questionable use of atomic energy; the question of the need secrecy - military vs. civilian; the cold war; the role of science's need to know versus the safety of the individual.Filmed in glorious black and white, it captures a mood of fright and is nightmarish in its quaility. Dimitri Tiomkin's killer musical score is in-your-face scary and certainly one of his best.I greatly enjoyed this film even though there are a few items that were amiss. First, Campbell's story took place in the Antarctic, not the Arctic (Carpenter's re-make makes amends here and is truer to the original story), when they first arrive at the saucer crash site, the shadows from the sun always fall in the same direction no matter where the actors stand or the camera angle and when following the mushroom cloud, the camera catches a very quick view of some microphones and other studio equipment.All-in-all, this is a great film that was years ahead of its time. My copy is on laserdisc that includes some fine supplemental material and has some deleted scenes put back in. I believe Warner now owns the rights to this film and I hope they release it on DVD in the near future. If you want genuine scares and want to see a really well made sci-fi film, I highly recommend this one.

This is a film that clicks on every level, and caught me from the first shot.  This is saying a lot, because I'm not normally into pseudo-war movies, and didn't know a lot about Arab history going in.  And yet, Lean and Bolt snagged me with the overture, and didn't let go...A lot of this is from Lean's amazing direction.  His prologue puts us right in Lawrence's shoes for a fatal last motorcycle ride, but his artistry is such that several characters whom we meet here but who don't show up again for another three hours are so memorable that we grok his ironies instantly.On top of that, Bolt's screenplay is a perfect example of economy; it's a good forty-five minutes into the film before we have a scene longer than two minutes; as well, we only get one expositional scene early on -- and yet, we're given character, situation, nuance... everything with very few words. The result was that, at the interval, I was blown away to find out I'd sat through two and a half hours of movie.  In objective time, it felt like about half of any typical Hollywood film.Nuance is probably the key word here.  Lean manages to educate his viewers in Arab culture, a key to the plot, without ever explaining anything.  We see it, and we understand.  In particular, I was struck by a caravan shot, in which a quartet of camels labor under strangely wobbling canopies. Nothing is  ever said about these constructs, but a mere shot of a hand and a wedding ring tells us everything -- the harem travels concealed; women are a secret here; and so Lean elucidates an entire culture in a way that's been forgotten.  Say it with me cinematically...Another lost art on display here subtext, subtext, subtext.  The brilliance of the story is in what is not said, but is merely shown; Lean's trust in the audience is superb.  Consequently, all the minor characters come ravingly alive, and the differences between British and Arab stand out in hard relief without anyone ever making a speech about it.  (The mind boggles at how this story would have been hacked to bits by modern Hollywood thinking.

But, my own personal caveat -- DO NOT SEE THIS FILM FOR THE FIRST TIME UNLESS YOU CAN SEE IT IN A BIG THEATRE.  Anything  less is a raving injustice to the creators.

During his campaign for re-election, a depressed Jay Billington Bulworth (Beatty) takes out a large life insurance policy, which his daughter will cash in if he dies. Bulworth goes on to arrange a hit on his own life, giving him just under a week to live, and live he does! As he makes route across America, Senator Bulworth starts to speak the truth, which jeopardises his re-election campaign, in the process meeting a variety of people including a group of young black women who introduce him to the world of rap music. As the film progresses Bulworth realises that he doesn't want to die and attempts are made to stop the assassins bullet while continuing to rap his way into notoriety. As previously said, Bulworth is a fairly bizarre film, as the narrative seems to be very segmented, and doesn't quite add up to a whole at the inevitable conclusion. Having said this though, Beatty, with more practice, could have a profitable sideline appearing with Ice-T at concerts, as his rapping is worth the admission price alone. Supporting cast members include the reliable Oliver Platt as one of Bulworth's advisors and Halle Berry as the love interest.

It had its moments, with Jack (Richard Gere) having a real big lesson in Beijing culture, sex, and law, all in one night.  Probably the most interesting and suspenseful parts of this film were Jack's initial experiences with the Chinese prison system.We learn much of the legal system, however,  through Jack's  Chinese court-appointed attorney, who is smart and beautiful (a combination that has kept her single for some time).  She is involved in  the other extremely suspenseful sequence  when Jack is chased through the crowded streets (a scene very reminiscent of Elizabeth Shue's dash to an embassy in The Saint).  But, to be honest, the movie seemed to slow to a grinding halt after that.  After a while, I saw very little difference between the American and the Chinese court practices, and the thought of his attorney trying to explain that China actually does have an effective (albeit harsh) form of justice is nauseating--in light of the obvious human rights violations that have taken place in the Republic for many years.Like many American movies that try to capture culture, it pretty much plays to stereotypes.

It was a great disappointment to find the tone so thoroughly changed.  Had I been older, I would have known that Disney was the wrong studio to undertake the project they Disneyized it.  It is telling that when P.L. Travers objected to their treatment of her stories, the studio had to appease her with the argument that the film would make a fortune.  Oh, well-- what are movies for?Mary Poppins should have an aura of menace.  Some of the adventures she led the children into were threatening; some of the situations they got themselves into were dangerous.  The contrast of danger and normalcy increased the effect of her magic, and added to the significance of the messages behind the stories  The everyday scenes of life can have hidden meaning and deep undercurrents (most of the people in the neighborhood were somehow involved with the goings-on), and home is a safer harbor than one might imagine.  In many respects, the Mary Poppins stories are reminiscent of works by Ray Bradbury.Disney did not really mature to the point of handling stories such as these until Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)-- a Ray Bradbury story, by the way.  But Mary Poppins also directed the stories to a younger audience than they were originally written for-- they are juvenile fiction, not children's stories.  At a time when taking the whole family to a movie was more common, this was a valid business approach to the production.  It doesn't do the stories any favors, however.The dynamics of audiences have changed in the last thirty-five years, with more young adolescents attending movies independently of their parents. There is a market for a more accurate version of the Mary Poppins stories. Since Disney is-- sometimes needlessly-- remaking some of their old movies, why don't they remake Mary Poppins, and get it right?  Margaret Hamilton would have made a fine Mary Poppins; Lily Tomlin could do quite well with the character nowadays, perhaps the more surprisingly considering her association with comedy.  And, as amazing as the effects for the first Mary Poppins were (and still are, in many ways), they could now make the movie with effects that live up to the depth and subtlety they took out of the stories when they made the first one.It would be a shame if P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins stories faded into oblivion and Disney's Mary Poppins remained the only vestige of the creations-- as often happens with good books.  Read the books and see what you think.

And the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous; it alone deserves an Oscar. However, there's one thing that keeps it from true greatness- the ending. It's not a bad ending per se, but it simply doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. Had the ending been changed, it would have been a near-perfect movie. But all in all, I'd definitely recommend it.
