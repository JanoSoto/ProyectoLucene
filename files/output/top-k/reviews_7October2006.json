Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower, at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through.Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks, but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant, this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed, the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism, that it wasn't a typical Lynch film. Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isn't his own. Brundage claims, with his protagonist Alvin Straight quoting lines directly from Confucious. He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead, Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore, The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan, it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.The narrative is slow and thoughtful, which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife, children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks, which only adds to the effect, which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti, makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. Regardless, however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor. So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue, the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!

The classic image of the white face stretched in a painful scream has become iconic for it's simple and yet un-nerving look. First thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of Scream is the ghost face mask and rightly so, it managed to create one of the perfect horror villains. The fact that throughout the film you never know the evil that is behind the simple mask and it makes it all the more brilliant.I feel guilty saying that I love this movie and yet I still feel I have every right to like it. On first glance I felt I'd been for the typical clichéd teen slasher movie, in which dumb teenagers get picked off one by one and still making sure there are two victims of the ordeal remaining to make room for a sequel. Of course the film does make room for its two-follow ups and still manages to reference another certain Wes Craven originated franchise that became an awful money making machine.The fact that Scream is a horror movie aimed at teens and it still manages to be fun and intelligent. The cast's chemistry is amusing and you can tell everybody had a lot of fun on set. The film's biggest star would be Courtney Cox who plays a highly entertaining and overwhelming character. Drew Barrymore also makes a small role for the infamous opening sequence, one of my favourite scenes. There is a certain moment in the 15-minute scene that stands out for proving the film's sarcastic, twisted and almost guilty comedy level. The moment is one where Drew Barrymore gets put in a tight spot and runs into the kitchen, the cliché joke (in what is actually a very tense scene) is that the kitchen table is empty apart from a box of kitchen knifes. Very sardonic humour, that you'll have to look out for and it certainly is honest in the way it studies the art of making a horror.I've never been a fan of Wes Craven, yet I think Scream proves that he can make a good movie when he puts his mind to it. After watching Scream, I've gained a newfound respect for the horror director. There's a scene in the high school that involves an excellent cameo from the director himself, so keep an eye out. The script is very clumsy, yet it somehow still manages to be perfect for the type of film Scream is. The fact that there is rubbish is Scream, still does not take away the fact it is an excellent film. The characters are likable and memorable which helps you to become involved in the film.The film's pacing is one that keeps you wanting to watch and always tricks you into thinking the killer is someone else and then when the thrilling finale comes to a close you'll certainly feel tricked. The whole last 30 minutes of the film are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense that even Hitchcock would take note to. The film's references to classic horror movies are certainly impressive and will please all the horror hounds out there. Scream is somewhat a mixture Halloween, but with a slight Carry On edge clinging on. The lighting and the music help create the tension for the crazy and darkly funny death sequences.Avoid Scary Movie which is a painful attempt to rip off the Scream franchise with a spoof attempt (as if they didn't realise Scream was a spoof). If you're looking for a movie that you hope will scare you, then don't watch Scream. But if you want an amusing horror movie, that is from it's roots and still manages to be original then look no further. Perfect to watch with a bunch of friends or just on your own for pure sit back entertainment value. Criminally underrated, don't feel guilty for loving it for what it is.

I've been a fan of Campbell Scott since the first time I saw this movie (I've probably seen it 10 times by now). His character is smart, sexy, gentle (but strong when he needs to be) and successful, the kind of man every woman dreams of. The main characters have great chemistry, not only the romantic chemistry between Campbell Scott and Rebecca Pidgeon, which takes my breath away in several scenes, but Campbell Scott and Steve Martin are equally mesmerizing when they are on the screen together. The Spanish Prisoner has everything you could want in a movie, excellent cast; fun, witty dialog; sly plot twists; and a very good, and unexpectedly serious performance by Steve Martin.

There were several of my friends and peer associates when I was twelve and thirteen (toward whom I felt varying degrees of attraction or non-attraction) who gradually--as they entered puberty--began to express a decided interest in girls. I remember how, at the time, I felt a keen sense of puzzlement and disorientation as these erstwhile friends and playmates gradually began spending less and less time with me, and concurrently showing more and more interest in females (as reflected in their conversation and banter); how I slowly began to realise (to my growing discomfort and dismay) that--despite my wishes to the contrary--I simply could not fathom what it was in girls that they found so interesting and compelling. To put it bluntly, but accurately, I slowly began to feel almost non-human--as if I was slowly morphing into an alien from another planet--so strange and foreign did these pubertal boys' shared experiences seem to me, and so unlike the boyhood we had just left (and which to me still seemed so familiar and unchanged). It was as if suddenly they now belonged to a club (open to everyone in the entire world who wanted to join it), but a club to which I no longer belonged, or felt welcomed in.It was the portrayal of this phase of pre-adolescent boy-to-boy attraction and camaraderie in the film Something Wicked This Way Comes--so beautiful, so poetic, and so archetypal, which immediately drew me to the film, and has kept me a devoted fan ever since (the many other qualities of the film notwithstanding). This fictional portrayal in the film resonated deeply with my emotions and soul, seemed so true to my memories of that time in my own life, seemed to express so beautifully and poignantly that period in my life (or even identity, which is a vastly more profound term) which was taken away from me forever by puberty, and which I had longed (unsuccessfully) to regain ever since&#151;all my boyhood desires and hopes which were left (almost literally) hanging in the air, unfulfilled.This phase of boyhood I have been discussing was described perfectly (and poetically, of course) by Shakespeare, in the oft-quoted passage from The Winter's Tale, at Act I, Scene ii, lines 63-66 and 68-75We were, fair queen,\/ Two lads that thought there was no more behind\/ But such a day tomorrow as today\/ And to be boy eternal. ...We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun\/ And bleat the one at th' other. What we changed\/ Was innocence for innocence; we knew not\/ The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd\/ That any did. Had we pursued that life,\/ And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\/ With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\/ Boldly 'Not guilty'...Of course, anyone with half an opinion of Shakespeare can endlessly debate his meanings in this or that passage (and his now-archaic language definitely lends itself to this); I realize, therefore, that others' opinions of the above-quoted passage may differ significantly from my own. My own take on this passage, then, is that Shakespeare was indeed referring to this very stage of boyhood in which same-sex attractions are not only possible, but even likely. And a careful reading of the above passage indicates (to me, at any rate) that Shakespeare himself was very much aware of this. Shakespeare even uses a phrase (boy eternal) which is a literal English translation of the Latin phrase&#151;puer aeternus&#151;which would later be used by Jung to describe the archetype of the eternal boy who (for one reason or another) either refuses to, or cannot, grow up and mature into a well-grounded adult. (Perhaps myself?)Shakespeare refers (in the above passage) to best-friend boys bleating at each other like lambs (paraphrased). This is highly suggestive language indeed. To what else could it possibly refer? Would someone say that Shakespeare really was so innocent and naïve as not to realize how such words would be likely construed&#151;either then or in later ages? And would not such an assessment of Shakespeare really be demeaning of his intelligence as a human being and writer? After all, don't we have pretty near universal agreement that Shakespeare was, in fact, one of the most intellectually profound writers in all the history of the English language? Shakespeare then refers to their change (what we would now call exchange) of innocence for innocence&#151;that is, what each boy brought to the relationship, as regards his intentions, was entirely innocent of any knowledge of either guilt or sin (and he strengthens this idea immediately) we knew not the doctrine of ill-doing (that is, the Judeo-Christian teaching that such relationships were either wrong or sinful). And then the strongest of all possible disclaimers, to those who might have been inclined to 'question' such boyhood relationships Had we pursued that life (i.e, as boyhood best-friends) &#133; we should have answer'd heaven boldly, Not guilty. In other words, in the absence of any Church indoctrination or brainwashing to the contrary, these boys would have indeed felt innocent enough of wrong-doing to stand up to God Himself and all His Holy Angels and proclaim with boldness their innocence in the matter of the boyish friendship.

This film is about a man whose obsession with a football team has brought him years of comfort but also stunted his emotional development. Cocooned in his family of Arsenal fans, Paul Ashworth is clueless in real relationships. Colin Firth, most often known to fans as restrained and aristocratic Mr. Darcy, v. 1 or v. 2, is here rumpled and unshaven and wild-haired throughout. His voice as Paul is also quite different. I'm no expert on English accents, but he swallows his consonants and broadens some of his vowels. And instead of Firth's patented watchful smoulder, here when Paul is talking about his beloved football team -- confiding unnecessarily that he would pay extra! to live next door to the stadium -- his face is entirely unguarded, open, and vulnerable. Paul is a man-child. One can only agree when the love interest refers to him as a 12-year-old.The movie has many delights the great shaggy performance by Firth; the excellence of the writing; the truthfulness of the human observations (which pertain to many subjects beyond football); the comedy. However certain parts of the movie were frustrating for me, an American viewer. One it's pitched to an English audience, of course, so the dialogue is very rapid and full of English slang. Without the consonants and crisp diction, and with a music soundtrack, the words can be very hard to follow. (I must have replayed It's NOT the smoking, Steve. It's the crapness, half a dozen times before I could make it out.) I wanted to shake the director as I felt with only a very little tinkering, which would not have harmed the specific Englishness of the story, he could have created a world-wide hit. In my opinion it wasn't -- as has been written -- the background of football that kept this from happening; folks enter into entire fantasy worlds a la J.R.R. Tolkein without batting an eyelid. It was the blurry, difficult-to-follow audio! Viewers need to be able to understand what's being said! (Non-Brits may profit by turning on subtitles.) Two a lot of the cinematography looked cheap and poorly lit. Three I would have added a bit more to flesh out the romance, as this one, as written, though fun, was uneven and appears doomed.Here is an audio clip from a Colin Firth fan site which illustrates the charms and frustrations of this filmhttp\/\/www.firthessence.net\/audio\/football.mp3(a) Different and interesting Colin Firth accent.

This film is about a man whose obsession with a football team has brought him years of comfort but also stunted his emotional development. Cocooned in his family of Arsenal fans, Paul Ashworth is clueless in real relationships. Colin Firth, most often known to fans as restrained and aristocratic Mr. Darcy, v. 1 or v. 2, is here rumpled and unshaven and wild-haired throughout. His voice as Paul is also quite different. I'm no expert on English accents, but he swallows his consonants and broadens some of his vowels. And instead of Firth's patented watchful smoulder, here when Paul is talking about his beloved football team -- confiding unnecessarily that he would pay extra! to live next door to the stadium -- his face is entirely unguarded, open, and vulnerable. Paul is a man-child. One can only agree when the love interest refers to him as a 12-year-old.The movie has many delights the great shaggy performance by Firth; the excellence of the writing; the truthfulness of the human observations (which pertain to many subjects beyond football); the comedy. However certain parts of the movie were frustrating for me, an American viewer. One it's pitched to an English audience, of course, so the dialogue is very rapid and full of English slang. Without the consonants and crisp diction, and with a music soundtrack, the words can be very hard to follow. (I must have replayed It's NOT the smoking, Steve. It's the crapness, half a dozen times before I could make it out.) I wanted to shake the director as I felt with only a very little tinkering, which would not have harmed the specific Englishness of the story, he could have created a world-wide hit. In my opinion it wasn't -- as has been written -- the background of football that kept this from happening; folks enter into entire fantasy worlds a la J.R.R. Tolkein without batting an eyelid. It was the blurry, difficult-to-follow audio! Viewers need to be able to understand what's being said! (Non-Brits may profit by turning on subtitles.)

Raising the question, why make a movie at all if you plan to just put three easily dividable pieces together? The three stories could have appeared on Tales From the Crypt or Tales From the Darkside, since they seem to be taken from there with the same quality of film and acting and no respectable soundtrack. Also, the wraparound cartoon was poorly animated and not very interesting. I was really very bored with it. The Creep? Horrible mask! The first story was the worst, involving a wooden Indian statue getting revenge on some thieves who steal the tribe's treasure. The plot was so weak and predictable and whoever did the gore ought to be fired from film because shotguns do more than make people fall over and the old shadow on the wall while a spray of blood hits the shadow routine is fun but not scary.The second story, The Raft, had been recommended to me by a friend who is a horror aficionado and grew up with this movie. And yes, it was better. Some drug references and some nudity, which is really needed in a horror film (especially if you want to make it a film you can't show on TV). Was I scared of the tarp or garbage bag sitting in the water? No. But at least the effort was better, with a little gore. And you learn how to swim without getting your dope wet.The last story, The Hitch-Hiker, was almost more funny than scary although it was easily the most violent and bloody. I really enjoyed this one, as it just wouldn't end and reminded me somewhat of Cannibal! The Musical in a good way. If the second and third stories were kept and the first one removed, this would have been a stronger film. Though, it would then be much shorter...I guess I shouldn't expect much from Stephen King, but in some ways I do (although his acting was great in this). George Romero? Well, he's good with zombies, but have you seen the original The Crazies or Season of the Witch? He's no panacea. Tom Savini I also have a high opinion of, but he was left playing a goofy masked non-speaking role, making his contribution basically worthless. Oh well.If they had cast Barbara Eden in this like they first planned, maybe I'd give it a better rating, but overall I was let down by what I hoped would be a fun and naughty film. I had for a while believed this was better than the original Creepshow, but after re-watching both of them in the last month, I was quite wrong... the stories here have potential, but do not add up to the overall decency of the original.

It has everything you'd expect from Dahl's best work. A plucky heroine. A fantastic sense of black humour and a tone refreshingly clear of over-sentiment that never patronises it's target audience.Ever since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was first adapted for film, I've been eagerly awaiting for Matilda to arrive on the big screen. Not everything about the film works. Moving the action to America was a bit questionable, but since it was directed by Danny DeVito, and with his penchant for black comedy, the film succeeds far better than it might have in the hands of a more mainstream director.Matilda (Mara Wilson) is the extraordinarily bright child of Harry and Zinnia Wormwood (Danny DeVito & Rhea Perlman). But how she managed to be daughter to these two is a mystery. Harry is a crooked used car salesman, while Zinnia is a bingo junkie. And where Matilda has a keen intellect and a generous spirit, Harry & Zinnia are selfish mental slugs.Since Matilda's parents have little to no time for her, she must learn to take care of herself. The film manages to encapsulate very well the book's theme of self-empowerment in the face of parental neglect. The first 25 minutes are my favourite, because they show how Matilda learns to fend for herself. By the age of 4, Matilda can not only cook, but she can read fluently. She has read everything from CS Lewis, to Charles Dickens.As Matilda's mind continues to expand, she feels ready to take on new challenges. And that comes in the form of public school. Matilda has always wanted to be around kids her own age, but there is a problem. The headmistress of Crunchem Hall. The nightmare of kids everywhere... Miss Trunchbull (brought frighteningly to life by Pam Ferris).Miss Trunchbull is a strict authoritarian. She rules her school with an iron fist, and is fierce as any drill sergeant. She used to be an Olympic athlete. Her speciality was the Hammer Throw, and she's not above using it to enforce discipline. One particularly shocking scene has Miss Trunchbull picking up a 6 year old girl by her pigtails and throwing her over the school fence when she dares oppose her. Or throwing a boy out a window with all the grace of a javelin.But not all the teachers are like that. Miss Honey (likably played by Embeth Daviditz), Matilda's teacher, has a kind and gentle spirit, and strikes up an instant rapport with Matilda once she learns of her ability. Matilda and Miss Honey are kindred spirits. Both are lonely. And both come from families that shunned them.Matilda's brain power eventually develops to the point where she becomes telekinetic. She uses this newfound power to turn the tables on the adults in her life who make her miserable.Matilda has always seemed very similar to Stephen King's Carrie. A girl who was bullied at school and tormented by her mother, and her anger eventually turned to telekinesis, allowing her to take revenge on those who tortured her. But Matilda is not a carbon copy. It has it's own line of thinking.Matilda has no desire for revenge. But she does intend to teach those a lesson if she feels she and those like her have been mistreated. She punishes Harry when he unfairly admonishes her reading ability, and gets rid of Miss Trunchbull who is really Miss Honey's aunt. She stole her house from her, and Miss Honey is too afraid to stand up to her, trapped within a controlling relationship.Danny DeVito shows a flair for bringing the world of Roald Dahl to life. There are many quirky camera angles that seem to heighten the sense of oppression from a child's eye point of view. Images of Miss Trunchbull towering over a child, or closeups of her face grinning evilly. Matilda really is quite a hard film to watch at times, because of it's disturbing moments, like a boy being forced to eat an entire chocolate cake, or kids thrown in the Chokey, a narrow cupboard with nails and shards of glass sticking out of the door.But Matilda is still a refreshingly intelligent kids film. It's DeVito's first children's film, and he does superbly. Never too nauseating. The comedy is funny, and it doesn't dumb down. The casting is truly inspired too. Real life husband and wife Danny DeVito & Rhea Perlman are perfectly obnoxious as the Wormwoods. Mara Wilson finds just the right balance between wide eyed innocence and burgeoning intelligence without ever lapsing into precocity. And Embeth Daviditz gives a very sweet and appealing performance, making Miss Honey an always sympathetic figure.But it's Pam Ferris who's the scene stealer. Mad as a hatter, a blaring voice and intimidating frame, she brings Miss Trunchbull to life in ways I never thought could be possible. She is the image of Miss Trunchbull. She was born to play the role. Filling out the character with obvious relish and perfectly evil, you won't easily forget this Hammer Throwing Olympian in a hurry.The ending is perhaps a little too happy. It expands upon a few things that were done more subtly in the book. And I didn't like the way Matilda's power stayed with her instead of fading like it did originally. But for the most part, Matilda is a largely successful endeavour, and pays respect to my favourite book from the wonderful Roald Dahl.

It tells the story of John Merrick, called The Elephant Man because he had a facial deformation, and his quest to be accepted as a normal human being. The screenplay is wonderful; it shows two amazing leading characters, that face real problems realistically, a great storyline that evolves naturally, and lots of pain and happiness. The lines are very poignant and beautiful, too, as are the moral implications of this movie. The way this intelligent, kind, cultured man can't be accepted is painful, because you want him so much to succeed.Great part of the success of the movie is because of the actors. John Hurt gives a mind blowing performance, and one of the very best I've seen; his kindness is real, the way he talks is real, the way he walks and gets into the character is just unbelievable. You can actually feel his pain on your skin, such is the streght of his performance. His breakdown scene in the train station, is just a cry for freedom; and it sounds so truly a cry for freedom, that you can believe this is actually happening. Anthony Hopkins is very good, and he has a very good chemistry with John Hurt, that evolves during the movie. I think he underplayed is character, but it worked and let us focuse on John Hurt. The supporting cast is all very good, even if out shined by John Hurt.The soundtrack is haunting. It perfectly sets the dark, dramatic tone of the movie, and makes the movie have more impact on you. The editing is good, particularly in some of the scenes. The make up is the best I've seen; it's believable, and it must have been tremendously difficult to do, but it's simply amazing. Lynch's direction is original; I don't think he was trying to pull the tissues, if you know what I mean, but to show a touching story just focusing mostly on the actors, which works. I loves some of his shots, like the part in which John Hurt is humiliated by people in the hospital; it just shows you all the confusion and pain of the moment. The black and white color is dark, and it makes you just think about the story, without lots of color to distract you.This is a simply flawless movie that everyone should watch; it has an important message delivered without being sappy, great performances, direction, music and editing.
