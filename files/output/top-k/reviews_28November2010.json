[{"date":"28 November 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" KING KONG (RKO Radio, 1933), directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, from the idea compiled by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace, ranks one of the true classics from the 1930s, in fact, one of the greatest adventure films of all time. Following the pattern to MGM's TRADER HORN (1931) and TARZAN THE APE MAN (1932), along with RKO's own adaptation to THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (1932) featuring its KING KONG stars, Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong, in support of Joel McCrea, the studio of RKO makes good by outdoing the others as well as itself with the biggest jungle adventure of them all, featuring a giant gorilla listed below the principal players as King Kong, the Eight Wonder of the World. Before the theme of Beauty and the Beast gets underway, the opening title card of an old Arabian proverb fills the screen to what's to be expected And the Prophet Said, and Lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And it stayed its hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead. Fade in begins with a view of a steamer docked outside New York where Charles Weston (Sam Hardy), a theatrical agent, comes on board to meet with Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a motion picture producer who specializes in jungle films of animal life. Because Weston is unable to accommodate a leading lady for his latest production, Denham, with crew about to set sail early next morning, ventures through the streets of New York until finally selecting Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), an out-of-work girl caught stealing an apple from a street vendor (Paul Porcasi). Saving Ann from an arrest, Denham takes her to a coffee shop explaining his reasons, who he is and why she's been selected to appear in his next movie. Regardless of uncertainties ahead, Ann readily accepts his offer. While on board the Venture, Ann meets with the crew consisting of the skipper, Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher); first mate, John Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), Charlie, the Chinese Cook (Victor Wong), among others. As the steamer arrives to the uncharted Skull Island, Denham and the others soon encounter hostile natives, prehistoric animals, and King Kong, a giant gorilla, before returning to New York where the unexpected occurs, King Kong's escape and rampage throughout the city. Fay Wray's constant screams, Max Steiner's nearly continuous underscoring and Armstrong's immortal closing line have made this film legendary. Regardless of the wide range of movies to their credits, no doubt that it's KING KONG for which Wray and Armstrong are best known. The popularity of KING KONG lead to an immediate sequel, THE SON OF KONG (1933) starring Armstrong; imitators, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1949) the Japanese made, KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1962); as well as the Saturday morning cartoon, naturally titled King Kong (1966) where its premiere episode, bearing no such characters from the original film, included the now famous climax of King Kong's climb atop of the Empire State Building while holding onto the heroine. KING KONG also lead to theatrical reissues over the years before making it to television by the mid 1950s. Due to intense scenes (Kong stepping on a native, throwing woman out of apartment window, etc.) or controversial material (Kong stripping Ann's dress while holding and smelling her), it's the shorter prints that have circulated for decades. The edited material, long thought to be lost, was recovered and restored in the 1970s. Only after Paramount's 1976 updated KING KONG remake did the restored 1933 version finally turn up on television in 1977, home video (1980s), cable TV broadcasts of American Movie Classics (prior to 2001), Turner Network Television (1990s in colorized prints), Turner Classic Movies (after 1994), and finally DVD. Opening and closing overture music was inserted and shown on TCM in that fashion beginning in 2005, the same year of the latest KING KONG (Universal) remake. Only the now sort after spider pit sequence, enacted in the 2005 film, remains among the missing from the original. In spite of better production values, added color and realistic presentation of Kong depicted in the remakes, it's the black and white version of still animations, rear projection sequences and cardboard background settings for the New York City climax that continues to make a lasting impression. A lot of effort certainly went into this production, as depicted in one of the well-constructed documentaries, Hollywood, the Golden Years (1987) narrated by Ed Asner. Regardless of certain flaws found in KING KONG, they're easily overlooked due to its fast-paced action, which never stops once the film gets underway. Those who refuse involve themselves with this edition of KING KONG because of its age or lack of color or star names may want to get an idea of its concept by taking a look at the more faithful 2005 remake than the 1976 presentation.
