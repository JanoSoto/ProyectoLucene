[{"date":"12 January 2014","score":"","review":" Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) is a card player who loses it all to KGB (John Malkovich). He vows to quit to his girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol). However when his childhood friend Worm (Edward Norton) gets out of prison, he pulls Mike back into the life.The card games can get very boring if done incorrectly. The games here are done pretty well. At least, the movie doesn't dwell on the games too much. It's the acting which makes this a superior movie. Matt Damon is really solid which allows Ed Norton to play the wild man. Their relationship is the center of the movie. Norton really has the skills to play the darker half of the duo.Some may have difficulties with the message of the movie. The idea of using your god given skills no matter what those skills may be is an unconventional message. I doubt there is another movie where the movie roots for the lead to play poker instead of studying law school.

The shtick was getting dull.It is not funny or exciting at all. The scene where someone asks Mick You're Australian, you must know Mel Gibson. and Mick says Yeah, I know 'Mal' Gibson. How is that funny?Mike Tyson's cameo was pointless and unfunny. The Mick, Mike and Mikey gag is not funny.And the whole Lethal Agent thing just bored me. The whole movie just bores me. The WGA didn't give Paul a writing credit on the film because they probably knew that this film sucked and didn't want Paul to take the blame.We haven't seen Paul Hogan do anything since '01. If he is going to make a comeback, he is going to have to do something spectacular. A Croc Dundee 4? On your bike!
