[{"date":"30 July 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Helen Mirren plays a villainous character very well in this film, teacher or not, but to root for her to win the battle in the end is insane. I've read several reviews for this film, most of which liked Helen Mirren's performance only, which is probably not the idea Kevin Williamson had in mind. Granted releasing it in theatres shortly after Columbine was not the best move, but maybe the target audience got the humor of it without taking it seriously. Now, did I enjoy the film? Yes. Would I own it? Definitely! In fact, I already do! The young actors do a nice job with their roles, and Helen Mirren as already stated is very easy to hate, but she chews up the screen with every scene she's in. It's one of the better comedies, imo) than some of the so-called gems they're putting out now, the re-make craze is getting old too, except for some of the horror and revenge flicks.The story centers around Leigh Ann Watson\/Katie Holmes-who's concluding her senior year, but also wants to be her school's best student. But with her history teacher hating her, that goal could be very hard to achieve... Accused of cheating, unjustly, Leigh Ann and two other friends decide to try and reason with her, but their plan backfires, and things get out of control, quickly. Now, their goal was never murder, and it doesn't go that far either, let's just say, her cruelty finally comes back to haunt her in the end, watch it and you'll see.
