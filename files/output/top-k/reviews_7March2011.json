I watched it up until Lloyd was daydreaming at the wheel of the car about his dreamgirl, Mary and then shut it off. I liked it up until the state of events about the bumbling crooks, the suitcase full of money, etc. I didn't want the film to be about that. I wanted it to be about two idiots getting into trouble. Not all this serious crap going on.Now that it's been about eight years since I've seen it, I appreciate the film a bit more now. The first forty five minutes of the film are very entertaining and very funny. I laughed a lot in that time frame. Then once the film gets more and more about the crooks, and less about the antics of the two goofball leads I started to care less and less about the outcome.The plot Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are two slackers who are trying to save enough money to go into business selling worm related novelties and worm-farms. Lloyd is a limo driver, and Harry is a dog-groomer. One day, while taxiing a beautiful women to the airport (Holly), Lloyd noticed she leaves a suitcase on the ground (purposely). The suitcase was left for two henchman to have. Lloyd swoops in and retrieves the case much to the dismay of the henchman who now believe Lloyd works for someone who is planning to disrupt their plan.Lloyd and Harry aren't aware that they are prey to two dangerous henchman, so they now go on a trip from Rhode Island to Aspen to give the beautiful women her suitcase back. Which obviously leads to slapsticky antics by both of the leads.The jokes are hit or miss, but there are scenes like at the diner and when the guys get pulled over that I can help but laugh at. They are right up my alley those kind of scenes. My favorite line in the film is when Harry and Lloyd go to Nebraska instead of Aspen. Both are expecting to see The Rocky Mountains, but seeing Nebraska is flat as a board Jim Carrey states John Denver is full of s**t, man! Had me laughing out loud for minutes. Both Carrey and Daniels give surprisingly great performances. I say surprisingly because I'm rather not too fond of Jim Carrey because in many of his films he seems to be off his own medicine, or just running around like a dumbass for ninety minutes. In this film he does a rather humorous role, and is actually a pleasure to have on screen.I would give this film a better review it had been about the two trying to start their own business. I'm rather not too fond of the film's plot because I don't care about the goofs trying to flee from thugs. The whole joke is that they don't know they're prey, and are pretty much going with the flow on the whole trip. If the film would've played like a better comedy instead of throwing this ho-hum plot at us maybe I would've appreciated it more.Dumb and Dumber is good slapstick material, but it doesn't compete to slapstick gold like Tommy Boy and Black Sheep. Black Sheep is one of my favorite films, and has one of my favorite actors in it too, Chris Farley obviously. Dumb and Dumber was said to put The Farrelly Brothers on the map. This was followed by films like Me, Myself & Irene and There's Something About Mary. Who would've thought that a movie about two dopes would've gave two brothers a successful career. That is so dumb, fo' real.Starring Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, and Lauren Holly. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.

No longer is Ryan the middle-aged family man portrayed by Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger; Ben Affleck's character is far younger than Ford's, younger even than Alec Baldwin's in The Hunt for Red October, even though that film was set in 1984 and The Sum of All Fears in 2002 or 2003. Whereas Ford's character was married, Affleck's is a bachelor, although he has a girlfriend with the same name, Cathy, as Ryan's wife in the earlier films. At a time of rising international tension between America and Russia, the city of Baltimore is destroyed by a nuclear device. The real culprits are neo-Nazi terrorists, but everyone in America assumes that the Russians are responsible, an assumption which is strengthened when a rogue Russian general orders an air attack on a US aircraft carrier. Ryan, a CIA analyst, is one of the few people in America who realises that the bomb which destroyed Baltimore did not come from Russia, and has to try to persuade the trigger-happy American President, J. Robert Fowler, before he can order a revenge attack. This was one of the few films from the early 2000s which did not earn Ben Affleck a Razzie nomination. He has never been my favourite actor, but at least he is better in The Sum of All Fears than in many of his films- certainly a lot better than in, say, Pearl Harbor from the previous year. Even so, he never quite brings the authority to the part that Baldwin and Ford did in the three previous Ryan films. The best acting performance comes from the normally reliable Morgan Freeman as Ryan's boss, CIA Director William Cabot. The script makes a few changes from Tom Clancy's novel, but these were largely made for the sake of political correctness rather than plausibility. Clancy's terrorists were Arab nationalists; here they are neo-Nazis who make convenient villains because virtually everyone hates them and they won't alienate any ethnic groups among the target audience. Director Phil Alden Robinson declared that he did not wish to promote negative images of Muslims or Arabs, but he seemed less concerned about promoting negative images of Russians. Early in the film were hear that the Russian Army has launched a massive chemical warfare attack on Chechnya; although it transpires that this was carried out by maverick commanders without the approval of their Government, the Russian President nevertheless decides to take the credit for it on the grounds that it is better to be seen as a mass-murderer than as an incompetent weakling. It is a general rule in the cinema that political thrillers, if they are to remain thrilling, should be set in the present or the near future. There is a partial exception for films based on real events, like K-19 the Widowmaker or Thirteen Days about the Cuban missile crisis, but this does not apply to purely fictional stories. There would have been little point in making The Sum of All Fears as a Cold War period piece set in the sixties or seventies as everyone knows that nuclear war never broke out between the superpowers during that era. Unfortunately, I was never sure what the point was of making the film at all. As a thriller, the film is fairly exciting, but its main problem is that it is stuck in the past and reflects American\/Russian relationships as they were in 1962 or 1982, not as they were in 2002. The second half of the film concentrates too much on political intrigue and not enough on what is happening in the devastated city- we never even learn how many people have died. The plot-line seems more suited to the Cold War era than it does to the early twenty-first century, and indeed was looking a bit rusty even when Clancy published his novel in 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Given that the 9\/11 attacks took place shortly after filming was completed, and several months before the film opened in May 2002, Robinson might indeed have looked more prescient had he made a film about Middle Eastern terrorism rather than trying to rehash something like Fail-Safe for the modern age. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 March 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Sum of All Fears is the fourth film in the Jack Ryan franchise, but no attempt is made to maintain continuity with the earlier three episodes.

The second half of the film concentrates too much on political intrigue and not enough on what is happening in the devastated city- we never even learn how many people have died. The plot-line seems more suited to the Cold War era than it does to the early twenty-first century, and indeed was looking a bit rusty even when Clancy published his novel in 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Given that the 9\/11 attacks took place shortly after filming was completed, and several months before the film opened in May 2002, Robinson might indeed have looked more prescient had he made a film about Middle Eastern terrorism rather than trying to rehash something like Fail-Safe for the modern age. 6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"7 March 2011","score":"","review":" The third part of this unique police movie series presents us a weaker story line than the second movie but a few great surprises.

Ditto with Tolkien's works, including his non Middle Earth writings. I, like a lot of other people, hoped someone would make a movie out of his books someday, and someone did.Me, I just can't take the story too seriously because it is essentially updated mythology. Parables about why the environment is dangerous hail from a different time, and we now understand why there's thunder and lightening, what stars actually are, how tidal waves and earthquakes are created, and whole slew of natural phenomenon that weren't only scary in terms of the danger they present (as they still are today) but were otherworldly and supernatural in power to our ancestors, who had little understanding of the natural world.With science-fiction (read that as good science fiction) it's a different story. The fantasy is still there, but the foundation isn't founded in losing oneself in divine or near-divine powers, but with the presumption that we understand how the physical world works. With fantasy you presume that you know the basics; water runs, wood burns, wind blows, boats float, but beyond that you're intentionally in the dark. So it is that Frodo and company galavant beyond their quaint home of the green Shire, and into the mysterious and dangerous depths of darkest Middle Earth.We're there with them to explore and experience the dangers and wonders of a world created by one of the great literary minds of our time, J.R.R. Tolkien. A man who took his knowledge of Norse mythology and melded it with his knowledge of folklore, religion, and his personal views on warfare and honor. We thus have a parable of friendship and the pitfalls of industrialized warfare, where the conflation between rival powers sucks in and destroys those who have no interest in what is essentially a personal struggle between supernatural personae. Persons who are never fully presented in this work.For the lay non-Tolkien fan, the War of the Ring, about which the films and books present and address, is an extension between Tolkien's version of the Christian god Eru Illuvitar and Morgroth (his personification of Lucifer). Morgroth had a servant, Sauron, who, after his masters vanquishing, took it upon himself to conquer Eru's creation. The films and books give us a slice of that conflict, and also present its final stages. In this sense (and by Tolkien's own admission in several interviews) we're seeing an homage to the King James bible as interpreted by Tolkien himself.Pete Jackson, obviously a Tolkien fan, has taken the works and put them in a splendid visual piece with a top rate cast and production team. No expense is spared to bring us the Shire, Mordor, Gondor, Rohan and places beyond. We're there with the characters as they jump from one situation to the next in an attempt to rid the world of evil (or a good portion of it) by carrying out a specific task.It's good entertainment, but like all films, you can't take it seriously. Which is why I think it's silly in this regard because it does take itself seriously. I think that was more of a nod towards the fan base who really regard Tolkien's works almost as a religious codex. They're not too far off the mark in Tolkien's outlook of his work, but I think give it far more import than the author would have been comfortable with. And I guess that's why I tend to smirk, perhaps laugh, at the films, regardless of how much I think they're okay in terms of movies unto themselves. But we're not supposed to question the physical reality of the world presented, just accept it and the drama. And perhaps that's all anyone can really do.Still, the seriousness of the actors, the angst of the direction, and overall gist, to me at least, seems ever so marginally over the top. It's as if everything here is ultimately serious, with serious consequences that need to be regarded with serious demeanor.

Whether or not he does possess a certain cinematic genius is neither urgent or necessary to conclude. His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother, ultimately, fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love. To the end of the small portion of Polanski's life he would later recall as the happiest he's ever had. He had a beautiful, talented, and adoring wife. Her name was Sharon Tate. The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever. Chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality. But it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying.

The baby inside of her, she and Roman would never name. In August of 1969 the Manson Family laid slain to Sharon Tate and the baby inside of her, both terrorizing and taunting, the darkest chapter of Polanski's life was marooned with notoriety and fear. It was only a few years after the death of his wife where Roman would leave his mark on the world forever. Chinatown flows with a lavishly perfected Noir tone, and I should add here, the film is the Neo Noir archetype, the best of its kind and one of the best that Film Noir carries in its respective canon. Also, whenever one sets out to write about Chinatown, one cannot understate the delicacy, the supreme handling of pacing which is to be found in this particular film. Not before, and not since, has pacing been so well thought out, so marvelously calculated, and devilishly crafted. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand immortal in this film, bellowing through the tenement halls inside of every dirty city confined within every Noir film in rotation. If Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway stand luminous as Kings of their respective Kingdom, then John Huston stands apart; shrouded in darkness, transparent, eager, vicious, immediate. John Huston's 'Noah Cross' exists, alright, and the most dangerous thing about the 'Noah Cross's of the world is that the evil within them is otherwise ordinary, bottomless, and unstoppable. Robert Towne's script is simply impeccable. Flawless storytelling accompanied by snappy dialogue, and a climax that cuts deeper than that of documentary reality. But it is Polanski who is the true star of this picture. You can see him in every shot, peering in through the lens, and directly into your heart. You can taste him in every dry patch of dialogue, smell him in the midst of gun smoke, and fear him as the tension culminates into the wake of tragedy. It is there, in the tragedy, he dares you to hope for the best, he wants to feel safe because films make you feel comfortable. He takes the trust that he'd earned from the audience, and crushes it, oh, and he makes sure it stings. He makes sure it hurts. And in in the aftermath of the his final act, his final betrayal, the ultimate tragedy, he makes sure you can feel him. He leaves you in pain. He leaves you guilty in satisfaction. Knowing that tragedy is the most universal of luxuries, Polanski makes that perfectly clear, and for the first time, his voice is heard, his war cry. Coherent and horrifying.

Whether or not he does possess a certain cinematic genius is neither urgent or necessary to conclude. His body of work speaks for itself, his 1974 magnum opus speaks for its decade, reality in the face of theatricality, and for the sanctity of the cinema itself. Now although it is not completely justifiable to prove whether Polanski is or is not a genius, it is rather important to discuss the life of this idolized and wanted man. Roman Polanski was born in the year 1933 in Paris to Polish parents. When his mother and father were forced into concentration camps for being Jewish, Polanski was faced with the unmeasurable difficulty of surviving the Holocaust on his own. His Mother, ultimately, fell victim to the horrors of Auschwitz. If that's not enough, if you would so melodramatically, fast forward to the year of 1969. To the Summer Of Love.

Session 9 is the kind of horror movie for people that can think for themselves. It is not the run of the mill slash hack slice'n'dice movies that we have been getting so many of lately. Session 9 is different to those kinds of films. So very very different. It begins with Gordon Fleming played by Peter Mullan, the owner of a small asbestos removal company Hazmat Elimination Company putting in a bid to clean a mental hospital that had been closed for years. Incidentally the building they used was the old Danvers Hospital, now since torn down. Gordon wins the bid and and his team which consists of David Caruso - Phil, Stephen Gavedon - Mike, Josh Lucas - Hank and Brendan Sexton III - Jeff who is Gordon's nephew. As they start to clean out the asbestos from the building, they begin to start quarreling among themselves. The tension builds and then Mike finds some tapes of patient 444 and begins to play them. I don't want to give too much of the film away here simply because this is something that has to be experienced for oneself. The atmosphere and tension that the director, Brad Anderson manages to build in the film is spot on. This movie is not about blood and gore. This is not a movie that will satisfy those who expects lots of violence and torture. This film is subtle and has a slow moving pace that works to build the tension to a rather shocking finale. There are many under currents in this film and many unanswered questions as well. This is a movie that wants you to use your brain, it has no pat answers for the viewer and actually deserves more than one viewing. It refreshing to see a truly atmospheric and cerebral movie in a time where all the horror genre seems to consist of visual grotesqueries and not much else.

But it's main influence probably comes from The Three Stooges. Sam Raimi's love of the The Three Stooges shows throughout the film's many comedic set-pieces. From a demon who can't stalk fast enough, to Ash fighting a possessed hand, and even some crazy antics with a flying eyeball. There are so many classic scenes in this movie, and all this is due to the absolutely awesome performance by a certain Bruce Campbell.

Sometimes mistakenly referred to as a biography, Amadeus is really a cheeky historical might-have-been, a storyteller's flight of fancy.The greatness of Amadeus lies largely in its source material, a play by the renowned Peter Shaffer, who adapted the screenplay himself. Shaffer's twin Anthony was behind some of the best thrillers of the 1970s, and Peter shares his brother's dark wit, but with a mind more towards the dramatic than the suspenseful. It's true that for Amadeus he has updated a baseless rumour and embroidered the truth extensively, but this tale of childish rivalry between two classical composers is simply irresistible. The exaggeration of the characters of Mozart and Salieri, the former into a giggling schoolboy, the latter a stuffy hypocrite, drives the story forward. Shaffer weaves the myth of their antipathy into a fascinating and humorous study on fame, talent, jealousy and ego. The emphasis on Mozart's operas as turning points in the narrative, as oppose to his many symphonies or chamber music, appropriately demonstrates music as storyteller and backdrop for action.Schaffer's play may be the mighty heart of this picture, but let us not play down the skill with which it has been brought to the screen. The first thing to make an impression is the lavishness of the sets and costumes, conjuring up the excessive glamour of the era, never totally clean, always a little dusty. Director Milos Forman however has such an ability to bring our focus in so totally on the actors that he can make us forget the extravagant backdrops. In example, for the interview scenes with the older Salieri, we move from the authentic clutter and bustle of the lunatic asylum, to suddenly having the background become a black and white blur, with F. Murray Abraham and the clergyman picked out crisply upon it. Still, the director does make clever use of the production design, a chandelier glittering eerily behind Abraham mirroring the fire on which he burns his crucifix. There is much cunning editing, not just of the image but also of the music, snatches of Mozart's compositions, accompanying such visual jolts as the appearance of Leopold, at other times disappearing in the middle of a scene, leaving a feeling of emptiness hanging in the air.The cast is a good one too. F. Murray Abraham gives a masterful turn, at his best in his scenes as the older Salieri, full of wry cynicism and weary regret. Tom Hulce's Mozart is massively theatrical, but it's a hammy performance for a hammy character, and almost as much fun as watching Charles Laughton in full flow. Good as these two are, I would love to have seen the leads from the first Broadway production, Ian McKellan and Tim Curry, reprising their roles for the screen version. The standouts really are in the smaller roles, especially a witty Jeffrey Jones portraying the Emperor Joseph II as if he was some slightly incompetent manager. The almost universal American accents of the cast may seem a little unconventional, but really considering these characters would in reality be speaking German is no more or less accurate than them all sounding English. Besides it seems the smaller parts have been cast for the expressive range of their accents, some sounding bucolic, others pompous, giving us the idea of character as opposed to where they might be from.Amadeus stands out amongst historical dramas for its mix of endearing wit and reflexive look at art and genius which is intelligent but never obscure. We are fortunate that it was produced in an era when production values were high enough to make it look stunning, after the days when censorship might have diminished its sharp edge and before the time when it could have been ruined by CGI cityscapes.

Ben Affleck is a rigid businessman who finds his efforts to make it home to Savannah in time for his nuptials with Maura Tierney constantly confounded by the weather, mechanical failures, coincidence and the temptations provided by wacky free spirit Sandra Bullock, who keeps getting thrown together with him.Singularly Bullock and Affleck can be very entertaining, but together they do not have much spark between them. They come off more as a brother\/sister pairing than potential romantics. Part of the problem is certainly the writing. Affleck's character is written as such a stick and Bullock is stuck playing such an offbeat stock character that the audience is never allowed to warm up to them. The less said about Tierney as Affleck's colorless fiancée, the better. Their misadventures grow tedious fairly quickly and events are not helped by Bronwen Hughes' uneven direction. Hughes either concludes scenes before they have built up a head of steam or allows them to drag on forever. For instance, the events at the hotel where Affleck and Bullock really start to bond and then run into acquaintances of his runs on and on and on. Meanwhile, a potentially hilarious sequence where, to earn money, Affleck reluctantly has to do a strip tease at a gay bar abruptly concludes right when it was starting to hit its comic high point. And these are only two examples. Hughes does not seem to understand what works and what does not. As such, we get a romance that is not particularly romantic, and a comedy with some scattered laughs that dry up long before the film has reached the two-thirds mark. I would venture to say there is not a smile to be had anywhere in the final third of this film.Another issue that fails is the ending. It probably sounds very mature on paper and it is certainly a non-Hollywood climax, but it is incredibly dull and renders the majority of the preceding scenes pointless. In a romantic comedy, one should never introduce a female character that is more colorful and appealing than the woman with whom the leading man ends up with (and vice versa). That is exactly what the writers have done here. They manipulate two characters together for romance and then in the final moments of the film, they have Affleck do an abrupt about-face and declare his undying love for Tierney, while a wise-beyond-her-years Bullock slinks off alone into the sunset. Affleck needs to sell us wholesale that the sight of Tierney alone has made him fall back in love with her (after a scant moment before he was planning on breaking off their engagement) and it is beyond both the actor and the screenplay to convince the audience of this. Rather than making it seem like Affleck is a great guy, it makes him seem more than a tad fickle. The next time he is stuck away from his beloved Tierney for a day or so, is he going to have another crisis of love? Does Tierney need to be in his line of sight in order for him to maintain the love affair with her? The entire scenario is just plain foolish. Affleck and Bullock have been much better elsewhere, and fans would be advised to find those other efforts.

And these are only two examples. Hughes does not seem to understand what works and what does not. As such, we get a romance that is not particularly romantic, and a comedy with some scattered laughs that dry up long before the film has reached the two-thirds mark. I would venture to say there is not a smile to be had anywhere in the final third of this film.Another issue that fails is the ending. It probably sounds very mature on paper and it is certainly a non-Hollywood climax, but it is incredibly dull and renders the majority of the preceding scenes pointless. In a romantic comedy, one should never introduce a female character that is more colorful and appealing than the woman with whom the leading man ends up with (and vice versa). That is exactly what the writers have done here. They manipulate two characters together for romance and then in the final moments of the film, they have Affleck do an abrupt about-face and declare his undying love for Tierney, while a wise-beyond-her-years Bullock slinks off alone into the sunset. Affleck needs to sell us wholesale that the sight of Tierney alone has made him fall back in love with her (after a scant moment before he was planning on breaking off their engagement) and it is beyond both the actor and the screenplay to convince the audience of this. Rather than making it seem like Affleck is a great guy, it makes him seem more than a tad fickle. The next time he is stuck away from his beloved Tierney for a day or so, is he going to have another crisis of love? Does Tierney need to be in his line of sight in order for him to maintain the love affair with her? The entire scenario is just plain foolish. Affleck and Bullock have been much better elsewhere, and fans would be advised to find those other efforts. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"7 March 2011","score":"","review":" Take two Hollywood performers at their peak, place them in a romantic comedy loosely inspired by the riotous Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and watch the fireworks FAIL to ignite. Ben Affleck is a rigid businessman who finds his efforts to make it home to Savannah in time for his nuptials with Maura Tierney constantly confounded by the weather, mechanical failures, coincidence and the temptations provided by wacky free spirit Sandra Bullock, who keeps getting thrown together with him.Singularly Bullock and Affleck can be very entertaining, but together they do not have much spark between them. They come off more as a brother\/sister pairing than potential romantics. Part of the problem is certainly the writing. Affleck's character is written as such a stick and Bullock is stuck playing such an offbeat stock character that the audience is never allowed to warm up to them. The less said about Tierney as Affleck's colorless fiancée, the better. Their misadventures grow tedious fairly quickly and events are not helped by Bronwen Hughes' uneven direction. Hughes either concludes scenes before they have built up a head of steam or allows them to drag on forever. For instance, the events at the hotel where Affleck and Bullock really start to bond and then run into acquaintances of his runs on and on and on. Meanwhile, a potentially hilarious sequence where, to earn money, Affleck reluctantly has to do a strip tease at a gay bar abruptly concludes right when it was starting to hit its comic high point.
