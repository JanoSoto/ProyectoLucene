[{"date":"4 April 2012","score":"","review":" Matrix is considered a sci-fi classic for good reason. The action scenes are simply outstanding. The last 20 minutes feature some of the most thrilling action sequences ever put on film.Also, the whole concept of the Matrix is fascinating. The trailer teases audiences with the question What is the matrix? There's no way to describe it. You have to see it for yourself. Well, when you see the movie and find out what The Matrix really is, you're not disappointed.If there is a weak spot in the movie it's in the middle when they get caught up in the whole Chosen One storyline. This is too good a movie to rely on such a stupid plot device. The whole sequence of events surrounding this plot line reminded me of a really bad Japanese animated movie I once saw where one of the characters kept saying I don't understand! I thought I was the chosen one! (or something like that). Why can't they just say, he's got great potential and leave it at that.
