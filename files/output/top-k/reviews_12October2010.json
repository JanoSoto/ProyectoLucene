[{"date":"12 October 2010","score":"","review":" Lord Farquaad is searching for a wife. Because of a complicated situation he needs a mate so he can qualify as king of the land. The 3-foot-tall despot has already banished all the fairy tale characters from his land, resulting in a mass of familiar bedtime figures. Shrek and the obnoxious Donkey factor in when Farquaad concludes that he needs dragon-slaying assistance. The woman he wants is the beautiful Princess Fiona, who's imprisoned in a castle by said dragon. To cut a deal to keep his house, the antisocial Shrek accepts the mission, except he falls in love with the princess he's been ordered to find!We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles! Since Shrek Forever After will be the final chapter in the series, I've decided to watch the past Shrek movies starting with where it all began Shrek. The story is brilliant and original and puts a modern spin on classic fairy tales. The characters were instantly lovable and were a joy to watch, especially Donkey, who is voiced as the brilliantly funny Eddie Murphy. The voice acting was fantastic and their voices fitted the characters perfectly, the cast couldn't have been any better for their roles. The animation is brilliant with bright colours and great designs. With some hilarious scenes and funny jokes and one-liners, Shrek is a success and is definitely guaranteed to keep the kids' attention as well as the adults.I really enjoyed Shrek and I think that the writing was fantastic and it definitely achieved its target to keep adults and children happy. The jokes were brilliant and the story was great as well and I laughed all the way through the movie. Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz were perfectly cast as their characters and it was comic viewing to watch their characters. Eddie Murphy was just fantastic and memorable as Donkey and was probably the funniest in the whole movie. All in all, Shrek is a family movie that shouldn't be missed by anybody!

The siblings get the chance of a lifetime gig; their manager(Keenan Wynn)books the team to perform in London during the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth in 1947. On the way to England, carefree and naive Ellen falls head over heals for a dashing Lord Brindale(Peter Lawford). Nothing real new, because Ellen seems to fall in love as the wind blows. While holding dance auditions confirmed bachelor Tom finds a romance of his own in a young dancer Ann Ashmond (Sarah Churchill). Will the dance team be broken up because of the new love interest? This song and dance musical comedy is very typical until the ever nimble Astaire does his incredible dance number on the ceiling and walls. A few of the memorable songs Too Late Now, Ev'ry Night at Seven and What a lovely day for a Wedding. Kudos to director Stanley Donen and Alan J. Lerner doing his first screenplay. Can you imagine a royal wedding taking backseat to a dance team?
