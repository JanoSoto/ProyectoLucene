The trailer didn't really do the film justice however the trailer was the one thing attracting me to see it in the first place. Although I saw the trailer while sitting in the cinema awaitng 'Scary Movie' final destination was one movie at the back of my mind labelled the next must watch. I myself cannot scare easily, well not in the sense of horror movies, I found the Exorcist boring and pathetic disregarding the fact its old and Scream original but more humorous than frightening.  Although I do like the parody. As I went into the cinema I thought this movie would be another slash\/horror one, with 'death' in the shape of the grim reaper dressed in a black cape holding an axe, popping out of closets and ripping the cast in half, however the movie was nothing of the sort.  It wasn't scary except the plane scene which seemed convincingly real, but was extremely suspenseful which threw many questions at me while i was watching. 'Who was next?', 'How would s\/he die?', etc, the fact that Alex had visions and took notice of hints that death gave him were extremely entertaining.The cast were good with great acting.  I had never thought too much of Kerr Smith, mainly because of his character on Dawsons Creek but he is very talented (and gorgeous) and I don't think he will get enough credit for the talent he produced in this film.  Ali Larter was excellent as well, I remember her from Varsity Blues, typically one of my guy friends I went with to see this movie, recognised her from the whipped bikini scene. In most movies nowadays the writers tend to not use the lead actress enough but I found they used her sufficiently and at the end of the movie her having the same feelings Alex did was a great twist.  Devon Sawa as always was great as the lead, he proved that carrying a movie was not too tough.  Seann William Scott was one of my favourites from American Pie and Road trip but I feel they didn't use his character enough in the film.  The directing was great, I loved the way the camera panned around Alex whenever he felt death, that was one of the main suspense factors.I don't think it was much of a teen movie as I had suspected, it was very adulty for say and been rated R down here meant many teens couldn't see it anyway, (without sneaking in of course).  The writing was excellent and very original, I think that the main problem for this film is that it was released at the tail end of the teen horror backlash.

King said he set out to make a moron movie and in that department he most definitely succeeded. I didn't sense for one minute while watching this that he tried to make it a good movie.

There were only a few moderately exciting moments in this film, and that doesn't cut it. Three things about Maximum Overdrive that really annoyed me are 1) the graphic violence, which at times was unforgiveable; 2) the cast of actors who act totally obnoxious (Pat Hingle and Yeardley Smith take top honors for the film's worst performances); and 3) the blaringly loud music score by the popular rock group AC\/DC. Now I'll grant you, AC\/DC is a pretty good rock band. I find some of their songs to be pretty cool. But for King to make them compose the score to this film was a big mistake.

The story itself is adapted from Alexandre Dumas' novel, which is a pretty highly colored piece to begin with. Chereau theatrically plasters the set with blood and gore, and we are left in no doubt that an atrocity has occurred (the St Bartholomew's day massacre of the Hugenots.) The mendacious Queen Mother, Catherine di Medici, and her weak-minded son, Charles IX, seem to have set it off to deal with the protestant problem without realizing how bad it might get.In all this horror is the rather cute tale of the relationship between two disparate personalities thrown together in marriage, Catherine's daughter Margo and Henry of Navarre (later Henry IV of France, and one of its better kings). Margo is repulsed at first sight by Henry `the peasant' while Henry rightly regards her as about as loving as a trapped tiger. Yet they reach an accommodation and finish up friends. Both have other lovers (and both respect that) but neither can prevent the lovers from coming to sticky ends.It's always a bit hard to assess the acting when you are relying on sub-titles (if only the French didn't speak so fast) but Isabella Adjani at the age of 40 pulled off a remarkable job and had me convinced she really was a spoilt, willful little nymphomaniac in her early 20's. She looked as young as she did in the `Story of Adele H' 20 years earlier. Daniel Auteuil was also excellent as the unprepossessing but very intense and quick-thinking Henry. Virna Lisi, a sex symbol in her earlier film career, made a good villainess as Catherine. Most of the other principals seem to have been chosen for their looks by rent-an-ego casting though Jean-Huges Anglade was suitably pathetic as the doomed King Charles.The rather claustrophobic sets brought home the medieval lack of privacy, even (perhaps especially) in royal palaces &#150; the old Louvre was about as spacious as the &#145;loo. The film fades a bit in the second half, but it's still not a bad story, if at times a bit difficult to follow.  I have to say I found `Elizabeth' more interesting and a lot less bloody.

What characterizes a Stanley Kubrick film?, one might ask. Well, that's not easy to say, but a Kubrickian film encompasses a particular genre being advanced by pioneering cinematography, stunning visuals, strong (and sometimes explicit) dialogue, and a high level of metaphoric art and symbolism. One cannot watch a Kubrick film with a relaxed mind and expect to be entertained. In order to fully enjoy and comprehend a film by Stanley Kubrick, it is imperative to think. Go below the surface of what you see on the screen and find a metaphor or symbolism that each shot represents. THE SHINING is a perfect example of this idealogy. One must rememember that in a Kubrick film, each shot means something.Second, this film is very reliant on themes and imagery to support these themes. Foremost is the pertinent theme of reflections. Mirrors enhance reflections and are key elements in the movie. It is through a mirror that we watch Jack eat his breakfast, not be able to see Grady (but be able to see Jack at the same time,) Danny watches a mirror at the beginning of the film while he shines, and it is mirrors that finally reveal the true meaning of the phrase redrum. Reflections play a major role in the unfolding of the story. From using them to see that Grady is a ghost, to finding Jack's true intentions.The acting in this film is also superb.

This is a welcome respite from the typical cinematic chum (Don't you die on me! I'm too old for this sh*t). Nevertheless, when you do that, you have to pursue the arguments made in the film to their logical conclusion. While it's difficult to discuss the final flaw in too much detail without giving away the ending, it suffices to say that there is a comparison of the Christian method of proselytizing (witnessing in the common parlance) to the salesmanship of the other characters. The problem with this is that the salesman don't seem to really give a damn about their product and how it affects the customer in contrast to the witness. This makes all of the difference.And this is not a fatal problem, if this wouldn't necessarily occur to the character in the film, but the born again new guy stands toe to toe (rhetorically) with Kevin Spacey's war hardened sales veteran throughout the entire movie.
