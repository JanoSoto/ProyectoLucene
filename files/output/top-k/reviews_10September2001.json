Instead of one growing tired of Max's antics and a brilliant British Invasion soundtrack, one learns to appreciate these often subtle beauties of a often misunderstood film.  The characters are well written, the chemistry is real, and the irony is wonderful.  Everyone  can in some way relate to Max, whether it be through betrayal, over-achievement, or a broken heart, there is something for everyone.  And the soundtrack, one of the greatest from a 90's film.
