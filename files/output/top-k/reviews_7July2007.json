It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs, but, despite all this, it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it. It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil, though only 28 while filming, played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book so stative, so smart, so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal, and I think he did not just because he won for Stagecoach that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent, moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense, but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him, but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new, cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.Of course, Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's, but later on she was given what she deserved (Oscars for To each his own and The Heiress). She plays Melanie with such a sensibility, but she manages to show her hidden strength, but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett, and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectly-remember that playing those scenes, like those after Scarlett's miscarriage, needed acting talent. He's perfect. But, I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it, and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch, so they fought about it badly, but, finally, Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.If you love good cinema, if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old, though almost 70!, do not miss it.

It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults, but it's original, imaginative, creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or, to use only one word to describe it Smokin!Jim Carrey can be two things either a really funny comedian either a comedian who does his job well but overacts, although no one can deny that there is a genius inside this man. In 'The Mask' he is awesome. I consider this one of his best actings of all time, if not his very best.In 'The Mask' Jim Carrey portrays Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk in a nice Edge City bank. He is a very nice and easy-going guy with great sense of humor (which matches his funny name). He is «the nicest guy», yet shy and somewhat depressed and he does not have much success in his job and personal life. He doesn't have much friends, except for his co-worker Charlie and his loyal dog Milo (a Jack Russell Terrier). Stanley likes to watch cartoons (particularly a Tex Avery one with a whistling wolf), decorates his apartment with items from these cartoons and he has the most unusual pajama )Jim Carrey also portrays the title character (The Mask), which is the other side of Stanley Ipkiss... or at least what he wants to be but can't be without the mask. The mask gives him superpowers and courage to do things he wouldn't be able to do without it. For example, he can dance like Fred Astaire, Gumby and Barishnikov (all together) - and he can flirt with the gorgeous Tina Carlyle. The Mask is a cartoonish figure that can do incredible things.This film is a crazy comedy, a film that surpasses the limits of imagination. Yet, despite its cartoonish humor, it also works well as a thriller and has a dark atmosphere. At the same time, this movie is clearly inspired (in many ways) on several cartoons, such as the Looney Tunes, Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood' and even the live action\/animation movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The movie also has great sceneries and backgrounds, as well as great lines, nice special effects and its magic.Cameron Diaz in this movie... my goodness! Is there any guy who wouldn't fall in love with her in this film? She was really a stunning beauty in this film. She was absolutely at her hottest and most sensual here she was more curvy, sexier, so beautiful and her smile was even more enchanting. Her role as the gorgeous and loving Tina Carlyle was a great acting debut for her. Plus, she was great in this role. In fact, she was a better actress in her early acting years than in more recent years. And she got slimmer with time.Cameron Diaz also sings very well in this film, with a husky, jazz-like voice. What a difference comparing to 'My Best Friend's Wedding', where she sings terribly. She was 21 years old in 'The Mask' but she surely looked older than that. She is really like a live-action version of Jessica Rabbit in this film.Other funny characters (along with Stanley Ipkiss) are Charlie Schumacher, Milo, Detective Doyle and the impatient Lt. Mitch Kellaway.Most of the soundtrack is great the opening theme and other instrumental themes during the movie and even the cheerful songs Hey Pachuco and Cuban Pete - this last one is sung by Jim Carrey himself in a hilarious part where he (as The Mask) dances and makes the policemen dance either. It really makes one wanna dance.Most actors are pretty good in their roles Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Ben Stein, Amy Yasbeck, Richard Jeni, Nancy Fish, Jim Doughan and Max.Max is the name of the dog that portrays Milo. The intelligence of that dog deserves to be mentioned. This breed of dog is known for its intelligence and loyalty, but also for being lovable, playful and stubborn dogs. Milo is all of that. Plus, Milo seems to understand everything they tell him. When his master is giving him orders, he moves his head as if he is understanding every word that is said. Plus, he climbs a considerably tall wall to rescue Stanley and we can see in his eyes when he is feeling fear, joy and sadness, for example. What a fabulous dog actor!The loaner... what a piece of junk! That car makes its own scenes hilarious! Why? Simply because of what it is a charger in a junkyard.Jim Carrey makes this movie as good as it is. I believe that this movie couldn't possibly be this good without the great Jim Carrey. This role was made for him and couldn't be played by other than him.This should definitely be on Top 250.

In fact, there were a number of Euro-Westerns made prior to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. However, in comparison with Leone's first Western, the few Euro-Westerns I've seen tend to be little more than copies of American Westerns. Instead, Leone was first to usher in a new style of Western. Leone created a less romanticized Western where characters had faults, got dirty, and bled. A Western where the line between the good guys and the bad guys was blurred. A Western where events were unpredictable. A Western where the violence was over-the-top. The Spaghetti Westerns like A Fistful of Dollars may have had little in common with the real Old West, but neither did the Hollywood Western. And I'm not sure that Leone and the rest cared that their films lacked historical accuracy. The real West wasn't their inspiration &#150; the Hollywood Westerns were their inspiration. These were entertainment pieces first and foremost. And if the audiences of the 1960s were entertained by this new style Western, Leone was going to give it to them.It's impossible to mention A Fistful of Dollars and not discuss the genius of Sergio Leone. In this movie, you can see early examples of directorial flourishes that would become Leone trademarks. The extreme close-ups followed by enormous widescreen shots, the extended showdowns, and the use of music as an integral part of a film can be seen in his first Western effort. But just as amazing and genius as Leone and just as important to the success of A Fistful of Dollars is Ennio Morricone's score. I'm sure audiences familiar the Hollywood style of scoring were shocked by Morricone's music with its series of whistles, chirps, and other experimental sounds. It was a new sound for a new kind of Western. And it's brilliant.At its core, A Fistful of Dollars is a very simple movie. The plot is simple (and even more so if you've seen Yojimbo). Clint Eastwood rides into town and discovers two warring factions. He uses the animosity they have for each other for his own gain. Like I said, it's simple. But the film's simplicity extends beyond the plot. Partially for budgetary reasons and partially the result of some judicious cutting and editing, there's very little in the way of fat. For example, the dialogue in A Fistful of Dollars is often very minimal. Considering the fact that he's the lead performer, Clint Eastwood's character has very few lines. Instead, Leone and Eastwood allow a look, an action, or a note from Morricone's incredible score to speak for Clint. Simple? - yes, but very effective.Beyond Leone's direction, Morricone's score, and the style of the Spaghetti Western, A Fistful of Dollars excels in several other areas - especially the acting. For the budget the film was made on, the acting is superb. Eastwood and his minimalist Man with No Name may be the known quantity, but there are other, equally impressive performances in the movie. Chief among them is Gian Maria Volontè as the crazed Ramon. It's an amazing piece of work. As much as I enjoy Eastwood, it's Volontè that makes the movie for me.Finally (and I'll end here because I could probably go on writing all night) I sometimes wonder if Leone or Eastwood or anyone involved with A Fistful of Dollars had any idea of what they were doing. Did they have any notion that more than 40 years later these movies would be more beloved than when they were made? I sincerely doubt it. I'll never forget the night I discovered Leone's Dollar Trilogy. I was in college in the early 80s and WGN was playing A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More back-to-back. I was blown away! My conception of what a Western was changed that night. And I've been a huge fan every since.Thank you, Mr. Leone.

But the film's simplicity extends beyond the plot. Partially for budgetary reasons and partially the result of some judicious cutting and editing, there's very little in the way of fat. For example, the dialogue in A Fistful of Dollars is often very minimal. Considering the fact that he's the lead performer, Clint Eastwood's character has very few lines. Instead, Leone and Eastwood allow a look, an action, or a note from Morricone's incredible score to speak for Clint. Simple? - yes, but very effective.Beyond Leone's direction, Morricone's score, and the style of the Spaghetti Western, A Fistful of Dollars excels in several other areas - especially the acting. For the budget the film was made on, the acting is superb. Eastwood and his minimalist Man with No Name may be the known quantity, but there are other, equally impressive performances in the movie. Chief among them is Gian Maria Volontè as the crazed Ramon. It's an amazing piece of work. As much as I enjoy Eastwood, it's Volontè that makes the movie for me.Finally (and I'll end here because I could probably go on writing all night) I sometimes wonder if Leone or Eastwood or anyone involved with A Fistful of Dollars had any idea of what they were doing. Did they have any notion that more than 40 years later these movies would be more beloved than when they were made? I sincerely doubt it. I'll never forget the night I discovered Leone's Dollar Trilogy. I was in college in the early 80s and WGN was playing A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More back-to-back. I was blown away! My conception of what a Western was changed that night. And I've been a huge fan every since.Thank you, Mr. Leone. ","genre":"Action, Drama, Western"},{"date":"7 July 2007","score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" A Fistful of Dollars is often incorrectly called the first Euro or Italian or Spaghetti Western. In fact, there were a number of Euro-Westerns made prior to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. However, in comparison with Leone's first Western, the few Euro-Westerns I've seen tend to be little more than copies of American Westerns. Instead, Leone was first to usher in a new style of Western. Leone created a less romanticized Western where characters had faults, got dirty, and bled. A Western where the line between the good guys and the bad guys was blurred. A Western where events were unpredictable. A Western where the violence was over-the-top. The Spaghetti Westerns like A Fistful of Dollars may have had little in common with the real Old West, but neither did the Hollywood Western. And I'm not sure that Leone and the rest cared that their films lacked historical accuracy. The real West wasn't their inspiration &#150; the Hollywood Westerns were their inspiration. These were entertainment pieces first and foremost. And if the audiences of the 1960s were entertained by this new style Western, Leone was going to give it to them.It's impossible to mention A Fistful of Dollars and not discuss the genius of Sergio Leone. In this movie, you can see early examples of directorial flourishes that would become Leone trademarks. The extreme close-ups followed by enormous widescreen shots, the extended showdowns, and the use of music as an integral part of a film can be seen in his first Western effort. But just as amazing and genius as Leone and just as important to the success of A Fistful of Dollars is Ennio Morricone's score. I'm sure audiences familiar the Hollywood style of scoring were shocked by Morricone's music with its series of whistles, chirps, and other experimental sounds. It was a new sound for a new kind of Western. And it's brilliant.At its core, A Fistful of Dollars is a very simple movie. The plot is simple (and even more so if you've seen Yojimbo).

and if all you've seen is 90% of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, you'd be right not to expect much. But essentially the format is a Shakespearean archetype, a blank slate for the most direct kind of morality play; the formula works for all sorts of costume epics, from rapiers to broadswords, six-guns to light sabers. John Ford and Howard Hawks, for all their technical mastery, only achieved anything like moral depth a couple of times each. Anthony Mann, Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah and, once, Marlon Brando, all turned in grown-up renditions of the old tune. ONE-EYED JACKS is one of the best.Brando flickers, flares and rages as the hell-bent Kid Rio, mumbling and twanging when he isn't destroying furniture or batting his eyes like bullets; and Karl Malden's partially redeemed Dad Longworth glistens with ambiguity in every inch of his gigantic frame. The photography and scenery are more interesting than in most genre pictures, and the dialog favors character while promoting story. ('member that little stick place just outside San Felipe? 'member, you got drunk and killed that lady's goat? 'member?) The script, which Brando famously nurtured over years, with such fine writers as Peckinpah, Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Guy Trosper under his lash, sticks Rio with some of the least chivalrous behavior ever perpetrated by a Western hero - he shoots the sheriff in the back and even more unforgivably impregnates his daughter - and disconcerts us with a challenge to Gary Cooper morality the Kid is justifiably desirous of Dad's death, but Dad really has cleaned up his act and made good with society, and if the Kid hadn't come to Monterey, Dad might have found redemption in repose. Brando's direction is alternately blatant and subtle, depending on the moment - phallic rifle barrels slowly poke open the flapping doors of a whorehouse; seductions are quiet and sexy; violence is sudden and ugly; death rides into the frame through the slats of a porch swing, where the victim snoozes after lunch. He knew which lens to use, and which angles, or at least left such decisions in the capable hands of Charles Lang (though his widely reported micromanagement of the project would seem to obviate this possibility;) and his direction of actors is first rate. If all his directors had shot him as glamorously as he shot himself, he would have eclipsed Marilyn Monroe as the biggest sex symbol of all time, even though he did not leave a good-looking corpse. That he painted himself so prettily doesn't tell as much about his ego as it might seem to do, since he courteously displayed all his performers to best advantage. The mother and daughter scenes, full of shame and pathos, are played out quietly in Spanish, a risk no Hollywood director took in the forties or fifties no matter how many hundreds of Mexicans had been portrayed in how many hundreds (thousands) of cowboy movies. Most of all, though, we must return to the impeccable casting as JACKS' crowning glory. Some of the great character actors of the period excel themselves in interesting little roles that may cost the film its imperative drive, but ultimately make for a mature, considered entertainment. Katy Jurado is spot-on as ever; Pina Pellicer makes her ingénue noble and pathetic; Timothy Carey and Sam Gilman are weird and threatening, and Elisha Cook Jr shows up to perform perhaps the most heroic act of his 200 film career. This is the only movie to feature both real-life cowboy legends Slim Pickens and Ben Johnson in good, meaty roles - neither has enough to do in THE GETAWAY or MAJOR DUNDEE, and THE SWARM just isn't worth it. The more famously comedic Pickens is surprisingly effective as the lascivious buffoon Lon, and Johnson's Bob Amory is more sweaty and unregenerate than any other of his numerous villains, even rivaling that other great bad-guy Bob, R.G.

Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio did such a great job with this, and James Cameron really pulled it all together as the director. you cant picture anyone else playing the parts...they did such a great job.there were some great scenes...like when Jack is handcuffed to the pole and Rose has to break him free with an ax off the wall so she takes a few practice swings and then tries to hit it in the same spot and misses by like ten feet! even though oddly enough she cuts him free perfectly as she smashes the chain with her eyes closed and then they have to wade through like really deep water.another is where the mother is telling a story to her two kids, so they will fall asleep and not be so afraid when they die..one of my all-time favorite scenes is where Jack and Rose are flying at the front of the ship.

Basically it has been two years since the events of the first film, and Chucky the Doll, possessed by the soul of The Lakeshore Strangler, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) (named after Charles Manson, Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray), has been recovered and reconstructed by Play Pals Inc. They have had bad publicity because of the events reported, and they have put together this doll for analysis and to prove to the public there was nothing wrong with it, of course they were unaware that the soul of Ray still inhabits the doll, so he comes back to life soon enough. Chucky is after the child he tried to transfer his soul into before, now eight year old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent), who has been placed in a foster home, as his mother is in a psychiatric hospital for thinking that a doll tried to kill them. Andy is living with foster parents Joanne Simpson (An American Werewolf in London's Jenny Agutter) and Phil Simpson (Gerrit Graham), and teenage orphan Kyle (Christine Elise), who has been transferred to numerous foster homes due to her trouble making. Chucky manages to find where Andy is, and finding another Good Guy Doll in the house he switches himself with it, and for a while Andy is fearful but unaware it is the same doll that tried to get him before, until of course he is tied up and almost his his soul taken away. Andy is next having a day in his new school, and gets into trouble with teacher Miss Kettlewell (Donnie Darko's Beth Grant) for apparently writing an expletive on his test paper, and trying to catch Andy again, Chucky kills the teacher. This chasing and killing spree continues, with anyone getting in the doll's way falling victim to his evil intent, even the Simpsons get killed as no-one believes the little boy's story that the doll is trying to get him. Kyle does discover the truth about Chucky when she uncovers the original Tommy Good Guy Doll buried in the back yard, but she cannot stop him from getting away and heading for Andy who is being held in the Foster Centre. The little boy is forced to take Chucky to a seemingly empty place, the large Play Pals Inc. factory making the hundreds of Good Guy Dolls ready for shipping, and he tries to transfer his soul into the boy's body. But he has been inside the doll body for too long and he is trapped in the body he has, so in rage he tries to kill Andy and Kyle, chasing them through the factory, and losing his hand in the process, replacing it with a knife blade. After losing his legs as well, Chucky is splashed by heated plastic mould until apparently dead, but then he springs to life one more time, before getting an air hose shoved into his mouth, and inflated until he explodes, and Andy and Kyle walk out relieved it is over. Also starring Grace Zabriskie as Grace Poole, Peter Haskell as Sullivan and Greg Germann as Mattson. As before Vincent is cute as the little boy forced to run away from the evil doll chasing him, and the puppet techniques and menacing and wisecracking vocals of Dourif make Chucky the star of the film. It is fair to say that this follow up is almost the same thing all over again in terms of the concept, especially seeing characters realise the doll is alive seconds before they are killed in a nasty way, but you can't help but like the deaths, the finale in the toy factory, and of course Chucky the killer doll, not a really bad horror sequel.

Andy is next having a day in his new school, and gets into trouble with teacher Miss Kettlewell (Donnie Darko's Beth Grant) for apparently writing an expletive on his test paper, and trying to catch Andy again, Chucky kills the teacher. This chasing and killing spree continues, with anyone getting in the doll's way falling victim to his evil intent, even the Simpsons get killed as no-one believes the little boy's story that the doll is trying to get him. Kyle does discover the truth about Chucky when she uncovers the original Tommy Good Guy Doll buried in the back yard, but she cannot stop him from getting away and heading for Andy who is being held in the Foster Centre. The little boy is forced to take Chucky to a seemingly empty place, the large Play Pals Inc. factory making the hundreds of Good Guy Dolls ready for shipping, and he tries to transfer his soul into the boy's body. But he has been inside the doll body for too long and he is trapped in the body he has, so in rage he tries to kill Andy and Kyle, chasing them through the factory, and losing his hand in the process, replacing it with a knife blade. After losing his legs as well, Chucky is splashed by heated plastic mould until apparently dead, but then he springs to life one more time, before getting an air hose shoved into his mouth, and inflated until he explodes, and Andy and Kyle walk out relieved it is over. Also starring Grace Zabriskie as Grace Poole, Peter Haskell as Sullivan and Greg Germann as Mattson. As before Vincent is cute as the little boy forced to run away from the evil doll chasing him, and the puppet techniques and menacing and wisecracking vocals of Dourif make Chucky the star of the film. It is fair to say that this follow up is almost the same thing all over again in terms of the concept, especially seeing characters realise the doll is alive seconds before they are killed in a nasty way, but you can't help but like the deaths, the finale in the toy factory, and of course Chucky the killer doll, not a really bad horror sequel.

An idealistic, principled lawyer sees the world falling apart around him and makes his stand. The world's a crummy place, he learns.Watching it again recently, a lot of things became clear. It's essentially a kitchen-sink potboiler melodrama with some black comedy in it, a puree of everything from Paddy Chayefsky to Frank Capra to Elia Kazan in which a little man rails against the system. The script is much more mediocre than you'd find in those guys' movies (Lumet is the most obvious touchstone here, and would've been the right person to direct), with lots of planted insights and twists that we've seen coming a mile away. It's faux moral in the manner of a 15-year-old who learns that not every defendant is innocent of a crime, and I think Levinson and Curtain really have no idea of what lawyers really do. Everything in the movie is an idealistic Showstopper about the system--no poring over the books or sweating out the details. There are a couple good scenes\/characters I guess (Jeffrey Tambor is really entertaining), but the movie really makes little sense. Why the banally comic scene with the helicopter? Why the crummy lounge jazz score? Why does Pacino SUDDENLY YELL in the middle of every other sentence? I jest about Pacino though. He's great, totally alive, spry, and enervated--the last of his great run through the '70s, and in the service of a generic crap picture. Jewison's direction is pretty lousy, and it seems like the actors (many good actors, I might add) are essentially flying blind. Pacino makes it work for him, though, and if the movie has any weight at all, it's because he's so committed to it. He's still young enough to be completely charismatic (in the manner of Dog Day Afternoon) yet old enough to carry some authority and wisdom. The movie doesn't really deserve him, but without him there'd be no movie at all, and I'm glad he stooped to be in this to do his thing at its most unfiltered.

It's a moment to savor, for you know it'll be a generation before another like it comes along.Rob (John Cusack), a thirty-something who owns a record store that attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers, has just been dumped (yet again) by his current flame Laura (Iben Hjejle) because he hasn't changed or grown up. This sends our immature hero on a journey of self-discovery as to why he can't seem to sustain a relationship, which includes visiting (and re-visiting) all the other girls on his Top 5 list, including (in chronological order) Alison Ashmore, Penny Hardwick, Charlie Nicholson (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Sara Kendrew (Lili Taylor). All the while, he tries fruitlessly to win back Laura and to grasp why she prefers the company of hippie ex-neighbor Ian Ray Raymond (Tim Robbins), in addition to having long talks about music with his two employees, Barry (Jack Black)--imagine a human version of Cartman from South Park but with an impeccable taste in music--and quiet Dick (Tod Louiso). Through his journey towards self-discovery, Rob slowly grows up and realizes what relationships are all about.Rob on page comes off as a self-pitying, adolescent jerk, a challenge for a character-driven comedy\/drama. The casting of John Cusack immediately helps the problem, because 1. Cusack is becoming the most automatically charming and lovable star since Cary Grant and 2. as a co-writer of the script, he knows Rob inside, out and backwards. This role is his. And because slowly, we see a boy becoming a man, a common theme of Nick Hornby's books. First Rob wants Laura back simply because his pride is hurt by being dumped, but as time goes by we see that he did truly have affection and love for her, which results in Rob making a list of Top 5 Things I miss about Luara. There isn't a moment we don't root for him, even when we question his maturity.The supporting characters provide the movie with a great deal of needed laughs to help ease the at times brutal honesty. Jack Black is a scene-stealer as music snob Barry, a guy so self-righteous he doesn't even give service to a customer who wants to buy I Just Called to Say I Love You because it insults his own taste. He's the kind of guy that you would violently assault in reality...if you weren't laughing so hard your stomach feels sore. Had the movie not been saddled with an actor as strong as Cusack, Black would've stolen the show. Tod Louiso is also great as Tod, as quiet as Barry is loud. Tim Robbins must've had so much fun playing the rebound man with a ponytail who inadvertently makes Rob's life a living hell. Joan Cusack, as usual, brings larger-than-life energy to her role as Laura's friend Liz. The only weak link is Iben Hjejle. But it isn't entirely her fault; the movie spends so much time focusing on Rob's dilemma when it should've spent a little time explaining what made Rob fall in love with her in the first place. And against such a great supporting cast, anyone would pale in comparison to Mr. Black.This movie is, quite simply, the ultimate male chick flick (a dick flick?), one that men can learn from while the women drool over Cusack and both can laugh at the numerous funny and truthful incidents (who HASN'T imagined killing the new flame of an ex?). A great movie if you've been married for 30 years or, more especially, if your relationship can't last longer than a tic-tac. An essential John Cusack role, whose exclusion at awards time is further proof that the 2000 Oscars were a joke. Not since Say Anything was Cusack more romantic or lovable.

At the suggestion of another IMDb list member, I saw it again today. I have gained a much better appreciation for it, a fine tragi-comedy.Toni Collette, a very chubby version of herself in her early 20s is the lead character Muriel Heslop, who for a time insists that she has become Mariel. She lives with a mostly dysfunctional family in little Porpous Spit, Austalia. No one likes her, not the guys, not the girls. Instead of getting a good job and working hard, she takes advantage of a blank check from her father and runs off, ending up in Sydney. That is act one.In act two, she tries to reinvent herself. She is sharing a place with a friend and happens upon an ad -- young foreigner needs Austraulian wife. He is a swimmer from S. Africa, and needs to swim for Australia in the Olympics to get his gold medal. She is giddy at the prospects of having a gorgeous young athlete for a husband, when she could never get anyone interested in her before. The wedding scene is masterfully done, and really funny. That is act two.In act three she realizes fully that she has been a fraud and her whole family too. She divorces her husband, just as she is becoming someone attractive to him, because for the first time she is becoming genuine, herself. After a death in her family, and explaining to her fraud of a father that he has to take care of his family, she heads off to Sydney with her now wheelchair-bound friend, destined for a better life.

She lives with a mostly dysfunctional family in little Porpous Spit, Austalia. No one likes her, not the guys, not the girls. Instead of getting a good job and working hard, she takes advantage of a blank check from her father and runs off, ending up in Sydney. That is act one.In act two, she tries to reinvent herself.

She is the only resident of a block not to give in to the demands of Alonzo Hawk, a developer planning the world's highest office tower. Whitfield, a relative of Hawk's and a newbie at being a lawyer, is given the mission by his new employer and uncle of convincing the woman to move so as to demolish her 'house'. Herbie and the woman's aeroplane hostess friend fight Whitfield over the matter until Whitfield is convinced that Alonzo is a no-good. Then Whitfield and the hostess fall for each other and with the help of Herbie stop the development. This is one of those interesting films from the 70s that uses older style movie making techniques to its advantage, not yet in the fast paced 80s but out of the experimental 60s, the film has a certain quality that is quite nice to the eye. The special effects and chromakey are used well, and at points a tad overused, but it is all in all a very enjoyable film.

Although Keanu Reeves holds his own in this film, this piece of cinema is an Al Pacino show.Pacino must have loved playing the devil, it shows in every word, in every gesture in his performance. Since Marlowe and Goethe cooked up Faust, the devil has had a great group of players taking on the part. People like Ray Milland, Ray Walston, Walter Huston have all done well with old Scratch, but no one ever tops Pacino in this.That's probably because through cultural and religious restraints, the devil HAS to lose in the end. In this film, it's not necessarily the case. Keanu argues the Bible says he loses in the end, but Pacino says quite properly, consider the source.Keanu Reeves is a hotshot trial lawyer from Florida who has rung up sixty three acquittals of various folks arrested. He's come to the attention of a very powerful law firm, headquartered in New York and they want to take him in. The senior partner is Al Pacino, a most mysterious fellow who moves among the rich and mighty with ease.Just how powerful Reeves has no idea and why Pacino is so interested in him particularly is also a puzzle. The reasons are quite shocking when he finds out.Although a talented supporting cast was gathered for this film, Pacino just overpowers this group with his performance. Even Reeves who actually has more screen time can barely keep pace.And the ending has to be seen to be believed. Let's just say that old Scratch has more tricks in him than Harry Houdini, David Blaine, David Copperfield and all the rest of that magician crowd put together.As he says, vanity is his favorite sin, it apparently is what trips mankind up every time, individually and collectively.
