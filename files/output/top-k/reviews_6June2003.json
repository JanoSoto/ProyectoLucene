In 1989, screenwriter Michael Wilson (With help from Richard Maibum) decided to bring Bond back down to life with a much grittier, realistic movie which was 'Licence to Kill'. Although it did make money, it was only a small amount by Bond standards. Audiences didn't want to see Bond bleed and be in pain while fighting sadistic drug dealers in Mexico, they wanted to see him in exotic locations with sexy girls and, as good as 'Licence to Kill' is, audiences were not satisfied and wanted the Bond they know and love. It would be a six year wait.In 1995, audiences finally got a glimpse of not only a new Bond movie, but a new Bond. Pierce Brosnan slips on the tuxedo and he couldn't be a better choice. Although not as good as Dalton, who is my favorite by far, he suits the role perfectly and knowing we have a good Bond is enough to make a good Bond film but the filmmakers were determined to give us something good and they do!To try and discuss the plot to a Bond film is like trying to convince people Shakespeare was an alien who secretly lived in California. The plots help but no matter how good, they don't matter. In this film, a main gimmick is the fact that 007 had been away so long and times had changed which this film weaves into it's story perfectly. No more cold war and, believe it or not, Bond is being bossed around by a WOMAN. Yes, times have changed. Having a woman as M bossing 007 around in 1962 would have been unheard of. Judi Dench fits into the role perfectly and has some brilliant scenes with Brosnan proving she is every bit the former M's equal despite being a woman. Cast as Moneypenny is Bond, Samantha Bond who teases Bond just as he teases her and tries to prove she has no interest in him at all. Of course, you have to have at least one friendly face and it's lovable old Q played by Desmond Llewelyn. His scenes with Brosnan are very funny although Q is once again just a cameo despite having a large part in the plot in 'Licence to Kill'.Now that you've got the MI6 team out of the way, there's the ever so famous role of the Bond girl, this time it's Izabella Scorupco playing the beautiful and intelligent Natalya Simonova. With a good Bond girl, you need a good Bond villain and this film is definitely no exception. Sean Bean plays the good-turned-bad Alec Trevelyan aka 006 (Cue dramatic theme) who Bond believed to be dead after an incident during the cold war. Sean Bean is an excellent villain and is quite good because he could be James Bond which makes it believable that he's 006 and he and Brosnan have some excellent chemistry in the pre-credits sequence. Famke Janssen plays bad girl Xenia Onatopp who has a very unique way of killing people. Cast as a slightly inferior henchman is Alan Cumming as Boris. This role is often criticised but I quite liked him and, for once, a non-Russian puts on a good Russian accent.The script by Jeffrey Caine and Bruce Feirstein is a great piece of work but it is slightly over complicated sometimes which means you get detatched from the film once in a while but Martin Campbell's direction brings you back in.Overall, a flawed Bond film (Russians speaking and writing in English is a noticeable mistake) but it re-starts the Bond franchise after an agonizing 6 year wait and everything here is nearly spot on making an enjoyable experience for Bond fans and casual viewers alike.

One is that a large amount of time is devoted to gratuitous sex scenes between Lucia and Lorenzo. Delightful as they may be, by the time Lucia is walking out on Lorenzo, there has been very little in the film to demonstrate that the bond between them is based on anything besides Lorenzo's acquiescence to Lucia's sexual aggressiveness. Lucia's initial contact with Lorenzo is the result of the fantasies she has about him based on his novel, which implies a delusional state of mind (not to mention her stalker behavior). I have nothing against on-screen sex nor against sexually aggressive women, but there was so little emotional connection between them established in the film that I had trouble buying that they had been together for six months, let alone several years. Besides, who keeps the same bad haircut for six years? Lorenzo, that's who.The other problem is the swarming mass of coincidence that brings all the players together on the island. The coincidences start early (Pepe's sister somehow knows the mother of Lorenzo's daughter) and Medem keeps piling them on until they're so thick it's ridiculous. It may be argued that this phenomenon is a result of the vague notion that the movie is about the intersection of reality and fiction, but that sounds to me more like a lame rationalization after the fact than a deliberately employed storytelling device. It feels self indulgent, even lazy from a writing standpoint.Okay, make that three major problems the assertion that the story has a hole where one can enter at the end and re-emerge in the middle and possibly change the outcome is bogus. If it is to be believed then most of the movie must be regarded as nothing more than a pessimistic fantasy played out in the head of a writer. Remember the infamous season of Dallas? Medem declared that he wanted to make this film more uplifting and optimistic than Lovers of the Arctic Circle. Could he only achieve this through the use of such an artificial deus ex machina? Medem seems to be going for magical realism, but he merely emulates its superficial qualities. A lot of sex, some washed-out photography, quirky characters and a bunch of unbelievable coincidences may add up to a hypnotic fable for some. For me it's all condiment and no entree.Medem is reputed to have rehearsed this thing for 5 months.

It is a satifying feature and effort. It is a real original production. Certainly relieving to see the big studios are capable of making decent movies such as this.

On her first visit to the apartment she finds that she can overhear every word that is being said from the psychiatrist's office next door.  She blocks it out but one woman's conversations stick in her mind.  As she mulls over what she hears she begins to apply it to her own life and see the failings in her life to date.I do love Woody Allen but some of his dramas are not to my taste as I have found them to be him chasing `real' art and not comedies.  However I can't remember having seen Another Woman so I decided to give it a go regardless of my preconceptions in relation to his `serious' work.  I was happily very wrong about this film as it is a very good piece of work.  My main problem with the film was simply because I couldn't relate to the life experiences of a 50 year old woman.  I was interested and felt sympathy for her situation but I felt like I needed to feel sympathy or at least connect better than I had.Despite this weakness (which was more mine that the film's) I still got something from the film.  The plot was well written, yes it keeps the usual Allen themes but that doesn't mean they aren't interesting.  What astonished me was the way he crammed so much into just 85 minutes, I could easily have watched it again afterwards to try and get more from it.Just as the plot is well written so too the characters are well developed and rounded.  None of the characters seem unreal although at times they were portrayed in a slightly pretentious fashion.  Marion is very well written and Rowlands brings her out well &#150; it is sad she has not had parts as good as this of late.  Farrow is good and the support cast are generally strong as well as being well known respected actors such as Holm, Hackman, Plimpton (!), Stiers and others.Overall Allen fans who love his comedy but have difficulties with some of his serious work (ie &#150; me!) should check this out as it is one of his best totally-straight films that I have seen.  Well developed story and well written characters make for a strong film that works very well.

However with a recent case resulting in an acquittal, her father Carl Lee takes matters into his own hands and kills the two men, wounding a marshal at the same time.  When he is taken up into court for murder bright young lawyer Jake Brigance takes up the case while the racial tensions rise daily in the southern town.The last time I paid to see a Joel Schumacher film was `Batman & Robin' and this type of film is the reason for that decision.  Here we have the perfect example of a bad Schumacher film &#150; a highly professional film that is lacking in sense, logic and thought.  The plot on paper seems reasonable but it has been turned into an extreme love song to violent vigilantism.  Nobody can condone the rape of anyone, far less a child (of ANY colour) however neither can I condone the premeditated murder of anyone.The film tries to have it too many ways.  Firstly we are sold on the murder on the basis that the town is so racist that the two rapists would be released was a given.  But yet at the same time the same town is not so racist to find a black man guilty &#150; not to mention the fact that this supposedly racist town has appointed a black sheriff!  The tasteless bit of the film is the fact that it isn't just a courtroom thriller and nor is it merely making the point that how awful rape is, on top of this it is a love song to vigilantism.  The film makes it very clear (by having Carl Lee tell Jake that he's going to do something) that this was clear cut murder despite the actual trial claiming insanity.  So we are asked to get behind someone who planned the murder of two men.  I agreed there were mitigating circumstances but even with all the tricks in Schumacher's book I couldn't raise a smile when Carl Lee was freed on all charges!This political stance is typical for a film that portrays Jake as a liberal but then has him rant about using the death penalty for those HE feels deserve it!  If that is a liberal then is it any wonder the film is so confused about it's politics!  Yes, this is very professional and polished and you'll enjoy it while you're watching it, but really Schumacher is throwing up a smokescreen using a big budget, a big cast, issues of race etc to try and hide the fact that he is saying that some people deserve a good killing.  Perhaps he would like to form his own lynching squad and go around dispensing justice to those HE feels deserve it?The cast is great and full of names, however this is another smokescreen designed to buy this film a nice new suit of clothes.  McConaughey is quite good in the lead but he is unconvincing as a lawyer.  Spacey is wasted with little to do except sit silently and lose a case that couldn't have been made easier for him.  Bullock is strangely given top billing but has nothing to do; her character (indeed a lot of the characters) is pointless to the plot and seems to have been added to allow more famous faces.  To facilitate her character, Judd is sent away halfway through the film to allow Bullock and McConaughey to get all sweet on each other.  Likewise Sutherland (both of them), Platt, Dutton, McGoohan, Fricker et al tend to be underused or portrayed to one extreme or the other.  Jackson has one very good scene but he doesn't leave much grey area in his performance due to the direction and script he has to work from.Overall this looks like a big Hollywood film for that is what it is.  However all the budget, music, big name cast and directors in the world can only hide a confused standpoint for so long.

Someone is selling guns and dynamite to the Indians and other agents have been killed trying to find out who &#150; only someone like Jane can get close.  When her partner is killed she has no-one to act as her husband and help her travel incognito.  She happens across a cowardly dentist, Painless Peter Potter, and she marries him in order to get a ride to Buffalo.  However, can she keep him out of trouble long enough to find the dynamite?Bob Hope may be 100 years old as I write this but he has been out of movies for quite a few years, also he only tended to make one type of film and play the same part in each one.  So the appeal of this film very much depends on whether or not you like that.  Personally I love Bob Hope and enjoy him even when he is in a weak film.  The Paleface is one of his best films simply because it is a good piece of all round entertainment.  It has a good central plot that stops the film just being a vehicle for him to do his stuff and instead is actually going somewhere.The songs are quite nice but also there's only really two so it doesn't slow the film down too much.  I do like the odd musical number but some Hope films had 5 or more songs in a 90 minute film, which was way too many.  Hope is on good form, his asides and jokes work better in a good plot and he is very funny throughout.  Some routines work better than others but if you are a fan then you'll like his style even when it isn't as funny as you'd hope.  Russell is a good leading lady despite being a bit serious and then softening too quickly.  The support cast are all in the background and the Native American clichés can be explained by the period and not racism.Overall this is a very enjoyable film that works well because it allows Hope to run free within a good film instead of simply letting his performance be the film.  He wisecracks his way along and it is easy to see why his light comic style has made him an icon even with a generation who have found him on their television and not the big screen.

So the appeal of this film very much depends on whether or not you like that.  Personally I love Bob Hope and enjoy him even when he is in a weak film.  The Paleface is one of his best films simply because it is a good piece of all round entertainment.  It has a good central plot that stops the film just being a vehicle for him to do his stuff and instead is actually going somewhere.The songs are quite nice but also there's only really two so it doesn't slow the film down too much.  I do like the odd musical number but some Hope films had 5 or more songs in a 90 minute film, which was way too many.  Hope is on good form, his asides and jokes work better in a good plot and he is very funny throughout.  Some routines work better than others but if you are a fan then you'll like his style even when it isn't as funny as you'd hope.  Russell is a good leading lady despite being a bit serious and then softening too quickly.  The support cast are all in the background and the Native American clichés can be explained by the period and not racism.Overall this is a very enjoyable film that works well because it allows Hope to run free within a good film instead of simply letting his performance be the film.  He wisecracks his way along and it is easy to see why his light comic style has made him an icon even with a generation who have found him on their television and not the big screen.

Obviously taking influence from the similarly themed &#145;Conan' movies, this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all.Bridgette Neilsen stars as Sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged, her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant Queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do it. After discovering what has happened Sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not.The first major problem with this movie is the beginning. The events leading up to the point where Sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film. However, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one-minute `Previously on&#133;.' segment from a television show. Had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer has only currently directed two movies since Red Sonja).This film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably. He was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for &#145;Red Sonja'.For all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both Neilsen and Arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey. The acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even Arnie didn't seem too bothered about his performance. I don't recommend this film at all; to me it's a waste of an hour and a half.

Splinter actually looks fine, but his outer appearance lacks the spirit of the original Splinter.  People at Jim Henson Studios must put effort and life into anything they create because most puppeteers create their actual puppets -such was the case with Splinter in the first two. But this was taken out of the third movie...and thus the only thing to back it up would've been another return of Shredder and a good plot.Sadly any return of Shredder would probably be a bad plot. (   As he did die in the comic book...   And since the second story pushed away from the Comic's original storyline....(TGRI was really TCRI...and was run by aliens from outer-space) There was no way a plot that furthered the story would be any good...unless....they chose the script they chose for this movie.  The whole side story in Feudal Japan is it's own movie and this works excellently for the film.   The Turtles show up to save April, who has been transported to Feudal Japan by a magic scepter.   And of course adventure and comedy is bound to ensue.Another thing I digged was the character development...which is sometimes sped up sometimes on Michaelangelo, Raphael, Whit, April and Casey's relationship, and Kenshin.   However April (by herself), Lord Norinaga, Mitzu, Walker, and Donetello's character development works... (Don's character changes throughout the entire trilogy....first smart mouth, then joker who is a whiz with computers (or starting to be.) then finally Turtle Nerd...I can't possibly exist without one single microchip?)Which brings me to one another issue..... Corey Feldman's return was awesome!   The second Donatello always annoyed me.   I think it was mostly because Corey Feldman made Don his own character and not just the smart guy, but rather a smart guy with a smart-ass mouth.  D  Corey's Return is highlighted in the credits and with good reason.   He does an excellent job of following up on the second Don's attempt to be a Computer Wiz..The rest of the cast is great, with the exception of Splinter's new voice actor.   He tries... but he is no Kevin Clash.  I must comment on Robbie Rist and Brian Touchi.  They are Michaelangelo and Leonardo..they surpassed the cartoon voice overs from the cartoon series in the first movie...and they continued with their roles until the end and never faltered.  Tim Kelleher is excellent as Rapheal, tho' it would've been nice to have the original voicer of Raph from the first or the second...he makes the role his own and that's actually good!  Paige Turco return is surprising as she doesn't look herself in this movie at all.   (I thought it was a third April) and this could be seen as good or bad for the film.

(Actor..the others did voices)  'Course I may be wrong.    But his presence helps connect this film with the previous two.  We get to see how Casey has changed (or hasn't) in this film since we didn't get to in the first. His appearance as Casey is short but good.

With A-list actors, acclaimed directors, well written scripts, big budgets and mind &#150; blowing special effects, these films are no longer just eye-candy, but substance based stories centered on ordinary people with extra-ordinary abilities, who are put in extra-ordinary situations. Many argue that the popularity of superhero or comic-adapted films began with the release of Tim Burtons' BATMAN in 1989, starring Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton. They say it was this film that got people excited again about seeing comic book characters adapted for the big screen. Indeed, BATMAN is a work of art, but there is no doubt that the landmark of superhero films is Richard Donners' SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, starring Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve and Marlon Brando.Although this film may be lost to the younger audiences of today, who grew up on CGI films, I was pleased to rediscover this movie on a new DVD format, along with previously deleted scenes, now integrated into the original theatrical version. Watching the film again, with a digitally enhanced picture and sound quality, was nothing short of amazing. The story (originally written by Mario Puzo of Godfather fame) is simply brilliant, incorporating various elements of storytelling, thereby creating a product that has elements of a love story, mythology, action, tragedy, comedy and drama, all seamlessly interwoven. Interesting to note that the original script was over 500 pages in length, which was later split up into two films, SUPERMAN THE MOVIE and SUPERMAN 2. The film does not prioritize special effects, as most modern day films of this nature do, but instead uses it as a creative device for telling a story. A lot of films today are created simply as a vehicle for showcasing advances in technology and special effects. This is not the case here, as the film has a real story to tell, and does not fall short of that aim. The film as a whole manages to capture the essence of the Superman mythology, incorporating all the elements making up the original story from the comic books. Considering the time the film was made in, pre-CGI, the visual effects still manage to capture the magic of Superman, from the flying sequences, to showing off his incredible strength, to the intricate set designs for Krypton and The Fortress of Solitude. Knowing that all the visual effects were created manually without the use of computers, gives the viewer a deeper appreciation for the amount of work put into this film, which truly shines as a labor of love. In comparison to most contemporary superhero films, this film is in no hurry to show off the hero sporting his costume and battling evil. In fact, we only get to see Superman about an hour into the movie. The first hour of the film is primarily concerned with the development of the central character, highlighting his origins and early years, which shape him into the man he will become. As soon as he gets to Metropolis, the action kicks in, the love story kicks in, and the film moves into a higher gear. We are introduced to the villain, Lex Luthor, love interest, Lois Lane, editor, Perry White and photographer Jimmy Olsen, all of whom form an integral part of the Superman mythos. The cast is superb, the directing flawless and the cinematography breathtaking. Added to that is the spectacular score by John Williams which captures the emotion of each scene in the film perfectly, from the opening credits to the end credits. There is so much to say about this film that I could go on for ages. For me, this is still the ultimate superhero film, and always will be. If you have the opportunity to get your hands on the DVD, do it. It's worth every cent. The special features include three documentaries, which give viewers an inside look into the entire production of the film, never before seen screen tests, as well as trailers and TV spots. If you are a Superman fan, then this is a must have for your collection.
