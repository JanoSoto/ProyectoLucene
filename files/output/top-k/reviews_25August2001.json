Marky Mark, er, Mark Wahlberg (excuse me) all muddied up running around a Tim Burton set and B. that they were even remaking this accidental classic, which easily is near the top of America's Cheesiest Films Of All Times list (right below Blackula, Killer Tomatoes and Jon Waters' purposely cheesy farces of course).For those too young to remember, Planet of the Apes first appeared in 1968. It was a sensation with audiences and panned by critics. The costumes were state-of-the-art for the times and the sets were as other worldly as they could portray in a sixties Star Trek quazi-realism way.Those who enjoyed the first version(s) even passed up the concession stand goodies for fear of losing that comfy close-up seat. The suspense of what the apes would look with all the modern gizmos the FX folks have at their disposal nowadays was almost unbearable. Like with The Grinch's recent successful transformation into 21st century-gadget- hoopla- infused- bing- bam box-office magic, TPOA does not disappoint on that level.As for the the rest of the film? Well, the plot is as deep as Green Eggs and Ham and the human cast is about as exciting as an instructional video on an anal polyp removal from the lower bowel of a brown field mouse, yet still, mad-director Tim Burton left just enough camp to keep it, surprisingly, enjoyable.The story goes...Astronaut; Leo Davidson (Mark softly spoken Wahlberg) is aboard a space station USS Oberon, training primates to play Astronaut. One starry night he is told to send one of these Chimps out to research a menacing energy field approaching fast on their starboard side.The canary in the coal mine never returns...So, Leo, bored with his mundane duties anyhow, jumps into a delta pod to rescue the fellow, and, surprise, gets transported through time to a place ruled by...He crash lands safely in an eerie swamp. But, before he can shake his banana dry, he is over run by a group of fear-for-their-lives types ricocheting through the forest being pursued by dressed, orating, violent apes. Leo is trapped, along with these ratty anorexic -Mad Max looking- extras each with a perpetual glaze over their faces like deer locked on headlights (or Nick Cage in an emotional scene), and sent to market. The market is run by Limbo (brilliant Paul Giamatti) a sleazy Orang creep.Leo and a boopsie faced tribe gal, Deana (Estella  be careful of bimbo typecasting  dear Warren), meet in one of Limbo's human slave holding cells. She's smitten, but he's focused on his personal inner dialog, his sequel, Exit El Quicko from the Planet Of The Apes.They end up working together and gather a few others including, human rights activist girly ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). They all escape the city and head to rendezvous with Leo's space colleagues who have been sending out a signal to him via his space age transmitter he rescued from his sunken space pod. The humans hope Leo is their savior fallen from the sky to save them from the mini-Kongs that suppress them. Leo hopes his friends are waiting for him, just over the mountain range&#133;The fleeing party faces some pretty mean mother-apers en route to Shangri-La! One ape in particular, General Thad, (Tim Roth) hates humans in a Hitler- southern plantation owner-circa 1800 way. He wants the filthy creatures (humans) completely annihilated and is schmoozing with the ape senate to get his wish. Leo is just what the nefarious Thad ordered when praying to their almighty Semos for a sign the humans must all go. With Leo's frightening display of intelligence and back bone, the senate will be scared bananaless into giving Thad the Marshal Law decree he so desires.Will Leo and his new tribal friends make it to the space command center before Thad's wicked army finds and crushes them? Is Leo the god they have waited for all these years? Could the last fight scene be tackier?Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything here for you...It's so telegraphed G.W.

After being underused in `Lethal Weapon 4' and `Romeo Must Die' he is given a starring turn that allows him to use his quiet tough guy to the full, taking his laconic persona, so evident in his Hong Kong films, and transferring them to a European setting. Trust a Frenchman to realize the potential of the Orient. Chris Nahon understands that people going to see a Jet Li film are only there to see one thing Jet Li. Not DMX not Aaliyah, not Mel Gibson. If only Brett Ratner realized everyone went to see `Rush Hour' to see Jackie Chan not Chris Tucker&#133;..Nahon gives us the fight set-ups we so desire at the right moments and allows Jet to show off a harder, brutal fighting style. Taking a leaf from HK cinema Li uses the set dressing for impromptu weaponry throughout the film, for which Yuen Kwai, the choreographer, can take great pride in. Using a more modern style of fighting there is no evidence of wires - greatly appreciated and something I have been looking forward to in a long time. For the run time there was just enough fight scenes &#150; always leave them wanting more but don't starve the audience!!Some reviewers have commented on the characters negatively and to a point I agree they are underwritten. However, Tcheky Karyo is no crazier here than in `Doberman' or as Gary Oldman is in `Leon', so are we to believe that all French policemen are mad? NO, it's a film!! As Jet&#145;s character relies on expression and silent intensity rather than dialogue, thus the antithesis to this is the exuberant psychopathic styling of Karyo. Perhaps they have given Jet less dialogue because of his level of English, if this is so he will need to redress this problem soon to make his transition to Hollywood, as we are unable to fully gauge his acting ability. What we see is the same career hardened, duty and honour bound character that is only unsure of himself when around women in an intimate situation (eg; Hung Hei Kwoon in `New Legend Of Shaolin'). Bridget Fonda pulls off an atypical &#145;hooker with a heart of gold' role and is perfunctory. If you want female characterization watch `Crouching Tiger&#133;' She is purely a plot device giving Jet's character the necessary emotional arc to carry himself through the film and when he is kicking this much a**e who are we to argue?Of the casting there was only one real blight for me and that was the casting of Burt Kwouk and Ric Young. There are many Oriental actors out there so why do they insist on using the same ones? Indeed some of the acting jobs I have done have been basically my version of Burt which begs the question do casting directors really think all Chinese are the same? Ric Young puts another sleazy camp Chinese onto his CV and the sooner he gets less work the better.There have also been comments on the fact that everyone does martial arts. Of course they do it's a martial arts action film. If I remember correctly I believe that martial arts is very popular in France and the police should have unarmed combat training but obviously not to the level of a Chinese policeman thus taking care of that argument. At least this time there are no street thugs who are gung-fu masters. There is no level of self-indulgent stylization of the fighting a'la `The Matrix' and the homage to `Leon's storming of a police station puts the Wachowski's film in the shade. Thankfully there was very little slow motion and in general the impacts and techniques were visible onscreen. For once there were no close-ups of foots in the face without the full shot of the damaging kick. If only Jet Li was in the next `Matrix' sequels.The gunplay is atypical of an action movie and no better or worse than the standard hip-firing fare. I believe that all gunfights should carry a certain level of realism when necessary. I have trained in weapons and martial arts and I didn't really think this film needed it and thankfully there were no continuity errors (see my review of Saving Private Ryan).Overall this is a brutal, well-made, well-paced martial arts action film with a wry sense of humour, showing the Americans how to use a Hong Kong movie star. Jet Li said this was for an R-rated audience and thankfully that is what they have given us. This rates with `Once Upon A Time In China' and `Fist Of Legend' as Jet Li's best.

Anyone who knows the slightest bit of history knows that the airborne forces were miss-dropped all over Normandy. Having said that if we British complain so much about the non-representation of our forces in American films why don't we make something equally as jaw-dropping, after all most of the technicians on the film were British? I'll tell you why not. After the release of his film `A Bridge Too Far' in 1977, director Richard Attenborough said he would never make another film whilst participants in the historical event were still alive. Why?

I have visited Pointe Du Hoc and I have full admiration for the Rangers that tackled their objectives. But I digress.The opening is phenomenal and is being recreated, derisorily, time and again in computer games. Nothing has captured the sense of what it must have been like but this goes some way to accomplishing that. The first time viewed I don't think I breathed out.Unfortunately after such a visceral experience there is always going to be a comedown, physiologically this is what is going to happen with adrenalin and thus the viewer is unwittingly experiencing what an infantryman might have gone through. The comedown for the audience however, is in the film's pacing.The mid-section does drag and yes maybe this is to show the lulls between the fighting etc. But if I wanted to experience boredom and nothing I would do nothing. Or I would watch `The Thin Red Line' a truly dull experience. Indeed this lack of pacing is noticeable on repeat viewing.The characterization is not fully realized for such a running time and many of the characters remain clichéd eg dependable Sarge, the coward. Nevertheless this does not detract from the film as the casting compensates in their visual appearance. From just their looks we are compelled and can empathize.The cinematography, editing, and sound are all first rate, as we have come to expect from Spielberg although the shafts of light were unnecessary. The washed out colours added a texture of reality and, with the age of digital film-making, the look of the film is far from the normal sheen of fantasy - an edge of documentary lending itself.On a technical note, and perhaps superficial, there are a few errors that irritate. Firstly why do they use the mortar shells when they have grenades on their belts, which stay unused? Having practised fire support team drills why does Mellish not carry the spare ammo? The unit has two bazookas and yet they leave one lying around.

But how these film critics can mislead the movie-going public! Swinton's performance as a mother who endangers herself on her son's behalf is right on the mark, but the film itself suffers from too many plot holes and contrivances, as well as poorly developed characters.     The Deep End, which is based on a novel called The Blank Wall by Elisabeth Sanxay Holding, begins intriguingly enough with Swinton's character, Margaret Hall, entering a gay dance club to demand that its sleazy owner, Darby Reese, (played by Josh Lucas, last seen as Laura Linney's sleazy ex-husband in You Can Count on Me) stop seeing her young trumpet-playing son Beau (played by Jonathan Tucker).  Within the next few minutes, Darby's corpse appears on a shore near Margaret's quiet home on Lake Tahoe.  In the time it takes her to take out the garbage, Margaret ties an anchor to the body and buries it in the water.  But her troubles are far from over when she must negotiate with blackmailer Alek Spera (played by Goran Visnjic), who threatens to turn over some potentially incriminating evidence to the police if she fails to comply.     The Deep End may have been as exciting as it sounds in print if the writers\/directors had attempted to develop the characters more, so that we can actually care about them in perilous situations.  Swinton's character Margaret is likeable enough, but never did I feel as if she were an ordinary person in an extraordinary situation, as one would think.  If there had been more scenes included in The Deep End that illustrated the tension that someone in Margaret's shoes would feel, then this thriller would actually thrill.  But instead, Margaret seems to assume a calm and collected veneer throughout.  Some key scenes should have been longer and more detailed.  For instance, the scene where Margaret discovers Darby's corpse is disappointing because she isn't given enough time to be appropriately shocked or upset.  Instead she quickly disposes of the body seemingly on instinct, as if she were simply performing a routine household chore.  Now if I were her, I would have been a nervous wreck!     Another problem I had with this film is that Margaret's relationships with other characters are not very well-established.  The relationship between Margaret and Beau could have been more interesting if Margaret had perhaps shown more animosity or resentment towards her son for his involvement with someone like Darby Reese and for putting her in such a compromising position.  But McGehee and Siegel seem more intent on portraying Margaret as a saintly mother who bears no ill will to anyone.  Also Beau is given very little to do except look pretty and play the trumpet!     The relationship between Margaret and Alek Spera is also inadequately established, mainly because Alek's motivations are not made clear enough.  I suppose if you had to be blackmailed by someone, you could do a lot worse than hunky Goran Visnjic, but the blackmailer-with-a-heart-of-gold thing was a little hard to swallow, if only because Visnjic projected so little chemistry with Swinton.  It is easy to feel sympathy for Margaret's plight, but if Alek's interest in her well-being was for romantic reasons, then this is news to me! While I am relieved that McGehee and Spiegel opted not to include an obligatory love scene between Margaret and Alek, it would have been nice if they thought of some overt ways that Alek could show his affection for Margaret.  I mean, come on, Tilda Swinton is a beautiful lady.  It shouldn't be too hard for someone to stare longingly at her.     All gripes aside, The Deep End is still a decent movie because of its slick direction and compelling lead performance by Swinton.  Just don't go into this movie expecting the masterpiece that all the top critics say it is.  If McGehee and Siegel had developed the characters more, then maybe this movie would deserve to be called the best American movie of 2001.  If you really want to see the best American movie (so far) this year, you are better off getting tickets for Hedwig and the Angry Inch or Ghost World.
