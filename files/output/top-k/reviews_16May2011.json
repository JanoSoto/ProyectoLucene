I don't think it's related to certain age or place. So that's why movies talk about it non-stop. Every movie has a case of stubborn idealistic teacher, and a mess that varies between poor underachievers and frank criminals.The icons of the kind aren't many across the way. In the 1950s (Blackboard Jungle &#x96; 1955) came out as very important one and almost a milestone. In the 1960s there was (To Sir With Love &#x96; 1967). In the 1970s somehow the sport movies exploited the formula, comically, leaving the serious case of school out of cadre with movies like (The Longest Yard &#x96; 1974), (The Bad News Bears &#x96; 1976), (Slap Shot &#x96; 1977),..etc. Then at the 1980s we came back to school in (The Principal) yet in a whole different way.This movie approaches the case through an angle that gathers between the commercial look (war with crime, action scenes, comic remarks) and the rule of meet violence with violence; which was &#x96; and still is &#x96; a pretty bold matter in movies of that kind. However it ended up as a bit unserious movie which deals with scarily serious subject. While it provides a swamp of a school, classic situation for its stubborn idealistic lead to face, rather to fight, many examples for the poor underachievers (single underage mom, a bright yet gangster student, Latino delayed in reading..) and frank criminals (a drug dealer, a rapist..), even loyal assistants (a tough janitor, a nice teacher..), it &#x96; in the same time &#x96; shows and handles everything and everyone as just a thrilling B-movie fare.All the characters are underdeveloped. Strangely the only well made, well portrayed, character was the janitor \/ security manager (Jake Phillips), done greatly by (Louis Gossett Jr.) in his finest hour after (An Officer and a Gentleman &#x96; 1982)'s success. The rest you know by the similarity with other &#x96; more deep &#x96; movies. Simply we didn't go, or have the time to go, through the characters, despite how troubled they all are; which would have been a feast for another drama. (James Belushi) is always the lovable Jim. Back then he did well in comedies or action comedies like (Red Heat), (K-9). And here he wasn't away from his area.The worst acting, or the worst anything, this movie has; came from the head of rebels, or the movie's villain for that matter !, (Victor) played by (Michael Wright). That guy, by the way he was written and acted, represented the worst of the B-movies' making. He's a professional drug dealer, with absolute evil and no background. The way he punished one of his gang, for leaving it and making friends with the principal, was too sophisticated, looking borrowed from horror movies or maybe drastic Blaxploitation ones. (Wright) as an actor has no middle; he's whether a badass, utterly confident, Dracula or a sudden pathetic wimp with terrified look in his eyes. Moreover, he doesn't get to kill the principal while having him under his pistol at the climax, according to being scared, yet he's so ready to kill his henchmen for not doing it (???!). Sure that exaggeration and contradiction weakened the conflict, and pushed the movie out of being believable.The last one-on-one sequence was more suitable for a Dirty Harry movie. And with an end like (Who do you think you are ?! \/ He's the principal *MAN* !), the action movie concludes nicely, but not the social commentary though. Unlike the endings of Dirty Harry's movies, where the long-shot and the lead walking sorry embody sadly declarations such as (the system doesn't work), this round the end with the lead riding his motorcycle, so proudly, after finishing the bad guys; must remind you more of the old westerns where the noble cowboy wins and struts over his strong horse heading to the sun.. and stuff like that. As you see; this is more refreshing happy end !On the other hand, aside from (Belushi) and (Gossett Jr.), there are some cool dialog (F**K YOU ! \/ They told me that you can't make a complete sentence here in Brandel !), and little fair action. Although the principal is another Blackboard Jungle's fighter mixed with the original cowboy, and its modern image; namely the 70s maverick cop, but the highest singularity this movie achieves isn't that mix inasmuch as showing that lead as someone who scares, gets confused, and feels helpless. So while John Wayne didn't use to ride motorcycles or fear of his enemies, you'll never see Dirty Harry drinking in a bar or reproaching an elevator's door for a failure he had either. That portion of human delicacy was a good different point. It did distinguish that hero and its movie to some extent.It carries out the message of being defiant instead of disappointed, in a way most of the thriller actions deal by. And in terms of having the message of meeting violence with violence in schools, it is less melancholic, more feel good than (187) 10 years later. Finally, some say that despite poor box office, (The Principal) managed by the years to turn into a cult classic. I believe it is a classic, however as an entertaining B flick, where the (dirty.. ) part ruled, and the (sir..) part \/ the problem of education, seemed like a cover or subplot.

It remains a classic, and to me, is more satisfying with each viewing. Perhaps it's because this may just be the most realistic movie about kids, friendship, and growing up I've ever seen. It's refreshing to know that they can make movies about young kids without portraying them as sex maniacs, criminals, or drug users.My Bodyguard is about a high school student, oddly named Clifford Peache (Chris Makepeace), who is encountering trouble at school. After unwisely insulting a school bully nicknamed Moody, (played wonderfully by Matt Dillon) he becomes a target. They want him to give them their lunch money, for protection. From who? From themselves, of course, but that's not what they say.. no, indeed. They tell him they're trying to protect him from a big, tough kid named Ricky Linderman (played by Adam Baldwin in his film debut).Clifford is somewhat small, he doesn't know how to fight, and he's not very intimidating, thus, he can't really defend himself. So, what he lacks in size, he more than makes up for in intelligence and cleverness. He decides that he wants to pay Ricky Linderman to be my bodyguard. This is where the movie really begins, and makes an excellent turn.Linderman is somewhat of an outcast and a loner at school, presumably because of his size, and some unkind rumors milling about the school. He has a reputation for being a psychopathic menace, but as it turns out, he's just a normal kid who experienced a tragic event. Clifford decides to get back at Moody with Linderman watching his back. Linderman is at first a little hesitant to accept Clifford's attempt at creating their friendship. Then, one day after Clifford is caught following his bodyguard home, their wonderful, unlikely friendship begins. The bonding sequence between these two unlikely companions is really satisfying to watch.Not only does Linderman help Cliff, Cliff helps Linderman. Linderman begins to open up, alleviate his shyness, and relate better to people. He begins to understand that there are friends out there, and we all need support. This character transition that Baldwin makes is extremely well-acted and very convincing. Clifford, we later learn, isn't the only one with tricks up his sleeve. Some scenes later in the movie, like Linderman getting pushed around by another tough kid, are a little difficult and painful to watch. The scenes about Cliff's grandmother (played by the wonderfully funny Ruth Gordon) and Martin Mull as his father trying to keep her under control in the bar of the hotel he manages, don't really go with the other scenes, and are almost like a film-within-a-film. That's easily forgiven and forgotten, though, because of the brilliance of the other parts, especially a great fight scene where everything comes together at the end. I haven't seen too many movies where I've liked the ending as much as this one.The most gratifying thing about this movie, is perhaps the lessons that can be learned. I loved the scene where Clifford discusses the rumors about Linderman with one of the teachers, who more or less implies that we should judge people and form our own opinions instead of listening to rumors and gossip. Clifford is wise enough not to listen to the rumors. It's nice to know that people can be friends, despite differences in their backgrounds, economic status, or social circles. It reminded me of a line from On Golden Pond spoken by Katherine Hepburn Sometimes you have to look hard at a person, and realize they're doing the best they can. My Bodyguard does exactly that.This is a very suitable film as well as great learning material for any teenager, teacher, or parent. The film is perfectly cast and the performances by the teenagers as well as the adults are fantastic. I liked the performance of Adam Baldwin the best, he starts out looking a little sloppy, scruffy, and primitive, but later goes through a transformation to a well-mannered, polite, affable, approachable young man. He is very convincing playing a kid who is tough, scared, sad, and angry at the same time.

I liked the performance of Adam Baldwin the best, he starts out looking a little sloppy, scruffy, and primitive, but later goes through a transformation to a well-mannered, polite, affable, approachable young man. He is very convincing playing a kid who is tough, scared, sad, and angry at the same time. To make a treasure and a classic movie like this about teenagers and high school was some kind of miracle, and wonderful.

One is an incredible set of stunts, involving both fire and water, that amaze beyond the pedestrian storyline. The other is Steve McQueen, proving here that while he may never have been the world's greatest actor, he was one of filmdom's finest action stars, playing the part of a fire chief with a winning world-weariness and absence of ego.

Fred Astaire shrugs and grins his way to one of the oddest Oscar-nominated performances as an aging conman, while Robert Vaughn is parceled off a couple of lines as the film's biggest-name extra.

Newman was great with antiheroes.There can really be only one hero in a film like this one McQueen.

They paid McQueen an obscene amount of money to be in this film. He was worth every penny.

But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been.

Ahh, this is something only the audience born before the 1990s knows well, suffered from and laughs about. With CDs and else more advanced devises now, plus teen comedies that have become all about obscenity, you must think; does more development mean more degeneration ? or when things grow less complicated, other things grow more ugly ?Anyway, this is a teen comedy and decent classic. Now the 4 words don't meet together in one sentence at all !

Seagal has come back again to bloody the silver screen with another actioner Marked for Death. This time, it's bloodier, more violent and less complex than Above the Law and for action fans with a short attention span that is always a good thing. Not that there isn't a story, but it's very by the numbers that you have probably have seen it before and for that, Seagal and Director Dwight H. Little(Rapid Fire, Phantom of the Opera) more than make up for it through a hail of bullets and a plethora of broken limbs.Seagal plays a retired DEA agent who decides to quit the job when his last drug bust ended violently with his partner being gunned down by a topless prostitute. Anyway Seagal decides to return to his quiet neighborhood life. But since this is a Seagal movie, we know his longings for personal peace would be in vain. Jamaican gangs (led by a Voodoo magician\/drug lord named Screwface) in the neighborhood are dealing dope in the neighborhood and are having a messy turf war with the local Italian gang. Seagal gets involved&#x85; gets marked for death and then proceeds to systematically wipe them all out.Like what I have said earlier, the story is nothing special. Sure, it's spiced up with elements of Voodoo from time to time, but in the final analysis, we know that Seagal can't be harmed by any stinking black magic. In fact, one can't help sometimes but feel pity for the Jamaicans and all assorted filth in this movie as Seagal uses them to showcase his exciting (and very painful to watch) bone snapping\/breaking moves. The films violence is definitely what sorts this Seagal movie from the other bunch. Like Under Siege and Out for Justice, Seagal takes normal B-movie action to unprecedented heights. While the shootouts come off as typical and maybe uninspired, the scenes of hand to hand combat are violently thrilling and have an undeniably cathartic feeling to it. Every time Seagal twists and breaks a Jamaican creep's limb, something inside you cheers and tells you that they deserved it for all the moral degradation they have brought to the community. Anyway, we are also presented with scenes that highlight Seagal's real-life prowess in Kendo (and the corresponding ineptness of his enemies).The technical aspects of the movie are also well done, with the production design and the music perfectly capturing the seedy environment of the Jamaica underworld. The acting is mostly OK, but the strongest performance in the movie doesn't come from any of the protagonists, coming instead from leading bad guy Screwface (Basil Wallace). His performance came off as menacing and threatening. Seagal gives another one of his so-so performances, this time less ambitious and charismatic than his acting in Above the Law. The pacing of the film is also great, but one thing that bothers me is the group of the scenes between Seagal and Joanna Pacula. They are supposed to add to the symbolic theme of the film but since all of that is sacrificed for bloody action, these scenes are empty fillers and do not even add cheap thrills. But then let's remember, this is a Seagal movie and the plot is always secondary to the action. Also watch out for the great song by Steven Seagal and Jimmy Cliff John Crow. It is a great and relaxing song that should tide you over after witnessing all the acts of bloodshed on screen. Seagal might not be the best actor in the world (he will NEVER be) but his vocals are amazing. Overall a great Seagal movie!

I watched this film with constantly fascinated eyes, admiring first the unsung heroes of the conquest of space, those who made the thing thinkable  test pilots. Interestingly, there's a first feel that would belong more to the Conquest of the West than Space. Even those pilots act like modern cowboys, trying to domesticate a savage beast made of air, physical laws, and high probabilities of death, with no other glory than a photography on the wall of the local town's bar, a beast called 'sound barrier', aka Mach 1, a cooler sounding name.And ones' deaths were others' inspirations until history chose Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepard), the central character as the winner of Mach 1. When he finally 'pierces the sky', we are plunged into another dimension. The visions are so dazzling we understand that Yeager's motive is a quest of the unknown, as an admirable refusal of being trapped into a disabling human condition. Ego is not the motive, but still, he was the pioneer who paved the way to a series of individual performances that outdated Mach 1 first, then Mach 2.It's like The Right Stuff followed the rhythm of history. Now, it's time for the newcomers, among them, the young and cocky Gordon Cooper (Dennis Quaid) whose private joke with his wife is to ask her who the greatest pilot she ever saw is, a joke saying a lot about the pride inhabiting these men's hearts. But the film less denounces the ego than glorifies it as one men's greatest virtues  courage, at a time where kids still dreamed of being pilots, or fire fighters, of conquering the stars instead of being ones. And the movie also provides a nice touch by showing these men as little boys from their wives' point of view, wives whose courage was to live with the idea of becoming widows at any day.And one day, a curious little bird named 'Sputnik' started to tweet around the Earth, inspiring one of the funniest scenes I didn't expect from a drama, featuring the President Eisenhower, a priceless Johnson, a German scientist, and two recruiters creating an improbable and hilarious duo with Jeff Goldblum and Harry Shearer. Beyond the comic relief element and a deliberate intention to keep the movie in an enjoyable mood, this shows how America was still very late on the space program department. The screening of the possible astronauts with acrobats footage was hilarious, not to mention the series of rocket test failures with the last little one as the icing of the cake.But the Americans got one thing right, dominating the world is dominating its environment, and space was to men what the Mediterranean Sea was to Romans, is it a hazard that the program following the 'sputnik' episode was named Mercury ? The Mercury program is the core of the movie, seven men -another magic- are recruited, among them, the clean-cut John Glenn (Ed Harris) and the scene-stealing Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn). And this time, the country needed heroes, faces, models... and they got the casting goddamn right.The general mood was friendly and cheerful, punctuated with some thrilling and intense parts. Among them, the hatch blowing incident with Gus Grissom (Fred Ward) followed by his poignant breakdown after his wife's egoistical comments. Another touching moment was Glenn's solidarity with his stuttering wife who didn't want to meet the President. More than pilots, they were also husbands, ordinary men for extraordinary missions. And as Yeager pointed out to a skeptical fellow, you can send an ape to space, he doesn't know he can die. The pilots form a group whose solidarity is the element that would drive their force, a force symbolized by the iconic walking in astronauts' suits in slow motion.But again, they're beaten by a certain Gagarin guy. The depiction of the Russians is more of a running gag, but it's also the pivotal point before the final act, simply epic.

Chuck's dreams was not fame, but personal accomplishment, and he had a last word to say, a last exploit which almost cost his life, flying so high until he could perceive the stars ... the best encouragement to transcend our limits.Conti's score deeply touched my heart, especially the final part with the violins, like The Right Stuff Final Bell.

Detectives Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega launch an investigation given that Richards's mother, Theresa Russell, is filthy rich and not taking this lying down so to speak. Dillon's reputation is further besmirched when another student - poor white trash Neve Campbell comes forward to also claim sexual assault. Did Dillon really do it or is this some bizarre revenge plot playing out? Trash can be incredibly fun if it is made right or incredibly boring and laughable if made badly. Making great trash is very tricky. Wild Things is great trash and I mean that as a compliment. It knows it is trash, it does not have any aspirations to be anything better than what it is and it revels in the fact that it is trash. Director John McNaughton does not miss any chances to play up the sultry Florida heat or intersperse his scenes with knowing clips of gators cruising the waterways, likening them to the various predators cruising the screen.Other than McNaughton's assured direction, there are a gaggle of other aspects to the film that click in just the right way so that the viewer is in on the fun and games as they unfurl. The screenplay is surprisingly inventive and tight. The sexual assault angle and subsequent courtroom mayhem are only the starting point for a rather complex plot. The film twists and turns with characters double-, triple- and occasionally quadruple-crossing each other. There are so many surprises that they keep coming even after the credits have started to roll.It also helps that the film is so unabashedly sexual, even with two leads known at that time for avoiding excessive skin. Richards is a limited actress - and I use that last term advisedly - but the film truly knows how to utilize her. Showing up at the start at Dillon's house for a charity car wash she looks like a walking porn movie. The film progresses to include a titillating threesome, a lesbian flirtation between Campbell and Richards and the now legendary shower scene where Kevin Bacon...well, shows his impressive bacon.The rock solid cast also helps matters and they seem to be having a blast. They pretty much play everything straight rather than tongue in cheek, which keeps the audience guessing and entertained. Dillon walks a fine tightrope as a guy who may just be too good to be true. Bacon provides just the right touch of world-weariness as one of the investigating officers with just a flourish of sleaze to keep the audience wondering about his own motives. Campbell probably has the most difficult contribution. She needs to be sexy without being overt, enigmatic, vulnerable and yet convey a certain degree of intelligence to guide the audience through some of the twists. To her credit, the viewer rides along freely and only after the film concludes does one realize how improbable some of her character's motivations are. Richards is undoubtedly the weakest link in the cast, but her sexpot looks, sledgehammer delivery and broad acting actually serve her character here well. The supporting cast is littered with a surprising array of familiar faces, all looking like they are enjoying themselves. Russell as the rich mother, Oscar nominee Carrie Snodgress as Campbell's mother, Robert Wagner as a rich friend and Bill Murray as a shady attorney all have moments to shine and plot points to contribute.Ironically, I think this may well have been the last successful potboiler that Hollywood has provided, as I am hard-pressed to remember a more recent successful example.

Dillon's reputation is further besmirched when another student - poor white trash Neve Campbell comes forward to also claim sexual assault. Did Dillon really do it or is this some bizarre revenge plot playing out? Trash can be incredibly fun if it is made right or incredibly boring and laughable if made badly. Making great trash is very tricky. Wild Things is great trash and I mean that as a compliment. It knows it is trash, it does not have any aspirations to be anything better than what it is and it revels in the fact that it is trash. Director John McNaughton does not miss any chances to play up the sultry Florida heat or intersperse his scenes with knowing clips of gators cruising the waterways, likening them to the various predators cruising the screen.Other than McNaughton's assured direction, there are a gaggle of other aspects to the film that click in just the right way so that the viewer is in on the fun and games as they unfurl. The screenplay is surprisingly inventive and tight. The sexual assault angle and subsequent courtroom mayhem are only the starting point for a rather complex plot. The film twists and turns with characters double-, triple- and occasionally quadruple-crossing each other. There are so many surprises that they keep coming even after the credits have started to roll.It also helps that the film is so unabashedly sexual, even with two leads known at that time for avoiding excessive skin. Richards is a limited actress - and I use that last term advisedly - but the film truly knows how to utilize her. Showing up at the start at Dillon's house for a charity car wash she looks like a walking porn movie. The film progresses to include a titillating threesome, a lesbian flirtation between Campbell and Richards and the now legendary shower scene where Kevin Bacon...well, shows his impressive bacon.The rock solid cast also helps matters and they seem to be having a blast. They pretty much play everything straight rather than tongue in cheek, which keeps the audience guessing and entertained. Dillon walks a fine tightrope as a guy who may just be too good to be true. Bacon provides just the right touch of world-weariness as one of the investigating officers with just a flourish of sleaze to keep the audience wondering about his own motives. Campbell probably has the most difficult contribution. She needs to be sexy without being overt, enigmatic, vulnerable and yet convey a certain degree of intelligence to guide the audience through some of the twists. To her credit, the viewer rides along freely and only after the film concludes does one realize how improbable some of her character's motivations are. Richards is undoubtedly the weakest link in the cast, but her sexpot looks, sledgehammer delivery and broad acting actually serve her character here well. The supporting cast is littered with a surprising array of familiar faces, all looking like they are enjoying themselves. Russell as the rich mother, Oscar nominee Carrie Snodgress as Campbell's mother, Robert Wagner as a rich friend and Bill Murray as a shady attorney all have moments to shine and plot points to contribute.Ironically, I think this may well have been the last successful potboiler that Hollywood has provided, as I am hard-pressed to remember a more recent successful example.

It takes 20 minutes for the movie to begin, which for those raised on IM, Twitter and MTV will seem like an eternity in hell. Star Trek isn't Star Wars, it is the heir to 2001, A Space Odyssey, which was also super slow-mo. When this movie came out, before DVDs or home VCRs, sitting in a movie theater, having waited close to 15 years for Star Trek to return, it delivered. Now, viewed on a TV or computer monitor, by those who may have already seen the sequel TV shows, with special effects far superior to this movie, it does not deliver.But there is still a reason to watch this the music by Jerry Goldsmith. Sure the movie is slow, especially the opening, but it provides a magnificent canvas for Goldsmith, who takes the visuals, the plot, the emotions, and magically transforms this into music. I doubt Beethoven or Mozart could have done any better. He uses mostly acoustic instruments, except to represent the alien vessel. Goldsmith does a brilliant job of bringing the music to the forefront with strong melodies when the action is slow, and going more abstract to avoid distracting from the action. That, if you are a music lover, is the time to listen to the music! Goldsmith could easily have been one of the great classical composers of the 20th century, but he chose this medium. The amazing thing about Goldsmith is he never repeats himself from one movie to the next. There are no borrowed motifs or styles; each movie is unique. The exception would be the Star Trek series, of course, where the theme is carried over. Goldsmith was simply the greatest film composer of all times, and one of the finest composers, period.Robert Wise is no slouch as director, either. Take a look at his credits, which include the original The Day the Earth Stood Still sci-fi masterpiece, not to mention The Sound of Music. This could have been a disaster; look at what happened to Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy when they tried turning it into a movie. But it wasn't; Wise fully understood the concept behind the original TV series sci-fi as spiritual speculation and morality tale. He improved on it, gave the chintzy TV series majesty and class that kept the franchise going. The joy of watching old movies is that it transports you to another era, even an era before you were born. You need to use your imagination and your historical understanding of that period to appreciate the film. Strangely, this movie, even though about the future, is old by many viewers' standards. Its real roots are in the 60s TV series, which I watched on air. As a little boy I read tons of sci-fi books about space travel written before we ever sent a man into orbit. I still remember the illustrations of finned rocket ships sitting upright on the Moon or an alien world. I was naturally disappointed by the ugly duckling Lunar Module that did actually land on the Moon and take off again. Those books were the historical context of Star Trek TOS. Star Trek TOS aired when the Gemini two-astronaut capsules were cutting edge, when network television via satellite relay was still a rarity. It was about the future, a better, more idealistic future of world cooperation. The Motion Picture, while continuing that idealism, was also a futuristic retro look at the good old days of space exploration, hence V Ger. Yes, the story line is a bit thin, especially if you know the ending. But when audiences watched it in the theater for the first time, it didn't seem thin, or slow, at all, and the ending was a kick in the butt! And part of the shock was the realization that maybe we shouldn't be trying to contact alien civilizations on distant galaxies -- maybe we weren't ready for the consequences, which could come back to haunt us!Sci-Fi movies about space travel were scarce back then, except for the kiddie Star War adventures, designed to market toys to kids.

Just looking at the list of great actors that starred in this movie should be enough for any serious movie fanatic to become giddy with excitement, and rightly so.First of all, Peter Weller gives a stunning performance as the main character Buckaroo Banzai, an archetypical Renaissance Man whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. A neurosurgeon, musician, quantumphysicist, and real-time action hero all rolled into one, he delves into the unfolding adventure in such a fearless manner that it makes our usual Rambo, Indiana Jones, or even James Bond characters that we are so used to watching seem wet behind the ears. Joining our main character there are the incredible performances of wellknown names such as Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, and Christopher Lloyd to name but a few.This in-your-face line up of top class actors gives the viewer the setup for a incredibly entertaining movie in which the action and comedy never seems to stop, never ceases to be interesting and more importantly remains plausible. Because apart from it being great entertainment, it also provides a very real message that for its day, was years ahead of its time. The quantumphysical theme throughout the whole movie (I doubt whether the term 'quantumphysical' even existed back then) will carry on teasing the eager mind and will keep you thinking for a long time. Could it be possible that this movie provided the inspiration for other box office science fiction hits such as Back to the Future or even Clive Barker's Hellraiser? Same goes for the interdimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times. But this science fiction\/action\/adventure movie does it in a way that grabs a hold of you and has no intention of letting you go for the rest of it's enjoyable ride. And neither do you want it to.I can somewhat relate to the criticism concerning the costumes and special effects. However, considering the cheap and simplistic costumes paired with the (sometimes) incredible popularity of a series such as Star Trek for instance, I truly believe the real science fiction lover will look beyond this and appreciate the overall atmosphere of the movie. Humanoid aliens may perhaps be a little less exciting than the CGI monsters in movies such as the Alien trilogy but hey, in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension this just plainly isn't the case. We're dealing with Lectoids. And in this case, it's as real and exciting as it gets.Comedy lovers also get their fair share of laughs, as this movie is laden with the craziest situations and jammed with drywitted oneliners. All in all this is a very underrated movie that will never get old. Definitely a classic that everyone should watch at least twice.

But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980. *** out of **** ","genre":"Drama, Music"},{"date":"16 May 2011","score":"","review":" This is the most harrowing movie I have ever seen. It is the tale of a mother and daughter, more specifically it is perhaps the first and final time the daughter confronts her mother. Liv Ullmann surpasses her performances in Face to Face and Persona to give what I believe to be her best performance. Ingrid Bergman also does a commendable job.The characters are very carefully etched. Even before the confrontation begins I could sense the change is Liv Ullmann when she is in presence of her mother. I could see in her a 12 year old kid desperate for her mother's approval without being told so explicitly. And mostly I remember her distraught face when she watches her mother play. Having already watched her in 5 other Bergman movies, I thought I knew her expressions. But that face will probably trouble me in the night when I try to sleep for a few days.Whenever I watched Ingrid rebuke Liv, I could see in my mind as if she was kicking her daughter in her gut. Watching this movie made me so thankful that I didn't had a parent like that and appreciate them much more.Another masterpiece by Bergman with some of the best performances I have ever seen.

Crumb's work, finding it unpleasant and ugly, but I heard the documentary was good and it certainly is. This is a fascinating portrayal not just of the highly eccentric Crumb but also of his even more off-kilter brothers. They are a very messed up family, so messed up that their upbringing was probably even worse than it is described in the movie.The film works in a number of ways. It does a good job of exploring Crumb's artwork, where it came from and how he approaches it (even though it's mainly about the personal we do see some of his craftsmanship as well. It shows how his comics generate extreme reactions, most notably in the opposing reactions of a pretentious English guy who talks about Crumb as a great artist and a painfully politically correct woman who says he legitimizes horrible fantasies by expressing them.But more than anything, this is a movie that reveals the Crumb's disturbing personalities and dismal lives. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about it is how casually they discuss themselves, laughing boisterously as they talk about their odd sexuality and abusive father.It's a rather downbeat documentary but well worth watching.

I just want to say two things about this film.The first thing is that the subject has particular relevance today, 75 years after the movie was issued. Near the beginning of the film, a character jokes that Prosperity is just around the corner. Another character wants to know which corner. So much for setting the tone. It seems that the problems so elegantly addressed in the script - social and fiscal, by such an elegant cast - are still some of the most pressing problems of today. Where are the gifted creative team members to bring the message to modern audiences?My second point is that, although I've seen this movie several times, each viewing makes me think of it less as a comedy, let alone a screwball comedy, and more as a powerful film with a very serious tone. I realize that Godfrey really is grateful to the Bullock family and his farewell is far more than a clever way to move the action along to the final scene. Did I say less comedic? All of this simply makes the comedy more delicious and the film more satisfying.

I found David DeCoteau's sequel somewhat a step-down in quality (which at times looked very second-rate), but probably a little more enjoyable if a tad creative in its story (despite a silly script, unintentionally humorous plotting and an abrupt ending). While still being one of the weakest, it skipped that childish feel of the recent ventures&#x85; to only deliver on the nasty and gory quota with its nightmarish details (resembling the tone of the original features), but while the jolts and cruelty is there it seemed to meander on its characters interactions and the constant mystery surrounding a disappearance, which is rather predictable to figure out. The puppets have always been the stars and that's nothing new here, as the creations are well-used despite some obvious stock footage from other features. The uncanny appearances and personalities come through, although some are underused; The Jester and especially Leech woman. However there are plenty of images of the puppets cementing how they are best of pals. DeCoteau's practical direction is raw and threadbare, but there's a lyrical guidance that shows in some atmospheric visuals. Most of the performances are particularly lousy and over-enthusiastic, but Emily Harrison seems to be an exception to the trend.
