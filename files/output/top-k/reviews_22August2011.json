Though tirelessly dedicating her hours to listing for meaning in the static of space blips, Foster takes time out for a sexual encounter when she meets handsome wavy-haired Matthew McConaughey (as Palmer Joss). Opposites attract as Mr. McConaughey is a deeply religious man. They want to mate some more, but Foster moves on when her SETI funding source is threatened...Sometime Robert Zemeckis doesn't seem like he was in Carl Sagan's Contact book...So, Foster leaves McConaughey's telephone number behind, after she packs. We see her place McConaughey's number by the telephone next to the bed where they played hide the telescope. The reason for this scene is unexplained, so we'll just have to assume McConaughey's number is being left for the next occupant. Or, maybe the cleaning person. Apparently, Foster's suitcases are jammed, and\/or she's one of those people who don't like putting anything in her pockets. Really, she couldn't possibly have disposed of the paper any other way, because we need to play up this romance and widen the audience...Also regrettable is the film's muddying of the science versus religion waters...Anything more on that subject could affect your viewing pleasure. Getting beyond the criticism (and physics improbabilities), you still get an exciting adventure. Foster offers up another strong characterization; amazingly, she has acquired an alien receptive look. The special effects are outstanding, and enough of Mr. Sagan's spacey thoughtfulness remains. The use of real people (Bill Clinton, Larry King) is interesting and may someday lose the datedness; until then, Rob Lowe is a hilarious stand in for Ralph Reed.

Considering the greatness of the original film they must have really screwed up the recipe for this barely watchable sequel and there are some glaring fatal flaws that made this one simply bad. First of all if they couldn't get Nancy (Heathen Langenkamp) to come back they should have waited until they could. This film barely ties into the first film and they really have to try hard to tie that into together but using Nancy's diary from 'five years' earlier. Second of all...where in the hades was Freddy? Freddy Kreuger, the legendary killer, the focus of all these films is hardly in this movie. He spends the whole time terrorizing and possessing the main character that you hardly every see Englund in his classic role. In the entire movie Englund's Freddy is in thirteen minutes of it?!?! That is a terrible decision on the film makers part. Thirdly they completely eliminated the haunting melody of the Nightmare On Elm Street theme that was used in every single other instalment. So instead of the horror film we all love we get to watch a sub-par over actor run around whining and screams for 80+ minutes.God bless Mark Patton for not carrying on his acting career too far after this. Patton plays Jesse the possessed youngster who apparently is only a target because he lives in Nancy's room. He has the body, Freddy has the brain as he says in one of the only memorable moments in the film. Patton takes emotions to new levels but not in a good way. He cries and screams and whines and its overwhelming and you want to slap him. Premiering in this film is Kim Myers as Patton's girlfriend. She looks so dazed through the whole film and has very little personality and chemistry with Patton whatsoever. Robert Rusler is at least a little better as the cocky future victim Grady. Rusler should have been given more time on screen and also the lead role because I think he would have done better. Sadly I can't even comment on Robert Englund's performance as Freddy because his role is barely a cameo and yet the entire film is supposed to be about him? I can't say he was good or bad because he just wasn't even important in this and that's sad and stupid.Wes Craven outright refused to come back for this and that's a shame because maybe he could have saved it. Then again it bodes well for future instalments that they did the worst one right off the bat. Jack Sholder wasn't a stranger to horror so I guess we have to blame someone else. I mean he could only do so much with the script. Now the reason I am giving this film some sort of redeemable score is because there are still some really solid special effects in the film that I think A Nightmare On Elm Street series should be applauded for because they often did it on low budget and minimal CGI unlike nowadays. There is still some pretty gruesome kills but its also completely twisted to have the main character and 'hero' also essentially be the killer. If you're a fan of the series or if you're just determined to watch them all then you have to watch this. If anything it'll make you look more highly on future instalments.

I am in awe at practically everything about this movie. The story is indelible -- a chase across the wild Civil War laden frontier for a supposed $200,000 of stolen Confederate gold buried in a cemetery somewhere. All sorts of gunshots fired, men fallen, twists and turns of faith within the plot -- you never know what to expect next. The relationship between Blondie (Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) is so ambivalent that it's entertaining. Each strands the other in the middle of a vast desert, each has opportunities to kill the other. But ultimately they team up with the common goal of acquiring great riches - - though you never know when someone may turn on the other.The acting is done perfectly. Eastwood plays Blondie to be the quintessential bad-ass, the man we all wish we could be, who's got no fear to kill but ultimately has good intentions. Then Wallach portrays Tuco as The Ugly, which is convincingly done as Tuco is preoccupied with material objects rather than things like faith and friendship. He rushes Blondie to recovery only when Blondie's survival is mandatory to find Bill Carson's hidden gold. Tuco conceals his sins (which include greed, lust, wrath, drinking, etc.) with constant prayer and reference to the Lord. I find this to be especially intriguing. It echoes the real world phenomenon where the most religious people are often the ones who are most befallen by vice. Tuco wants to believe that he's as worthy as his brother (who is leading an actual Catholic mission), but is committed to doing whatever it takes to satisfy himself, at no matter what cost.On that note, I find it amusing analyzing the difference between The Ugly and The Bad (which was spectacularly portrayed by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef)). At first thought, both titles seem negative, but that doesn't mean they are identical. In fact, it doesn't even mean that both are the exact opposite of The Good. While Angel Eyes may be characterized by greed, and finds it acceptable to physically assault prisoners of war and anyone that stands in his way, he is markedly more intelligent and more self-respecting and resourceful than Tuco. At the Yankee prison, Angel Eyes doesn't even bother beating Blondie to get information on the location of the gold, figuring that he's smart enough to know that talking won't save (him), this just after he tortured Tuco, who succumbed. Angel Eyes clearly views Blondie as a more capable traveling companion. In other words The Bad has a sharp eye for detecting and appreciating the assets of The Good, whereas The Ugly doesn't have much keenness of any kind, only seeking to serve himself through sensual pleasures. Also at the end of the movie, just before the final showdown, Angel Eyes seems to understand the sporting nature of Blondie's wish to duel for the rock at the cemetery's center (which supposedly bears the name of the grave where the money is), while Tuco seems to merely be along for the ride, only accepting the challenge because of the possible reward. Note that The Bad's entertainment seems to normally arrive through mental means -- his battery of the prisoners allows him to assert dominance over them. He always sees the job through, showing resoluteness and conviction. Perhaps this indicates that The Bad is more similar to The Good than The Ugly is. While The Bad may utilize his assets of intelligence, strength, and persistence corruptly, at least he HAS them, like The Good and unlike The Ugly. The Ugly seemingly has no hope to ever become a respectable figure, as he hypocritically worships a god yet displays insolence towards real people and ideas that are worthy of reverence. This complements the idea that being good isn't only about possessing favorable traits and abilities, but also about cultivating them through good habits.There are too many epic scenes in this film to list them all here. There are the escapes of Tuco from the gallows after Blondie shoots the rope that holds him aloft. There's Tuco's surreptitious entry through Blondie's window at the inn, the bathtub gun-pull scene, the bombing of Branston Bridge. The fact that the captain witnesses the explosion of that damn bridge that he wanted so badly to see annihilated, while he lays wounded and just as he dies quietly upon the neighboring hill.....still gives me chills when I think about it.

Jimmy Conwa is the high roller, stuffing everyone's pockets with money, playing it cool until his neck is on the line. And Tommy, dear volatile Tommy, whose voice and actions steal the show, is an Italian fireball who is unpredictable. All expertly acted, these are the guys you wish you could be.

The picture is full of cinematic and literary references as Jorge Luis Borges , Raymond Chandler , and George Orwell , adding comic-book style . Like most of Godard's films, the performances and dialog in Alphaville were substantially improvised . Alphaville mingles the genres of Dystopian science fiction and film noir.

The legendary ones like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare On Elm Street are legendary for a reason. They spawn multiple sequels, they have a memorable killer, and in this case they have an amazing story. I think where A Nightmare On Elm Street stands out on its own is because Wes Craven is a truly outstanding writer and creator and he didn't just rest on blood and guts and slashing teenagers but actually put a story behind this killer, a very real story, that could be explored in future instalments and actually makes the killer seem that much more disturbing. Also you have this really brilliant idea of a killer that kills in your dreams. Anything goes in dreams...Wes Craven single handedly got rid of any concern about whether something is believable or not because this killer is in their dreams. The only reality in dreams is what's happening. A hot young cast, a great director and the birth of one of the most chilling killers in history...Freddy Kreuger makes this truly memorable, fun, chilling, disturbing and just plain fun all at once.I always joke that star and scream queen Heather Langenkamp always lives up to her name...the 'kamp' part of it because every performance she does is campy. But at the same time she's cute and down to earth and somehow you relate to her but some of her emotions and expressions are bordering on hilarious but it works because her Nancy is the legendary scream queen of Nightmare. Johnny Depp in his premier role is recognizable and certainly has a handsome quality to him. He doesn't particularly stand out but he does a decent job and the chemistry between him and Langenkamp (his love interest) is sort of minimal. Other teenie fodder for death includes Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia, both of which do a good job but again nothing that will stand out. Depp, Wyss and Garcia are better than your average Friday the 13th victims because I think Craven gives characters more depth. John Saxon is actually one of my favourite Nightmare characters as Nancy's Dad and the no-nonsense Sheriff who buried Freddy's remains after killing him. Saxon gives a great performance in the small screen time he has but he really does stand out as a seasoned actor. Oh yes and of course Freddy Kreuger...the legend is brought to life by a legend in his own right Robert Englund. Certainly no one knows Freddy better than Englund and he makes him come to life in all his sarcastic, twisted, gory glory.I mean what can I say about writer and director Wes Craven. The man is a horror master and was even when this was created. The Hills Have Eyes and The Last House On The Left already set a bar for gore and disgust so this was tame compared to those. He simply created an iconic character, gave life to the other characters and made us believe this could happen. His story is timeless and creepy and the special effects, especially given the budget, are terrifying eerie. A Nightmare On Elm Street set the bar for horror flicks after it. It is more than a slasher, and while I feel like as I'm watching them all (I am making my way through the entire Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th series) the sequels to this fell off far faster than Friday the 13th, there is still a lot of greatness to be found in the original classic horror flick A Nightmare On Elm Street. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 August 2011","score":"","review":" Slasher flicks are my favourite.

This landmark film was Tim Burton's Batman, with Michael Keaton as the troubled Bruce Wayne masquerading as the mysterious crime-fighter and Jack Nicholson as the iconic mad villain Joker. Regrettably, very little holds up well.The first major problem with this film is that the tone is all over the place. In several scenes it is almost impossible to understand what the filmmakers are trying to get across to the audience. Is it supposed to be scary, intimidating, funny or amazing? Another major problem is the casting and characterization of much of the supporting cast. Two small characters in particular, crooked cop Eckhardt and tireless reporter Alexander Knox, come across as so pointless and obnoxious that after awhile you wish they would just be killed off so we could focus on the real characters, specifically Bruce, Joker and the beautiful Vicki Vale.This brings us to another major problem the screenplay. The plot is less than memorable, consisting mainly of jumbled story-lines thrown together without creating a coherent overall arc. At some points in the film, you may wonder if the editing was done incorrectly as the film swings from one emotion to another. I still feel woozy from the experience. The final major problem I will bring up is the characterization of some of the key characters. The entire Gotham Police Dept. is so incredibly inept in this film it is a wonder how more Jokers do not pop up. Unlike Gary Oldman's hard-working but exhausted Gordon, this one is simply a foil to laugh at until Batman arrives to save the day.In short, this is very far from being the best Batman film, much less a great film at all. The tone could best be described as campy noir, a term I read in another review which I think sums it up best. The look and feel of the sets are fantastic; there is a real neo-noir atmosphere to Gotham City's physical attributes. However, there are countless problems with its most important inhabitants. Jack Palance is the most timid and unconvincing mobster I have ever seen, Keaton's Bruce Wayne is more boring than complex and brooding, Nicholson's Joker is funny but not menacing, and Kim Basinger is beautiful as Vicki Vale but still just a caricature for Batman and Joker to fight over. Essentially, this film is closer to the 1960s Adam West series than anything else. It is far superior to the amoral garbage Joel Schumacher was able to conjure up but in comparison to Nolan's realistic look, it is dumb, vapid and kind of silly.

This landmark film was Tim Burton's Batman, with Michael Keaton as the troubled Bruce Wayne masquerading as the mysterious crime-fighter and Jack Nicholson as the iconic mad villain Joker. Regrettably, very little holds up well.The first major problem with this film is that the tone is all over the place. In several scenes it is almost impossible to understand what the filmmakers are trying to get across to the audience. Is it supposed to be scary, intimidating, funny or amazing? Another major problem is the casting and characterization of much of the supporting cast. Two small characters in particular, crooked cop Eckhardt and tireless reporter Alexander Knox, come across as so pointless and obnoxious that after awhile you wish they would just be killed off so we could focus on the real characters, specifically Bruce, Joker and the beautiful Vicki Vale.This brings us to another major problem the screenplay. The plot is less than memorable, consisting mainly of jumbled story-lines thrown together without creating a coherent overall arc. At some points in the film, you may wonder if the editing was done incorrectly as the film swings from one emotion to another. I still feel woozy from the experience. The final major problem I will bring up is the characterization of some of the key characters. The entire Gotham Police Dept. is so incredibly inept in this film it is a wonder how more Jokers do not pop up. Unlike Gary Oldman's hard-working but exhausted Gordon, this one is simply a foil to laugh at until Batman arrives to save the day.In short, this is very far from being the best Batman film, much less a great film at all. The tone could best be described as campy noir, a term I read in another review which I think sums it up best. The look and feel of the sets are fantastic; there is a real neo-noir atmosphere to Gotham City's physical attributes. However, there are countless problems with its most important inhabitants. Jack Palance is the most timid and unconvincing mobster I have ever seen, Keaton's Bruce Wayne is more boring than complex and brooding, Nicholson's Joker is funny but not menacing, and Kim Basinger is beautiful as Vicki Vale but still just a caricature for Batman and Joker to fight over. Essentially, this film is closer to the 1960s Adam West series than anything else. It is far superior to the amoral garbage Joel Schumacher was able to conjure up but in comparison to Nolan's realistic look, it is dumb, vapid and kind of silly.

However, I wouldn't allot it quite that much praise. In my humble opinion, speaking that highly of this film would be giving it a little too much credit when it isn't that masterful of a film. It's good, but not that good. It's the story of Maximus, a valiant Roman soldier who is betrayed by his emperor and cast out of Rome, only to return and find his wife and son murdered. Having lost everything, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a man named Proximo who is assembling men to fight in Rome's epic gladiator games. Maximus takes this opportunity to return to Rome and enact his revenge on Commodus, the evil emperor who betrayed him. The film prides itself on being an epic scale action film, using it's flashy showmanship and it's enticing bloodlust to disguise some of its dullness and its weaknesses in many areas.This is a film I really wanted to like. I really thought I could fall in love with this film, and I thought I was during some of the epic fight scenes full of bloody disgusting action that thrills and horrifies to no end. But there's a certain dullness which saturates everything else about this film so that it doesn't quite reach the heights you are expecting it to. Basically, it is your average hero's journey with every necessary archetype standing out and moving about as you would expect. There are no surprises in this film when you really feel like there should be. This film's storyline isn't inherently bad, it just doesn't offer all that it could with a story as epic as Gladiator perceives itself to be. I found myself very bored at times and never fully being able to buy into what was going on. Maybe it was in the acting, maybe it was in the dialogue, I'm not sure. Maybe it was a combination of all the factors of this film that just left me wanting more and feeling like I had been cheated out of some great potential in the end.But what doesn't leave you feeling cheated are the fight scenes. They are explosive, graphic, shocking, and wildly entertaining. Ridley Scott shoots the film with his frenetic display of camera angles and quick edits that make every fight scene incredibly intense and almost too much fun. Honestly, everything that took place in the Colliseum I really enjoyed. And that's only appropriate for a film called Gladiator, right? However, everything else I wasn't all that fond of. The film strikes no emotional chords with me, despite being a well constructed story that, in theory, exceeds expectations. The execution isn't perfect but I still respect a good story, and that's what Gladiator has at its core. Everything that surrounds it is a different story, though. The film just lacks true prowess and integrity to live up to its epic expectations. If you just take it as is then it's still a good film, but it could have been so much more.I spent this entire film going back and forth between liking and disliking it. There were things I thoroughly enjoyed and thing that just left me feeling empty and careless. In so many moments I felt like I was really going to love this film in the end, but the excitement and intrigue over this film flatlines just below a level of greatness. Gladiator isn't the epic scale story of bravery and violence, but it tries very hard to be. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is a bad film, but I wouldn't give it enough mercy to call it a great film either.

It's good, but not that good. It's the story of Maximus, a valiant Roman soldier who is betrayed by his emperor and cast out of Rome, only to return and find his wife and son murdered. Having lost everything, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a man named Proximo who is assembling men to fight in Rome's epic gladiator games. Maximus takes this opportunity to return to Rome and enact his revenge on Commodus, the evil emperor who betrayed him. The film prides itself on being an epic scale action film, using it's flashy showmanship and it's enticing bloodlust to disguise some of its dullness and its weaknesses in many areas.This is a film I really wanted to like. I really thought I could fall in love with this film, and I thought I was during some of the epic fight scenes full of bloody disgusting action that thrills and horrifies to no end. But there's a certain dullness which saturates everything else about this film so that it doesn't quite reach the heights you are expecting it to. Basically, it is your average hero's journey with every necessary archetype standing out and moving about as you would expect. There are no surprises in this film when you really feel like there should be. This film's storyline isn't inherently bad, it just doesn't offer all that it could with a story as epic as Gladiator perceives itself to be. I found myself very bored at times and never fully being able to buy into what was going on. Maybe it was in the acting, maybe it was in the dialogue, I'm not sure. Maybe it was a combination of all the factors of this film that just left me wanting more and feeling like I had been cheated out of some great potential in the end.But what doesn't leave you feeling cheated are the fight scenes. They are explosive, graphic, shocking, and wildly entertaining. Ridley Scott shoots the film with his frenetic display of camera angles and quick edits that make every fight scene incredibly intense and almost too much fun. Honestly, everything that took place in the Colliseum I really enjoyed. And that's only appropriate for a film called Gladiator, right? However, everything else I wasn't all that fond of. The film strikes no emotional chords with me, despite being a well constructed story that, in theory, exceeds expectations. The execution isn't perfect but I still respect a good story, and that's what Gladiator has at its core. Everything that surrounds it is a different story, though. The film just lacks true prowess and integrity to live up to its epic expectations. If you just take it as is then it's still a good film, but it could have been so much more.I spent this entire film going back and forth between liking and disliking it. There were things I thoroughly enjoyed and thing that just left me feeling empty and careless. In so many moments I felt like I was really going to love this film in the end, but the excitement and intrigue over this film flatlines just below a level of greatness. Gladiator isn't the epic scale story of bravery and violence, but it tries very hard to be. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is a bad film, but I wouldn't give it enough mercy to call it a great film either.

In the opening scene, to establish his character, he is in Germany and notices some interesting encounters in the crowd during an Octoberfest celebration. As the Russian spy exits the venue, Kendig confronts him, explains that he has photos, and demands the microfilm spy photo cartridge, in return he will overlook his being there.But Ned Beatty as Myerson is the younger, ambitious, division chief back in Washington. He isn't happy that the Russian spy is let go. So he sentences Kendig to a desk job, a menial filing job, until his retirement. But Myerson has skeletons in his own closet.Kendig decides not to get mad, but to get even. He basically fails to report to work and after a few days they begin to wonder where he was. In fact he was in Salzburg, Austria, visiting his girlfriend, rich widow Glenda Jackson as Isobel. Kendig decides to write a tell-all book about the CIA and in particular about the few he wants revenge against. He copies and sends the first chapter to a number of places, including Moscow and Washington.So most of the movie is about slick, calm Kendig always staying one or two steps ahead of the CIA who are trying to hunt him down. At each new location in hiding he writes another chapter and mails it to all the same places.Good movie, good story, good characters.SPOILERS As the story is getting to its conclusion Kendig, also a pilot, buys an old plane outside London and tells one of the agents he will fly it to mainland Europe, because he knows all the normal exits from England are being monitored. They end up chasing him in a helicopter, and arrive over the cliffs of Dover. Then the airplane explodes over the water, Kendig is presumed dead. But we see that he was actually on land, flying by remote and had set off the explosives. At the very end we see him in a disguise, in a book store, his book Hopscotch is a best seller. He is with his girlfriend, whom he had given power of attorney before he disappeared, so they are set to live the good life.
