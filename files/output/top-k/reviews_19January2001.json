","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"19 January 2001","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" As proof positive that I attended this film and did so with an open mind, I even arrived on time and saw a delightful promo for Hannibal.  With one hand in the popcorn and the other on my cell phone, I eagerly awaited one of the most anticipated films of the year.  Such promise, and so easily thwarted. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee's meticulously crafted, odious tone poem, together with its Lawrence Welk-ish soundtrack, left me mortified. But before I get into the details, let me first thank Mr. Lee for challenging all of my romanticized assumptions about 19th century China.China, long open to outsiders like Bernardo Bertolucci who were unable to offer an authentic critique, has finally permitted one of its own to do just that.  Enter Ang Lee, attempting to set the record straight with his own brand of revisionist history as told through a cliché kung fu morality tale. As visually stunning as Crouching Tiger arguably is, one cannot help but notice Mr. Lee's overbearing reliance on cheap, gimmicky special effects and tediously over-choreographed swashbuckler sequences, of which there are far too many.  If this film has a point, it is buried under the weight of its snobbish nods to Shakespeare and Moliere.  Gone, apparently, are the days when a film could survive on its own merits rather than rely on the tiresome crutch of allusion and mimicry.  Yes, the film is dazzling and glitzy, but those attributes are no substitute for accuracy, authenticity, originality and grace.  Exactly how many sunsets and moonscapes can one cram into a two hour movie?  Just ask Ang Lee.Unlike past projects where Mr. Lee has proven himself to be an arguably competent director and storyteller, Crouching Tiger is a formidable and inaccurate mess.  It is no English Patient.  I have often been fascinated by Asia Minor, and China is no exception.  This film so completely whitewashes the Tienamen Square incident that perhaps Mr. Lee was unconsciously expressing a repressed love for the works of Leni Reifenstahl.  Seeing this movie, you wouldn't think that the Chinese ever ate rice, grew or smoked opium, or went to the bathroom.  You would think that self-censorship was a good thing.  You would want to run out and build hydroelectric dams to wipe out whatever beauty remains in Taiwan.  You would want to subsidize plastic surgery for the ugly, guns for the unstable, and showers for the homeless. But Crouching Tiger's artistic license does not end there.With the principal actors suspended from barely erased wires like marionettes, I half expected Fran, Kukla and Ollie to take up arms and battle the equally riveting Jade Fox.  Each character is a caricature; each misplaced and overwrought emotion a manipulative scam.  It is as if Mr. Lee dug a little too deeply into his emotional core, defiantly putting onscreen a half-hearted project that would have been much better left on stage at the local dinner theater.  Such audacity is unbecoming.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee's meticulously crafted, odious tone poem, together with its Lawrence Welk-ish soundtrack, left me mortified. But before I get into the details, let me first thank Mr. Lee for challenging all of my romanticized assumptions about 19th century China.China, long open to outsiders like Bernardo Bertolucci who were unable to offer an authentic critique, has finally permitted one of its own to do just that.  Enter Ang Lee, attempting to set the record straight with his own brand of revisionist history as told through a cliché kung fu morality tale. As visually stunning as Crouching Tiger arguably is, one cannot help but notice Mr. Lee's overbearing reliance on cheap, gimmicky special effects and tediously over-choreographed swashbuckler sequences, of which there are far too many.  If this film has a point, it is buried under the weight of its snobbish nods to Shakespeare and Moliere.  Gone, apparently, are the days when a film could survive on its own merits rather than rely on the tiresome crutch of allusion and mimicry.  Yes, the film is dazzling and glitzy, but those attributes are no substitute for accuracy, authenticity, originality and grace.  Exactly how many sunsets and moonscapes can one cram into a two hour movie?  Just ask Ang Lee.Unlike past projects where Mr. Lee has proven himself to be an arguably competent director and storyteller, Crouching Tiger is a formidable and inaccurate mess.  It is no English Patient.  I have often been fascinated by Asia Minor, and China is no exception.  This film so completely whitewashes the Tienamen Square incident that perhaps Mr. Lee was unconsciously expressing a repressed love for the works of Leni Reifenstahl.  Seeing this movie, you wouldn't think that the Chinese ever ate rice, grew or smoked opium, or went to the bathroom.  You would think that self-censorship was a good thing.  You would want to run out and build hydroelectric dams to wipe out whatever beauty remains in Taiwan.  You would want to subsidize plastic surgery for the ugly, guns for the unstable, and showers for the homeless. But Crouching Tiger's artistic license does not end there.With the principal actors suspended from barely erased wires like marionettes, I half expected Fran, Kukla and Ollie to take up arms and battle the equally riveting Jade Fox.  Each character is a caricature; each misplaced and overwrought emotion a manipulative scam.  It is as if Mr. Lee dug a little too deeply into his emotional core, defiantly putting onscreen a half-hearted project that would have been much better left on stage at the local dinner theater.

And they take her on many painful misadventures; from her initial run-in with a troupe of dancing frogs, to a swinging dancing hall of bugs led by a beetle voiced by Gilbert Gottfried (perhaps a tongue-in-cheek reference or homage to Tex Avery), to a buttinski fieldmouse who would rather have Thumbelina marry a blind mole instead of the fairy prince of her dreams.  Oh yes, and each disaster or rescue is accompanied by a musical number, one that is invariably mind numbing and\/or insipid.

And they take her on many painful misadventures; from her initial run-in with a troupe of dancing frogs, to a swinging dancing hall of bugs led by a beetle voiced by Gilbert Gottfried (perhaps a tongue-in-cheek reference or homage to Tex Avery), to a buttinski fieldmouse who would rather have Thumbelina marry a blind mole instead of the fairy prince of her dreams.  Oh yes, and each disaster or rescue is accompanied by a musical number, one that is invariably mind numbing and\/or insipid.  The fieldmouse's Marry the Mole song (done by Carol Channing in a typically annoying drone), unnerved me the most since it demonstrated that the songwriters know extremely little about Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet\/were very much in love when they were wed), among other things.Combine that with a multitude of annoying characters (the fieldmouse, the frog troupe, Jacquimo the pigeon narrator, the fieldmouse, the fairy prince, and did I mention the FIELDMOUSE?!) and the masochistic plot, and you have a movie that stands up well to Rocky Horror-esque heckling.  I mean, there is a certain sick pleasure in watching Thumbelina's spirit get repeatedly broken...As long as you have a high endurance rate for awful songs.

Spinal Tap has had its commercial and popularity ups-and-downs since the mid 1960s.  Although known as one of England's loudest heavy-metal bands, their catalogue actually includes a wide range of musical styles.  The 3 primary musicians include guitarist and lead vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist and auxillary vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and bass guitarist and background vocalist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer).David is a somewhat pompous, pseudo-intellectual who likes ruffles, velvet and satin stage attire and has a rather pushy New-Age girlfriend (Jeanine exerts a major cosmic influence on David's life and creates a wedge between him and childhood friend Nigel).  Nigel is a confused chain-smoking, gum-chewing, accomplished guitarist with strong juvenile tendencies, a love of kilts, and a knack for inane invention.  Derek prefers a studs-and-leather stage presence but is perhaps the most intelligent of the lot and assumes the role of realist and peacemaker.Filmmaker and fan Martin DiBergi (Rob Reiner) accompanies them on this tour to create a documentary of the experience, but Spinal Tap will later accuse Marty of making a hatchet job by portraying them in an unfavorable and unflattering light.  Marty's film does tend to focus on the historic failings of the band, their apparent waning popularity, and the few(?) times on tour when they couldn't find the stage; had cancellations, production failures, embarrassments, and lapses in competence; bickered amongst themselves; acted like prima donnas; sported their cold sores; and couldn't meaningfully or coherently answer his interview questions.The film is almost entirely improvised from a skeletal plan.  The comedy is subtly and richly layered with humorous but realistic character portrayals\/development, malapropisms, double entendres, and numerous sight gags.  No laugh track needed or wanted here! These guys are not only brilliant improvisors, but they are also fine musicians capable of performing a serious-but-quirky, full-length concert (1993 Return of Spinal Tap concert\/comedy video).  They really have written and performed all the wonderful lyrics and arrangements by themselves.  Classics like Big Bottom and Sex Farm.REVIEWER CONTEXT  48-year-old female (a scientist and not in the entertainment or music business) who saw the movie for the first time (!) in October 2000 and who loves rock-and-roll (particularly the 1960s and 1970s British Invasion bands) but is not attuned to raucous heavy metal sounds or to outrageously gross personas.  Comedy preferences include the Monty Python features, the Pink Panther series, A Fish Called Wanda, The Birdcage, Best in Show, etc.  But, for me, THIS goes to Number 1 (for now anyway).Yes, it grows on you like an untreated fungus.  What I knew in advance of 1st viewing was just that it was supposed to be a funny satire of a heavy metal band done by actors.  Note that you probably will need several viewings (without interruption) to fully appreciate the humor and to become hooked, but you will love it more and get more out of it with each subsequent viewing.THE PRODUCT(S)  The new VHS tape adds 10 minutes of out-take footage, including the Bitch School music video.  The new DVD includes an audio overlay for the film itself (ad-libbed, in-character commentary (defense) by the 3 principle musicians), about 70 minutes of out-take footage (presented sequentially like the film), a DiBergi update, 4 music videos (excluding Bitch School), other promotional clips, film trailers, advertisements and interviews.  It caused me to buy a DVD player.There is also a 1993 VHS Return of Spinal Tap, which is a real London sell-out concert from July, 1992, interspersed (approximately every 3 songs) with comedy inserts and interviews; a 4.5 hour bootleg tape of the original movie; 2 real CDs (1984 soundtrack and 1992's Break Like the Wind); a recent book (Spinal Tap Companion by Karl French) with transcripts, lyrics, and other delights; and older materials (laserdiscs, CDRoms, DVDs, VHS) that are out-of-print.
