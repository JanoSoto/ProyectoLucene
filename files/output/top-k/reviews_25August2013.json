Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot.Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad! are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's Black Dynamite, wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else.It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. Powers depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied.After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man &#x96; the plot is essentially Demolition Man. Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm.Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to International Man of Mystery and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

Its a tragic tale about a shy girl called Carrie White who seems to get abuse and bullying by almost everyone she meets, her mother, classmates even annoying kids on bikes. Her mother is a religious nut case, therefore she has had no knowledge or understanding of the world and is left open to bullying from other kids due to the fact she is different. What no one knows is how different Carrie really is. She is already realising she can move things with her mind at the start of the movie, therefore its not dragged down with learning to use her 'powers' etc and instead concentrates on the story. For the story is not only about her ability, its an all too human tale of someone looking for acceptance, to be loved and its this that makes it so memorable. Its a very cruel movie for several reasons. First of all the bullying is quite nasty and humiliating, secondly then with help of one of the few sympathetic class mates Carrie gets her dream date for the prom (after initial scepticism) and during the prom she is genuinely happy for once in her life and these scenes are very touching. As a viewer we know its not going to end there however, we know the fall will come and DePalma expertly creates the ominous atmosphere before the bucket of blood comes crashing down all over her. What comes next is a split screen massacre as Carrie wipes out almost the entire Prom Night goers in a rage fuelled inferno. Carrie is a film that has that magic mix. DePalma's sure direction is excellent (even the quirky touches such as the fast forward work for me) Sissy Spacek, words are not enough to explain her shattering performance. It really is something. I've always been a fan of Pino Donnaggio and his work here is one, if not the best soundtrack he has ever done. Highly recommended.

That is the main theme that director, Roman Polanski, is trying to explore here in this criminal film noir thriller starring Jack Nicholson as a wise and overly confident private detective who is about to learn that despite how much he wants to teach the bad guys a lesson perhaps things are a little out of his league. That is why the film is titled Chinatown, because it represents a time in Jake's (Nicholson's character) life where he wasn't able to make a difference in the police force and became cynical towards the world. Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown is what they told him, and that is why he decided to retire and become a private investigator working on his own. He doesn't want to forget it, he wants to catch the bad guys and balance things out. He doesn't want these rich executives to continue thinking they can get away with anything. That is exactly why he decides to investigate things on his own and begins to enter dangerous territory where not everyone is who they say they are. He slowly begins to uncover one lie after another, and that is what makes Chinatown such an entertaining and masterful thriller. We are part of the investigation and begin discovering things at the same time Jake does. We are as confident as he is that he is going to uncover everything. This is Jack Nicholson's movie from the opening scene and he delivers one of his best performances to date. Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way.Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks.This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences.

Faye Dunaway is also interesting in her femme fatale role; we are never sure if we can trust her or not. Polanski has delivered a perfect homage to the 40's film noir thrillers. Chinatown will remain as one of the best classical films of all time. This is my favorite Polanski film, perfect in every way.Jake Gittes seems to be doing well as a private detective in Los Angeles, since he specializes in infidelities and there are many in the city. His latest assignment is to follow Evelyn Mulwray's (Diane Ladd) husband who happens to be the builder of the city's water supply system. His name is Hollis (Darrell Zwerling) and he is fascinated with everything that has to do with water, but Evelyn is convinced he is having an affair. Jake accepts the job and begins following Hollis, and surely enough he photographs him with a younger woman causing a scandal in the city. Jake believes his job is done, until a Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) comes thundering into his office claiming that she had never hired him to follow her husband. Apparently the first woman claiming to be Mrs. Mulwray was only an impersonator and now Jake has a law suit in his hands. Surprisingly Mrs. Mulwray drops the law suit a few days later, and her husband is found dead after an apparent suicide. Jake is now hired by Mrs. Mulwray to discover who might have wanted her husband dead, and soon Jake will find himself uncovering an entire web of deceit and corruption that is much bigger than he thinks.This masterful film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, but only won one (Best Original Screenplay written by Robert Towne) considering it had to compete in 1975 with another perfect film The Godfather Part II. One of the best things about Chinatown actually is the screenplay. There are so many great dialogues and quotes from this film that are still remembered today almost 40 years later. Chinatown is exactly what a classical film looks like. Polanski created a masterpiece by recreating the classic film noir from the 40's with great art direction, costume designs, and cinematography. The editing and the original score are also done wonderfully, but none of this would be enough if it weren't for the wonderful performances from Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Chinatown deserves all the praise it has received over time and it has really turned into a timeless classic and one of the few that continues to astonish modern audiences. The twists and surprises in Chinatown continue to work today. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"25 August 2013","score":"","review":" Well. Wow. Let me absorb this all for a moment. Alright. So that was... one of the best films I have seen in who knows how long. It is definitely on my all-time favorites list. Such an amazing film about film... but so, so much more. It is about friendships- the very best two people can share. The multitude of ways one person, one place, one passion can change your life for eternity; without which you would be a different person altogether. This film makes me want to experience the small town life that I never have, in any way before- to have so many people who know you so well; who grew up with you or watched you grow up; who can be proud of everything you have become; who love you in ways people who have not known you since you were a baby; A place where you can return decades later to find that everything has been the same after all these years, yet, at the same time, changed. This film inspires in me a love of films than span lifetime(s) in a way that very few others have. This film makes me think about so many things redemption, regret, love, hope, friendships, trust, appreciation; how clinging to the past can be such a rewardingly bad tendency, how so many things we have no power over are so blatantly unfair, how, in the name of love, the most difficult decisions are inevitable made. I would kill to have a friendship like Toto & 's. I am regrettably obligated to clarify that, however. Alfredo's decision regarding Toto & Elena made me so upset that... I didn't know whether I could like his character anymore. His decision and actions were out of place, mean, and wrong. In the end, though, I suppose I can only say I respect Alfredo less, as I know, in his heart, he wanted what he felt was best for Toto. I emphasize, what he felt. And that's my point exactly. Because it was not his place and therefore not his right to do what he did- his sincere care and love for Toto irrelevant in this case- although mitigating the severity of his wrong. I agree that in some ways what evolved was best for Toto- but for his career. And I am an adamant believer that love is always the No. One priority in these lives of ours. At the end of the day, financial woes, careers, daily nuisances aside, love is what matters at the end of the day; at the end of a lifetime. Toto shares this philosophy, as made obvious several times. Secondly, why in heaven's name didn't the two of them rekindle their rare, genuine love at the end? I understand that some things in life can become too late t retrieve, but, again, I agree with Toto- they should have resumed it. I know neither of them ever loved anyone else, vows or not, anywhere near as powerfully. And, despite what I may say, contrary to all logic, I wish for a love like Toto & Elena's. As the saying goes, It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. I understand that times were different then, but, perhaps unfairly, I am upset with Elena. For not choosing true love over her family's unreasonable demands (although she did redeem herself). For not agreeing to set things right at the end. The only other issue I have is with the plausibility of some specific details. First, falling in love without ever talking, at first sight? And then Elena reciprocating, but, almost even more unbelievably, only after watching him wait outside her place for a year? Secondly, Toto's devotion to waiting outside is as unbelievable as the soldier's to the princess. Men like that could and would not ever exist. I would have identified so much more had it been more realistic. Of course I remember you... Life is not what you see in films... Life is much harder. Amen to that. So extremely, heart-breakingly sadly. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 August 2013","score":"","review":" Well. Wow. Let me absorb this all for a moment. Alright.

She's a thorough professional, though seen as too cool by patients and peers alike. Her poise is shattered when she meets her new boss (Gregory Peck), who goes by the name of Dr. Edwardes. At once both suspicious and swept off her feet by this handsome stranger, Constance soon finds herself deep in a mystery that puts both her life and sanity at risk.Bergman's performance is easily the best thing in the film. She's at the peak of her acclaimed radiance yet quite human, too, alternately projecting aloofness, compassion, and sheer terror. This is one of Hitch's women's pictures, and one of his better ones, presenting us with a main character both strikingly independent and far from being in charge of her situation.Hitch and scripter Ben Hecht have some perverse fun with the romance between Constance and Edwardes, and Bergman is terrific playing along. Her big romantic scene with Peck ends with her saying but a single word, and what a word Liverwurst. Bergman almost glows as she sighs the line, which is what sells it as both comic and endearing. Here and throughout the film, Bergman is just so much fun to watch.A big problem for me is that she shares too many great moments with Gregory Peck, here at his most stiff and insufferable. Much of this is the product of a flawed script that requires him to drift off into a trance-like state any time there's a flash of white on-screen. Still, Peck's struggle to sell this makes for hard viewing. If you want an actor playing a shrink to render believable a line like We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass, and clouds without complexes, you need someone who had less starch in his collar than Peck had.Much of Spellbound feels a bit too on the nose as the story develops. The famous dream sequence designed by Salvador Dalí is interesting but entirely too literal in communicating plot points. The patients at Green Manors we briefly meet all speak out their phobias for instant analysis. (I hate men. I loathe them.) There are drawn-out exposition scenes; a rather superfluous voice-over bit that almost spoils an otherwise fantastic ending; and more of an obvious focus on symbolism from Hitch even without Dalí, such as a couple's first kiss being accompanied with an over-the-top image of multiple doors flying open.Constance's diagnosis of Edwardes problem feels pat even by doctrinaire Freudian terms, and the final cure, when it comes, is laughably simplistic. Did anyone really ever think amnesia was merely a trick of the mind for staying sane?At some level, though, you can't attack Spellbound for being dime- store Freud because the hooey sort of works in the context of the movie. Even if you agree with Rhonda Fleming's Mary character that this whole thing is ridiculous, you have to allow for psychiatry's magic efficacy in this film the same way you allow for Jedi mind tricks in Star Wars. Doing so has its payoff at the end, when another overly literal dream analysis session turns into a killer's standoff, precisely because of that silly Freud stuff.Hitchcock is masterful in his compositions here, and delivers a wonderful series of set-pieces. Bergman's great performance is wonderfully supported by Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov, and John Emery as my favorite character in the movie, Constance's dogged but unsuccessful suitor Dr. Fleurot, who memorably dubs her Miss Frozen Puss. Humor and suspense are kept in fresh supply, which helps a bit in swallowing the various, badly delivered Peck lines (Will you love me just as much when I'm normal? If there's anything I hate, it's a smug woman!)Most of all, it gives us a memorable central performance from Bergman, who makes us believe in what she's doing by the power of her character's dangerous commitment. I couldn't feel this way toward a man who is bad. Ultimately, you may disagree with Constance, but as played by Bergman you care enough about her to stick around to the end.

Before its release, the notion of a 'summer blockbuster' simply didn't exist. Then, this movie came along and became an unstoppable pop culture phenomenon, grossing a then-record $123 million dollars at the box office amidst a wave of critical praise.The story is a fairly simple one. In the sleepy island community of Amity, the normally placid waters are disturbed by an unwelcome visitor in the form of a deadly great white shark. The police chief immediately senses the danger but the town's mayor is reluctant to close the beaches just as tourist season is kicking into gear. When matters escalate the police chief takes it upon himself to recruit a grizzled fisherman to hunt down the dangerous predator.Since the producers wanted to make the shark the star of the picture they didn't go out of their way to cast any big names in leading roles. Instead, they went for talented actors best known for supporting or ensemble roles. To that end, they decided on Roy Scheider as police chief Brody, Robert Shaw as grizzled fisherman Quint and Richard Dreyfuss as shark expert Hooper. All three gave memorable performances, especially Robert Shaw, whose 'U.S.S. Indianapolis' speech is one of the movie's high points. Apart from these three, the acting is ably handled but fairly undistinguished except for Murray Hamilton as the fast-talking mayor.Spielberg's direction is superbly handled, yet he was unaccountably snubbed by Oscar voters. His handling of the film's suspense is so assured that I found the hairs standing up on the back of my neck when watching scenes that were already deeply embedded in my memory. The fact that the mechanical shark didn't work very well was actually serendipitous since it meant that Spielberg had to employ a 'less is more' approach that left more to the viewer's imagination.

Tarantino has a penchant for violence, as do many of the big name actors, like Jackson and Willis. But so does the human race. There's more to us and more to the film.The fact that it creates so many unanswered questions, the fact that I can watch it again and again and still see new things, even it's tie-ins to other QT movies all add up to a depth and complexity that uses violence and sex - it is not used by it.It's ironic that such a pulp\/pop film could do it, but we live in a world of strip malls where we pick up donuts, a world with pawnshops run by long-hairs with Reb flags, and a world of people with accents from faraway places.

Music is by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Haskell Wexler.1950s Los Angeles and four unorthodox detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) are called in to investigate the death of a young woman found crushed at a construction site. The woman is revealed to be an aspiring actress who had recently had a relationship with the married Hoover. Can is open, and worms everywhere, and following those worms leads Hoover down murky avenues...It's the almost nearly great neo-noir movie, everything looks right in principal, it has a strongly assembled cast, the 50s visuals and cinematography are splendid, and the murder mystery element of the plot - with some added sex, sizzle and nuclear shenanigans - looks promising on the page. Yet it never delivers on that promise of being something dark, to be a labyrinthine noir thriller beating a black heart.It starts of so well, based on the infamous Hat Squad we reasonably expect the story to expand upon the opening macho machinations of the four tough hombres in the hats, but instead away from Nolte's grizzled Hoover, the other three guys are merely dressed up props. Which means there's some good actors wasted, sadly.As the plot moves slowly forward the investigation and Hoover character axis becomes less interesting. Griffith came in for some critical grief for a lacklustre performance, but she's done no favours by the writers who fail to give her marriage to Hoover any substance. So when things go pear shaped and the characters of Mr and Mrs Hoover should explode on the screen, we really don't care having had no interest previously to hang our emotional being on.It all builds to what can best be described as a poor pay off, the resolution to the hinted at muddy mystery is hardly shocking, and the big face-off sequence between good and bad guys (or bad and bad if you prefer) is about as exciting as watching paint dry.

The Script is also a significant achievement weaving Pro and Anti War sentiments effortlessly. There are so many quotable lines...here is one...Compared to War, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificanceThat is a summation of Patton and the Movie does give a slightly Romantic vision of the most Controversial, Flamboyant, and Charismatic Military Leader of His Era. In contrast, Eisenhower barely had a Heartbeat and was dull and humorless.The Film is Framed and Shot entirely from Patton's point of view. The Battles are shown mostly in Wide Shots and the carnage is only glimpsed after the fact. The Deaths and suffering of the Soldiers underneath this self identified Demi-God are to Him like Players on a Stage or Pawns in a Game.

Indeed, STAGE FRIGHT does not occur to display any striking resemblance to more popular fantasy products by the Master of Suspense and, strangely enough, his famous hallmark, the MacGuffin, actually remains offstage. Carter B. Horsley rightly observed once that Hitchcock had a wickedly delicious sense of humor and was a master manipulator of his audiences with unexpected dramatics in spectacular locations. It seems that this line finds its clearest resemblance in this film which proves to balance the real with the stylized, occurs to transmute a melodrama into real life where, specifically, Hitchcock and old England are doing darn well...and...lots of our assumptions give way to the unique fantasy of linguistic and cinematic 'manipulation.' With the lovely camera ankle of 'entrance into apartment' viewers enter a slightly different world by Hitchock, yet equally entertaining and memorable. Flashbacks are there to tell lies, the images of ruined London serve to correspond to specific period challenges, the English characters spy or are accused while the German ones sing, the psychology of characters seem to deceive us all the way through but one thing is certain the show goes on with a very specific aspect where 'some fear' is placed the stage. Terribly theatrical context but isn't that so much British? Traditionally British? Therefore, I would like to focus on three points of this helter-skelter movie, as Bosley Crowther names it in his review the cast, old England and humor.THE CAST One of the film's major strengths is its delightful bunch of British cast. As a relatively newcomer at Hitchcock, JANE WYMAN, is the director's unique female discovery. From the start of the film, she somehow manages to call our attention, we empathize with her and, in the long run, she constitutes, for us, a perfect model of 'make-belive.' There is innocence and inexperience blended in her. One of the most powerful scenes that she handles is the bar moment where she leads audiences to certain tension but does not let us be absorbed by it completely. She looks desperate, as humorous Mr Fortesque notes, but surprises us with later reactions. That anticipates, and rightly so, her major skill in this performance, to evoke emotions constantly keeping the borderline, the limit to what place it is safe to go and which point we actually cannot cross. Also great job as one Doris Tinsdale and a dresser of extravagant Charlotte.MICHAEL WILDING, a very eminent actor of the times, with his role does not only serve to portray an 'Agatha-Christie' like detective but beautifully combines the wits, charm, and determination creating a unique, non-verbal interaction with various audiences. Finally, he is the one who falls in love. His moment is the car scene with Eve. The performance of RICHARD TODD, the actor of Irish origin does occur a bit shadowed by others. STAGE FRIGHT does not ignore, among the supporting performers, the elderly couple (who are usually the parents of a protagonist) and so they are here ALISTAIR SIM as calm and peaceful Mr Gill and SYBIL THORNDYKE as his rigid, demanding wife.As she is a strict mother of more or less Victorian style, he is a very sympathetic, hilarious (at moments) daddy who is afraid for his daughter knowing that 'in real life you have to face situations with all its bearings.' He is a very likable old gentleman, at the same time, resorting to more peaceful way of life and one of the most frank of all Hitchcock's supporting characters. Crowther nicely refers to Sim's performance saying that the privilege of watching him muster his wits and resources to assist his daughter in her endeavors is one of the genuine pleasures of the film. Sim and Thorndyke paired together, they powerfully manifest the director's own believes about elderly couples within traditional conventions of a family life. And, obviously, Hitchock's daughter Patricia in the supporting role.Of course, among the cast, there is one exception from 'the British' yet, the one loved by the British public MARLENE DIETRICH. It simply takes her that way and some people see the film solely for the sake of her presence. Yes, as 'the Laziest Gal in Town' with specific sexy laziness that only Marlene was capable of handling on the screen, she reveals the flamboyant and yet predictable aspect of her character, Charlotte. Her glamor goes with her terrific impact on characters around and audiences alike with, indeed, some other unforgettable climaxes than the song she sang for Hitchcock (and sang once more in Denver). She embodies sex with power, extravagance with manipulation, beauty with price.OLD ENGLAND Along with the title and the locations, Hitchcock highlights something significant that may but does not necessarily remain in the background peaceful, idyllic England that is forever gone with the old generation. We don't have haunting castles, some ghastly removed spots, foggy atmosphere and other clichés of the sort but a garden party, old cafés, theater basically ruled by classical approach, gentlemen of the old style and the post-war London where ruins also stand for social situation of the time. In this way, the film is 'dazzlingly stagy...far from frightening' (Crowther) but very pleasant to watch. And the last aspectHUMOR is ever-present from the lovely scene of Doris Tinsdale in glasses through Hitchcock's cameo presence, Mr and Mrs Gill's tense interactions, some of Ordinary Smith's lines to the dark wit (for the time) expressed in Charlotte's line I hate rainy funerals. Many clever lines make the film witty in an intelligent manner.STAGE FRIGHT is undeniably a movie worth seeing, another of Hitchock's powerful productions though it might not look like one.

She quite obviously had no idea about alpinism and didn't research Harrer's life. She doesn't even seem to have understood the book itself. The real book certainly wasn't about a lost son (Rolf) or a lost marriage, nor was it about any rivalry between alpinists (Aufschnaiter - Harrer). Harrer and Aufschnaiter survived a physically and mentally extremely exhausting escape over the Himalayas under deadly conditions with very limited gear where most of us probably would have died many times. The endurance of this incredible achievement is totally lost in the film. In Lhasa, it was mostly his awestruck confrontation with a hidden culture, which was quite contrary to the film or simply didn't get through to the audience.

Also there is a scene of some cops harassing a pair of transvestites and ordering them to give bl*wjobs inside their squad car. We hear one of the cops say. I knew a guy once who was a coke-sucker. We hear his partner immediately saybefore that he was a cork-soaker. This dialogue shows the society's views on homosexualism during that time. The murder scenes depicted in the film are hardcore. Pacino's acting is excellent as always. His role in the film was to bring the serial out and the way he accomplishes this task is why you should rent or buy this excellent film. I've seen this film about three or four times already and it gets better with every watch. Also I should mention that Paul Sorvino, another favorite of mine, gives a powerful portrayal of New York Police Captain Edelson who is given a deadline by the Mayor to solve this case or else...Other serial killer films to see\/buy The Deliberate Stranger(1986), Ted Bundy(2002), To Catch A Killer(1992), Dear Mr. Gacy (2010), Albert Fish In Sin He Found Salvation (2007), The Gray Man(2007), Dahmer (2002),The Secret Life Jeffrey Dahmer (1993), Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer (1986), Citizen X(1995), Evilenko(2004), The Hunt for The BTK Killer(2005), Confessions Of A Serial killer(1985), Deranged (1974), H.H.
