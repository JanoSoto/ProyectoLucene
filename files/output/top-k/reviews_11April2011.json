It's been nearly a decade since I last watched this film and on this newest viewing I was rather shocked to see how much more impressed I was with it. The story is pretty simple as a killer wearing a ghost face mask stalks teens in a small community and he might have some sort of connection to one (Neve Campbell) whose mother was butchered a year earlier. This killer, however, has his own set of rules that those he stalks must play by. SCREAM was a massive hit back in the day and it saved the genre from its own self destruction and nearly fifteen years later the film rightfully deserves the label of being a classic. While it's far from a masterpiece it at least manages not to lose any of its impact that made it so special when it was first released. I'm not going to sit here and say that SCREAM broke and created all the rules because there were horror-comedies long before this one and there were horror movies that references other horror movies so that there wasn't anything new either. What made the film work so well is that director Craven was at the top of his game and one might say that he did the best work of his career by making this material work so well. Yes, there's quite a bit of humor here but it works because fans of the genre will get a kick out of seeing rules that they know carried out. The various references to other horror movies makes for a lot of fun and we even get a couple nice cameos from previous horror stars. Craven puts his mark all over the film in terms of suspense and this famously starts with the Drew Barrymore sequence that starts the movie. I remember not being overly impressed with this sequence when I first saw it but viewing it today makes quite an impression because of how much suspense there is and how the director manages to slowly build it up. Seeing this sequence today also makes you see how violent it actually was and the death scene is quite effective and chilling considering the events that are going on around it. Craven also keeps things moving perfectly well with the ending because not only does he keep the tension going he also manages to keep the mystery up in the air as well. There are many suspects from start to finish but we're always guessing and even when you think you have it figured out something else will happen to throw you off track again. Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Jamie Kennedy and Matthew Lillard all fit their roles nicely and it was fun seeing the likes of Henry Winkler and Linda Blair. Even at 110-minutes the film never wears out its welcome as it moves at a very quick pace and whatever elements it's going for are always working. A lot of times horror films wear down with age but that's not the case here as the movie is just as strong and perhaps even stronger than when it was originally released. Each generation has films that built the horror genre and SCREAM certain did that and you really can't take away from it simply because of future rips that would eventually help kill the genre.

SCREAM worked so well because it knew it was a horror movie, knew the clichés and knew how to have fun with it. There's no question this sequel was made to cash-in on the success of the first film but thankfully screenwriter Kevin Williamson also knows this and keeps the fun going. There's a terrific sequence early in the film where some film students discuss the good and bad to sequels and we've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy) giving us the rules to survive a sequel. This all adds up to a winning film even if it falls somewhat short of the original. Williamson's screenplay certain makes the mystery deeper and adds some higher quality death scenes but perhaps one of the most interesting aspects doesn't get covered as funny as it could have been. I think the movie would have been better had they toned down some of the culture references and instead took a closer look at violence in movies and how it might relate to violence in the real world. This is touch on briefly and even is motivation for one of the killers. Those who were old enough to remember when this film was in the theater will remember some copycat killers of the first film so it's clear that both the screenwriter and director are stating their opinion that you can't blame movies. It's just too bad this wasn't explored a little bit more. As with the first film, the cast hit all the right marks with Campbell perfect as the victim and and we also get fine performances from Liev Schreiber and Kennedy. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a cameo appearance but it's David Arquette and Courteney Cox who easily steal the film as Dewey and Gale Weathers. The two of them had remarkable chemistry in the film film and that carries over here as their playful banter just adds to the fun. The death scenes here are more violent than in the first film but they'll all well handled by Craven who certainly hasn't forgotten how to stage a scene. The highlight of the film is a sequence where Sidney and her friend are trapped in the back of a police car with the killer in the front seat passed out. The two girls have to try and crawl over him to freedom and this here is Craven at his very best as he milks the scene for every inch of suspense. I think the identity of the killer isn't as good as in the first film because there doesn't seem to be much intent on the mystery being a big aspect here. Of course they don't want you to figure out but when the killer or killers are finally revealed you realize there wasn't much rhyme or reason and that they could have picked anyone.

SCREAM worked so well because it knew it was a horror movie, knew the clichés and knew how to have fun with it. There's no question this sequel was made to cash-in on the success of the first film but thankfully screenwriter Kevin Williamson also knows this and keeps the fun going. There's a terrific sequence early in the film where some film students discuss the good and bad to sequels and we've got Randy (Jamie Kennedy) giving us the rules to survive a sequel. This all adds up to a winning film even if it falls somewhat short of the original. Williamson's screenplay certain makes the mystery deeper and adds some higher quality death scenes but perhaps one of the most interesting aspects doesn't get covered as funny as it could have been. I think the movie would have been better had they toned down some of the culture references and instead took a closer look at violence in movies and how it might relate to violence in the real world. This is touch on briefly and even is motivation for one of the killers. Those who were old enough to remember when this film was in the theater will remember some copycat killers of the first film so it's clear that both the screenwriter and director are stating their opinion that you can't blame movies. It's just too bad this wasn't explored a little bit more. As with the first film, the cast hit all the right marks with Campbell perfect as the victim and and we also get fine performances from Liev Schreiber and Kennedy. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a cameo appearance but it's David Arquette and Courteney Cox who easily steal the film as Dewey and Gale Weathers. The two of them had remarkable chemistry in the film film and that carries over here as their playful banter just adds to the fun. The death scenes here are more violent than in the first film but they'll all well handled by Craven who certainly hasn't forgotten how to stage a scene. The highlight of the film is a sequence where Sidney and her friend are trapped in the back of a police car with the killer in the front seat passed out. The two girls have to try and crawl over him to freedom and this here is Craven at his very best as he milks the scene for every inch of suspense. I think the identity of the killer isn't as good as in the first film because there doesn't seem to be much intent on the mystery being a big aspect here. Of course they don't want you to figure out but when the killer or killers are finally revealed you realize there wasn't much rhyme or reason and that they could have picked anyone.

For those who don't remember the early '90's, Culkin and Wood were the top child stars of cinema who were compared frequently. They were like Pepsi & Coke, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, Britney & Christina, etc. You would think the first movie they would star in together would appeal to kids.That's the bad part The Good Son, as a result of incorrect marketing, appealed highly to kids upon its release in 1993, even though it was rightfully rated R. Being a fan of the two actors, particularly Culkin, when I was a kid, I remember seeing the movie's poster with Culkin's face displayed prominently, & thinking Cool, another Macaulay Culkin movie! I have to see this! I was later bummed to find out that the movie was rated R. I have no doubt, however, that millions of kids my age felt the exact same way I did.It was just wrong to cast two well-known child actors in these dark roles. It would be one thing if the child actors were unknowns, but since Culkin made a name for himself with the hugely popular Home Alone films, kids wanted to see whatever movie he was in. It was the equivalent of casting Miley Cyrus in Requim for a Dream and putting a large poster of her face above Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's faces. Kids would want to see it regardless of the subject matter, and adults wouldn't want to necessarily see it because it has a kid's star in it.I saw it years after it came out, when I was old enough to watch R-rated movies. When I saw it the first time, I admit that I liked it. After seeing it recently as a mature adult, the movie has some major problems.Elijah Wood plays Mark Evans, a child whose mother has just died. His father (David Morse), immediately following the funeral, goes on a business trip and promises his son that he'll return and spend more time with him, thereby creating a giant plot hole nearly ten minutes into the film. Why didn't his father take time off after the death of his wife? Why would he leave his grieving son alone!?!Regardless, his father takes him to his uncle's house to stay until he returns. Mark's Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) seem normal, which is why you wonder how their son Henry (Macaulay Culkin), who is Mark's age, became so messed up. You learn as the film progresses and Mark & Henry spend so much time together that Henry is one unbelievably sociopathic 10-year-old. He kills innocent animals with a crossbow he made himself, throws a mannequin off a bridge into traffic just to see the cars crash, and repeatedly tries to kill his younger sister Connie (Quinn Culkin). All the while, Henry's parents, while they are good people and not abusive or inattentive, manage to be completely oblivious to their son being a reincarnation of Ted Bundy.It's not unbelievable that a kid can act like this. I'm sure there are kids this messed up, but they probably have far less attentive parents. My problem with this film is that in a town as small as the one they live in, how could no one besides Wood's character see Henry pulling these dangerous pranks? The movie really loses its credibility in the last 20 minutes, when Henry's true intentions come to light by way of (and I am not making this up) a rubber duckie! It goes without saying that when the favorite bath toy of Ernie from Sesame Street is the primary motive for Henry's madness, there is just no room for method.After that part, the climactic show-down is just entirely contrived, not to mention hokey and completely stupid! The voice over at the end then leaves the movie on such a questionable note that it's incredibly unbelievable that the movie was made in the first place.It was one of the MPAA's smartest moves to rate this movie R, but it was absolutely wrong, not to mention immoral, of the production company to market Culkin as much as they did. It's a dark film, but that's really all it is. It could have been so much better, and if someone else beside Culkin (and maybe Wood too) had been cast in it, the intended audience of this film would not have been distracted. My guess is, however, that 20th Century Fox, who released this movie, worried less about an audience and more about money. They probably didn't care that some parents managed to succumb to their kids' demands to see this movie, and probably regretted it later.

The movie has elements of all those films, but its disturbing factor, which should be the selling part of the movie, is focused upon so much that many other elements in the story are ignored entirely as the movie progresses. What results is a mess of a movie that, at the time of its release, appealed to the wrong demographic entirely.Macaulay Culkin got the headlining credit, even though Elijah Wood is really the lead actor and the moral compass of the story. For those who don't remember the early '90's, Culkin and Wood were the top child stars of cinema who were compared frequently. They were like Pepsi & Coke, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, Britney & Christina, etc. You would think the first movie they would star in together would appeal to kids.That's the bad part The Good Son, as a result of incorrect marketing, appealed highly to kids upon its release in 1993, even though it was rightfully rated R. Being a fan of the two actors, particularly Culkin, when I was a kid, I remember seeing the movie's poster with Culkin's face displayed prominently, & thinking Cool, another Macaulay Culkin movie! I have to see this! I was later bummed to find out that the movie was rated R. I have no doubt, however, that millions of kids my age felt the exact same way I did.It was just wrong to cast two well-known child actors in these dark roles. It would be one thing if the child actors were unknowns, but since Culkin made a name for himself with the hugely popular Home Alone films, kids wanted to see whatever movie he was in. It was the equivalent of casting Miley Cyrus in Requim for a Dream and putting a large poster of her face above Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto's faces. Kids would want to see it regardless of the subject matter, and adults wouldn't want to necessarily see it because it has a kid's star in it.I saw it years after it came out, when I was old enough to watch R-rated movies. When I saw it the first time, I admit that I liked it. After seeing it recently as a mature adult, the movie has some major problems.Elijah Wood plays Mark Evans, a child whose mother has just died. His father (David Morse), immediately following the funeral, goes on a business trip and promises his son that he'll return and spend more time with him, thereby creating a giant plot hole nearly ten minutes into the film. Why didn't his father take time off after the death of his wife? Why would he leave his grieving son alone!?!Regardless, his father takes him to his uncle's house to stay until he returns. Mark's Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) seem normal, which is why you wonder how their son Henry (Macaulay Culkin), who is Mark's age, became so messed up. You learn as the film progresses and Mark & Henry spend so much time together that Henry is one unbelievably sociopathic 10-year-old. He kills innocent animals with a crossbow he made himself, throws a mannequin off a bridge into traffic just to see the cars crash, and repeatedly tries to kill his younger sister Connie (Quinn Culkin).

","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"11 April 2011","score":"","review":" David Mamet can write. There's no two ways about it. He can write with such a beautiful and graceful cadence that any conversation, no matter how dreary or dull, can sound like a poetic work of art. In The Spanish Prisoner he shows off quite a bit, but hey, doesn't he have the right to do so? The Spanish Prisoner is about a naive inventor named Joseph Ross who has come up with a formula called The Process that is the key to global success for the company that employs him. But holding a secret this significant and this important has its drawbacks, and Ross quickly discovers that as an elaborate scheme unfolds before him in order to get ahold of The Process. This scheme is full of twists, turns, and countless surprises, making for a film that is a lot of fun to watch play out, but be prepared to follow the many trails as the film spins out of control towards the end.Now, I said David Mamet is a great writer, and The Spanish Prisoner is an excellently written film, it's just... different. The writing style has a more poetic cadence to it rather than the raw and realistic style of some of his other scripts like Glenngary Glen Ross, or House of Games. The style of the dialouge and its delivery takes some getting used to and there always seem to be those moments where I thought to myself, I bet that line looked a lot better on paper. Regardless, the script is full of sharp wit and crisp cadence, and the depth of the story as a whole is very impressive.In many ways I do feel like this would have been a lot better as a book or even a stage play, as some of the film aspects didn't translate perfectly. There's nothing truly bad about this film and it really is a great film that is a joy to watch, there are just those odd moments. Those moments, for the most part, just come and go and you forget about them after a while, as you become more enticed by the bigger picture unfolding masterfully before your eyes. One thing I consistently couldn't forgive, though, was Rebecca Pidgeon. I feel like she's most of the reason I felt the delivery of certain lines that otherwise would have been ingenious, were delivered a little rocky.

He can write with such a beautiful and graceful cadence that any conversation, no matter how dreary or dull, can sound like a poetic work of art. In The Spanish Prisoner he shows off quite a bit, but hey, doesn't he have the right to do so? The Spanish Prisoner is about a naive inventor named Joseph Ross who has come up with a formula called The Process that is the key to global success for the company that employs him. But holding a secret this significant and this important has its drawbacks, and Ross quickly discovers that as an elaborate scheme unfolds before him in order to get ahold of The Process. This scheme is full of twists, turns, and countless surprises, making for a film that is a lot of fun to watch play out, but be prepared to follow the many trails as the film spins out of control towards the end.Now, I said David Mamet is a great writer, and The Spanish Prisoner is an excellently written film, it's just... different. The writing style has a more poetic cadence to it rather than the raw and realistic style of some of his other scripts like Glenngary Glen Ross, or House of Games. The style of the dialouge and its delivery takes some getting used to and there always seem to be those moments where I thought to myself, I bet that line looked a lot better on paper. Regardless, the script is full of sharp wit and crisp cadence, and the depth of the story as a whole is very impressive.In many ways I do feel like this would have been a lot better as a book or even a stage play, as some of the film aspects didn't translate perfectly. There's nothing truly bad about this film and it really is a great film that is a joy to watch, there are just those odd moments. Those moments, for the most part, just come and go and you forget about them after a while, as you become more enticed by the bigger picture unfolding masterfully before your eyes. One thing I consistently couldn't forgive, though, was Rebecca Pidgeon.

The movie is set in a train station from Lancashire and some of the kernel events in the story are developed in that particular place. The soundtrack is repeated in almost the whole film and it is the Piano Concerto No. 2, composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff.

The film presents then, their love story in a dramatic way, because, as mentioned before, both are married. Love, cheating and moral values are some of the main themes that this production explores and, in my opinion, it is the duty of the spectator to condemn or support the couple, to judge whether they are acting wrong or just following the instincts of two people in love. However, the film also presents some mysteries that the spectators must find out by their own. There are also some technical aspects which are important to mention in this story. First of all, it is essential to highlight the role of the voice over, which is as important as any of the characters. Thanks to this voice, the spectator knows what is happening during the whole story and it makes impossible then, to miss the main events in the film. Secondly, the story ends in the same moment that it starts but, almost the rest of the film is a flashback from Laura's mind, which permits also to see what the voice over tells.

In spite of these minute details, I liked the film, and I think that the plot is also innovative and original and got to attract me and that is something I appreciate while watching a film.

Something deeper?Direction As with his best films (The Sixth Sense, Signs), Shyamalan creates an indelible atmosphere in which this story unfolds. The eerie tones are emphasised by well-placed silences and close-ups, while the more frightening moments are defined by lucid lighting and jagged editing. He even uses a not-too-flashy flourish in the opening scene on the train, a long shot without a cut in which Daniel and a stranger's conversation is portrayed through by the camera switching perspective from behind a chair, implicitly seen through the eyes of a curious child.

Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick & Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary.

It revolves around basically three themes - the scientist who goes to the jungle looking for her former fiancé, the primatologist who wants to return a talking gorilla to her native land and a treasure- hunter who's looking for King Solomon's lost city of diamonds. The three somehow manage to team up to support each other, and we spend significant time watching them traipse through the jungles, with precious little excitement or action taking place. Amy (the talking gorilla) is kind of cute, but I found it hard to believe that this obviously domesticated gorilla would be able to survive in the wild. Still, her story may be the only one of the three that has any appeal as you wonder whether - when the inevitable moment comes when she encounters wild gorilla - she'll choose her own species or the human she's come to love. Yeah. It's kind of a bizarre love story. The gorilla-creatures from the movie's beginning don't re-appear until the movie's last half hour or so, which means that there's essentially a lot - and I mean A LOT - of filler.The movie features some nice sceneries, but an unfortunately second-rate cast that seems to put enough effort into this but never really thoroughly convinces. Ernie Hudson is probably the most familiar face, supported by the likes of Laura Linney and Dylan Walsh and Joe Don Baker, who all work often enough but have never really achieved mega- stardom. There's a minor role for Joe Pantoliano, who I recognized from The Sopranos.Unless you really have nothing else to do, this isn't worth the effort of watching.

We know nothing of the home lives of the heroes, for instance, except a brief excursion into the kinky side of Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman). We actually see much more of the backgrounds of the villains and they seem more normal and even more sophisticated.Is this then a criticism of the police? I don't think so, at least not up until the finale. We see the dedicated law men having to deal with the scum of society, sacrificing the normality of their own lives. In one important scene, Doyle waits outside in the bitter cold with a cup of coffee so disgusting he tips it away, while observing the criminal, Frog One (Fernando Rey), eating in comfort in a lavish restaurant.In my view the unvaried nature of the film, one long cat and mouse game, adds to its intensity and any interpolated scenes of family normality would dilute it. I do however have a few problems with this film.Perhaps because of the original nature of most of it, the few clichés stick out. The tired You're off the case just before an attempt is made to kill Doyle. Even worse is the car being stripped and the I've ripped out everything but the rocker panels. This is so stupid it annoyed me even when I watched it as a kid. Obviously the ludicrous way in which the car is miraculously re-assembled without a scratch is also a mark against the film.What is so irksome about all these is that they were so unnecessary. It is like someone painting a moustache on the face of the Mona Lisa and not noticing. It could, and should, have been avoided. Another is when Frog One is allowed to drive over the bridge before the police appear thus giving the criminals an opportunity to escape, an opportunity which Frog One takes. However this could be interpreted as Doyle's own ego in wanting to actually see the look on Frog One's face when he was caught.I must say, too, that I find the ending too downbeat and nihilistic. The complete callousness with which Doyle having shot his fellow cop dead, simply ignores him, is deeply troubling. I'm not sure I completely believe it, at least as presented here.

It's this basic premise that had always rather put me off 12 Angry Men. Technically, the film ends up as a study in close quarter drama. The tension of Hitchcock's Rope is very much in evidence, although the whodunnit element of 12 Angry Men is simply a MacGuffin (which Hitchcock would have appreciated). The drama itself is a study of men the way in which men behave towards one another, understand and deal with one another, what they consider acceptable, and so on.It's a very interesting film, as the acting techniques are really dated. Despite this, one consistently gets a sense of authenticity, that for all the melodrama, men - these men, with their own backstories - do behave like this. Even without considering individual performances, there is much to confirm this. For example, the general, collective meandering about the room before they all finally sit down and begin to discuss the verdict; this tells us as much about their pride and insecurity as any exchange.The entire cast is really excellent - it's a bit like trying to single out one particular performance in Glengarry Glenross. Henry Fonda leads but only as the initially unconvinced juror. He asks questions. His liberalism isn't didactic. I actually found his attempts to undermine the evidence childish, compared with the dialogue that this confrontation provokes in the defensive ensemble.
