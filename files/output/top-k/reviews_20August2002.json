When the other guy flies through a glass window (the only good effect in the whole movie) and the cops arrive, Klein gets picked up at the bottom of the hill by LL Cool J and suddenly forgets that he is owed money from the guy that went through the window.  Klein then turns down an offer to be in Rollerball and then the movie throws the viewer 5 months ahead to Klein being the best player ever.Why go into that much detail for this review?  The answer to this question and the reason this movie fails miserably is all in the opening.  Everything is rushed throughout the movie.  It's like a race down the hill is not good enough, let's add skateboards, gambling, cheating, a wreck, cops, 30 people rooting them on the street, and introduce LL and Rollerball, all in the first five minutes.The pacing is all wrong.  They break your neck in the first five minutes, while none of it makes any sense, and then you are supposed to care about a game that they don't even bother to explain because it's too complicated.  Action, action, action, sex, action, action, action, action, it's like if you keep the camera on something moving maybe someone will care.  Unfortunately, there is no way to even care at all, because no one in this film is likeable.This is just garbage.  The acting is as bad as anything a major studio has released in the last 20 years.  Klein is miscast (duh?), and the rest are either wasted (LL), misused (Reno) or should not be in any film (everyone else).The actors aren't the only ones to blame.  It's hard to act when the dialogue is just grunting and occasional sentences that don't explain anything.The basic direction of the film has to be questioned.  Anyone who would shoot, and leave in, 10 minutes of night-vision film in all of it's multiple green-colored luster, should be blamed.  That was quite possibly the worst shot sequence I have seen in a movie, and it was allowed 10 minutes of time?  How is that possible?  I have so many more questions that I would love to ask the director  How in the world is everything else in the movie so bright, yet the shots with night-vision so green and the shots of Ms. Stamos in the locker room so dark?  I saw the R-rated version and I thought I was watching a PG film, because all of the violence and nudity were kept to brief flashes, but wasn't that the draw of this film?  Where is the extreme violence, because it didn't look that bad to me? How hard is it to complete a simple shot without chopping it?  I mean simple panning shots were chopped several times and I don't know why?  Was it to cut down on time?  Where'd the plot go?  Did it get cut for time, too?  Was it fun making the worst movie ever made?  Why did this feel like a movie version of the XFL?Obviously, this movie is horrible.  Whether you are fan of any of the people involved, or not, don't bother wasting your time watching this junk.  In my opinion, John McTiernan has now made the best (Die Hard) and worst (THIS) movies ever created.  Everyone involved should be ashamed.  What a terrible waste of time and money!  They should had shelved this movie forever and everyone should had made sure Rollerball never saw the light of day.

Mahoney plays countless pranks-watch out for the scene where the Commandant is giving a speech to various police chiefs. Something rather crude happens and it is so funny. Other great scenes include a citywide riot which the cadets are called out to police, the fight between the fat Leslie Barbara and his tormentors and the scene where Copeland and Blanks end up in a homosexual bar and are forced to dance all night.I feel I've gone on for too long.

The plot revolves around three police officers (Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce) working on different cases that coincide, set in early 1950's LA. You feel as if you're really experiencing the debauchery, the sleaze and the glamour; walking amongst film sirens, downtrodden actors and corrupt cops. The storyline is set at a good pace and I didn't feel bored at all during the film, as the action is spliced with interesting subplots that will eventually all make sense at the end.The acting by Spacey and Pearce is exceptional (Crowe didn't actually have to act much apart from his scenes with his love interest) with the latter pulling off the perfect ambitious backstabber. This movie is for those who enjoy the crime genre, obviously, although there is quite a large firefight at the end it concentrates more on the characters and their investigations. There is also solid backup from Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, (and my favourite character) Danny Devito as the amoral trash reporter.An extremely well-made movie, definitely in my top ten. The only possible bad thing about LA Confidential that I can see is that some people just despised the film because of Guy Pearce's character's actions at the end of it. I actually found it refreshing, because it remains to his character and we're given no traditional Hollywood morality lessons. Anyway, 9 out of 10 from me.

How do you defeat a being who exists in your dreams and can not be killed by conventional means? You simply stay awake. However, staying awake can also lead to death eventually so you're pretty much stumped.The ending is very creepy too. Nancy defeats Freddy (I won't say how) but the final scene is really scary as you realise Freddy is one dude who won't be staying down.I happen to think this was a very symbolic movie telling us that dreams are only dreams and can cause you no harm if you don't let them. It's when you do let them cause you harm that the danger starts.But, philosophical thinking aside, A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror of the 80's and praise must go to Wes Craven and also to Freddy who carved his own niche.

It goes so far over their heads that it probably isn't worthwhile. Tolkein's written work is much the same. I read the story 3 times. First time it was way over my head. Second time it was a boring hack and slash story. Third time it was a soul stirring work of art that stung me deep in the heart and created a feeling that lasted for months afterwards. The story is an intricate examination of the human spirit that leaves you breathless (if you have the eyes to see it).This is definitely one of the best movies ever made. There is no question about it. It's not like the written story (and it's amazing to me that so many writers were impressed with how well it followed the book- Saruman and Sauron are NOT  allies for one thing). But it stands as it's own entity better than I would have ever thought possible. Perhaps we shouldn't judge outright until all three are done.For people who write negative things about the movie, I assume that they fall into a couple different categories. One is the person who cannot feel, and thinks it is a hack and slash picture with neat scenery. The other is the flatland literalist who can't stop analyzing everything, and picks it apart until it is stripped of all value. These are the people that should not be making evaluations of movies such as this. Not caring much for the movie is fine, but bashing the written work is more self-degrading than anything.
