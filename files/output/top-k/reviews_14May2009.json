I in general like Nic Cage and his roles, and I like him here. There aren't many honorable characters here, but they make the story palatable by keeping the killing to a bare minimum.Nicolas Cage is Memphis Raines, known car thief, perhaps the best ever, who has now gone straight. But he gets a visit, seems that his younger brother, Giovanni Ribisi as Kip Raines, has gotten in with the wrong element and, having just botched a heist is threatened with death, unless Memphis can help out. He doesn't want to, but also doesn't want his brother killed.Memphis has to assemble a crack team and plan everything just right, because his task is to steal a list of 50 specific cars over one 24-hour period and deliver them to a shipping container at the Long Beach wharf. This represents quite a cast of characters, including Angelina Jolie as Sara 'Sway' Wayland, Scott Caan as Tumbler, Will Patton as Atlee Jackson, Chi McBride as Donny Astricky, and the old veteran, Robert Duvall as Otto Halliwell.A heist wouldn't be very interesting without a group of law officers trying to foil their plan. They are led by Delroy Lindo as Det. Roland Castlebeck and his sidekick Timothy Olyphant as Detective Drycoff.In spite of the time devoted to the preparation for the heists, and one very long and spectacular chase scene near the end, this is basically a character study. Big brother and little brother. Old friends. Law enforcement trying to do the right thing.It is an interesting 2 hours.MAJOR SPOILERS Memphis saves his favorite car for the last heist, the 1967 Shelby Mustang. This is the chase scene, and even though he does many improbable things, arrives as the 50th car in Long Beach, even though it is highly damaged. But he is 12 minutes late and the bad guy won't accept it. In fact he decided to kill Memphis for having pointed a gun at him a few days earlier when trying to rescue his brother. So a shoot-out ensures and the bad guy falls to his death after cornering the cop, Castleback. Memphis saved the cop's life. In return the cop told Memphis to beat it, make himself scarce. In return Memphis told him to send someone to check out a shipping contained of stolen cars. The bad guy dies and everyone else comes out OK.

Of the old horror films; Dracula and Frankenstein have somehow come off better then The Wolf Man franchise and the concept of werewolfs didn't surface again until 1981. The old Hammer films successfully revived both Dracula and Frankenstein and a lot of horror films have dealt with vampirism and badly conceived monsters in the sixties and seventies.However, 1981 was a good year for werewolfs. An American Werewolf in London probably has more following than The Howling, but I've always preferred this fright fest to the John Landis classic. One thing, though, that Joe Dante and John Landis have in common here; the both infuse their horror tales with big doses of humor. Here, Dante cleverly mixes old footage of Lon Chaney's Wolf Man and old cartoons (a frequent Dante thing) as a bleak forecast for what's about to happen.Another thing he does well here is mixing in a bit of social satire spoof (maybe he watched George Romero's Dead films) when he created a self help group in a recluse colony (which of course is where the werewolfs can enjoy their nature freely).But overall, The Howling is a pretty effective horror film. The werewolf transformations still look impressive and the final look of the creatures is still wonderfully creepy. The humor works well here and this is overall a fairly well written movie. It's got a knockout opening act and it maintains it's atmosphere fairly well throughout. The Colony is a beautiful setting for werewolf mayhem and some set pieces are terrific.Dante's direction is first rate and it's a shame he veered more into comical horrors (but I still love his Gremlins films). Performances are fine; Stone is always the same but Robert Picardo, Dick Miller and Kevin McCarthy are entertaining in their small roles.Good werewolf films are few and far between; but The Howling is a keeper and comes highly recommended for horror buffs.
