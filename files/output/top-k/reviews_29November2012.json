The very first James Bond film of all time! Everything you know about James Bond, even if you're not a fan, started here! Well, if you doesn't count the 1954 TV episode Casino Royale from Climax, that is. The film set the standards for many movies to come, and the Bond universe has been parodied so many times over the years since! The film was based on one of the bestselling James Bond novels of the same name by Ian Fleming. There were so many people that contributed, to makes this film so memorable Ian Fleming's excellent novels, Sean Connery's brilliant portrayal of James Bond, the stylish and tireless direction by Terence Young, John Barry's brilliant theme tune, Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood's fantastic script, Maurice Binder's brilliant main title opening, Peter Hunt's rapid and professional editing, etc. It's just all so brilliant! Connery as James Bond was able to charm both critics and moviegoers from the premiere, and it became an instant hit! The story centers around this British agent for MI6 names James Bond (codenamed 007), who is sent to Jamaica to investigate the mystical disappearance of another British agent named Strangways and his assistant. Bond is almost immediately tried to get rid off, and Bond is quickly lured into a darker and more sinister plot! The plot is in fact very simple, though it gets kinda complicated at the end! Terence Young's brilliant direction is clearly visible right at the start! I don't think any other Bond director (expect Guy Hamilton with Goldfinger) has achieved to make such a sleek and stylish movie which matches Sean Connery's portrayal so far! Sean Connery is imo the best Bond ever! He was the first and the original of course, but his performance is just so stylish and so memorable that whenever you think of Bond, you'll think of Connery! He expertly and smoothly blends into the role of James Bond, like he has been playing the character for years. It's interesting to note, that Connery drew a lot of inspiration for his interpretation of Bond from Terrence Young! And that Young apparently had Sean Connery sleep in the special tailored suit he wears in the movie. Connery agreed, and when he woke up the suit was still as comfortable as the night before! Connery owns the role, and will for many be the first and best James Bond, including me! Ursulla Andress plays the first EON Bond girl, and boy does she look good in a white bikini, phew! She's never been my absolute favorite Bond girl, but if I were to make a top 10 she'd probably be nr. 3 or something. She isn't given much screen time, but when she makes her entrance... it was worth the wait! She gets the most iconic Bond girl intro, when she walks out of the sea with her white bikini! Andress isn't that good an actress, but considering she's got no prior acting experience, she does a decent job. Joseph Wiseman plays the first EON Bond villain. I've always liked this villain. He has a nice build up, he has a nice, calm and laid back performance, which is a lot of fun to watch! He kinda set the standards for all Bond villains to come... Too bad he doesn't get much screen time, neither. He is also the first to introduce us to SPECTRE! You'll hear more about them in the other movies! He'd probably be my nr. 6 or something, on my top 10! We also have Jack Lord as Felix Leiter! Lord delivers the definitive performance as Felix Leiter. He's sophisticated, suave and calm in all of his scenes, and seems like a capable agent in his own right! More than you could say about the other actors to portray Leiter! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell takes on the roles of M and Moneypenny, and both does a fantastic job!Dr. No was never one of my absolute favorites. Don't get me wrong it is one of my favorites, but not one of my absolute favorites. I would have liked Andress and Wiseman to have more screen time, so that they could do more with their characters. The film hasn't got any real memorable action set pieces. The action consists of a regular car chase, people trying to shoot Bond while he sleeps, and some brawls in the end. That's kinda' it. Some might argue that this movie is boring. That is completely nonsense. The films pacing is slow, but this movie is meant to introduce viewers to Bond. Who he is, how he operates, who he works for, how he lives etc. The film does a pretty damn good job with that!I guess, I have been pretty unfair with my verdict. It is the first Bond movie and therefore it is almost to important to rate! But here it is. Forget whatever critic I might have had against this movie, and watch it! Probability says you're gonna like it, and wanna go check the other Bond movies out! This is the first real James Bond movie... and it's absolutely friggin' awesome!9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2012","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Talk about a legendary classic of a movie!

One can not fault this because now, over 40-years removed from Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw, the mountain of known evidence is more vindicating related to Garrison than ever. It will likely continue to be more so even as those directly involved are largely deceased.The story of Jim Garrison is fascinating. Garrison had the back-bone to do what no one else either would or could.

Stone has reverence for the quest and takes it seriously. Though the movie is long, and some would say slow, I find it fastidious in detail and never boring. In other words it is truly moving that a man without a dog in the hunt would hang himself so far over the line in his quest for the unthinkable. The viewer both roots for Garrison and cringes at how he is kept from securing valuable documents as well as many witnesses (like the obviously knowledgeable Mr. X). One must feel pain for Garrison as even the trial's supposedly neutral judge is openly hostile (what a waste of humanity whoever this low-life of an empowered official was in real life).This movie is exactly what President Eisenhower warned Americans of so take it that way and do a comprehensive research of your own.

That is the power of this movie because it literally forces the viewer to think and pushes one toward more investigation (it actually did force the government to release a quantity of previously sequestered, yet still highly vetted, information as well as calling out the Warren Commission Report as fiction). It is a wake-up call because we still are largely victims of government by the few in this post 911 world.I applaud Oliver Stone for bringing Jim Garrison's story so effectively to the masses.

No, it may not be 100 accurate, but if it isn't the errors are forgivable with obstruction at the highest level preventing a clearer picture. That is the power of this movie because it literally forces the viewer to think and pushes one toward more investigation (it actually did force the government to release a quantity of previously sequestered, yet still highly vetted, information as well as calling out the Warren Commission Report as fiction). It is a wake-up call because we still are largely victims of government by the few in this post 911 world.I applaud Oliver Stone for bringing Jim Garrison's story so effectively to the masses. I am glad that not only was it surprisingly successful upon release, but that it has continued to be seen by millions more each year some twenty plus years later. Two things should be mandatory for all U.S. citizens read The Constitution and see this movie, 'nuff said!

My favorite scene in this movie is where the house was hanging on a cliff, with the Lone Prospector and Big Jim trapped inside. The movie boasts of such amazing screenplay, especially that specific scene.Chaplin's movies have received numerous recognitions for their work and appeal, this movie is no exception it got an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Recording, although it is a silent film. In 1942, Chaplin re-released the movie and in this new version, he added a musical score and a narration which he recorded himself, the original version was a silent film done in 1925.The movie's plot is about a character named The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) whose desire to venture into Alaska to look for gold led him down a path of adventure where he discovered gold and fell in love. In his adventure he met Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen and during a storm all three were trapped in a cabin.While they were tapped in the cabin, they ran out of food and Larsen went out to go search for some, while Big Jim almost ate the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin), as Larsen wasn't back in time and he Big Jim was hungry. The movie then carried on, at the end of the storm, Big Jim unfortunately loses his memory as he battled with Larsen at one point while the Lone Prospector went into town and fell in love with a girl he met at a saloon named Georgia.Although Gold Rush is fun and a nice movie to see, but it is not as great as City Lights which was done six years after.
