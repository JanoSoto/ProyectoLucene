The glamour in this film is almost nonexistent except when it's deserved in the fantasy sequences, so I can wholly accept the players in this story as very true to life mid-20th century.

I watched it after hearing great comments and reviews about this film. I was confident it would just be a big disappointment. I was wrong.2001 A Space Odyssey is as much as a film as it is a work of art. Before you watch this film you have to really slow yourself down, relax, sit back and be patient. It is a very slow movie, and the opening sequence is about 10 minutes of shots of open land, when almost nothing happens (I know there are many people who would have just given up on this by now and turn of the TV, I almost did.) The CGI is incredible, and it is hard to believe that the movie was made in 1968, almost 40 years ago, when it could have been made as recently as 1998.The movie was based on a book which had very little plot, and so did the movie but that changes nothing. The whole film is a mystery, and leaves you with tons of questions throwing themselves at you from all directions. What are all these strange black monoliths? Why does everything seem to change when they appear? Where did they come from? What are they doing? What is this film about? Anyone who attempts to answer these questions are going to have thousands disagreeing with them. This film has a lot of different opinions, and always will have.Another amazing thing in this film is HAL 900, the machine that controls the ship, the machine with apparently no error whatsoever. The perfect machine. HAL 900 backfires, the machine itself loses its mind. This film is rated G or U depending what country your in, meaning anyone can see it and anyone can buy it. Yet when HAL 900 starts to break down, it is almost like a real human going insane, and I was more terrified of him than I ever was of Freddy Krueger, Jason, Micheal Myers or Pinhead. Although he is just a computer, as you get deeper into the film you see him as a real human and a real human losing his mind is terrifying, especially when hes controlling the whole ship, even the Oxygen.2001, A Space Oddyesey, may be the greatest film ever made. The colors, camera angles and effects all sum up to make it a two hour masterpiece.

The whole film is a mystery, and leaves you with tons of questions throwing themselves at you from all directions. What are all these strange black monoliths? Why does everything seem to change when they appear? Where did they come from? What are they doing? What is this film about? Anyone who attempts to answer these questions are going to have thousands disagreeing with them. This film has a lot of different opinions, and always will have.Another amazing thing in this film is HAL 900, the machine that controls the ship, the machine with apparently no error whatsoever. The perfect machine. HAL 900 backfires, the machine itself loses its mind. This film is rated G or U depending what country your in, meaning anyone can see it and anyone can buy it. Yet when HAL 900 starts to break down, it is almost like a real human going insane, and I was more terrified of him than I ever was of Freddy Krueger, Jason, Micheal Myers or Pinhead. Although he is just a computer, as you get deeper into the film you see him as a real human and a real human losing his mind is terrifying, especially when hes controlling the whole ship, even the Oxygen.2001, A Space Oddyesey, may be the greatest film ever made. The colors, camera angles and effects all sum up to make it a two hour masterpiece. The ending is so odd you cannot spoil this film for anyone, because they will most likely look at it in a different way than you. This is by far Kubricks best invention, and may be the greatest film ever made.10\/10 ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 February 2007","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker. This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about a half hour ago.It's all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like Huppert's Erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. She's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. I think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe.I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading sub-titles. That has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and I've seen quite a few. In this film, like Cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert's character is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.

I don't have much of one now either. My time was filled, then and now, with work, words, and images. School has become a stressful mid-management position, but the words and images remain the same--slightly offbeat.Unlike my friends and peers, I watched a lot of randomly selected independent films during adolescence. I'm not sure who else in my rural town was renting Cold Comfort Farm or The Funeral (maybe the video store owners). In any event, as a preview, I first came to know this tale of down-on-their-luck individuals in the vast emptiness of Reno. I loved the look of Philip Baker Hall and John C. Reilly. I fell in love with Gwyneth.

I must admit that I expected a comedy (based solely, of course, on the pack of matches), but what I found was something better and something that left an indelible mark upon me for the rest of my high school years. I've come to appreciate Boogie Nights and Magnolia more than Hard Eight, but this film still stays with me.There is terrible sadness in this film--in the eyes of the characters, for the most part--that you cannot escape. Gwyneth's mascara caked orbs haunt me to this day, as do the sacks under Philip's eyes. The one bright spot too comes from the ocular apparatus--that of John C. Reilly. Though he has come to play a similar role in many films, here is the first time you see him as the naive innocent. He performs beautifully, as does everyone else.It's truly a remarkable, though minor key, film. Magnolia and Boogie Nights are epic, in a sense, but Hard Eight, with its slim plot and grim photography, is a sonnet of awful beauty. One is not blind-sided by the movie; you can see easily the direction it is heading. It's impossible to look away, even though one knows they are awaiting a train wreck. For all the (welcome to me) bombast in Boogie Nights and Magnolia, I am happy to know that PT Anderson has the ability to subdue his more manic and excessive tendencies, as he does here. This is a movie for those that love Boogie Nights and Magnolia; it might also be a movie for those that hate Boogie Nights and Magnolia.

Rappers were in it, and that added to the flair of it.Remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and couldn't, until he met and was befriended by Nazis. They took him in. Nazi's aren't all this awkward, but like most gangs, they fill a void that is missing be it economic, social, emotional, whatever. Michael Rappaport played the part perfectly.Omar Epps was the hot shot track star, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight, and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it.Kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in, until she was date raped. She then found her self experiment with her sexuality, and getting involved politically.This film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play.I read so many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters but there were evil white one (Nazis). So what? Remy wasn't portrayed as evil at all, he was trying to find his way, and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him. He was scared, it was sad to see him devolve how he did. He even says right before he kills himself, I didn't mean it, I wanted to be an engineer.Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was somewhat of an intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. They both showed no consideration at all for their roommates, and generally appear to not like white people very much. They were angry like the Nazis but not on the level of Nazis in terms of overall badness. Sorry if this makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No.People say it shows white=-bad black=good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (omar epps roommate) was a good guy, and even Remy was a good guy, he was just misguided.Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously flawed characters, angry and inconsiderate. Although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well.Good movie, well done. Like all movies that deal with racism, its a great piece to get a discussion going.I don't think Cube and Busta coulda beat those Nazis though.

For me this is neither a tale of Vietnam action , and the extreme effect it has on the innocent like Apocalypse Now; and neither a tale of the homegrown American who leaves behind their romantic but humdrum mid-western existence only to be thrown into the worst of people's nightmares like Platoon. The Deer Hunter stays too long on the home life of the main characters, and for me fails to explain their true relationship, because not all of them go to war! The beginning of the film really drags on once you realise that the wedding scene is played out in full detail. It felt like I'd spent a whole day at the wedding. Yes we'd discovered some new revelations about the characters, but for a film that was 3 hours long, the beginning could have been more succinct. It is the fact that the script labours too long on the home life and not enough time on the war, and the aftermath that leaves me thinking that this classic piece of cinematography doesn't really cut it in the 21st century. If you take Gone with the Wind (some 68 years old), the script is so strong that you can relate to the individuals, feel the tension throughout the whole drama and come away feeling emotive. But with The Deer Hunter, (sarcastically) it was neither an intense Deer hunting film or a good Vietnam Movie. It just did both interpersonal relationship and Vietnam war OK, but neither exemplary. I recommend watching it for some classic movie moments, mostly in Vietnam. But be prepared to be distracted with boredom until you get to those scenes, some 1.5 hours in. 5\/10.
