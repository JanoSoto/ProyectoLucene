State and Main like Day for Night is a look on the inside of the very crazy business of putting together a film and there are some real funny gems in this flic. Mamet's characters are always after something, and the reason he is so popular with actors is his ability to write very playable lines. The DVD of State and Main a rare comedy from the writer\/director has a wonderful ensemble of actors presenting a wacky and at times cock-eyed version of the film-making world. Anyone who has ever worked on an independent film crew will find a rueful pleasure in the characterizations auteur Mamet gains from his actors. The story is about a film crew on location directed by Walt Price (William H. Macy) in the back woods of Waterford, Vermont having been run out of another town in New Hampshire for murky salacious reasons, but it is hinted that lead actor Bob Barrenger (Alex Baldwin) may have had some sort of personal tryst with a young (very young... below the age of consent) citizen. Walt Price has to find a location to fit the title of the film he's directing, The Old Mill, and this town reportedly has such a landmark. After the film rents out the hotel and sets up shop, they find out that the old mill of the town that is listed in historic literature for the area was burned down in the 1970s as part of some rumored conspiracy, one that actually was responsible for the forming of the Waterford Huskies, the local fire department. The screenwriter Joseph Turner White (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is brought in for rewrites. He is eclectic- only writes with an actual typewriter, and goes to the local resale shop to find one. There he meets Ann Black the owner of the shop and through their love for theatre (she has a copy of White's fist real stage play), they form an attraction for each other and begin to fall in love. Love in this world is a brittle thing, but not beyond the grasp of two kindred souls like Ann and Joseph, and amidst all the shenanigans, their relationship is something that weathers the test of any and all conflicts. This screwball comedy escalates to a fast and furious pace as Barrenger hooks up with youngster waitress Carla (Julia Stiles), and is ultimately arrested for child abuse by Ann's fiancée and local politician Doug McKenzie (Clark Gregg) seeking a trophy for his climb up the local political mountain. Added to this lead actress Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) refuses a nude scene that she agreed to do to make the film, and producer Mary Rossen (David Paymer) has to finagle some way to appease her and get his lead actor Barrenger out of jail, while also attempting to attach post-modern product placement into a period film dated in the 1800s. It all comes to a head, but happily for the pure of heart Ann Black and Joseph Turner White, and ultimately the film goes into production with the entire town turning our for extra work and emotional support for the crew and those involved. It's all tongue-in-cheek with many a laughable moments generated from the performances, the dialogue, and this ideas that Mamet generates about the film industry and an alternate culture to be reviled as well as honored for many of the same reasons.

Bill Smith It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise. - Bob Barrenger I know my lines. &#133; I just don't know what order they come in. - And a great line that gets tossed around by just about every character as an exclamation point to something they've just said &#150; Go you Huskies! I would recommend that any film student see this as class assignment in their first year of film school, because it brings up many of the actual issues that a film company faces when making a movie, and pokes fun at them at the same time.

The film captures a strong vibe and energy of the rock n' roll scene during the early 70's, and tells the story of one young die-hard fan\/music journalist getting the job of a lifetime working for Rolling Stone magazine to follow an up-and-coming rock band as they travel on the road. The film is very well cast, and it comes through with a number of really great performances, including Billy Crudup, Jason Lee, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Noah Taylor and newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays the young journalist that gets swept away in a world that the doesn't belong in, and his performance is the real heart of the picture. Almost Famous was nominated for four Academy Awards, and won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, but unfortunately it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture, which I certainly think it should have at least got a nomination.The film starts out with a young Will Miller growing up in a house with his strict mother, Elaine, played well by Frances McDormand and his rebellious older sister, Anita, played by Zooey Deschanel, who has a passion for rock music that their mother doesn't approve of because of it's potentially harmful lyrics about sex and drugs. Anita decides to move out on her own when she's eighteen because she can't handle living at home any longer, but before she leaves she stashes a collection of rock albums under his bed, telling him that they'll set him free, and it does, in a big way. Will works for a small music newspaper and is kind of taken under the wing of Lester Bangs, rock music critic and magazine editor, played well by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, which eventually lands Will a gig working for Rolling Stone to pick a band and follow along with them on the road and write an interview for the popular music magazine.Along his trip with the band he becomes friends with the band and falls in love with one of the group's band aids, a cute blonde that goes by the name of Penny Lane (yeah, just like The Beatles song) played with a tender touch and free spirit by Kate Hudson. As the trip goes along Will has a hard time trying to write his article, and watches the bands ups and downs, and while he's away his mother can't help but worry constantly about Will's safety and reminds him numerous times not to do drugs, which everybody but Will seems to be taking. The film is a bittersweet journey; one that's not entirely a comedy, nor is it an uptight drama or a full fledged romance. I loved watching Almost Famous, not just because it's a very well made film, but also for all the great rock songs that are played nearly back-to-back continuously throughout the entire film. And I'm already a big fan of Led Zeppelin, so this film certainly put a big smile across my face from beginning to end. At times the film reminded me of another really good movie; Lost in Translation, which is another film about getting lost and carried away in a place where you obviously don't fit in. But the experience of getting to go out on the road and spend some time with the band is quite a fun and enjoyable time, and that's exactly what Almost Famous is; fun and enjoyable, and in my opinion Crowe's best film to date.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"26 May 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" John Frankenheimer's Ronin is one of the top ten most underrated action-thrillers of the 90's. It's a film so well made you could swear it would easily fit in with other spy thrillers of the 60's and 70's, like The Day of the Jackal or The French Connection. The script is mysterious, the characters are all intelligent and sophisticated and the direction it's well crafted; bustling with suspense, intrigue and excitement. The film is about a group of freelancing mercenaries who formerly worked for various different military and intelligence organizations that are hired to steal a case that contains important materials that are wanted badly by both Irish and Russian rouge factions. The team is assembled by an Irish woman named Deirdre (Natasha McElhone) which includes an ex-CIA intelligence officer named Sam (Robert De Niro), a computer expert (Stellan Skarsgard), a fast getaway driver (Skipp Sudduth), a French man who knows how to track down anything and everything (Jean Reno), and a former IRA weapons expert (Sean Bean).The film is gritty and played out with a realistic hand due to Frankenheimer's constant vision of keeping things real, and not using any kind of CGI-trickery. Ronin isn't stylized or over-the-top, it's down in the gutter with a sense of believable intensity. The violence is bloody, at times a little gruesome, but only because it would only be realistic, not because he wants it to be over-the-top, but because that's the way it would probably be. Ronin is a rare thing in contemporary action films; it's exciting, without ever having to sacrifice any of its brains in the process of being entertaining and for that reason alone it does stand out from all the rest. Much like 1994's The Professional (another film about a gun for hire, which also stars Jean Reno), Ronin is exciting, entertaining, well acted, well scripted and doesn't ask you to buy into preposterous events in order to get some sort of satisfaction out of enjoying the film; you buy it whole sale from the beginning and it never cheats you out of its believability.The film features two absolutely amazing car chases, which have now become a part of film history, ranking up there with Bullit and The French Connection, and also went on to inspire such films as The Bourne Identity and Supremacy. The chases are purely exhilarating and realistically intense. Why does De Niro have a scared look on his face throughout the chase? That's because that's really him in the car during the entire chase; the stunt driver (usually in the back of the car) was steering the whole time, but it's really the actors in those cars doing 60 through heavy traffic, and driving through those Paris tunnels. John Frankenheimer is probably most remembered for directing the original black and white version of The Manchurian Candidate back in 1962, and if you want to, watch Ronin and turn the color level on your TV all the way down and enjoy it in black and white; and because of the way it's shot it still works quite well even without color.

It's a film so well made you could swear it would easily fit in with other spy thrillers of the 60's and 70's, like The Day of the Jackal or The French Connection. The script is mysterious, the characters are all intelligent and sophisticated and the direction it's well crafted; bustling with suspense, intrigue and excitement. The film is about a group of freelancing mercenaries who formerly worked for various different military and intelligence organizations that are hired to steal a case that contains important materials that are wanted badly by both Irish and Russian rouge factions. The team is assembled by an Irish woman named Deirdre (Natasha McElhone) which includes an ex-CIA intelligence officer named Sam (Robert De Niro), a computer expert (Stellan Skarsgard), a fast getaway driver (Skipp Sudduth), a French man who knows how to track down anything and everything (Jean Reno), and a former IRA weapons expert (Sean Bean).The film is gritty and played out with a realistic hand due to Frankenheimer's constant vision of keeping things real, and not using any kind of CGI-trickery. Ronin isn't stylized or over-the-top, it's down in the gutter with a sense of believable intensity. The violence is bloody, at times a little gruesome, but only because it would only be realistic, not because he wants it to be over-the-top, but because that's the way it would probably be. Ronin is a rare thing in contemporary action films; it's exciting, without ever having to sacrifice any of its brains in the process of being entertaining and for that reason alone it does stand out from all the rest. Much like 1994's The Professional (another film about a gun for hire, which also stars Jean Reno), Ronin is exciting, entertaining, well acted, well scripted and doesn't ask you to buy into preposterous events in order to get some sort of satisfaction out of enjoying the film; you buy it whole sale from the beginning and it never cheats you out of its believability.The film features two absolutely amazing car chases, which have now become a part of film history, ranking up there with Bullit and The French Connection, and also went on to inspire such films as The Bourne Identity and Supremacy. The chases are purely exhilarating and realistically intense. Why does De Niro have a scared look on his face throughout the chase? That's because that's really him in the car during the entire chase; the stunt driver (usually in the back of the car) was steering the whole time, but it's really the actors in those cars doing 60 through heavy traffic, and driving through those Paris tunnels.

It is a terrific exploration of childhood, growing up, the individual and what the individual can achieve, the justice system and human values. Atticus Finch is surely one of the most heroic and true characters ever created, and Gregory Peck does a marvellous job portraying him in the film version of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'.His interaction with the kids is the thing I enjoy most about this film-how both the adult and the child grow to understand each other through the course of the film's events. Atticus is a great father figure, in the fact that he isn't perfect, but strives to do the best he can, as a widower, by his children. When I was a child, I used to sit and watch this and pretend Gregory Peck was my real father instead of my own (we don't have a very close relationship), because of his sincerity and goodness of heart. Peck's understated qualities as an actor perfectly suited the role, it is one of the best male dramatic performances you'll see.The child actors are excellent also- particularly young Mary Badham as Scout, the little girl whose eyes we see the action with. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly, and Mulligan's direction is almost flawless. The courtroom sequences are some of the best ever put to the screen; filled with high emotion as Peck, the town's most upstanding citizen, puts his reputation on the line to defend a black man accused of rape. Due to the town's (and America at large)racial prejudices, the trial is a foregone conclusion even though the black man is obviously innocent, but Atticus' true character and faith shine through.This is an amazing film adaptation of a powerful novel.10\/10.

Things start going wrong right from the get-go when Reve tries to shoot a one-shot dolly in on a scene where Nicole (Katherine Keener) and Cora (Rica Martins) are daughter and mother emoting about a past event in the family. As the action progresses we discover that those in charge of making the film within the film are less than capable to the task. Things reach a nerve-wracking level when we suddenly discover that we are inside the nightmare of the director, and the action begins again. Later to complete a fantasy section for the film a dwarf actor is hired, Tito (Peter Dinklage) to act in a scene with Nicole, but things keep going wrong with adverse reactions to the script and Nick's direction. We're never sure if the movie gets finished but old wounds get salved and another day of creating is successfully completed.It's the little touches in the film that make this inside joke such a pleasure.Highlights are the scene with Nicole and Cora, where we feel that real emotion is being observed and something pure is artistically derived, only to be sidetracked by the incompetent bumbling of the comedy of errors that make up the film crew.Another great section is the one where Nicole and Chad are trying to finish a scene after having sex the night before and carrying all the baggage from that involvement onto the set, with all the accompanying vulnerabilities standing in their way of connecting creatively.The other great section is when we discover that Cora, the mother character of the character in the film within the film earlier, is really the director's own mother. Confused? It's all very funny once you start putting it all together in your own mind.There are some really great quotable lines in this comedy. When you want to really insult an actor call him a Hostess Twinkie Mother F*****- you get it when you see the movie.Another great bunch of lines Chad Palomino Ya know the only reason I took a part in this movie is because someone said you were tight with Quentin Tarentino. You're nowhere man! Tito Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it? Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? No! I don't even have dreams with dwarfs in them. The only place I seen dwarfs in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Although the movie Living in Oblivion will appeal specifically to film-connected people and those who have attempted to create a crew-involved film, even normal people will find laughs in it.You'll come back to this film again and again to look at single scenes to laugh at the stuff that goes on.

After seeing it previously only on a small TV screen, the viewing was fantastic.As most film and Hitchcock fans know, Shadow of a Doubt is the story of a small town girl who idolizes her uncle, (who she is named after) only to become disillusioned when he visits her and she soon realizes that he is not the wonderful uncle she thinks he is, but is in fact a cold-hearted murderer.The niece (Charlie or Charlotte) is well played by the lovely and talented Teresa Wright (she should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this role). She displays true innocence early in the film, only to turn against her uncle in the end.I did not like Joseph Cotton in the lead role as Uncle Charlie the first time I saw the film. However, recently seeing him on the big screen, I saw a true professional actor, doing a very good job playing a despicable character.Wright mother is played by the wonderful Patricia Collinge (who also played Wright's aunt in The Little Foxes (1941), and played her mother again in the forgotten classic, Casanova Brown (1944). She is truly in love with her brother Charlie and has no clue to his hidden awful secret.Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life) plays Wright's father and Collinge's husband. Travers was 69 (born 1874) when the film was released. A little too old to play the father of Wright and two other small children, but he still is fun in the role.Hume Cronyn plays Travers quirky friend, Herbie. Together they relax after work, by describing ways they could kill each other and get away with it. Cronyn (a wonderful and underrated actor) nearly steals the film with his whimsical banter with Travers.MacDonald Carey plays a detective hot' on Cotton's trail. He plays the romantic interest for Wright. Their romance is forced and not believable. He is the worst part of the film.The script by Thorton Wilder and Hitcock's wife Alma Reville has some minor problems.Who are these detectives (two on the East coast and two in Califonia) who are looking for Uncle Charlie?

After seeing it previously only on a small TV screen, the viewing was fantastic.As most film and Hitchcock fans know, Shadow of a Doubt is the story of a small town girl who idolizes her uncle, (who she is named after) only to become disillusioned when he visits her and she soon realizes that he is not the wonderful uncle she thinks he is, but is in fact a cold-hearted murderer.The niece (Charlie or Charlotte) is well played by the lovely and talented Teresa Wright (she should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this role). She displays true innocence early in the film, only to turn against her uncle in the end.I did not like Joseph Cotton in the lead role as Uncle Charlie the first time I saw the film. However, recently seeing him on the big screen, I saw a true professional actor, doing a very good job playing a despicable character.Wright mother is played by the wonderful Patricia Collinge (who also played Wright's aunt in The Little Foxes (1941), and played her mother again in the forgotten classic, Casanova Brown (1944). She is truly in love with her brother Charlie and has no clue to his hidden awful secret.Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life) plays Wright's father and Collinge's husband. Travers was 69 (born 1874) when the film was released. A little too old to play the father of Wright and two other small children, but he still is fun in the role.Hume Cronyn plays Travers quirky friend, Herbie. Together they relax after work, by describing ways they could kill each other and get away with it. Cronyn (a wonderful and underrated actor) nearly steals the film with his whimsical banter with Travers.MacDonald Carey plays a detective hot' on Cotton's trail. He plays the romantic interest for Wright. Their romance is forced and not believable. He is the worst part of the film.The script by Thorton Wilder and Hitcock's wife Alma Reville has some minor problems.Who are these detectives (two on the East coast and two in Califonia) who are looking for Uncle Charlie?

Not because of the gore or violence, but because of all of the colors, lights, and the eerie music. Suspiria is about an American dancer, Suzy Banyon, who travels to Europe to attend a ballet school in the middle of the woods. While staying there, Suzy makes some new friends, but also begins to notice strange things happening at the school that she can't explain. Then people start to die in really gruesome ways, and it appears that something along the lines of witchcraft is involved.I don't want to spoil it, but this isn't a slasher movie (like it may sound from my brief plot outline). It is more of a supernatural murder-mystery type film. Suspiria really sets a mood and a feeling for it, and the music by Goblin is creepy and unlike anything I've heard before. The score itself is enough to give you the creeps - it's very effective. It has an intense, unique atmosphere too, primarily because of the amazing sets and the vivid colors. The colors used here are great, all kinds of bright pinks, blues, yellows, etc, usually contrasting with bloody murders and gruesome images, resulting in an interesting final product. Not often to do you see such bright tones in horror films, and that makes this film really stand out. The whole movie is very colorful, and is surely eye candy, this even includes the colorful tones of blood used in the movie. There are also some creative and extremely violent murders that will have you wanting to look away from the screen. Good acting from all involved, (Harper leads the film well) and wonderful, surrealistic direction by Argento. The opening scene was very, very gruesome, and sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is peppered with some solid jolts, savage murders, and hallucinatory visuals. And the final 12 minutes are guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat - I know that I sure was. I'd recommend this, and if you want to buy it on DVD, get the 3-disc limited edition set, it's the way to go. Trust me, I bought it and it's a lot better than the regular DVD release, it includes the regular film disc with a slew of features, and the 2 additional discs are a documentary and the hair-raising soundtrack CD. They even threw in some collectible stills and a thick booklet. The price is worth owning this classic in such a nice set.Overall, Suspiria is a horror masterpiece with beautiful colors contrasting with brutal carnage, threaded together in a mystery that will hold the viewer's attention the whole way through. It's not often that you find a horror film that is quite so graceful and artistic, and Suspiria is one of the few. Not to mention the score Argento uses, which will draw you in and set an uncomfortable, spooky mood -it's difficult to describe, and almost one of those things you have to see for yourself - granted, it's probably not a movie for everyone. For me though, this stands as one of the best horror films of all time. 10\/10.

No one can deny that, I still remember the first time I saw it I was about 8 and every time the shark came out my cousin and I would just jump over the sofa because it would scare us so bad. To date I still have a hard time going into the ocean with out thinking that there is a crazy killer shark out there. The scene where the little boy gets killed was one that haunted me when I was little even though I was in the pool. Every time I get on one of those floating devices I have a flashback to that movie. That is a brilliant movie. Who would have thought that a movie that had so many problems like it did would become a cult classic. So many movies have tried to do the shark movie but this one will always be number one. The acting was great and it absolutely draws you in from start to finish.

My favorite part was when Johnny and Baby were playing around to the music of Mickey and Sylvia's Love is Strange which was one of the songs I loved when I was a teenager. But I think I loved all the movie, especially when I went out to buy the DVD which had a lot of background info on it. The cast was perfect. The song at the end by the camp staff reminded me of the summer camps I had been to. The music I didn't originally like that much, but it has grown on me and I think it was perfect for the film.

It was so well made it had me eating out of it's hand and asking what's going to happen now? - nothing was the answer. Julianne Moore plays Carol White, a housewife who doesn't seem to be well at all. Is her illness genuine? Is it in her head? and all such questions are thrown at you and a good amount of suspense is built up and just as you're waiting for the big revelation, or at least a clue as to what's really happening the credits start rolling. Needless to say, this is just my opinion, there are some viewers who would enjoy this sort of end to the film and sit chewing over it for an hour or so after, myself, I wanted some answers. As said before the film is very well made and Haynes' directing and the score are used brilliantly, the film holds an internal intensity that was great to watch, but if you were to watch it, be aware of the ambiguity ahead, otherwise you'll just have the what, that's it? feeling that I had, which for me, swept the rug out of most of what I had just enjoyed.

His performance would be on my top 10 best male performances of all time, next to PS Hoffman in Capote since that was a brilliant performance. When an actor plays a blind character, there are ways to tell if he is really looking at things or if he is just faking. With Pacino, you really believed he was blind because he never appears to look at anything, and he is extremely perceptive. Blind people rely on their already heightened other 4 senses anyway.The movie also has some great lines from Pacino as well. It's a serious drama, but there is a lot of comedy too.

It may not be an artistic masterpiece but it shows what Hollywood could do at its very best.It's a murder mystery wrapped around a love story, with the stiff self-contained Dana Andrews as the investigating detective and the eyeball-coagulatingly gorgeous Gene Tierney as the supposed corpse he falls in love with.Every aspect of the production seems to come together -- the lighting, the decor, the wardrobe, the photography, and the players. The scene in which Andrews, half drunk on Tierney's fine scotch, falls asleep in a chair and is awakened by Tierney's arrival can be played repeatedly by itself and enjoyed each time.The film is filled with splendid little signs of genuine talent at work. Tierney returns from the dead and has no idea what's been happening, so she demands an explanation from Andrews. The writers could have come up with a clumsy scene in which the detective explains to the recently revived victim what the viewer already knows. Instead, rather than answering her questions, Andrews picks up a newspaper and hands it to her. It takes about five seconds for the astonished woman to learn what she needs to.I think I'll quibble now. I had a little trouble with three things.The maid, Betsy, played by Dorothy Adams, is treated like a devoted dolt. She overacts and is given to shrieking. She's so dumb that she needs Tierney's reassurance, Don't worry, Betsy. I'm not a ghost, really I'm not. If the dialog for the other characters is relatively sophisticated (even Andrews has heard of Sibelius) the writers seem to have no ear for the speech of the working folks.I had trouble too with Clifton Webb. People warned Preminger not to use him because he hadn't made any sound pictures before, and because he flits. I don't care if he flits or not but that Midwestern accent just doesn't allow him to sound viperish enough. Ridiculous comes out as ree-DICKulous. Honest, they needed George Sanders for the job.And maybe he's sophisticated and acerbic but we only really know about that because everybody tells us about it, Webb most of all. I dee-molished his ree-diculous theories, says Webb about the painter Jacoby. What theories are they? The script strains and grunts and creaks at the joints as it reaches for archness and wit and it winds up with lines like, If you come a little closer, my boy, I can just crack your head with my stick. It's determinedly middle-brow. The insults don't sing. And although Webb projects self absorption, he can't really show us any ironic distance from the goings on.Well, as long as I'm carping, let me add that Andrews' falling for Tierney is believable enough, but her falling for him after a day or two filled with conflict and suspicion, is a bit on the impulsive side as far as her character goes. When it comes to that, what is her life with Andrews -- a tough, blunt cop -- going to be like after they're married. What is she going to do when he can't come up with another fox fur? How about when he falls asleep and snores at Sibelius concerts?But those remarks shouldn't keep you from seeing the film at the first chance you have. It's a very good one.
