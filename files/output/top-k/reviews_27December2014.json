I go this on Blu Ray and sat down with my girlfriend to see this classic I had heard so much about.Straight away I related to Travis (De Niro), quiet guy, keeps to himself, works hard and he doesn't like what he sees around him. The amount of 'scum' which exist in this world is scary at times and you either do something about it or you don't, Travis as a Taxi Driver sees this on a daily basis, you can see how it bothers him however he can keep a lid on his temper (for a while).Loneliness is a big part of this movie, Travis explains the hours he works and that would be a nightmare for most people, but not for Travis. He has nobody to see, he has nobody he has to take time out of his day just so he can spend a day or night with. The first attempt he makes at doing this is with Betsy and to his joy it goes well for a couple of dates, but then she leaves him confused, angry and worst of all alone. The scene where Travis decides to purchase weapons and take action is one of my favourites, this is the decisive scene on which Travis decides he's got nothing to lose.Well to summarise this is right behind Goodfellas for my favourite Scorsese movie, the journey was hard and gritty, you could really feel how Travis felt and then other times you had no idea how he was portraying the events he was seeing. The shootout at the end was brutal and gory, a satisfying ending to the life of the scum which Travis had taken out, but not as satisfying as knowing that Travis would live to fight another day. The hard truth though is what he did was great, but there is thousands more of guys out there like that and there is just no way of fully stopping them. As for De Niro's performance it was a 10\/10, he was Travis Bickle that man was as real as you and I. The scene where he pretends to shoot himself as he's bleeding out just shows you what loneliness, depression, society had done to him. Perfectly directed, a tough, rough showing and also a very nicely played cameo from Scorsese as the mad passenger who told Travis about his plans to kill his wife.

The most notable 80s Western is probably Silverado (from 85), which while being somewhat entertaining, is entirely too long with too many somber, interchangeable characters. And, yes, I'm counting 'Unforgiven(from 92)' in the list of dull post- 1980s Westerns with it's pompous sense of self-importance and array of forgettable characterizations. Also, there is the ambitious yet monumentally monotonous 'Wyatt Earp(from 94)', which somehow manages to go LOWER than both Silverado and Unforgiven in terms of underperforming. It's an ironic twist because Silverado and Wyatt Earp both feature Kevin Costner and Costner basically stole Silverado as a minor character giving the liveliest, most engaging performance while being the polar opposite in Wyatt Earp, a super-serious, somber, eternally sad lawman.This film that I'm reviewing TOMBSTONE (1993) is the polar opposite of those 3 movies. Instead of lack of, there is too much of. Too many characters who blatantly over-act and shout their lines. Scenes punctuated with overdramatic, pumped-up music that's supposed to engage and move the viewer, but instead sounds extremely annoying. Too simplistic, unreal sounding dialog that comes across as laughable upon close scrutiny.'Tombstone' stars the usually reliable Kurt Russell as the infamous lawman Wyatt Earp, who arrives in the lawless frontier town circa 1880 via train along with his brothers Virgil (played by vet Sam Elliott, probably my 3rd fave performance in the movie; will get to the other 2 later) and Morgan (played by comical character actor Bill Paxton in a rather bad performance), their respective wives, including Wyatt's common-law wife Maddie (earnestly played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson). Upon arrival, Wyatt and his clan meet up with his longtime associate Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer in a performance deserved of an Oscar nomination). So we've come to my BEST performance in this otherwise lacking film. Kilmer really rises to the occasion delivering an energetic, career-defining performance. But sadly, virtually no one else in the film is even HALF as good as Kilmer. Unlike the rest of the cast, Kilmer balances out the bombast with empathy, compelling the viewer to root and feel for his character. It may not be the most accurate portrayal of the famed dentist-turned-gunfighter, but it certainly is one of the most entertaining.The other significant group in the large ensemble are the actors playing 'The Cowboys', the nemeses of the Earp clan and Holliday. The Cowboys are played by Michael Biehn (as Johnny Ringo, my 2nd favorite performance), Powers Boothe (as leader Curly Bill Brosius), Stephen Lang (as Ike Clanton), Thomas Haden Church (as Billy Clanton), and Michael Rooker (as McMasters), in addition to several other character actors. Except for Ringo, these characters are all too 1-dimensional as villains with absolutely no layers. They're hateable, but not relatable, again Biehn's solid portrayal of the educated, contemplative Ringo being the exception, which is another problem I had Ringo disappears for huge chunks of this movie yet I feel he was the most important member of the Cowboys.Additionally, there's a terrible tacked-on love story between Wyatt and town newcomer Josie (played by Dana Delany), a travelling acting troupe performer. Josie is supposedly the femme fatale role in this movie, but it's hardly believable that Wyatt would be so enamored with a rather plain-looking woman who's about as sexy as a root canal! The acting troupe includes an effeminate actor (played by Billy Zane, getting in early practice for his over-the-top villainous role in 'Titanic'). Like most of the actors in this movie, Zane thought this was a Broadway play! Then there are odd characters like Jason Priestley's who literally just occupy space and give nothing to the proceedings. And I didn't buy for a second Russell as a tough lawman. Too many characters folded against him and I didn't find him intimidating in the least.The acting in this movie isn't very good, but the script has to take a lot of the blame. Much of the dialog is extremely odd, the tone of the film meanders clumsily among elements of comedy, melodrama, and existentialism. It takes itself WAY too seriously to even be taken serious by the viewer. In actuality, I used to think this film was re-watchable, but lately, I see that it's good for maybe only a couple of viewings. The revenge angle is nice because it's always fun to see truly bad guys get their comeuppance, but the characterizations are so poor, you don't really care by the end of the movie. You just want to get to the end!

Paula McFadden (Mason) is a former dancer, she and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Cummings) are living with his actor boyfriend, one day, she returns to her apartment and out of the blue, finds out that she is dumped through a letter, her boyfriend deserts them because he has nailed a film contract, and what is worse, before leaving he sublets the apartment to one of his fellow actor Elliot Garfield (Dreyfuss), after an unpleasant first acquaintance, they merely agree to temporally live under the same roof. But Paula's world has been torn apart, being 32, she is obviously too old to compete in her old vocation, which is quite a grating prejudice of ageism, Elliot is a budding thespian, just being offer a chance play Richard III in an off-off-Broadway production, yet the requirement from the director of playing his role as the queen who wants to be king, a stereotyped homosexual style boggles him.However, the from-foe-to-lover plot (which has become a corny norm in the genre now) of Paula and Elliot has been played out magnificently thanks to Simon's witty script with utterly delectable bickers, and the two leads shape a dynamic duo since Paula is juggling her insecure temperament of whether or not she should trust the man with her inherent attribute of a sucker for romance, whereas for Elliot, his feelings for her is prone to be a love-at-first-sight type, with a patina of verbal negation. Simon does prove that he has a keen eye to man-woman relationship, both sex carry an equal weight during the process and the equilibrium is maintained beautifully until the romance breaks out, not creative but essentially moving. Dreyfuss impresses with his top-notch elocution and genial spirit, leans on a more natural impulse other than rehearsed theatrics to be credible and engaging, also he looks rather older than his real-age, his Oscar victory would be very difficult to repeat now since Academy has shied away from awarding good-natured type of excellency decades ago, Elliot basically is a nice young man who has barely any bone to pick with, he is a bit finicky but never aggravates into the dark side. So does Mason, who possesses an obliging quality and her emotional turbulence is the main allure of the film, she is spontaneously approachable and compassion-arousing, which also functions as a magnet when the same scenario occurs to Elliot, we have no doubt what will happen, but it is Mason's heartfelt investment pulls off the feel-good ending and leaves us not grudge how lame it is. Also Quinn Cummings is nominated for an Oscar, the levelheaded but sensible daughter is always the catalyst between two adults, she is adorable and never a spoiled nuisance unlike nowadays her equivalents in the same breed. After all, THE GOODBYE GIRL is a much well-intentioned and well-executed comedy than another Ross-Simon production California SUITE (1978, 5\/10), definitely a crowd- pleaser.

I understand that everything that is depicted in George's life did eventually serve a purpose in the context of the narrative, but if I'm being honest I found the journey from A to B to be rather uninteresting. The other problem is that this uninteresting aspect of George's life is dragged out for about 2\/3 of the film (had the film been 90 minutes long that probably would have been just about OK, but in a film that is over 2 hours long it's just unforgivable). I just couldn't get involved in the story, I didn't care about the characters and pretty much lost interest in the film.Focusing on the positives, I thought that Stewart was excellent and this is probably the best I've ever seen from him. Likewise, Donna Reed was also really good and I thought that they both had really good chemistry together.Another big positive to be taken from this film is its message and the best way I can describe it without spoiling anything is 'Be Careful what you wish for'. The last 30 minutes of this film were excellent and if I was to rate the last 30 minutes alone I would give it a 9 or a 10. The ending of the film is particularly good and is actually quite moving and it's just a shame that the first 2\/3 of the film was so boring.Even though I've only rated this film a 4 out of 10, I would still recommend watching this film because as a 'message' film it's absolutely first rate. However, no matter how good the message is with this film, for me, it didn't make up for how tedious and boring the majority of the film was as a whole.

Truthfully, I am a fan of neither film and of the Best Picture nominees for that year, I would most assuredly have picked The Shawshank Redemption over both without hesitation.Forrest Gump is a simple story about a simple man - expanded over an arrogant nearly 3 hour running time. A Southern man of low I.Q., whose good intentions and well-meaning heart allow him to triumph over the obstacles and adversities life throws his way. The film opens with Forrest sitting on a park bench regaling others with his exploits, such as his outrunning bullies and becoming a football hero, his tour in Vietnam which led to a successful shrimping business and his enduring love for his childhood friend, Jenny.Director Robert Zemeckis can be a great director and the first hour of Forrest Gump is very good. It establishes a tone of bemused whimsy that the material requires. Unfortunately, bemused whimsy is a hard tone to maintain, especially when your film has such a slight plot, a running time that would be a strain with the best material, and a central character that is, let's face it, not particularly fascinating. By the midway section, the film starts to stumble and then completely implodes right around the time that Forrest starts running back and forth from coast to coast for no apparent reason.For comedic measure and a degree of relevance, the story tries to shoehorn Forrest in with historic figures, fads and events, some of which work well and some not at all. The tie-in with Watergate and Forrest showing his wound to Nixon are amusing, but his scene on the National Mall at an anti-war protest where the microphone cuts out so the crowd can remain clueless that he is an imbecile is ridiculously coy. And the sequence with John Lennon, where it is obvious the words do not match the lip movements is downright embarrassing. The Oscar for special effects here is a real stretch.Tom Hanks can be a great everyman actor (like James Stewart). He can also be overrated and it is to his misfortune that the two films for which he won back to back Oscars are two of his most overrated efforts. One can see politically in Oscar circles why he would win for Philadelphia, but the win for Forrest Gump the next year is most puzzling. Forrest has very little range emotionally or intellectually, and he largely reacts to everything the same way.Sally Field seems oddly miscast as Forrest's mother, who apparently gifted her son with his low-rent fortune cookie advice. Gary Sinise provides the film's only really great performance as Forrest's Vietnam superior and later friend - providing some of the grit and emotion that the remainder of the film lacks.In the pivotal role of Jenny - the girl who Forrest has loved since childhood - Robin Wright is a complete wash-out. The film keeps returning to her character, who has become an embittered drug addict and it founders every time it does. Jenny may have her reasons for her addictions, but she is often played as a shrewish selfish person, who takes Forrest's help when convenient, and shuns him when she is finished with him. Hanks and Wright have no chemistry together and because of her shoddy treatment of Forrest, I cannot imagine anyone rooting for them as a couple. A foolishly lengthy mid-film sequence with Jenny on a ledge contemplating suicide actually had one witty film-goer in my audience begging her to jump - I concur. Her final moments in the film are especially absurd - as she once again shows up to prey on Forrest's good will - this time announcing that she is dying from some mystery illness which seems to be AIDS although the filmmakers refuse to say and she wants Forrest to care for her son, which she assures him is his (although we as an audience are not really sure given the characters chronic dishonesty). This strange disease seems to have been borrowed from Love Story, as Wright's only major symptom seems to be that she gets more luminous and has better lighting the closer to death she gets.The final hour of the film is near unendurable. The whimsy has been lost and the events surrounding Forrest just seem to get sillier and more pointless. As a character on which to hang a film, Forrest is largely a slow-witted blank. He ends the film almost exactly as he starts it. He has had no great epiphanies or insights or much in way of growth - he has been largely a passive passenger riding the wave of life. The film's meme that good-hearted people will always get what's coming to them is beyond naive and a tad insulting - as there are many good-hearted people who have the opposite happen. Ironically, we never get to see the expressions or reactions of the people Forrest victimizes with his tales, which may be intentional since they may have run screaming from the park bench or just passed out in bored apathy.

I was also curious to see the director's cut, which is evidently 20 minutes longer.It was easy for me to spot those extra 20 minutes, the only scenes I did not recognize. They were, primarily, the two scenes dealing with Salieri's suggestion to Costanza that she return later and spend the night with him if she wants him to see that Mozart gets the appointment as music teacher to the princess, and the two scenes dealing with the wealthy noble with the noisy dogs who is looking for a music teacher for his shy daughter. The second pair of scenes really adds nothing to the movie. The first two cast Salieri in even a more negative light. None of them is in any way necessary, and the two scenes in the country do slow the movie down. At 160 minutes, the movie never dragged for me.

Characters are not talking but there is a narrator talking instead of there being title cards.There was a time, long ago, when slapstick was still smart. This Charlie Chaplin movie is an example of that era. Gold Rush is actually funny despite the comedy being based on physical slapstick. There are no penis jokes or poop jokes needed to make this movie funny (unlike the modern comedies). Although most of the comedy comes from Charlie Chaplin's physical hijinks, the commentary of the narrator can be quite witty as well. You will probably not be laughing loudly, but Gold Rush is worth plenty of smiles.The story is about Charlie Chaplin's character in Alaska during the gold rush there. Some of the content in which the film finds its comedy is actually surprisingly macabre. Although the movie is entertaining, it did get a little boring in the middle. The performances are not so captivating and the humour is not so great as to keep you entertained the whole time. Also, the ending seems to be an afterthought. It feels rushed, like the story skips about 10 minutes worth of story that should have explained what happened to a couple of the characters.The movie looks interesting. There are some special effects done using miniatures and a technique whereby the characters from one film are pasted over the background of another film. The shots of mock up models are interchanged with the close up shots of the real thing, like for example there is a live bear involved but during certain scenes it becomes a dude in a costume. The effects look very fake, but nonetheless interesting. In 1925 these were probably really advanced special effects.Gold Rush does not feel particularly special.

The cinema reason is so that I can enjoy the horror-movie and movie like this. Yes, maybe just in the movie I believe in ghost. But, usually ghost-movie is identical with horror, and The Sixth Sense make the very opposite perspective. A ghost-cinema with humanity approach. There are two main idea of this review, humanity in people who sees ghost and in spirit itself.The basic idea is human knows to be human.

Let's say, if you look people with leprosy or other horrible disease, you will afraid of them, especially help them. This is what I get, everybody even ghost need to be listened. In real life, you can learn from people with acute health or physical problem. Of course, it takes time and great bunch of tolerance, but at the end we can see the joy of caring other people.From the core of movie, let's review the extrinsic part. So twisted and simple. The story is just nothing but superb. That's why I rated it 8 out of 10. Why not 9, because the cinematography is also simple, the setting is monotonous. But, what's good in movie, is just the original yet unique idea. This movie just make another breakthrough of how should we see ghost added by wonderful story and natural acting. Just another great cinema in 1999 epic year of movie.

It's hard to tell. Yes, it made a fair amount of money at the box office and spawned a couple of (awful, straight to video) sequels, yet it always comes across as quite an 'unloved' little number. Basically, a lot of people objected to its 'dark tone.' The cartoon\/comic source material it was based on was decidedly cheery. Therefore, some objected to setting the film in the dark, seedy back alleys of New York. So, it looks like something Tim Burton would make, yet, every few lines, the writers throw in some hip 'one-liner' to lighten the mood. These two aspects kind of contradict each other. Still... I enjoyed it.However, now I've watched it as an adult, I do see that it's a pretty basic film. Each line\/scene is absolutely essential to moving the plot on. We're introduced to the turtles pretty quickly, given a whistle-stop explanation as to how they became man-sized and brilliant at martial arts, then rushed to the next vital plot-point. Rinse and repeat.I'm not sure how the 'youth of today' would find the film. They may think it's all a little tame. The turtles have just been remade and there's loads of high-action, computer-generated action scenes like it's something out of a Marvel superhero movie. In the 1990 version the most 'special' the special effects ever reached are having someone thrown through a window.Whether the 1990 version will stand up to the test of time is one thing.

This a cheap flick, an attempt to make some money on the success of the 2001. I would say it is something like Terminator 3 or 4, cheap movies based on awesomeness of the originals however it was good entertainment on it's own. Plays were cheesy, Roy Scheider appears as NAGGING MR ALWAYS RIGHT which why I despise him because he had absolutely no talent, playing 100 movies and he has the same character in all of them! The opening scene is probably the most ridiculous when Dr Moisevitch approaches Floyd (Scheider) on the telescope. There is no way that someone could hear Moisevitch's voice while standing on top of the giant telescope! Seriously, how a director or screen writer can make such an obvious mistake? Movie is too noisy, inside spaceships are too dark as of most sci-fi of the period and instead of having an imitation of futuristic electronics, there are monitor screens straight from mid 80s but probably the ending was what made me go ballistic! A new sun was created in the solar system! Sounds cool except that in reality, such phenomena would cause the earth to be over heated and almost all life on planet earth would be destroyed! I'm a great fan of Sci-Fi and I hate open ended movies in which the ending would be left open to be guessed by the audience but what I hate more is cheesy and obviously unscientific answers. I believe an open ended is far better than a sham like this.
