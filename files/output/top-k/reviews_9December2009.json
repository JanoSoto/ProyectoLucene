[{"date":"9 December 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is a lot more than the story of a black boy from the Bronx finding his full realization in both basket-ball and creative writing. This film is a lot more than the skimming of black public high schools by white private high school to find the winning sportsmen they need. This film is a lot more than the story of a black teenager who finds his mentor, a father substitute since he has no father and his elder brother is not the model he wants, in a famous and yet totally marginal writer, Scottish by origin and bird-loving by choice and passion. This film is a lot more than the exacting tyrant a failed writer can become when he decides to compensate his failure in writing by becoming a creative writing and literature teacher. And this film is also a lot more than the phenomenal emotional shock it is for an aging man, diagnosed with cancer, entirely solitary and marginalized to find by accident and the insistence on the side of the foundling, the younger man who is going to be his follow-up next generation. He gets out of his cocoon. He gets out of his seclusion. Even so much that he will save his foundling from academic probation and even open up the door to his future. This film is all that together and a lot more. It is the story of loyalty, commitment and yet betrayal and salvation. Deeply emotional all along the film gets to a poignant ending when the death of the older man is announced by a lawyer to the younger man, and when this younger man is given the full legacy of the older man the keys to the older man's den and sanctuary in the Bronx, a final farewell manuscript letter and the manuscript of his second and posthumous novel to be prefaced by the younger man. The racial problem is dealt with delicately but thoroughly showing how little race has to do with creative imagination, or even plain human love, but also that it has a lot to do with some preconceived ideas that a black basket ball player cannot be a creative writer of any excellence. A film to watch several times just for fun and emotional inspiration. You can always trace and track all the visual or situational allusions to many other films, like Matt Damon as a young lawyer. I have seen that somewhere else. Solve the many riddles of the type like the older man on his old fashioned bike cycling to the private school to save his black younger friend from ostracism and rejection. He just misses a black gown flying around him.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Val de Marne Créteil, CEGID.

I don't see anything necessarily wrong with that. Every story is an advertisement for one or another belief system. A man must stick to his guns and do what he believes is right, even against public opposition. (High Noon, The Fountainhead, and God knows how many others.) Or it's wrong to push ahead in the face of public opinion. (Citizen Kane, etc.) Some belief systems are better than others but even the obviously malignant messages can be well framed. (Triumph of the Will.) The Exorcist, taken for what it is, is a well-constructed and thoroughly spooky film, better than the novel it was based on. Promoting Holy Mother Church may have been necessary in order to enlist the aid of the authorities in filming the story on the campus of Georgetown University. Some of the minor characters are played by real priests. William Friedkin, the director, tells us practically nothing of the back story in his least-informative audio commentary.It hardly seems worthwhile to describe in any detail the narrative itself. A normal young girl (Linda Blair) is possessed by some kind of demon and after many gruesome medical tests is turned over by her terrified mother (Ellen Burstyn) to two priests (Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow) to be exorcised. The clerics get the job done but it costs them their lives.The special effects were superb for their time. The performances are equally good, especially Lee J. Cobb as Lieutenant Kinderman, the cop who is investigating a death associated with the possession. He's been excellent before but never better than here, with his soothing, childlike, and perspicacious presence. Jason Miller is as taut as a 40-pound bow string. Even Linda Blair, who went on to do some awful trash, is thoroughly convincing.The director steps wrong once or twice, revealing a passion not for spiritual enlightenment but commercial success. Having a candle flame flare up and then blow out in a darkened room is a cheap shot but it works. So does a shot in which Jason Miller is hunched over tensely, a ringing phone explodes the silence, and he shouts Huh? and jerks upward. Bob Hope could have done that. But these minor intrusions, though they remind us that what we're watching is just a movie, don't detract from the aplomb with which the rest of the film is handled.It really IS scary!

The film was released in 1997, two years after another Leonard adaptation (Get Shorty). Though it was brushed aside in 1997, Brown's reputation has grown over the years, thanks largely to the way it avoids Tarantino's more annoying tendencies. The film lacks the rapid-fire dialogue, narrative gymnastics and bloody violence of Tarantino's previous two films, and is generally more sedate and easy going. The film's also far less cartoonish than Tarantino's other flicks, perhaps thanks to its central characters, played by Robert Forster and Pam Grier. They're a charming couple, both in their late 40s or early 50s, and lend the film a certain gravitas. They also strike up an interesting relationship which, though it never quite turns romantic, sizzles nevertheless.Restraint, then, separates Jackie Brown from Tarantino's other pictures. The director gives his characters room to breath, fills his film with quieter moments, deaths and murders aren't taken as lightly as is usual, his characters aren't as self-consciously hip and Grier and Forster exude a kind of world-weary disillusionment, both quieter and wiser than the motormouths typical of Tarantino-land. Indeed, one can easily imagine a Humphrey Bogart or a late career Robert Mitchum in the film's Robert Forster role.Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of homages here. Tarantino inserts nods to Black Mamma White Mamma, Vampyros Lesbos and Bucktown, and turns the hero of Leonard's novel from a blonde Caucasian to an African American woman called Jackie Brown, a nod to Pam Grier's blaxploitation classic, Foxy Brown. One song used, Longtime Woman, was itself sung by Grier, and is a nod to The Big Doll House, a 1971 film in which she starred.Many know that Brown's opening shot, in which Bobby Momack's Across 110th Street plays while Grier rides a moving walk-way, is a raging rip-off of The Graduate's opening shot, but it's also ripped right out of the 1972 crime drama Across 110th Street, which is itself the name of a song by Bobby Momack, whom Pam Grier sang back-up for before she began her career in film. In truth, the film is packed with scenes and moments cribbed from other films &#x96; the best moments from Pulp Fiction also reappear here, Travolta and Thurman becoming Gier and Forster - but there's also a certain gravity here that Tarantino's other films lack. Jackie Brown's a tale of unrequited love, a sad romance, and a film about desperate people trying to survive. As Momack's song attests, the film's packed with characters trying to get out of the ghetto alive, doing whatever they have to do to survive. Smooth.Jackie Brown ends with a heist which is shown to the audience from three different points of view. This feels very gimmicky, as no real shocking or interesting new bits of information are revealed to us by the time we reach the third pass; the alert viewer has already predicted how the heist goes down midway into the second point of view sequence. Still, the film is packed with lots of little reveals which do work brilliantly. These reveals range from the subtle (Ordell's hot women on the side is really a battered addict) to the obvious (Jackie pocket's a gun etc). The film then closes on a close up of Grier's face. It's a face Tarantino adores, and one which he manages to elevate above postmodern fetish object. This is in contrast to his next film, Kill Bill, in which his women once again feel more like dolls, reference points and signposts.8.5\/10 &#x96; Slight, but perhaps also some kind of pulp masterpiece. Worth three viewings.

One song used, Longtime Woman, was itself sung by Grier, and is a nod to The Big Doll House, a 1971 film in which she starred.Many know that Brown's opening shot, in which Bobby Momack's Across 110th Street plays while Grier rides a moving walk-way, is a raging rip-off of The Graduate's opening shot, but it's also ripped right out of the 1972 crime drama Across 110th Street, which is itself the name of a song by Bobby Momack, whom Pam Grier sang back-up for before she began her career in film.

Jackie Brown's a tale of unrequited love, a sad romance, and a film about desperate people trying to survive. As Momack's song attests, the film's packed with characters trying to get out of the ghetto alive, doing whatever they have to do to survive. Smooth.Jackie Brown ends with a heist which is shown to the audience from three different points of view. This feels very gimmicky, as no real shocking or interesting new bits of information are revealed to us by the time we reach the third pass; the alert viewer has already predicted how the heist goes down midway into the second point of view sequence. Still, the film is packed with lots of little reveals which do work brilliantly. These reveals range from the subtle (Ordell's hot women on the side is really a battered addict) to the obvious (Jackie pocket's a gun etc). The film then closes on a close up of Grier's face. It's a face Tarantino adores, and one which he manages to elevate above postmodern fetish object. This is in contrast to his next film, Kill Bill, in which his women once again feel more like dolls, reference points and signposts.8.5\/10 &#x96; Slight, but perhaps also some kind of pulp masterpiece.

The film was released in 1997, two years after another Leonard adaptation (Get Shorty). Though it was brushed aside in 1997, Brown's reputation has grown over the years, thanks largely to the way it avoids Tarantino's more annoying tendencies. The film lacks the rapid-fire dialogue, narrative gymnastics and bloody violence of Tarantino's previous two films, and is generally more sedate and easy going. The film's also far less cartoonish than Tarantino's other flicks, perhaps thanks to its central characters, played by Robert Forster and Pam Grier. They're a charming couple, both in their late 40s or early 50s, and lend the film a certain gravitas. They also strike up an interesting relationship which, though it never quite turns romantic, sizzles nevertheless.Restraint, then, separates Jackie Brown from Tarantino's other pictures. The director gives his characters room to breath, fills his film with quieter moments, deaths and murders aren't taken as lightly as is usual, his characters aren't as self-consciously hip and Grier and Forster exude a kind of world-weary disillusionment, both quieter and wiser than the motormouths typical of Tarantino-land.

But to me the foremost reason this movie being timeless is its great   story. It's a real typical mystery\/thriller story, that has a couple of   twists and turns to it. It's unlike for instance the film-noir movies   from the same era, that were somewhat more or less being the 'normal'   mystery\/thriller movies of those days.

His job requires him to constantly manipulate,lie and deceive and he's great at it. But one day, Jerry starts to have second thoughts about the nature of the job, he starts to question himself and ultimately grows a conscience. He proceeds to write a mission statement suggesting a change of behavior and alternatives to the current methods being used by agents, and because of it, he gets fired. Only one client stays with Jerry, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), an egomaniacal football player. Meanwhile Jerry starts a relationship with Doroty (Renée Zellweger), a 26 year old single-mother who worked at his agency but decided to quit and help Jerry because she was inspired by the mission statement and also because she has a crush on him. Now Jerry has to balance his personal life and help his only client reach success... Jerry Maguire it's a good film, entertaining and somewhat engaging, however it does gets a bit touchy-feely and corny at times. The writing has some inconsistencies, for instance; Jerry marries Dorothy, basically because he doesn't know how\/want to be alone. Later on, he starts to question the marriage and his feelings, only to come to the conclusion( after a quick break up) that he does love her. It's just not very good writing, if you ask me. Having said that, Tom Cruise carries the film on his back and delivers a tremendous performance. Now that I'm seeing his old films, no wonder he went on to become such a movie star. He has tons of charisma and it shows on screen. Cuba Gooding Jr was great and very funny as Tidwell, Jerry's only client, but, although he did won one, it's far from being an Oscar-worthy performance. Renée Zellweger was OK and so was the rest of the supporting cast. All in all, Jerry Maguire is not great, but it's still a good time. The film is also known for some lines that have become extremely famous and its funny too see how it all began. Watch it for Cruise's performance and for its classic status.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 December 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Contains one minor spoiler Jerry Maguire it's one of those classics that people talk about and remember for years.

Yes there is sound, but there is no synchronized dialogue until about ten minutes into the film when the police detective and his girlfriend who are the central characters speak to one another. Shooting the film primarily silent with synchronized effects and leaving the talking sequences for segments of the film where dialogue was necessary and then having the judgment to know how much dialogue was enough and stop at that point was something Hitchcock got from the beginning. Watch some of the long-winded speeches from some other 1929 films and realize that many of Hitchcock's contemporaries struggled with this skill.The story is a good one. Alice is feeling neglected by her police detective boyfriend, and follows a handsome artist up to his flat. After some flirting the artist turns suddenly violent and assaults her. She defends herself by grabbing a knife and stabbing the man. Stunned and sure she has not been seen by anyone entering the man's flat, she attempts to erase all signs of her presence there and returns home. She mentions the incident to no one, but is weighted down with guilt.Frank, Alice's boyfriend, investigates the crime scene and sees Alice's glove. He confiscates it. Unfortunately, someone else who is not Alice has the other glove. The lovers don't discuss anything but the threat of the blackmailer until the end of the film. Like many of Hitchcock's later works, much of his art is in furtive glances and in objects that recall the crime rather than specific dialogue. An example of this is a jester in the artist's painting that Alice sees as pointing at her and thus accusing her. The jester meets Alice's eye both immediately after the crime and at the end of the film.Highly recommended as one of the best talking pictures of 1929, but I am yet to find a satisfactory copy on DVD anywhere.

This remake on hearing about it didn't seem too bad; I mean it has a talented cast, a good director and promised to be faithful to the original plot. So what did go wrong? By the way this review has no intention of offending those who love this movie, but in my mind this was not a good movie.I'll tell you what went wrong(for me that is). Everything! This is a perfect example like I've said already of a remake that is inferior in every possible way to the classic original. It is a remake, minus the terror and suspense of the original, and came across as pointless, even more pointless than the remake of the Wicker Man. I know it is thought as unfair to compare originals to its sequels\/remakes, but I feel that I need to compare to show how inferior it was to the Hitchcock.Gus Van Sant... he is a good director, however every scene in the film lack suspense and consequently the whole film came across as bland and lifeless. Plus it is way too stagey. The cinematography was rather jerky and rushed in places, and the lighting is too bright for a very dark and murderous tale. The black and white cinematography was perfect in capturing the creepy mood in the original Psycho. The script was clunky at best, and the murder sequences that were so traumatising in the original are so badly botched thanks to the redundant flash flames.The acting was very poor. I don't love Vince Vaughan and I don't hate him. I just like him, but it is fair to say it is dependent on the film. Vaughan is simply not creepy enough as Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins's performance was phenomenal, with his face, his voice and his mannerisms it was one of the most chilling performances of all time. However Vaughan plays the character like an effeminate hunk and is very monotonic throughout... talk about wasted talent. Anne Heche lacks the determination of Janet Leigh, and is more reminiscent of a kookie cutie. And Julianne Moore deserves better, she was wasted really as her Lila was too aggressive. Plus William H Macy in a ridiculously over-sized suit and hat looks uncomfortable as the private detective. In fact, the only redeeming quality was the modern reference about the dangling earphones, that was hilarious. But on the whole, it is badly acted and falls well short as a remake. 1\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"9 December 2009","score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I just want to say that I love the original movie, then again I love Hitchcock.

The direction is rock solid throughout, and is super efficient. The script is funny and inventive, and the story growing from a very simple idea is engaging and delightful. Plus all the characters are credible. And I have to say Jerry Goldsmith's music is a treat, that man knows how to compose a good music score I can tell you. Haunting, shocking and exciting are three ways to describe the score here. The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite. But the acting from the human actors is just as good. Zach Galligan is bland at first, but as the film gets going and you know more of his character you warm to him. Hoyt Axton is indeed a hoot as the inept inventor, and Keye Luke is great as the Grandfather(Mr Wing). Also watch out for a young Corey Feldman as Pete Fountaine. Plus the Christmas speech makes it essential Christmas viewing. All in all, silly it is, but it is clever and consistently engaging. Not only that, it succeeds at both comedy and horror, and that isn't easy to do. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"9 December 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I will admit some of it is very silly, but all the same it is infectious fun from start to finish.

The film was released years before it ever caught my attention and it obviously wasn't any of the Resident Evil games that lead me to watch it, since I've never played any of them. I first found out about this Paul W.S. Anderson movie when I learned that Milla Jovovich was in it. Before I rented it the other day, I knew it was one of the polarizing modern action blockbusters, but fortunately not one of the universally panned ones. Due to all the criticism, I wasn't expecting a great film, but thought it could be pretty good at best. I can now understand the widespread criticism, but despite the severe flaws, I found some redeeming qualities.Below Raccoon City, there is a top secret underground genetic research facility called the Hive, owned by the extremely powerful Umbrella Corporation. After a vial is broken, releasing a virus, the lab's supercomputer known as the Red Queen locks the Hive to prevent the virus from escaping, trapping and killing all the employees inside! A military unit then takes Alice and Spence, two people suffering from amnesia, and goes to the Hive to investigate what has happened. The head of the commandos, known as the One, explains why they are all here, and several members of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen, but are cut up by a laser! This leaves Alice, Spence, Rain Ocampo, Matt Addison, and Chad Kaplan to continue the mission. They discover that the supercomputer is not the only problem, as the employees who were killed have mutated into flesh-eating zombies, and can now be found all over the facility! From the beginning, I could tell the film wasn't that great, but when the emergency in the Hive begins, so does the suspense! After that sequence, Milla Jovovich, who plays Alice, makes her first appearance in the film naked, waking up in the mansion shower, and this scene could easily be cited as a highlight for straight male viewers like me. The suspense continues as Alice looks around in the mansion, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay consistent. The sci-fi action horror film can be a little hard to follow at times, the music is sometimes really cheesy, and there are some extremely juvenile lines. In addition to that, the characters are underdeveloped, and at least some of them seem like naive high school students who shouldn't be on a mission like this. The acting is nothing special, and Michelle Rodriguez' performance as Rain Ocampo is particularly poor. However, while the walk through the Hive before the mutants are found is pretty dull, there's a lot more adrenaline as the film goes along and the group faces the dangers of this underground facility. Jovovich and her fighting moves were another highlight for me. Also, as usual for these modern action sci-fi blockbusters, there are great sets and special effects in this film.I'm not sure if this video game adaptation deserves the 7\/10 rating I'm giving it. Overall, it is cheesy and juvenile, and probably mainly appeals to young male viewers (younger than me). I realize Paul W.S. Anderson was also the one who directed 1995's Mortal Kombat (another movie based on a video game), and I didn't like that film at all, but for some reason, that wasn't quite the case with this 2002 blockbuster. I'm not sure what I would think of it with a second viewing, but it wasn't bad for one viewing, as much as I think some of the haters have made some good points! If you hate mindless action, you will hate this movie, so don't watch it, and if you like that sort of thing, well, you MIGHT like this first Resident Evil movie, but there's no guarantee. The flaws could still be too much for you to take, and you could end up wondering how anyone could possibly like the movie!

The head of the commandos, known as the One, explains why they are all here, and several members of the team attempt to disable the Red Queen, but are cut up by a laser! This leaves Alice, Spence, Rain Ocampo, Matt Addison, and Chad Kaplan to continue the mission. They discover that the supercomputer is not the only problem, as the employees who were killed have mutated into flesh-eating zombies, and can now be found all over the facility! From the beginning, I could tell the film wasn't that great, but when the emergency in the Hive begins, so does the suspense! After that sequence, Milla Jovovich, who plays Alice, makes her first appearance in the film naked, waking up in the mansion shower, and this scene could easily be cited as a highlight for straight male viewers like me. The suspense continues as Alice looks around in the mansion, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay consistent. The sci-fi action horror film can be a little hard to follow at times, the music is sometimes really cheesy, and there are some extremely juvenile lines. In addition to that, the characters are underdeveloped, and at least some of them seem like naive high school students who shouldn't be on a mission like this. The acting is nothing special, and Michelle Rodriguez' performance as Rain Ocampo is particularly poor. However, while the walk through the Hive before the mutants are found is pretty dull, there's a lot more adrenaline as the film goes along and the group faces the dangers of this underground facility. Jovovich and her fighting moves were another highlight for me. Also, as usual for these modern action sci-fi blockbusters, there are great sets and special effects in this film.I'm not sure if this video game adaptation deserves the 7\/10 rating I'm giving it. Overall, it is cheesy and juvenile, and probably mainly appeals to young male viewers (younger than me). I realize Paul W.S. Anderson was also the one who directed 1995's Mortal Kombat (another movie based on a video game), and I didn't like that film at all, but for some reason, that wasn't quite the case with this 2002 blockbuster. I'm not sure what I would think of it with a second viewing, but it wasn't bad for one viewing, as much as I think some of the haters have made some good points! If you hate mindless action, you will hate this movie, so don't watch it, and if you like that sort of thing, well, you MIGHT like this first Resident Evil movie, but there's no guarantee. The flaws could still be too much for you to take, and you could end up wondering how anyone could possibly like the movie!

In the movie's grotesquely stereotypical idea of Italy, she improbably locates Damon after being completely boorish with a hotel clerk. The hotel clerk, who's old enough to give this girl an earful, instead instantly becomes cooperative, because he has no life, pride, story or values of his own. Bad writing is like that.

At the time I confused it with garden variety mainstream commercial teen oriented pop horror, not understanding the Stephen King & George A. Romero connection. All that I knew was that it was kind of cool, somewhat kinky, and appealed to me on an adolescent level very much in keeping with the concept of a ghoulish, cartoony graphic novel brought to life, complete with some twistedly dark Heavy Metal-ish animated sequences.George Kennedy is a treasure, he actually made some very daring little low budget horror movie appearances in the 1980s that critics regard with disdain (check out a little sickie called DEMONWARP if you ever get a chance). He was an actor and he lived to perform even if the standards of the projects weren't up to the critics approval, and graced those films with a presence that elevated them from the usual teen oriented fare of the era, my favorite being the incomparable DEATH SHIP from 1980. He's in full Grandpa mode here as a tottering seasoned citizen shopkeeper terrorized by a sadistic psychopathic Native American & his crew of dirtbag buddies in the opening Chief Woodin' Head story of the 3 part anthology. Yeah its kind of a shame to see him reduced to such roles, not to mention poor Dorothy Lamour looking positively baffled as his wife. What can you do.The standout segment is of course #2, The Raft from Mr. King's Skeleton Crew collection of short stories. Its a very engaging premise that works on a number of basic levels We are all afraid of huge globs of flesh eating goo that inhabit unknown bodies of water, and we all probably have recollections of summer camp intrigue where you always wanted to be stuck out on the swimming raft with that little hottie from a few cottages up. Its a wonderfully simplistic modern urban legend monster story that's actually been backed up as of recent with a real world report about an eerily similar looking glob of viscous goo that floated into a harbor in Alaska in 2008, then mysteriously disappeared a few days later. Creepy!! Though sadly the filmmakers changed some of the elements of King's original story for a gratuitous T&A thrill that looks like felony sexual battery to me rather than the consensual sex in the book. Then again the point was just to bait us into cheering as the bastard gets devoured at the end. He had it coming, and an interesting theory is that he was deliberately setting her up as a distraction to make a getaway ... who knows??The big laugh out loud conclusion is the infamous THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY! show-stopper, an adaptation of King's story The Hitcher about a clearly psychotic wealthy housewife (Bond actress Lois Chiles, showing her chest briefly) who runs over a hitchhiker while rushing home from a dalliance. And runs him over, and over, and over, and over again. The poor guy's mangled body keeps coming back in even greater degrees of disfigurement & mutilation, which becomes almost comic while at the same time being one of the most disgusting things ever filmed. That the poor hitcher is played by an African American male adds to the film's warped sense of moral off-centeredness. Even in 1987 the racial undertone of the scene was wince inducing, in 2010 era terms its openly problematic. Yet that's how King wrote the story and it helps to place the film in the pre-politically correct social context of when it was made.Which is perhaps the film's greatest charm It is a gleefully lurid little celebration of bad taste that resorts to lowest common denominators, made at a time when nobody gave a damn.
