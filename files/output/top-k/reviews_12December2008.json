Rushmore boasts a stunningly well-written love triangle which is rather implausible, as are many of the events which occur in the film, but because the characters feel so absolutely real one can believe it. The Darjeeling Limited is perhaps the only film which is really evocative of how that sort of trip, especially in a foreign country, feels. The Royal Tenenbaums is the most far-fetched and quirky of his films other than The Life Aquatic, but it doesn't matter because Anderson again grounds the film in reality by making the characters feel real.Once again the usual criticism of Anderson's films being too quirky and all that falls apart simply because it's not there for its own sake. I didn't hate Diablo Cody's Juno as much as some others, but while there are people who may talk like that the whole thing is far too cutesy and adolescent to earn my respect. I can see Cody or the director Reitman attempting to show off what they think is musical knowledge by name-dropping. Anderson isn't interested in such things, the music in his film serves a purpose always, the characters' quirks exist not simply because it's 'cute', and again his and Owen Wilson's writing here is simply tremendous. Like another IMDb member put it he treats every character with respect, but doesn't take any one of them too seriously.The Royal Tenenbaums was Anderson's most ambitious film when he made it. It's got the largest and probably most diverse group of characters, he pushes the style he fully formed with Rushmore to the max. I noticed on this viewing, having seen Rushmore just a week earlier, that Anderson appears more confident in dealing with exposition visually. The efficiency of characterization in Rushmore was remarkable, and I do think it is a superior film to this ultimately, but much of the exposition in that film was handled through dialogue. While there is some well-handled narration here, there are also several quick montages (reminiscent of the one detailing Max's extra-curricular activities in Rushmore) which convey a lot of information with great efficiency. This movie strikes a great balance between drama and humor, and Anderson is a phenomenal storyteller who lets the audience dictate their level of involvement and interest. He never pushes any information on you, and if you're not really paying attention you'll likely miss a lot of important characterization, even if you follow the general plot just fine. The efficiency of the storytelling is particularly noticeable in this film, considering just how much is covered here.The cast are pretty much perfect, with Gene Hackman giving the best performance of his career (and that's really saying something). Anderson's direction is as controlled and deliberate as can be, but without stifling the material, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The script is great too, and while it's not my favorite Anderson film it is a significant entry in his filmography, not that he has made any 'lesser' films just yet.

To the rest of the world (who actually have friends and watch movies), Dr. Strangelove is nothing more than a somewhat amusing movie, and that's it. I think Kubrick himself never intended it to be anything but the latter.I don't judge movies on their importance to cinema. If I did, any movie over fifty-years-old would have to earn a perfect score, despite what I actually thought of it. I think that is a cheap, dishonest way of reviewing. With that said, I am a fan of Kubrick, and I still found little in Dr. Strangelove that was worth viewing. The actually humorous moments are few and far between, and are almost always dry jokes that would make your grandfather laugh, but do nothing to the generation desensitized by American Pie and Superbad. Maybe Dr. Strangelove is simply a generational movie, which I could understand. I don't expect the next generation to love the same movies I love now.So what makes this movie deserve the score I'm giving it? For one, the boring factor. The movie is an hour and a half, but it felt more like five. Scenes drag on to the point of ridiculousness, trying, I assume, to flesh out the paper-thin plot. There is barely enough content here to actually make a short film, much less a full-length movie. The characters all just seem like cartoon gimmicks, only there to drive the plot. The characters aren't like the characters in Pulp Fiction where they're realistically absurd, they're just absurd. And that gets old fast.Also, there is nothing here that other war parodies haven't done before it and done better. The only difference here is that this one has a big-name director, whereas the others didn't. You've seen most of these jokes before countless times. Even the ones you haven't seen countless times are smile-worthy at most.The genius of making a parody where we march happily to our own execution is really nothing special either. What else is there for a war parody to do? It takes little imagination whatsoever, even for 1964. Political cartoons did it years upon years before that date. That's why when I say there is very little, if anything, truly original or creative about Dr. Strangelove, it's overshadowed by the countless parody clichés. Does that mean it's less amusing? Yes. When you hear a joke more than once, it's hard to laugh at it again.Overall, Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is just a Disney cartoon done in like action with a prolific director at the help. Nothing more. Nothing less. The hype is absolutely ridicules, and I don't care how many not helpful votes I get for this. Someone needs to realize these pretentious classics aren't classics at all.

It's a tough job but someone has to do it. Nikolai apparently saves Kallunda from a public execution at his own risk which has the desired effect of making Kallunda trust him, as Nikolai spends time with Kallunda & eventually meets Sundata he realises that he has been fighting for the wrong side & wages a one man war on his own country & it's army in order to liberate Africa & it's people...This South African, American & Namibian co-production was directed by Joseph Zito & I actually had quite high hopes for Red Scorpion in a cheesy over-the-top testosterone filled late 80's action flick of the kind they just don't make anymore sort of a way but after wasting 100 odd minutes on this rather mundane & boring film I realised why they don't make these sorts of films anymore as Red Scorpion exemplifies just about everything wrong with the late 80's & early 90's action flick fad. I like my action films with plenty of action & gratuitous violence in them, unfortunately Red Scorpion actually tries to have some sort of meaning & say something relevant about world events at the time. Now, I'm all for a bit of drama & seriousness if it's done properly but having the Sweedish actor Dolph Lundgren playing a Russian in Africa finding his true self, redemption & have him join some tribe or other in which he then instantly sympathises with the whole country & realises how bad & evil his own country is while running around in nothing but shorts & sandals with a silly haircut is not the way to go about it. Right? A lot of the running time of Red Scorpion is devoted to Lundgren wondering around as he develops a conscience, yawn. Where's all the action? Where are all the one-liners? Where is the obligatory love interest for Lundgren to save at the end? Why is Red Scorpion so boring & quite frankly dull? These Russians can't be that smart can they? I mean you have invaded Africa & have waged war on it's people so who do you send in to kill one of your biggest enemies? That's right a huge soldier with a Russian accent. Yeah, that's going to work isn't it? I mean I am sure every African will help big Lundgren, totally & utterly trust him & give him pretty much anything he wants. Wouldn't you? For my money Red Scorpion has too much preaching & moralising with the main plot an obvious take on apartheid & the events in Africa at the time. I usually like big, dumb, brainless action flicks but I found Red Scorpion seriously dull.Even the action sequences aren't that good, they feel too random with lots of shoot-outs where lots of people are shot but you never feel Lundgren is in danger & of course all the bad guy's have terrible aims & can't shoot straight. Lots of things blow up too but for no real reason & Lundgren is rarely in the same shot so again there's no threat there or last minute escapes or anything of that sort. For all we know these explosions could be happening twenty miles from where Lundgren is. There's a reasonable car chase about twenty minutes in but it's ruined by a very inappropriate & somewhat annoying song on the soundtrack. The violence is also disappointing, there's barely any fighting or hand to hand combat in it & there's not much blood either. A guy sticks some spikes into Lundgren as a form of torture & Lundgren shoots a soldiers arm off but other than that this is actually surprisingly tame.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 Red Scorpion was shot in Namibia in Africa & therefore breaking an international boycott of the country for it's apartheid regime which this film ironically tries to highlight, apparently the budget for the film was pulled & the cast & crew were stuck there for three months while the money was got back. The cast is alright although Lundgren is awful, it's always nice to see Brion James in something but what happened to his character who seemingly disappears half way through the film.Red Scorpion is a anti apartheid drama disguised as an action film & a bad action film at that.

The awful script also features a roster of thoroughly annoying characters just begging for an axe in the face, including redneck farmer Ethel, her moronic son Junior, a pair of leather-jacketed greasers who suffer from car trouble, a black delinquent with 'soul glow' hair and his Vanity-alike girlfriend, and an alternative\/punk girl who does robotic dancing.

Those movie were really popular- and flourished in the '40's. I must say though that during that time period some better genre movies. A lot better and more powerful movies. Only thing that still makes this movie good and a bit more special is Orson Welles his touch.It's funny how basically every Orson Welles movies seems so ahead of its time. It's techniques, it's storytelling. It's all something you wouldn't expect from an '40's movie but more from one made decades later. Also Welles his love for the radio shows in this movie. The movie is being made and told as a radio show, only with moving of course added to it, with Welles providing his own voice for the narration. Prior to this movie, Welles also made a radio show of the novel, this movie as well is being based on. For this, he used most of the actors that also star in this movie.The movie really doesn't feature the best known actors from its era but everyone is simple well cast and suits their roles superbly. It even earned Agnes Moorehead an Oscar nomination. She really earned it as well in my opinion. She played the best character out of the movie and was truly splendid in her role. Her acting style didn't really seemed like anything common for '40's standards, which is perhaps the reason why her acting and characters stands out so much in the movie.A problem I had with the movie though is that it was too long and just not always interesting to watch. Well, the movie actually isn't long at all with its 88 minutes but still the movie feels like a 3 hour drama production. Hard to say if this is Orson Welles his fault really, since it were the studios that 'butchered' this movie by cutting out 50 minutes of it, through editor and later turned famed director Robert Wise. Maybe Welles his version was a better flowing one, with some more drama and other moments added to it. We will never known, since the 'original' Welles version is most likely lost forever.Nevertheless it otherwise still is a superior made movie, with some wonderful new fresh used techniques.

His nemesis is Dr. Evil, also played by Myers, a bastardization of Blofeld of the early Bond films. Evil's plan is to cryogenically freeze himself and then come back in the future to try and hold the world ransom. Powers does the same and both are reawakened in the year 1997. This time travel element is probably to not alienate younger viewers who have no sense of the 1960s.Myers really showcases his talent for the first time in this film. Both Powers and Dr. Evil are unique, funny and likable. The strength of Dr. Evil in particularly is his sensitive side that we don't see in many villains in comedic films. Powers is such a strong protagonist because he brings some catchy 60s British jargon that is largely unexposed at this point to American audiences and other countries.

I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.The story is about an investment banker named Nicholas Van Orton(Michael Douglas in one of his best roles) who is greedy and self centred and who lives alone in his huge mansion. His brother(Sean Penn) gives him a card telling him to contact the company and it is his birthday present to him. What follows is absolute edge of the seat stuff and it shows David fincher at a time when he made some of the finest movies ever seen in Hollywood. In the midst of all this, he meets a waitress named Christine. Revealing more might spoil the movie for you as it is a fun roller-coaster ride with many twists and turns.What impressed me about this movie was the atmosphere throughout the movie. It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music.

It is classic David fincher with the dark tone and great background music. The camera work is excellent especially in the scene where his father falls down to his death. These scenes also show another side to Nicholas van orton and indicate why he became the way he is. He starts out as a one dimensional guy but then when faced with crisis he shows so many sides. I feel the game is more a character study because it shows the myriad changes in his behaviour throughout the movie. Rather than depending on gimmicky twists and quick editing(which is the popular way of making movies today), The Game depends solely on atmosphere and the strength of its performances. Deborah Kara Unger gives a great performance as a character with shades of grey. She is the perfect person for this character with her mysterious look. Sean penn as usual gives a great performance but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time.Another aspect of the movie is the dark humor. Michael Douglas gives certain comments with a deadpan delivery that makes it even more humorous. In many ways the Game can be described as a satire on society and how people forget the most important things in life when pursuing success. It is interesting how facing a crisis brings out the most basic emotions in people and how it changes people is the basic theme of this movie. We experience the same emotions as Nicholas and thus it becomes a ride where we don't know the truth till the last moment.I had tears in my eyes at the end and the credit should go to the direction and the music. The slow motion sequence at the end is also well done and this has got to be one of the best endings of all time.10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"12 December 2008","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised.

Goldfinger really kicks off both Bondmania and the whole Bond Machine. while the next picture Thuderball, is the one that has the massed lines and craze, it was because of the groundwork set by the first three movies, of which Goldfinger put it all together.So, what is the Formulaic Bond??? 1. pre-titles sequence (already done in From Russia With Love), but more developed here. 2. The titles themselves hit their stride (though Binder did not work on them in this film or the next, they were done in his style) and become the stereotypical Bond titles. 3. the megalomaniac with the plot to rule the world or create world-wide chaos (whether independently or as part of SPECTRE) 4. The Great Chase- some kind of intense chase involving lots of vehicles and crashes 5. The Bond gadgets- all kinds of cool tools and toys to help the secret agent become a super-agent. 6. The Bond Girls (good and Bad), including the overt use of the naughty names (Sylvia Trench was subtle, but beginning with Pussy Galore, the boundaries were pushed. 7. Lots of explosions and the big fight scene (usually at the resolution of the primary plot). 8. Exotic locations (Kentucky may not be, but Switzerland and others certainly are). 9. Bond getting captured and the madman explaining his plans and Bond's subsequent miraculous escape from elaborate death sentences. 10. The exotic henchmen and thugs who beat up Bond then get killed later on. There are more, but these elements all come together for the first time in this movie.The plot revolves around Bond being asked to look into an Auric Goldfinger as some suspect he is illegally smuggling gold. As Bond investigates further and deeper he uncovers a much deeper plan involving a scheme to destroy America's gold reserve.Connery is obviously at ease as Bond in this third go-round, all all the MI6 supporting cast is present (M, Moneypenny, Q as played by Desmond Llewelyn). Outside of the slightly hair-brained plot of the bad guys (though, perhaps more potentially relevant today than then), the movie is scripted and acted well. The only weaknesses are more in the subtle messages leftover from Flemings novel. While some of these may be problems of the era and some may just be misinterpreted, the fact remains that Fleming had a definite attitude against woman, bordering on misogyny, and women are either just eye-candy cuties, not very bright, or bullish near dikes with little feminine qualities until James Bond defeats them (and converts them. In the novel of the same name, Pussy Galore and her squadron are Lesbians, and the movie tries to hint at it- look at the somewhat mannish demeanors of the sexy-suited flyers.This movie and the next two Connery outings (Thunderball and You Only Live twice) follow this formula to great success and entrench the formula firmly in the films. Lazenby's On Her Majesty's Secret Service followed this formula to a lesser degree, but it returns full force in Diamonds are Forever. Goldfinger sets the mold for all Bond films, as does it well before the formula eventually tires and goes stale by the end of the Roger Moore run. The formula returns in the Brosnan series, but gets lost in chaotic plots and a need to constantly out-do the previous movie's amazing stunts and effects and breaks through the line of suspended disbelief to purely absurd ridiculousness.

Sadly, this snappy little above-average opus with a Boaz Yakin screenplay went straight to video because New World Pictures was suffering from financial woes. The muscle-bound Lungren is well cast as the anti-heroic vigilante. Louis Gossett, Jr., is effective as his former police partner, while Jeroen Krabbe and Kim Miyori make solid villains. The action is swift but lightweight.The Punisher opens with a TV news bulletin about the acquittal of Mafia crime lieutenant Dino Moretti (Bryan Marshall of Mosquito Squadron) of all charges in connection with the murders of police officer Frank Castle and his family. Moretti's lawyers have spent five years appealing his murder conviction. Moretti maintained his innocence and claimed he had no idea who was responsible for the 125 mysterious gangland slayings often attributed to a shadowy figure known as 'The Punisher' which occurred in the city over the last half-decade.The news media surround Moretti and his thugs as they exit the courthouse, praising the American jurisprudence before heading home to his mansion. The black-clad Punisher (Dolph Lungren of Rocky IV) follows them on his motorcycle and slips unobtrusively into Moretti's mansion. He stabs one bodyguard through a ceiling vent, hurls another off a balcony, and hangs the third by the neck to the chagrin of Moretti. Afterward, explosions erupt from every window. Moretti stumbles out the front door and falls dead on his knees with a skull-headed knife protruding from his back. The figure of the Punisher stands framed in the open doorway as the media scramble to capture images of him before more explosions engulf the mansion.Lieutenant Jake Berkowitz (Louis Gossett, Jr. of An Officer and a Gentleman) inspects the rubble of the Moretti mansion later that evening. Jake doesn't believe that Frank Castle is dead and insists that Frank is responsible for the killings. The chief of detectives delivers a message to him that Frank Castle is dead. No more talk about him being alive. You toe the line or you get the boot. The chief warns Jake We cannot let the public think that there is some psychotic ex-cop running around whacking out wiseguys like he has a hunting license. Typically, Jake works alone, but plainclothes female detective Sam Leary (Nancy Everhard of DeepStar Six), appears on the crime scene and pleads to be his partner. Sam explains that she is the second youngest member of the force to ever make detective the first time up. I'm not after a free ride. I can carry my share of the load. She informs Jake that she graduated at the top of her police academy class, is a crack shot, and agrees that Frank Castle is the Punisher. Jake orders her to be in his office at 9 AM sharp.The Punisher plunges us into the sewers. We see Frank Castle naked with a five 0'clock shadow, sunken eyes, and a haggard look pondering life. Come on, God, answer me. For years I've been asking you why? Or have you already answered? Or have you already said to the world here is justice. Here is punishment . . . Here in me? Why are the innocent dead and the guilty alive? Where is justice? Where is the punishment? Frank relives the tragic deaths of his wife and two young daughters who died in a car bomb explosion, similar to the fiery fate of Glenn Ford's wife and daughter in the Fritz Lang movie The Big Heat where they died from a car bomb meant for him. Frank struggles futilely to rescue his family, but the vehicle turns into a raging inferno.Gianni Franco (Jeroen Krabbe of The Living Daylights) leaves the airport on his return from Europe to take over as head of the Franco crime family. He ignores the media when they quiz him about The Punisher and he accuses them of creating The Punisher the way some people create boogeymen. Jake watches as Franco deals with the press. The new Mafia chieftain approaches Berkowitz and inquires how he can assist him. Jake chuckles, Kind of like a worm helps a fisherman. I'm glad you finally came home. I'm running out of bait. Later, Gianni informs the second-in-command of the Franco family that changes are about to occur. He explains that he is going to abolish the families. Franco explains that he has brokered a deal that will unit the families. He has arranged for 600 kilos of pure junk--$500 million dollars worth of product--to be shipped into the city. Everyone gets a share, providing they work together to make it happen. First, we consolidate, then we obliterate. The Yakuza muscle in on Gianni's good will deal and kill seven of the wise guys just as the Punisher had prepared his own reception for the Mafia. Lady Tanaka (Kim Miyori of Zoot Suit) spearheads the Asian invasion. Frank takes a knife in the chest and ends up in the river with a van loaded with the junk. He manages to get back to his lair in the sewer and cauterize the wound with a glowing knife. Detectives Berkowitz and Leary learn about the botched shipment.Meanwhile, Idiko Tanaka, who graduated from the Harvard Business School, shows up in town with her mute, adopted American girl who never leaves her side and wears a deadly pair of ear rings, dictates terms to the outraged Mafia. They will run the daily operations as executives and split the loot 75\/25 per cent. The Mafia declares war on the Yakuza. The Japanese Mafia kidnaps the American Mafia's children. Lady Tanaka is ruthless. She cooked her twin brother a meal and then slit his throat. The Mafia sends the Japanese the ransom money.The Marvel Comics character makes quite an impression, but the low-budget Punisher lacks the punch of later Punishers. He also doesn't have the death's head symbol.
