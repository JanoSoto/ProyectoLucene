But sometimes you just feel like checking out the pizza buffet, and when the atmosphere is right and the pizza turns out to be perfect, it can be every bit as satisfying as haute cuisine.  And that's the way it is with `Someone Like You,' directed by Tony Goldwyn and starring Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear and Hugh Jackman.  If you just want to relax and be entertained, with a movie that's not too challenging and let's you just go with the flow, then you've come to the right buffet.  Ashley Judd is Jane Goodale, who begins a relationship with new co-worker Ray (Kinnear) that goes so well so quickly that she thinks it's going to last forever.  And when it suddenly goes south for no apparent reason, she is crushed.  Why did Ray jilt her?  Was it just her, or is this just the way `Men' are?  Her musings on the subject ultimately lead to the formulation of what she calls the `New Cow' theory, which basically states that once men, like bulls, have had the cow, they move on to yet another `new' cow, leaving the `old' cow behind.  Realizing, of course, that lacking sufficient data her concept would never hold up to any real scientific scrutiny, she is afforded the chance to study it further when-- due to the circumstances of her breakup with Ray-- she finds herself without an apartment, and moves in with another co-worker, Eddie (Jackman).  And Eddie is a notorious womanizer who seems to have a `new cow' every other day.  Along the way, as Jane draws her final conclusions, there are some memorable-- and at times, humorous-- moments, like when Jane revives one of her old cheerleader routines for Eddie.  But whether or not she is able to prove her theory doesn't really make any difference; the important thing is, you'll have a good time going along with her while she tries.   \tThere's nothing very deep here, the plot is familiar in the genre of romantic comedy, and Goldwyn certainly doesn't break any new ground with it.  He keeps things moving right along, but uses a straightforward approach to tell the story that is fairly unimaginative and lacks the distinction of say, a Nora Ephron film.  Still, it's a good bit of entertainment, carried by the engaging performances of Judd and Jackman, which alone makes it worth the price of admission.  Judd is a wholesome beauty with a natural appeal, and she can act; Jackman is charismatic and has a definite screen presence.  And there's chemistry between the two of them that make it work.  There's no real surprises along the way, but it's like taking your favorite scenic drive; you've seen it all before, but it's pleasant and fun, and in the end you're glad you took the trip.  \tThe supporting cast includes Ellen Barkin (Diane), Marisa Tomei (Liz), Matthew Coyle (Staff Member), Hugh Downs (Himself) and LeAnna Croom (Rebecca).  When you put it all into perspective, you realize that `Someone Like You' is actually a real treat.  And Goldwyn, though he may not have given it that `special' touch, should be given credit for delivering a solid, uplifting and entertaining movie that is well worth seeing.  It may not be in the same league as `Return To Me,' or `You've Got Mail,' but if you've ever been subjected to bottom-of-the-genre-feeders like `The Bachelor,' or `The Wedding Planner,' you'll definitely appreciate this one for what it is.  It's warm and funny, and it'll leave you with a good feeling inside and a smile on your face.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7\/10.

Rodriguez normally directs harsher, more brutal movies, like Desperado and The Faculty, but accustoms a slick style of adventure and humor in this film that exceeds past the level of any of his recent work.  Spy Kids really does belong in some kind of James Bond picture.\tAs the film's writer, director, and co producer, Rodriguez does a lot more with the material here than we expect. The film has a stunning array of special effects, ranging from walking thumbs to a particularly imaginative experience in the villain's headquarters. Even the introduction has zest and intrigue we meet a seemingly normal family of four, consisting of Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez (Alexa Vega and Antonio Banderas), and their children, probably middle school aged, Juni and Carmen (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega). As the movie opens, Ingrid tells her children a nice bedtime story about two daring spies assigned to kill the other, but fall in love, get married, and retire. She prepares her offspring for bed and turns the lights off, walks to her husband, and explains she thinks it would be a good idea to tell Carmen and Juni their real identities as top-secret spies; the story Ingrid enlightened her kids with was true.\t Rodriguez quickly sketched his characters, but his method is surprisingly effective; the movie starts out with fast-paced action and captures our attention abruptly and does not really lose energy throughout its running time. We learn the two married spies have retired from the business nine years prior, but their fellow OSS agents are disappearing all over the world, and thinks it to be the work of a kids TV show host named Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming in a very whimsical, fitting performance) and his assistant, Minion (Tony Shalhoub). The agents have been converted into clay-like animated characters held captive at his mega tech laboratory.  Imaginative and interesting, if a bit cheesy. \tIngrid and Gregorio call their Uncle Felix over to watch the kids while they go out on their latest mission. Unfortunately, this mission could be their last; they walk right into a trap and are snared from beneath their toes. Felix receives a distress call, sends the kids to a safe house, but is captured himself, leaving the responsibilities to the younger members of the family. \tThe story isn't cheap or silly, although some of the material tests our tolerance for far-fetched science fiction. The underlying motives here are also legitimate. The movie puts confidence in strong family values, honesty, and trust, but does not preach, lecture, or on the other side of the barrel, become lost in an utter mess of silly dog poop and passing gas jokes like See Spot Run. The movie takes itself seriously, and is well written. We understand the character's motives.    \tSpy Kids gets one thing painfully right, and that is therelationship of the brother and sister. Their relationship is all too familiar in American households, where name calling and mean-spirited behavior inhabit offspring of both sexes. The petty little conflicts they feel strained and forced, giving this movie, otherwise somewhat mature, an immature sensation. This familiar stereotype is profoundly irritating.\tSpy Kids is often exciting, funny, and almost always entertaining. It is not the kind of movie that parents should just drop their kids off to, however, but should stay for themselves to witness some of the most effective family movie moments in quite a while.

He is clearly facing in Bettina's direction but it is not clear that he is going to follow her. The point is that he knows that he could follow her if he wanted to; he is back to the place where he has choices about life again.  In the ice in my glass speech, he says his low point on the island is about having power over nothing.  At the end of the film he has regained that personal power--to go in whatever direction he chooses, to follow Bettina or not. The mere opportunity to make the decision is the resolution, more important than the specific decision itself.  That is a psychologically sophisticated ending, much more satisfying than the typical Hollywood alternative.  If he had jumped in the truck and driven after her I would have thrown something at the screen--it just wouldn't have fit.Also, although he thought that Kelly was the woman with him on the island giving him the strength to go on during the four isolated years, it is equally true that Bettina was with him on the island--she was present with him through her art and his reproductions of her art even though he had never met her.  Bettina is a good match for Chuck; for whatever reason, she's grown comfortable with being isolated from modern life too she's living out in the middle of nowhere, she's driving an antique truck in a culture that judges you by the trendiness of the car you drive, she does not recognize him even though he's an international media celebrity (the story of his rescue was thoroughly covered in all those newspapers and magazines on Kelly's dining room table).  Noland thought Kelly was his reason for living, and he lost her, but Bettina was his reason for living too, in some ways more directly responsible for his survival and salvation\/escape, and there is still a chance that he could have her (a fairly good chance from the way she flirted with him, and just wait till she hears the story about how her art saved his life!).  I could go on, and that's about the ending alone.I think that the real problem with people's mixed response to this picture is that you do have to care about Tom Hanks to appreciate this performance. I think he is a great actor, and more than just a movie star, but who says that the two can't be one and the same?  I care about every character he plays (well, we won't mention Sherman McCoy) and the whole point of my moviegoing is to enter into a story about characters I can care about.  But that is a sign of my age and my identity as a student of human nature. Most of us reading this board know that the modern movie going audience isn't interested in caring about characters anymore.  They don't care about Hanks, Noland, any other character, or maybe even themselves, for that matter.  In fact, watching bad things happen to characters no one cares about drives most movies these days.  The vast majority of commercial hits are made for people who can only be entertained by laughing at people doing stupid things (for the price of a movie ticket they get a chance to feel superior to *somebody*); laughing at people being killed, maimed or otherwise physically harmed (how sick is *that*); pat sentimental mush at the level of romance novels or true confession magazines; stuff blowing up; sexual display and innuendo.  How could those people hope to get anything out of Cast Away, or any other serious picture?  They have no frame of reference, no experience of reflecting on the meaning of life.The other group of people who hate this film are the too cool for film school cynics who use their art as a distancing tool to keep from feeling uncool emotions like empathy, tenderness and transcendence.  I don't even have space to go into how much I pity those people, for they also have trouble entering into the real meaning of life, and their art is therefore destined to be empty, only appealing to others who have adopted the same cynical worldview.I do love Tom Hanks, I'll admit that.  I adore him, admire him and respect him.  I love his intelligence, his discipline, his integrity, his dedication to his craft, his interest in history, his liberal politics, his happy marriage (no small feat in this world) and the fact that he shares my vocation as a student of human nature.  Also, he is lovely to look at even with a Buddha belly, a scraggly beard, or wild man's hair (those lips, those eyes!) and he plays the full range of his expressive speaking voice like Yo Yo Ma on the cello.  Some of his critics think that those of us who love him are reading into his work a subtlety of emotion that isn't really there, and\/or overlooking his over the top moments because of personal devotion to him.  I only know that I feel bonded to all the people who reacted to the depth of his performance in the same way that I did.  Whether we react to him out of our feelings for him or out of his acting ability is almost irrelevant--how can who he is be separated from the art he creates?  This is what it means to be an icon, a national treasure, and all the other superlatives we use to describe him.  His own self is the only canvas on which any actor can paint; he uses his personality, his access to his own emotional history, even the aura of decency that keeps us from accepting him as a bad guy, he uses all of this to create these unforgettable roles, and in return we care about the characters he portrays and the stories he tells. In my opinion he should have about five Oscars by now; look at Apollo 13 again, look at Saving Private Ryan, imagine them without Hanks, imagine any other actor who ever lived trying to do what he did in Cast Away--how many people would pay to watch Russell Crowe rub two sticks together, especially if he were robbed of the superficial elements of his physical attractiveness?As some other reviewer said, it shouldn't matter how many Oscars you already have, if you give the best performance of the year (most physically challenging, most emotionally authentic, most essential to the artistic success of your film) you ought to be the winner.  Hanks can easily do without that third Oscar for now.  But one of these days he will get it--and with it the proof that he is the finest actor of my lifetime.  Let Russell have his make-up Oscar; Tom was robbed as surely as Ralph Fiennes was robbed for Schindler's List.  But in 25 years we'll still be watching Schindler's List, and we'll still be watching Cast Away, while The Fugitive will lie on some forgotten celluloid heap and Gladiator will have become as laughable as the Ten Commandments.  So although I'm disappointed, I can wait, because Hanks will be turning in fine nuanced performances and making memorable, emotionally resonant films for another 20 years, long after Crowe has been supplanted by the next alpha male on the block.  Unsolicited advice for Russell Crowe get over yourself, put your Oscar in a box, send it to Tom Hanks, and shut up!  And anyone who thinks Gladiator was a great film needs to arrange an immediate screening of Spartacus.I'll stop short of saying that Cast Away is a great film--like many others on this board I think I could have made (or edited) a better movie, both a tighter movie with respect to the set up and a more complete movie with an expanded development of his descent into despair and resignation on the island. It's too obvious that they shot a lot of other island footage that is left out, but I guess Zemekis was right to be concerned about length since people have been complaining about that (as for me, it was 223 well spent and I dream of a three hour director's cut).  I would have also made the ending longer, expanding the resolution between Noland and Frears.  But while Cast Away may not be a brilliant picture, Tom Hanks definitely gives a brilliant performance.  It is the kind of acting that makes people think, re-evaluate, come to a new understanding of the world.  It is the kind of performance that changes people's lives.  It changed mine.  I am still stunned that Hanks was overlooked on Oscar night.  I heard the Best Actor race was tight and the voting very close.  I guess too many of the Academy voters fit my description above--cluelessly shallow or smugly cynical.  The rest of us love Hanks, love his acting and loved Cast Away.I think I'll go see it again tomorrow.

This film went on to win eleven academy awards, and instantly becoming a classic all around the world. This was director William Wyler's Ben-Hur. Nearly 40 years after that, comes an epic-like film, with a similar storyline, titled Gladiator. An entertaining, well-made movie, that brings back the treasures of yesterday.The plot, although original, is cleverly written by screenplay writer's, David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) the greatest military leader Rome has ever had. After defeating, the Germanic renegades, Maximus is looking toward going home to his wife and son soon.

Whenever I decide to watch 'just a couple of minutes' while gobbling down a late night snack, and end up watching the whole movie because it is able to grab me by the neck and never lets go, someone has done something right. So Fargo was a very strange experience. It begins very well, with actors giving straight A  performances, doing a tremendous job in establishing their characters. Their mannerisms, looks, and voices make these well-written characters three dimensional and fun to watch. The story premise is promising. Loser of the year Macey needs money and his father-in-law is loaded, but because he want to keep his 'dignity', he just decides to hire a duo of loonies to kidnap his wife and split the ransom, to be coughed up by daddy.Needless to say, Things Go Wrong, to quote a minor Chris Isaak song.

Neither film manages to suggest why these figures still loom large in the popular imagination long after their deaths. After viewing Stone's extremely negative portrait of Jim Morrison in The Doors, you'd never know that Morrison can be counted among the 1960s' greatest poets, songwriters, and vocalists. Sid Vicious was considerably less talented, barely able to play a guitar, but the Sex Pistols were indeed the most influential band of the 1970's. Why? This relentlessly depressing film provides few clues.Punk was exhilarating and liberating precisely because it insisted that anyone could do it. Despite its negative rhetoric, punk was inclusive. The performance scenes in the movie fail to capture this spirit and instead come across as lip-synched dumb shows that ape the real thing.Impersonating a public figure or celebrity is always a tough acting assignment because the audience typically brings to the film a set of expectations about that person. They compare the actor's gestures, vocal inflections, even physical characteristics with those of the celebrity. The actor must mimic without stooping to mere caricature, in addition to creating a character who is believable within the dramatic structure of the film itself. Having to do so while delivering a musical performance is even more difficult, but with the right actor in the part, the results can be sensational. Sissy Spacek Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter may actually improve on the original. Despite The Doors' many shortcomings, Val Kilmer created a very passable Jim Morrison.The film's Sex Pistols snarl and spit and bang their heads as they play, all to no avail. The audience never understands why the real Sex Pistols made such an impact both musically and visually. Maybe the passage of time renders what was raw and vital in 1975 tame and hackneyed to today's audiences or even those of 1986 when the film was made. But then what is the point of filming this if not to remind us of how great and important the band seemed to contemporaries?Sid and Nancy is an incredible bummer to watch because it fails to deliver the goods musically and never conveys the frenzied excitement  that greeted the first wave of punk. Without this background, the Sid and Nancy characters are unbearable to watch. All you see is self-obliteration and death. It's never even clear why these two flamed out. Was it family, fame, a love obsession? (We know it was drugs.) Surely there is some connection to the Sex Pistols' own spectacular act of self-immolation - they lasted less than two years - but the film doesn't provide answers.Gary Oldman comes across more restrained than usual, an odd choice. He chews up the scenery in most of his films, why not here? And while Chloe Webb is initially great, how long can you stand watching her screw up her face, fall on the floor and whine Sid, we're aaaadd-icts...?If you want to see an ENTERTAINING film about fame, jealousy and self-destruction, rent Prick Up Your Ears (1987) which documents how the playwright Joe Orton was murdered by his lover Kenneth Halliwell, who then killed himself.

I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism.  When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window' as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo' (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions.  Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom'.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho' (#18) and `Vertigo' (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10\/10.  `Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.

Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho' (#18) and `Vertigo' (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10\/10.  `Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.
