Instead you have some amazing characters who interact better than most live actors, a great but simple-to-follow story and lot's of funny lines and moments. And there ARE some heartwarming episodes! All the voices are superb in there parts, with an added bonus for Eddie Murphy (his best part in YEARS!) and John Lithgow. And I do like the interwoven fairytale creatures, especially the Gingerbread man whose torture is a hilariously funny scene. And Shrek himself is a truly likeable fellow even if he is somewhat of a slob. The animation is amazing! The best part is the rescue of the princess with it's firebreathing dragon and all (also a funny scene). The ending ,with the escape from the dragon's clutches, is pure James Bond meets Indiana Jones with a score to match and even the use of slow-motion! A delightful mix of suspense and humour! My only, minor, complaint is that the movie is too short!! But you do get a bonus after the feature to treasure -) A MUST-SEE for children of all ages!!!!!!

When I saw the poster, I was even more enthusiastic. When I saw the film, I was terribly disappointed.The poster was the start of it. It clearly depicted an Apache helicopter and a dragon in the same bit of sky. In the film, there are plenty of dragons, but not one Apache. Just one lame average chopper. My hopes of an aerial dogfight between an Apache and a dragon went unfulfilled. And I think that's why I was disappointed. After that, it wasn't hard to pick holes in the film.For a start, we're led to believe that the big male dragon in the film is the one released by construction workers from beneath London. The first dragon, so to speak. But we're also told how all other dragons are female. So where did they come from? Did the male dragon dig them out? And how did the dragon\/s get buried beneath the earth in the first place? Did they bury themselves? Or was it a bunch of mediaeval knights that did it? How did they survive underground?Then there's the dragons themselves. Apparently they eat ash, which is why they burn everything in sight. I'm no nutritionist, but I doubt ash has enough energy value to sustain something that's 30 feet long, even if it didn't fly. And there's the fire breathing aspect, which we're told is the result of two glands which produce chemicals which react with each other to produce fire. I can accept that, but if so, all dragons should produce fire that is equally intense. But the male dragon's fire is clearly hotter and more intense than the others. In a pure fantasy setting, we can suspend disbelief and believe in dragons without knowing anything about them, but when you mix genres, like they have here, and then try and explain things in a half-hearted way, it just ends up with you thinking Hang on a minute, that's not right...There is also the army, which apparently doesn't have concerns such as where its next tank of fuel comes from.Then there's the all dragons are female, except for the one big male. If it was as easy as killing one dragon (which the american army can kill without too much effort), how in hell did the world get destroyed in the first place?All in all, a film which missed out on being a real stonker of a film and ended up being a real stinker.

The movie was visually brilliant and the story could be followed superbly. Tolkien's masterpiece suddenly came to life before my eyes. I thought it was incredible. Some people would say that the acting was dull and unexciting, but it matches perfectly with the chillingly perilous concept of the movie as well as the emotional concept.   The dialogue, like the movie, was beautiful. To Tolkien, the languages of Middle-earth were the most crucial parts of the story. He created so many different languages Elvish, Orkish, Black Speech, Common Speech, Dwarfish etc. I think his imagination was the very key to the creation of Lord of the Rings, not just his intellectual mind or his intelligence. I admire Tolkien's dedication to his work. He spent a lifetime creating tiny details to create the perfect mythical world.Now, back to the movie. In this movie, there are emotional aspects as well as violence, terror and feelings of loneness and dread.Firstly, the lasting loyalty and friendship between Frodo and Sam is very touching. Sam displays true friendship towards Frodo and Frodo demonstrates true friendship towards Sam. I see in the movie that both Hobbits are extremely protective of each other. This is a good demonstration of love and loyalty which is vital in a film. There must be expressions of some kind of emotion in movies as well as insightful messages that shine through to its audience.The second display of emotion is the true love demonstrated between Aragorn and the Elf-princess, Arwen. In order to wed the man she loves, Arwen must  give up her immortality. This is a display of pure love and sacrifice. Spoiler Lastly, is the courage of Boromir.  Near to the end of the film, when the Uruk-Hai Orcs are marching through the forest, Boromir is pierced by an arrow. Even though he is near death, he continues to fight over 50 Orcs. Even though he is dying, he still shows his undying will to protect the Ring-bearer. This too is very moving.The actors I'd like to commend for brilliant acting in Lord of the Rings are Ian McKellen, Sean Bean, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett. I think they did marvelously and their outstanding acting blended in very well with Middle-earth and the languages. I do admit that this movie isn't perfect, but it isn't far from perfect. Actually, it's quite close to perfect. I would like to point out that the jokes could have been slightly more humorous, but the jokes to make the film less serious in some scenes. This is very necessary because a movie can't just be serious. You need to squeeze in a few laughing moments. I also think maybe less time could have been spent in the Caverns of Isengard and more time on the journey. But that certainly is not a important problem.My conclusion Lord of the Rings is an epic. An absolute classic. Five Stars.

There is plenty to appreciate in this dark portrayal of earth in the future, but there are too many elements that just scream out Messy B-movie. A vision of a world where overpopulation causes people to literally spill out of windows, animal and plant life is virtually non existent, fresh food and water is only available to the truly rich, voluntary suicide is encouraged, the government hands out rations of odd food supplements (Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow, and the new Soylent Green), a jar of strawberries costs $150, and women are called furniture (they can be reused or thrown out when new rich tenants move into apartments), certainly has potential. The acting is strong from the two people that matter the most, Charlton Heston (Thorn) and Edward G. Robinson (Sol). Sol's suicide scene followed by Thorn's discovery of the recipe for Soylent Green represent the best parts of the movie. There is something very creepy about the way Sol is lead to his chamber. As he lies there and watches a film of all the beautiful things that earth once had to offer (still does to us), the footage makes its impact. The themes in SOYLENT GREEN are obvious right from the very beginning. An excellent montage, which shows the earth as it becomes more polluted over the years, opens the film.SOYLENT GREEN is similar to Heston's more famous PLANET OF THE APES as it shows us a bleak look at the future of humanity that is a direct result of our ignorance. It asks us to appreciate what we take for granted. However, it does not have the same impact. I'm not going to complain about film quality because that is more due to the fact that I had a poor videotape copy. Unfortunately, the film does have choppy editing and a weak execution. The story suffers from some really banal sub-plots such as Thorn's relationship with a furniture. The movie lacks the focus to develop into something really intriguing and instead contains some bizarre, out-of-place scenes. It's best when it focuses on Thorn's investigation and on his relationship with Sol. The production quality is low and the idea that people have not advanced much beyond the seventies seems like a lazy way of not having to deal with wardrobe, design, music, etc. So while the story may be good, the movie feels weak and dated and Thorn's final lines, while delivered nicely by Heston, do not have the impact they should.There is a curious scene that I want to mention. It occurs when Sol visits the Exchange. I got the impression that Sol is Jewish, especially since I heard him utter Hebrew phrases throughout the movie (I don't know a single word in Hebrew, but I've heard it before and that's what it sounded like). From their accents, it appears that the old women he talks to at the Exchange are European (possibly also Jewish). In my opinion, the conversation they have about the Soylent Green cover-ups seems to resemble conversations about Nazi war crime cover-ups. Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to make light of the Holocaust by comparing it to the story in SOYLENT GREEN. I may be completely misreading it. However, the old women have such strange looks on their faces as they talk about the hideous nature of the crimes and the need for proof. There is something about that scene that just made me uncomfortable. I don't know if it was the director's intention to show that the story paralleled the Holocaust in some ways, but I got that impression from that little scene. Other moments in the film, such as the crowd control scene or Sol's death scene, appear to fit in with that idea. The film is clearly against such actions so a comparison to the Holocaust may not be totally inappropriate, but it may be a trivialization, especially if the director really did intend for the parallels to be seen. Since I may just be imagining this, I'm not sure what to make of it. Please understand that I have never stretched my interpretation of a movie this far before (Well, I did have a strange theory on FREDDY GOT FINGERED). I may be completely wrong and I don't mean to misinterpret anything.The bottom line is that SOYLENT GREEN is a poorly executed, but interesting story about embracing and respecting our environment before it deteriorates and forces us into some extreme behavior. Here is a movie in desperate need of remaking. A thought provoking (not action driven) and technically superior remake could have a much stronger impact. For now, if you have time, SOYLENT GREEN is just decent enough to check out, if only for the famous ending. However, don't expect anything too amazing as this feels only like a second rate PLANET OF THE APES, from beginning to twist ending. Overall, a 6 out of 10.

You took the Bible references way too seriously.And as for you who in these reviews give 'The Life of Brian' a bad name, you should watch the movie again and see what you find wrong with it. Ok, done watching it? And what did you find wrong with it? Nothing!-from a great fan.

He used to borrow ideas at a prodigious pace in his movies, but he also lent them his unique visual and verbal wit. Now he's mostly doing imitations of his own biggest commercial successes, and he's not improving upon them either. Blow Out was his last great movie, and it was also the last time that he had made a marginal improvement on his previous work. If only he had gotten hold of the right project after that movie, I really think he could have become huge--bigger than Spielberg even. De Palma's ear, his sense of humor, was much more in tune with how America talked and thought, and his appeal is not nearly as sentimentality-dependent as Spielberg's. The middle De Palma is a cross between George Miller and the early Woody Allen.It's amazing how different Phantom of the Paradise is from Blow Out, in virtually every aspect, and yet the movies have one trait in common--De Palma's ability to put together so many influences and make a very good narrative out of it. There is a weakness in Phantom in that De Palma had not yet learned to splice his ideas as seamlessly as he would in Blow Out, so the connecting work between some excellent scenes really drags. Probably the best scene in the movie is Swan, the Paul Williams character, sitting inside a round table and thinking of the best musical act to replace the just-incinerated band that was to headline the Paradise's opening. He rotates in his table and samples the acts as they are suddenly in the spotlight in the vast room. The trick is that the acts are not there; Swan is only thinking about them, and they're projected for us, a twinkle in the mind. It is the equivalent of the cartoon bubble, and it is surprisingly, almost frighteningly, effective. De Palma came up with something that is truly primal here, and there are other scenes that come close, like the staircase scene and the climactic musical number.Sometimes its risky to recommend a movie too much because you risk overpraising, or at least raising the expectation to match what the movie is able to deliver. The peculiarity of Phantom is that it's impossible to overpraise--it's too big a movie, a huge sandwich of material. As someone once said about Anna Karenina, it's not an idea, it's a soul; in this case, probably the soul of De Palma the intoxicated moviemaker.

As most of the films he produced or directed flopped, his chances of breaking into the mainstream grew ever dimmer. Wes Craven has had a similar problem; although his films did considerably better, rarely does he have a chance to dabble into non-horror. Cunningham should not be completely dismissed, though; he also gave us the slight but amusing horror comedy House, and the equally enjoyable House II.

Based on these movies, one wouldn't think he was capable of crafting a more lighthearted approach to the genre. But there it is; a horror film that goes for the jokes and not the gore. A tormented Vietnam vet moves into his late aunt's old house, hoping to complete his latest novel. There, he must battle various demons, not only of the supernatural type, but his own self torment and the loss of his missing son.William Katt is not a particularly accomplished actor, but he is nonetheless likable and generates a great deal of sympathy for his plight. He realizes that the key to making a good comedy is to pretend the material is serious, making everything seem more real. There are several ghoulishly silly incidents; the best gag involves a possessed severed hand, which probably inspired Evil Dead II, released the following year. The scene involving the ugly fat creature is also effective. Miner gives the film a slick look and delivers humor and suspense in equal doses. This is not the best the subgenre has to offer (that honor may go to Ghostbusters), but it is a worthy effort that makes a more than adequate serving as a party movie on Halloween night. However, it still doesn't quite have the inspiration to go a step further.The ending is interesting enough, as Katt finds a doorway into the netherworld to rescue his son--and finds opposition by an old combat partner from beyond the grave.

One regret is that Jackson chose not to make The Hobbit first...it would have been fun to follow Bilbo to the Lonely Mountain to see Smaug and learn more in-depth about the Ring. Alas, he didn't...however, he did a great job with the Fellowship of the Ring! The production is grand in both scale and execution. The SFX are, for the most part, very good. Makeup and costuming for the host of Orcs and the Uruk-Hai, is fantastic. The location (New Zealand) was superb and the cinematography is first-rate.

It's a standard space adventure on the surface, with the obligatory alien contact bit, but with some truly cheesy dialogue and questionable physics thrown in for good measure. If you don't look too deeply its an OK film.There are some annoying scenes where I found myself shouting at the screen in frustration. One was where the crew are on Mars and the alien presence manifests itself around a rock spire. The crew just stand around without communicating and gape at the manifestation, and each other, like hicks on their first trip to the big city. This goes on for a protracted time, long past the point where ANY normal person would have made a run for it. Just silly.Another scene involved the crews' inability to think past the length of a rescue line and their own maneauvring pack fuel supplies in order to rescue a person stranded in space. I won't go into the details, but even a half-wit could have figured out how to save the guy given the resources they had. But....not good drama if they saved the guy.What is with Gary Sinise these days anyhow? He looks more and more like Captain Black each movie he appears in. Is he bucking for a part in the Captain Scarlet movie that is inevitable at some point?Still nice to see Jerry Connell of Sliders fame getting a reasonable part. Shame we don't see more of him in films.On the whole not as bad as made out, but with more than a few foolish bits which take the edge off what could have been a very good film.

The costumes, the choreography, and especially the amazing cast of actors that were brought together.  Unfortunately, one thing about this production brought all of it crashing to the floor.  (No, I'm not going to say it was Leo, he's one of the best young actors in the business.)  It was the accents.  The accents would not have bothered me if the director had decided on one.  But having the lead characters all sound like they're from different parts of the world - that's bizarre and jarring.  I could have accepted American accents in old France, and Leo and Malkavich had very pronounced modern American accents, if everybody had an American accent.  But then, you had Jeremy Irons and Gabriel Byrne in there sounding British, and to top it all off, you had good ol' Gerard who not only has a French accent, but sounds as though English does not come naturally to him at all.  This poor conglomeration of accents only served to remind me that I was watching a Hollywood movie.  It is unfortunate, but I could not bring myself to like the movie as a result.  Which is too bad.  The other elements seemed pretty good, although I have no idea why nobody got shot at the end.  Sorry, was I supposed to get something there that just didn't make sense?  Anyway, probably a good movie, but the mixed voices were really grating on my nerves.  I just couldn't adjust to it.

Yes, it has nothing to do with the storyline of the original, but I think it would be hard to make a sequel to such a self-contained movie. With that in mind, the filmmakers were wise to take on an entirely new storyline with a fresh batch of characters and odd creatures. If you're willing to accept it as a stand-alone film, then it's certainly worth renting at least once. The film is just as amusing and entertaining as the Steve Miner original, and does not deserve all the negative comments given to it over the years (remember the scathing reference in Scream 2?). Like its predecessor, it's not really a straight horror movie, but more of a comic fantasy, as the hero deals with a crystal skull, Aztecs, a baby pterodactyl, and dead gunslingers. It's slick and fast-paced, with no pretensions as to its real nature; just a goofy campfest.The strongest aspect of the film is a genuinely touching performance from the late Royal Dano, as the protagonist's resurrected ancestor. When we first see him, it appears as if he is going to be the villain of the film, but it turns out that he is just a harmless undead guy. The character generates sympathy as he realizes that his youth is long gone, never to return despite his most fervent wishes. This is a deliberate reversal of the traditional use of the undead as a destructive force in movies; this time we actually see one on the good side. The most amusing bit of casting is a pre-Politically Incorrect Bill Maher as a sardonic record exec; I was sure surprised to see him listed in the opening credits. Also of note is Plan 9 From Outer Space's Gregory Walcott in a small role as the sheriff towards the end.Note that this is a PG-13 film, as opposed to the original's very mild R-rating. Unlike most eighties horror, House II actually has a happy ending, as the hero rides off into the sunset with his woman and friends. It's good, clean, silly fun. It may not be the most coherent, logical film in the world--indeed, it's all over the place and threatens to become a bit too much--but it's more entertaining than the reviews would have you expect. The special effects are decent for its time and budget. I wish I had seen this movie when I was ten; I'm sure I would have really enjoyed it.**1\/2 (out of ****)Released by New World Pictures ","genre":null},{"date":"17 December 2002","score":"","review":"  *spoilers*I don't understand why horror fans continue to give House II such a bad rap.
