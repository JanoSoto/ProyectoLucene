[{"date":"14 January 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Intelligent script that has held the test of time - eight years after this movie was released, it's still hilarious. It contains a lot of classic, stereotypical characters - the nerd who plans revenge; the cruel jock; the thoughtful, poetic protagonist; and the elusive beauty (every high school had one).There are also some excellent bit players, like the complete poseur and the annoying person who can't quite seem to leave high school behind (a small, unforgettable role played by Melissa Joan Hart). It would be too easy to have these characters come off as hackneyed, 80's teens who are only interested in sex and getting high. Thankfully, they are much more multi-dimensional than that, and the actors portraying them really show this.The script was also good, containing excellent dialogue and witty one-liners. The reason I did not give this movie a full ten is that in comparing it to the true classics of teen films - Ferris Bueller's Day Off and the like - it still comes up short. Notice that I said the characters were very likable and deep. However, they're not unique enough to warrant instant recognition, like a Ferris Bueller.Try this movie out for an intelligent, late 90's take on high school.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"14 January 2006","score":"","review":" 57 years have passed since the attack on the Nostromo by a single Alien warrior, an attack which left only crew member Ellen Ripley alive. Suspended in cryogenic hypersleep, Ripley has been drifting in space all this time and is revived, only to learn that everything she knew is gone. Also during that time, the alien planet on which the deadly eggs were first discovered has been colonized. Now called LV426, the planet has been made habitable by atmosphere processors, but contact with the colony has been lost. A rescue mission of intergalactic Marines is sent in, and Ripley is brought along as a reluctant adviser. Ripley's fears are soon confirmed the colony has been obliterated by the aliens and the survivors used as incubators for their embryos. Only one little girl has survived the destruction, a shell shocked second grader called Newt whom Ripley takes under her wing. As the Marines too fall prey to the aliens, Ripley and a small band of survivors find themselves stranded on LV426 with little hope of escape. With their equipment damaged and the planet's damaged reactors threatening to blow the entire world into a nuclear ruin within hours, the small group plans a dangerous escape mission. It becomes a race against time as the aliens close in, and when Newt is kidnapped by an alien warrior, Ripley comes face to face with the source of the alien colony - a huge and fiercely protective Queen Alien who is determined to take personal revenge on Ripley.Where the first Alien film was a Gothic horror tale, Aliens is an action movie through and through, but still a damn good movie. The aliens are everywhere in this tense and exhausting sequel. There are gory chest bursters, sprays of acidic blood and, most impressive of all, the Alien Queen Herself, a gigantic and deadly mother with absolute authority. I love the standoff scene between her and Ripley, in which the Queen dismisses her bodyguards and the two mothers face off, each determined to protect her young. The cast is top notch as well. Weaver makes a triumphant return as the battle scarred Ripley, who is NOT a fearless, ass kicking warrior woman, but a deeply frightened yet determined person with a truly heroic streak. Carrie Henn (who amazingly never made another film, either before or after Aliens) is perfect as Newt, the bright and solemn little girl with a pair of lungs like a car alarm. One of my favorite underrated actors Michael Biehn is here as well, playing Marine Corporal Hicks, a possible love interest for Ripley and father figure for Newt. Bill Paxton has entered into film icon territory with his portrayal of the cocky, but ultimately blubbering Pvt. Hudson, whose wails of It's a bug hunt, man! a bug hunt! have become a part of cinematic history. Cult film favorite Lance Henrickson is here too, playing the slightly suspicious but ultimately likable Bishop, an android who could have made Nexus proud with his More Human Than Human personality.This is a really great sequel to the original masterpiece film Alien. It doesn't try to mimic or reproduce but instead veers off into a whole new direction, filled with fast paced action and a good, strong, intelligent storyline. It's fun, it's tense and it's scary, but it's also smart. The swarms of aliens in this one are really freaky, and no more so than when they find a way into the locked down base through a ceiling panel. This film never lets up for one minute and includes a great just when you thought it was over ending that will have you on the edge of your seat. An awesome film!

However, I would like to comment upon a very interesting coincidence involving the role of one of the characters in this film, E.K. Hornbeck, a newspaper reporter covering the Monkey trial (played brilliantly by Gene Kelly, the character being, most agree, after H.L. Mencken, the prominent newspaperman, book reviewer and political commentator who covered the actual Scopes trial in 1925.) Kelly plays a cynical newspaperman who is the bete noire, the gadfly of both Henry Drummond (the Spencer Tracy character) and Matthew Harrison Brady (the Frederic March character.) For Hornbeck everything is false, everything is a con in one way or another, including Brady's old-style religion and Drummond's belief that modern science and philosophy belie a literal reading of the Bible.In another fine film - some say also one of the finest ever produced by Hollywood - Elmer Gantry - Arthur Kennedy also plays the role of a newspaperman, covering the religious revivals held by the lead characters, played to perfection by Jean Simmons and the incomparable Burt Lancaster. Simmons plays Sister Sharon Falconer, who really believes - at least at the right moments - that she's speaking to God and God to her, especially when her minions are passing the trays for contributions in the revival tents. Lancaster, as Gantry, is a down-and outer with a silver tongue who charms his way into Falconer's inner circle (and later into her boudoir) who believes only in separating the marks from enough of their money so that he and Sharon can get out while the getting's good and ride off together into the sunset. The coincidence is that Kennedy - the cynical reporter who sees and understands all that is going on, expresses his contempt and cynicism at every opportunity, thus playing the role of a foil strikingly like the role played by Kelly in Inherit the Wind. (The Greeks had a name for such a character - the leader of the Greek chorus, or Choragos, who commented upon the action in a play but took no part in it.) As Kelly did, Kennedy played the part to perfection.So anyone who enjoyed Kennedy's role in Gantry should definitely see and carefully study Kelly's role in Inherit the Wind, and vice versa. The are both extremely intelligent, provocative roles, incomparably acted, with similar messages to convey.
