They believe it's some stupid comedy only about young kids who want to have sex before graduating.  Well, that's not what it is about.  Indeed, there is much more to the movie than just four kids wanting to have sex.  There is a story of relationships between friends as well as a big sports theme (lacrosse particularly).  This is not only crude humor, it isn't slap-stick all the time.  It has some very intelligent moments.  The movie begins with a strong beginning.  Jim (Jason Biggs) is jacking off in his room as he is watching an illegal channel when suddenly, without any warning, his mother comes in.  This scene gives you a pretty good impression of just how much you will probably laughing through the movie.  We then move on to Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who already has a girlfriend, Vickie (Tara Reid), but have been at the same level of their relationship for quite some time now.  There is also Chris (Chris Klein) who is a Lacrosse player and is too insensitive to maintain any relationship with a girl.  And finally, there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who is the fourth friend and doesn't try to hook up with girls that much.  But when the four guys make a pact to get laid before they graduate, they all become enthusiastic.  First time-directors Chris and Paul Weitz do a great job with American pie.  They seem to remember pretty well what their high-school graduation must have been like because the prom scene seems to be recreated in the exact same way it was for them.  They also seemed to know exactly when to cut the comic scenes perfectly so that they don't put too much and turn their jokes into stupid jokes.  Also to be mentioned as supporting actors are Sean W.

It is unique and perfect, revealed as an even more appropriate detail to the movie as more of the plot themes are revealed. The main character in the movie, Fresh, is played by a really exceptional young actor, Sean Nelson, who manages to steal scenes from two of my other favorite actors, Samuel L.

In my opinion it is neither funny nor anything else. It is a slow movie, nothing happens at all, the story can be told in less than three setences. Black guy (Forrest Whittaker) believes to be a Samurai. He kills an Italian guy and is hunted and killed by the Italians who gave him the order to kill the guy, so that they can blame someone for the death. Yes this sounds weird. Even though this movie is not much longer than 100 minutes, probably even shorter, it seemed to me that it lasted for more than 3 hours. All this Japanese mytholigy stuff or however you want to call it seems to be pretty foolish and stupid, perhaps that is also Mr. Whittaker's fault. I can't see how anyone was impressed by his acting abilities in this movie. OK it is pretty hard to look indifferent throughout a whole movie. So don't go and watch it, it is boring has no action and some samurai stuff that only seemed to be added to give an intellectual impression.If you like the music (Wu Tang) buy the CD instead, eventhough I think they were also quiet weak. I was completely disappointed by this movie, I don't want to blame anyone for that but how could someone give this movie more than 3 points, I gave 1 !!!

He kills an Italian guy and is hunted and killed by the Italians who gave him the order to kill the guy, so that they can blame someone for the death. Yes this sounds weird.

All this Japanese mytholigy stuff or however you want to call it seems to be pretty foolish and stupid, perhaps that is also Mr. Whittaker's fault. I can't see how anyone was impressed by his acting abilities in this movie. OK it is pretty hard to look indifferent throughout a whole movie. So don't go and watch it, it is boring has no action and some samurai stuff that only seemed to be added to give an intellectual impression.If you like the music (Wu Tang) buy the CD instead, eventhough I think they were also quiet weak.

The Straight Story is about a 73 year old man facing the fact that he is not immortal and that death could very well be upon him.  As the story opens, he is found lying on his kitchen floor.  He has been there for hours because he had fallen and there was no one to help him up.  He visits his doctor who warns him that his unhealthy lifestyle has caught up with him and that if he doesn't shape up soon things are only going to get worse.  And then, the final blow, a message about his brother, who he hasn't spoken with for several years, comes in, telling him that the man had a stroke. Richard Farnsworth plays title character, Alvin Straight.  He creates a stir in the small town he lives in when he decides to go an visit his brother who lives almost 300 miles away.  With no bus access, and with Alvin unable to drive a car (poor eyesight) he hitches a trailer up to his lawn mower and begins a trek across two states.  Sissy Spacek plays his daughter Rose.  While she seems to be burdened with a mental handicap, she is his caretaker and knows him better than anyone.  Yet despite her feelings about his trip, she is not able to stop him.The Straight Story is filled with David Lynch's creativity as a director.  As usual, Lynch captures the essence of small town living, highlighting the quirkiness of seemingly normal circumstances.The only Lynch trademark that is missing from this film (and I can't say that I necessarily missed it) was that element of danger he brings to his films.  Here is a story about a man meeting people as he travels the back roads of Iowa.   There is no violence and nothing to be afraid of. The Straight Story is very funny and at times had me laughing out loud.  But at the same time, there are several heart wrenching moments, as Alvin reveals some of the pain that he has experienced in his life.  Richard Farnsworth has been the second banana throughout his career.  His performance in this film had me wondering, Where has this guy been all this time?  Certainly Farnsworth is Oscar-bound with this role.Anyone going through a mid life crisis might find The Straight Story to be an interesting experience.  In one scene a cyclist asks Alvin What is the worst thing about getting old?  Alvin replies, Remembering when you were young.

The only one who comes  out looking like the screwball is the author.  If  Payne is painting unsympathetic pictures of every  single character he creates (although I suspect he  has a soft spot for Ruth), his treatment needs to be  darker, or it feels shallow--like a juvenile  delinquent caught redhanded, bellyaching about the  hypocrisy of adults to justify the crime, instead of  a woman bent on solving her pregnancy problem in the  worst way.  Or if Payne is going to do social  satire, he needs to stay closer to the subject and  dig deeper to the emotional truth of the problem  instead of being satisfied with the notion that a  woman's body is hers to do as she pleases, no matter  what the consequences are to her child.  And he  fudges even on that; we never know if Ruth has  aborted her baby or not at the end.  All we know is  that she wants to get away from the media circus  that Payne has concocted.  With her drug abuse,  you'd figure that the baby is close to being aborted  anyway, so why isn't Payne celebrating?  The movie  ends restively, but over what is not clear.  So it  feels like a throwaway--a nothing.  He might as well  be saying Why do we give women like Ruth the right  to choose abortion?  What he really is doing is  playing the coward--throwing his hands up at the  whole fight and not taking a stand.Payne also makes a bad choice in picking Laura Dern  as Ruth.  She looks too well-maintained to play the  part.  I wished that someone like Lili Taylor or  Jennifer Jason-Leigh had had a shot at it.  With  Dern cast, there isn't anything for a viewer to grab  onto except an occasional bright line reading.  With  Taylor or Jason-Leigh, the sense that Ruth had it  hard would be obvious.  It's a problem that there is  no mention of Ruth's family or friends; she might  just as soon sprung from the bowels of the Mother  Ship as from middle America.Considering the wealth of talent in this movie, it's  embarrassing how bad the acting is here.

And, like Cutthroat Island, it's another reason why we don't see more pirate films.I'm not saying that every pirate film has to be 100% realistic -- this is the movies, we're talking about, not a history lesson. But, can we please TRY, people? I mean, come on...SELF-PROPELLED TANKS AND SUBMARINES? SEMAPHORE? FLAMETHROWERS? NITROGLYCERINE? I guess this is supposed to be humorous or cute, in an anachronistic, Wild Wild West kind of way? It isn't -- it's LAME.Twice, in this film, a man at ground zero of an enormous explosion is left charred and smoking, like Wiley Coyote, with a stupid expression on his face. At what point does this cease to be the wildly entertaining pirate yarn that people seem to want it to be (it's even championed by Leonard Maltin), and become the RIDICULOUS CLOWN ROUTINE that it actually IS?I mean, Lancaster actually gives us a DISCLAIMER at the beginning of the film. Saying that we should only believe half of what we see (too bad he didn't tell us WHICH half was the believable one). This is the mark of a truly BAD film.

A complex 12-character storyline, the demand for the audience to absorb large amounts of info at a time, and a running time over 3 hours. All of these together means that you will either love or hate this film. But, altogether, how does work out? Perfectly.The plot of the film is so complex it can't be explained. Trying to explain the plot would be like trying to describe the taste of a 4-course meal in one word. The numerous sub-plots(which is probably the wrong word to use, their is no main plot of which the sub-plots branch off) are so complex and intricatley woven that you would otherwise feel like you are watching 12 films at once(but you're not). I read an interview someone did with the director P.T. Anderson, and when the interviewer asked him, So what's the movie about?, he just responded with a blank stare. He did this rightly so, you cannot say what this movie is about.The character development and acting are amazing. Earlier I said that it feels like you are watching 12 different films, but the characters all have things in common that (acted so well), everything flows together. It's a wonderful study of people's emotions on love and being alone as opposed to an editing disaster like it could have been. The dialogue in the film also occasionally lends itself to melodrama (not always, just sometimes), but everyone in the film makes their dialogue so real that it doesn't seem that way.The film's detractors for this film all have their own slighly varying opinion's on it, but most of them are all saying (either with directly or with intelectual trimmings) Its too long and its boring. I think that these people are more used to evenly paced films, something that moves along at the same speed, until eventually coming to a climax. This film is not that, and is not for everyone's taste. If you want to see a film that consist of predictable plot structuring, I dont think you would like this film. However, if you are more open-minded towards new idea's in cinema, and want to see one of the best movies of the year, see Magnolia. You won't regret it.

While this is the story of a man who can't seem to commit to anything but his craft, the film doesn't seem to explore the real reasons why, as many of Allen's films in the past have.  Sean Penn plays  Emmett Ray, the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world.  He is trapped by his second rate status, as often it is the excuse for his heavy drinking and irresponsible behavior.  Aside from playing gigs all over the country, Emmett is involved in pimping, gambling, and just about anything else that has the stamp of immorality on it.  Emmett's idea of a good time is going to the dump and shooting rates, or sitting in rail yards and watching trains go by.Early in the film, while out chasing women on the boardwalk, Emmett meets Hattie, a mute girl played by Samantha Morton.  Her genuine affection for Emmett and his music, and her extremely sweet disposition works, and without sacrificing his selfishness, he agrees to have her around.Woody Allen seems to have a flair for capturing the jazz era on film.  Past efforts like Radio Days and Bullets Over Broadway demonstrated his passion for the music and the styles of those days.  Sweet and Lowdown is yet another example, offering some beautiful jazz with a great 1930's backdrop.Allen chooses a documentary style to tell this story.  In fact, Allen, as himself, is one of the commentators.  Since there was very little plot in this one, (just a lot of escapades thrown together) that was probably for the best. It helps to keep the story moving, giving it purpose, without seeming choppy. Uma Thurman plays a vamp who moves in on Emmett, thus pushing poor Hattie away.  Her performance seemed a bit forced this go round.  She had the look down pat, but here was a girl not sure whether to replay Poison Ivy or stutter like a Woody Allen character.Sean Penn was great in the lead role.  As Emmett he pulls off just enough charm, and mixes it with just enough sleaze to make us believe that these women would fall for him, despite his obvious short comings. Woody Allen always has a fabulous supporting actress and this time around Morton steals the show.  She has no lines in the film and must convey all of her feelings through facial expressions.  Not only does she pull it off, but her performance is so endearing it's hard not to fall in love with the woman.I read a lot of bad reviews about this film before going in and therefore had low expectations.  I have to say, I wasn't disappointed coming out.  I did find the film to be clever in many respects.  I'll admit that this is not one of the brighter lights in Woody Allen's brilliant career, but it isn't bad.  Sweet and Lowdown is worth a look if you happen to like Woody Allen.
