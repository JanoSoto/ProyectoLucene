It was recently released on Blu-Ray DVD, though I watched it in a manner more fitting, on a friend's old VHS tape, the movie taped off of TV from an airing in the 1980's. It was fitting because it is one of those grandmasters of camp. It knows what it is, and doesn't hide it, and it's like discovering a box in the attic full of your old toys from when you were a kid. You dust em off, some of the wheels don't work right, some of the joints are broken off, and some of the toys you're not sure why you picked them up and played with them in the first way. But damn it, they're still so much FUN! Fun is the operating word here. If you can't have it with such a bizarre cast put together - Max Von Sydow as the main villain, and Topol (yes, the guy from Fiddler on a Roof) as a Hawk-Man character, and Timothy Dalton as a supporting role as just another guy fighting 'the man' (or the Emperor really) - then you shouldn't watch these specifically campy 80's sci-fi action movies. It's a throwback to the era of 30's serials (or rather what Star Wars elevated to popular art), and the filmmaker Mike Hodges (of, get this, Get Carter (1971)), and all you need to know is Flash Gordon - his name on his t-shirt - gets involved with this other race out in space (he's a quarterback on Earth) and is the only savior around who can stop the evil Emperor (Sydow with the most awesomely comical eyebrows anywhere) from destroying our planet and\/or marrying the girl of his momentary dreams.But what about the artistry that should be involved, or like the respect for the genre? This actually has more respect for its source than ultimately other 80's action-sci-fi movies had for their sources. Where it may fall flat is that it is SO campy and SO up on its own bad special effects (and believe me, there are some BAD effects here, so cheesy that you can see every line of demarcation of actor with backdrop or set with painting). On top of this the actor 'playing' at Flash Gordon is not at all good at what he does, except looking fresh and bleached like a clean towel. He makes Luke Skywalker look gritty if you can catch my drift.This movie is ultimately so hammy that Queen's music score has to keep blaring up every thirty seconds or so in the big climax to keep up with what else is going on - the flying monkey-hawkmen led by Topol, the man with the metal face and decidedly awesome British accent, Max von Sydow's eyebrows (sorry, I must mention them again for the sake of sanity), and the moments of outrageous fashion and silly fights and explosions. This isn't to say that some moments aren't meant to be taken completely campy. On the contrary, a few sequences, such as the scientist's mind-wipe as the editor goes through about 1,000 shots in a minute going through a man's memory files (some of these almost akin to a similar sequence in The Parallax View with Beatty's mind scanning through lots of images and messages). And it's actually more action-packed and sexual than one might expect out of a supposed kids movie, which is still basically is.All of the morals are BIG and COMIC-BOOK like (must use bold there), and there doesn't have to be too much thought involved. That said, there can be some emotional connection, if only on that level like, again, you had as a child. Flash Gordon is a movie proud to be simple and crazy and with sets that look every bit expensive as they probably were for the time period, and it's best to enjoy it that way. I wished I had watched it as a kid; it's made for nostalgia nowadays, but it also hits aim at any kid who likes the goofy and wild and action-packed.

But this Universal classic would still not even be as half as good as it was if not for one stellar performance Claude Rains as the title role. I cannot even imagine another actor in this life, or the next who could have played Jack Griffin with as much ferocity, exuberance and madness as Rains. He doesn't just chew the scenery, he swallows it whole and then comes back for seconds. His rumbling, powerful voice makes even the most elegant monologues sound like the rantings of a lunatic.

And nowhere is this more apparent than in The Invisible Man.I invite you to give it a watch and more likely than not, you will be pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up.

Scott for Veteran's Day and thought I would comment on it while it's still a fire in my mind.Francis Ford Coppola wrote a very enlightened screenplay that thoughtfully explores the Western Male Ethos and its accruing limitations as it plays its 'civilizing influence' out across the millennia. But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing without the towering Shakespearean quality performance of George C. Scott. When actors speak about shadings, depths and levels, undertones and overtones in a performance this is what they are talking about.This thing of beauty that Scott creates in the persona of General Patton will explain to you on a visceral level why we still have wars and why Cronus ate his children. Why Knute Rockne felt it necessary to explain the need of any society to sublimate somehow the natural male spirit and propensity for combat and, (dare I say it?) conquest in their relationships and surroundings. When wide-eyed innocents ask you -why is there War?, don't explain anything to them. Just sit them down to watch this film and they will also understand why there is football and the deification of Bruce Lee.It is because of this guy; the 'pure warrior' strutting about over a vast playing field creating big Hollywood effects in blood and explosions and steeling himself against the human carnage he has wrought without hardly breaking stride.It is for the glamor and the glory and the thrill and the love of POWER, baby. THAT is why males engage in such a 'preposterous way to settle a dispute' as Sherlock Holmes would comment registering his disgust while twiddling his thumbs and awaiting a 'case' that will once again have him engaged in the hunt and the chase and the fight.Scott conveys through his performance a mythic archetype who somehow takes you grudgingly into his confidence and despite all his carefully orchestrated bombast gets you to know him in subtle and intimate ways. He knows, like Alan Ladd's 'Shane', that his days are numbered. There have been way too many women and children marched naked in the parade before the conqueror's stand for him to be put up with much longer and the clamor for him to march his own way back into the dim mists of history is rising to a deafening pitch. But before he goes, he just wants to hitch up his ivory plated pistols one last time, partners, and show you turkeys how a real warmonger gets it done. That is because he honors and reveres and loves all this with a fervor approaching religious ecstasy and in a way you never will. As James Brown would exclaim, Everybody relax; and watch me work! The wonder is how Scott manages to simultaneously convey General George Patton as a larger than life figure and yet as someone as real and down to Earth as that son of a bitch who keeps complaining about how your kids are always running across his lawn and what he'll do to them the next time. Seeing him in scenes with the other actors he stands out not because of the usual physical beauty of the standard leading man, but because he seems so out of place. He is indeed a walking human anachronism. This is World War II and the American Armed Forces have enough intelligence, grit, technology and will to win it. But just in case events don't go their way, they have brought Solomon Grundy back from the grave to reserve as their Ace in the hole.Karl Malden and supporting cast come across as temperate paragons of sanity next to Scott's fiery Patton. Even the Nazi officers seem like civil servants simply doing their job, as was their assertion when defending the Jewish holocaust. This film, to Scott's credit, seems all about Patton and the holy and unholy forces he has unleashed to make everybody head for the hills before all the evidence is burned and he is finally reigned in for good. Everybody else is fighting for Home and Country, but Scott's Patton is the Spirit of War plying them to accept his Faustian bargain. Thank God nobody takes him up on it.There are many other things to be said about this film. It is like encountering a beautiful woman in the Library. Later on, you try to convince yourself she wasn't all that, but upon encountering her again you realize she WAS all that and there were even more features to her beauty that only now you can appreciate.This is not 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. But should you like films that make you feel like you're part of a winning gang earning the approval of an ornery father by doing the impossible and whose portrait oddly resembles that of the dearly departed Dorian Gray, I can only recommend this poetry spouting reincarnation of the Force of War.However, when taking your girl on a date, and having a choice between seeing 'Love Story' or 'Patton', I suggest you see 'Love Story' first.

Just sit them down to watch this film and they will also understand why there is football and the deification of Bruce Lee.It is because of this guy; the 'pure warrior' strutting about over a vast playing field creating big Hollywood effects in blood and explosions and steeling himself against the human carnage he has wrought without hardly breaking stride.It is for the glamor and the glory and the thrill and the love of POWER, baby. THAT is why males engage in such a 'preposterous way to settle a dispute' as Sherlock Holmes would comment registering his disgust while twiddling his thumbs and awaiting a 'case' that will once again have him engaged in the hunt and the chase and the fight.Scott conveys through his performance a mythic archetype who somehow takes you grudgingly into his confidence and despite all his carefully orchestrated bombast gets you to know him in subtle and intimate ways. He knows, like Alan Ladd's 'Shane', that his days are numbered. There have been way too many women and children marched naked in the parade before the conqueror's stand for him to be put up with much longer and the clamor for him to march his own way back into the dim mists of history is rising to a deafening pitch. But before he goes, he just wants to hitch up his ivory plated pistols one last time, partners, and show you turkeys how a real warmonger gets it done. That is because he honors and reveres and loves all this with a fervor approaching religious ecstasy and in a way you never will. As James Brown would exclaim, Everybody relax; and watch me work! The wonder is how Scott manages to simultaneously convey General George Patton as a larger than life figure and yet as someone as real and down to Earth as that son of a bitch who keeps complaining about how your kids are always running across his lawn and what he'll do to them the next time. Seeing him in scenes with the other actors he stands out not because of the usual physical beauty of the standard leading man, but because he seems so out of place. He is indeed a walking human anachronism. This is World War II and the American Armed Forces have enough intelligence, grit, technology and will to win it. But just in case events don't go their way, they have brought Solomon Grundy back from the grave to reserve as their Ace in the hole.Karl Malden and supporting cast come across as temperate paragons of sanity next to Scott's fiery Patton. Even the Nazi officers seem like civil servants simply doing their job, as was their assertion when defending the Jewish holocaust. This film, to Scott's credit, seems all about Patton and the holy and unholy forces he has unleashed to make everybody head for the hills before all the evidence is burned and he is finally reigned in for good. Everybody else is fighting for Home and Country, but Scott's Patton is the Spirit of War plying them to accept his Faustian bargain. Thank God nobody takes him up on it.There are many other things to be said about this film. It is like encountering a beautiful woman in the Library. Later on, you try to convince yourself she wasn't all that, but upon encountering her again you realize she WAS all that and there were even more features to her beauty that only now you can appreciate.This is not 'The Best Years of Our Lives'. But should you like films that make you feel like you're part of a winning gang earning the approval of an ornery father by doing the impossible and whose portrait oddly resembles that of the dearly departed Dorian Gray, I can only recommend this poetry spouting reincarnation of the Force of War.However, when taking your girl on a date, and having a choice between seeing 'Love Story' or 'Patton', I suggest you see 'Love Story' first.

But the same was build up to the one best endings I have ever seen for any movie(talking about the final cut of the film).The message it tries to convey is very deep and philosophical which sometimes may not be understood in one viewing. The second time you see it, you are well aware of the pacing so you can indulge in the beauty of the film(more or less like viewing 2001 A Space Odyssey).Harrison Ford plays Deckard who is a Blade Runner.

But later they are outlawed on Earth due to their tendency towards violence. Now some 4 replicants have made it to LA in pursuit of their creator and its Deckard's task to 'retire' them.Well the best thing about the movie is not its plot or story but the visuals. The dark and gloomy portrayal of the LA city is quite haunting. Makes you immediately think of our imminent future.The cinematography is top-notch. Also the questions it raise about humanity are golden, such as the meaning being a human , our resistance to our imminent death, can we be so technologically advanced that we can defy the laws of nature and so on.This is what pure sci-fi movies should be about generating thoughts and questions in our minds.The music by Vangelis adds remarkably to the haunting experience the film gives.

The best performance is by Rutger Hauer playing Roy Batty the leader of the escaped replicants. A scene involving him and Deckard towards the end is one of the most heart-touching moments ever portrayed in movies.If you do not like the movie on your first view better suggest watch it again knowing what the movie is about and is trying to say. Also I would recommend the final cut of the film. Right now, this is my favorite science-fiction movie till date (yes, I prefer it more over the ambiguous and long 2001).

In spite of being nominated for so many prestigious prizes, it did not win any. However, this fact cannot put a shadow over the fantastic job that was done while making the movie. Critics from all over the world were absolutely amazed by the drama with outstanding and unbelievably realistic scenery. It is simply a must to pay a great respect to the main protagonists &#x96; experienced Morgan Freeman as Red, a man who will provide you with everything you need, and irreplaceable Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who was unjustly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.The story starts in the late 1940's when a banker Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary for murdering his wife and her lover. He instantly becomes a friend with a contraband smuggler and the film's narrator Ellis Red Redding who procures a rock hammer for Andy so he can create small stone chess pieces. Soon, Andy unleashes his financial skills when he overhears the merciless guard chief Hadley complaining about taxes. Thanks to his former occupation, Andy is given a position in the library so he can manage financial matters for Shawshank. As the years pass, Norton, the head of the prison, uses the library and public works worked by prison labor to undercut skilled labor costs so he can receive huge kickbacks. Andy is used for laundering the money using the alias Randall Stephens. In the mid-1960's young Tommy Williams, an irredeemable burglar, is imprisoned. He gets close with Andy and Red and when hearing the details of Andy's case begins to talk about his former inmate. He explains that the inmate told him how he had killed two people and got away with it which seems to be a proof of Andy's innocence. Unfortunately, as soon as Norton hears a word about it, he has young Tommy shot by Hadley. This appears to be enough for Andy. He tells Red about his secret dream of living in a Mexican coastal village and instructs him how to get there when he is free. The next day, Andy's cell is found empty. Norton and the guards find out that Andy escaped through a tunnel which he had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. While they are searching for him, Andy, as Randall Stephens, visits a large number of banks to withdraw the laundered money. Besides that, he sends a package with evidence of what has happened at the prison to a regional newspaper. Will the police and the newspaper trust Andy? Will he and Red ever meet again? Go and watch the bravura ending.It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is an opportunity to witness how fate is the best judge in the end, how a frightened cat can turn into a brave lion and how a friendship can be developed even in the darkest moments of ones' lives. Next, I was really impressed by the perfect narrating skills of Mr. Freeman. The actor's storytelling keeps you deeply settled in your seat and you are able to literally breathe the story.

Without it, the superhero genre as we know it today would be confined to either TV or crummy B-movies (I'm looking at you, Fantastic 4!), Marvel would be nothing like the entertainment colossus it is today and poor old Stan Lee would be a half-forgotten figure from history instead of the cultural icon most fans revere him as. But why is this film so successful, a film still worthy of a watch even today especially given the character's recent bad run of form? The effects look a little rough around the edges these days and the script lacks a decent sense of cohesion, meaning that it sometimes doesn't make sense. It even plays fast-and-loose with the characters origins, straying from the source material whenever it feels like it. But it has a real gem in the form of its leading man, an actor so obscure at the time that nobody could foresee the level of brilliance he would bring to the part and how closely associated he would become with the role, even in death.On the distant planet Krypton, the great Jor-El (Marlon Brando) is forced to send his infant son to Earth to escape the impending destruction of their home-world. Barely leaving in time, Kal-El spends three years travelling through space before crashing in a field in Kansas where he is taken in by the Kents (Glenn Ford & Phyllis Thaxter) who name him Clark. As he grows and understands his unique powers on Earth, Clark (Christopher Reeve) heads to the city of Metropolis and gets a job at the Daily Planet alongside ace reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Fighting his growing attraction to her, Clark unveils his powers as Superman but doesn't reckon on the schemes of eccentric evil genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) putting the world in jeopardy.However you look it, the film belongs to Reeve who is simply perfect as both Clark & Superman. The shifts in character whenever the glasses go back on is astonishing - even his body shape seems to change. He easily outshines the rest of the cast who seem to vary between indifferent and comical. Hackman is a weak baddie as Lex, coming across like a guest villain on the old Batman TV series in his ridiculous underground lair. He isn't helped by Ned Beatty as typically inept henchman Otis or Valerie Perrine as random buxom bombshell Eve. Kidder does better as Lois but personally, I preferred Teri Hatcher's interpretation in the 90's TV show. As for the film itself, it is a ambitious epic covering both Krypton and the US and blows you away with sweeping vistas of Kansas countryside alongside angular crystal formations in the Fortress Of Solitude. Sadly, the script cannot string all the pieces together - feeling like the work of many typewriters (which it was), it feels disjointed and left many questions at the end. Speaking of which, the film's climax was a let-down as though the writers were backed into a corner they couldn't get out of.But all of these minor niggles cannot distract from the performance of Reeve. He would struggle to escape the cape for the rest of his career, cut tragically short though it was. But as legacies go, it's not a bad one - Superman remains an iconic picture and one that isn't just for geeks. Who cares about the effects or the miscasting or the dodgy storyline when you believe the film wholeheartedly? The moment Clark tears open his suit to reveal the famous S motif or the stirring soundtrack that could only be by John Williams or even the first time you see Reeve fly off into the sky - these are moments that cannot fail but capture your imagination and cheer for the film until the credits roll. I went into this thinking it would be corny and half-arsed but I was wrong - it might be a bit overblown at times and occasionally descends into parody but I'd recommend this film over any of the others out there. And if nothing else, Reeve also reminds us how much of a schmuck Dean Cain was...

Without it, the superhero genre as we know it today would be confined to either TV or crummy B-movies (I'm looking at you, Fantastic 4!), Marvel would be nothing like the entertainment colossus it is today and poor old Stan Lee would be a half-forgotten figure from history instead of the cultural icon most fans revere him as. But why is this film so successful, a film still worthy of a watch even today especially given the character's recent bad run of form? The effects look a little rough around the edges these days and the script lacks a decent sense of cohesion, meaning that it sometimes doesn't make sense. It even plays fast-and-loose with the characters origins, straying from the source material whenever it feels like it. But it has a real gem in the form of its leading man, an actor so obscure at the time that nobody could foresee the level of brilliance he would bring to the part and how closely associated he would become with the role, even in death.On the distant planet Krypton, the great Jor-El (Marlon Brando) is forced to send his infant son to Earth to escape the impending destruction of their home-world. Barely leaving in time, Kal-El spends three years travelling through space before crashing in a field in Kansas where he is taken in by the Kents (Glenn Ford & Phyllis Thaxter) who name him Clark. As he grows and understands his unique powers on Earth, Clark (Christopher Reeve) heads to the city of Metropolis and gets a job at the Daily Planet alongside ace reporter Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Fighting his growing attraction to her, Clark unveils his powers as Superman but doesn't reckon on the schemes of eccentric evil genius Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) putting the world in jeopardy.However you look it, the film belongs to Reeve who is simply perfect as both Clark & Superman. The shifts in character whenever the glasses go back on is astonishing - even his body shape seems to change. He easily outshines the rest of the cast who seem to vary between indifferent and comical. Hackman is a weak baddie as Lex, coming across like a guest villain on the old Batman TV series in his ridiculous underground lair. He isn't helped by Ned Beatty as typically inept henchman Otis or Valerie Perrine as random buxom bombshell Eve. Kidder does better as Lois but personally, I preferred Teri Hatcher's interpretation in the 90's TV show.

But Walkabout is like many of the dramas that emerged during the early Seventies in that it's well made but doesn't always make a lot of sense. It reminded me, weirdly, of Vanishing Point although there's less that happens here - the minimal cast, largely improvised script and uncomfortable setting makes for a much more visceral experience. And while its tale of cultures clashing makes for compulsive viewing, there is a sense of unease about the thing that might put you off.Driven by their father (John Meillon) into the Australian outback for a picnic, a teenage girl (Agutter) realises that he has other motives on his mind. As her father opens fire on her and her younger brother (Luc Roeg), they both run for cover before she sees her father shoot himself in the head and set fire to their car. Stranded in the desert and surrounded by the creatures that live there, they slowly wander through the terrain hoping for rescue. But they encounter a Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil) on his walkabout - a rite of passage where they must live off the land before becoming a man. Aided by their mysterious friend and his survival skills (despite not sharing a language), the children's hopes for a return to civilisation increase.Walkabout can, at times, be a brutal watch as animals are seen speared, shot and dismembered in graphic detail. It offers an unflinching look at a land and people largely untouched by our civilisation, one that often seems as alien to us as anything from outer space. But the film doesn't shy away from turning the spotlight on us, asking you questions that you might not like the answers to. Are we any better than the Aborigines because we hunt for sport with rifles and jeeps as opposed to spearing animals for food? Despite the lack of anything really interesting happening, the film is a compulsive watch thanks largely to the young cast. Agutter leads in a fearless performance as the bewitching schoolgirl although little Roeg (director Nicholas Roeg's son) also does well as he seems to have most of the dialogue. In between scenes, close-up shots of endless bizarre animals add to the unusual atmosphere while Gulpilil's performance feels frighteningly authentic.It can feel a bit of a head-trip but Walkabout is a good example of a movie working despite having little behind it. I wouldn't call it entertaining - it's much too bleak for that - but it's certainly interesting, both from a narrative and production point of view. With no effects, very little music other than what can be heard from the transistor radio the children have with them and little to explain what is actually going on, the film has to work hard to hold your attention and it succeeds, just. It's an unsettling attempt to compare our society with one that will be utterly foreign to 99% of its audience and while it's a brave thing to look in the mirror, it might have been nice with Nicholas Roeg wasn't using one he'd borrowed from a circus tent.

It basically has all the clichés of Heroes who don't play by the rules Villains who are petty, no development or any kind of arc and at the end... I enjoyed it.The plot is that a hit-man who has a strong moral code (well... for a contract killer) accidentally blinds a woman on his latest contract. Feeling guilty he decides to get close to her and help her out in any way possible. While this is going on a cop who doesn't play by the rules is asked to be a bodyguard to a prominent figure - who is the hit-man's next target, after a chase between cop and hit-man the hit-man finds out he's been set up by the Triads because his identity was blown. The cop eventually finds out about him but they must team up together to kill all the triads.Basically my biggest problem with the movie is that the Triad boss's motivation is because he wants to clean up the whole He's blown his cover but he begins taking care of it as he's returning home. This would mean that he would prematurely know this is going on or someone found out about it, told him and he sent people after him and they got there in under 5 minutes, this is not because I missed a subtitle, in the action scene in the beginning of the movie the only survivor could not tell people what the assassin looked like.Aside from that it basically encompasses all to expect from this genre of film. The action as typical of John Woo is actually really good. The cinematography is also something to admire from this movie. Not the best but it is worth mentioning and I also think think to some extent the acting is... okay, I mean it's over the top in places - yes but that's the genre.So all of whether you'll like this movie or not boils down to if you like these types of movies. Because when you get down to it this movie is probably the best example of Hong Kong Action cinema I have seen and if you don't really like the clichés then you won't like this movie. I personally think it's half good movie half guilty pleasure (... if that makes sense) but if someone wants to see a solid enough action movie of the 80's then this is certainly going to satisfy your expectations.

This would mean that he would prematurely know this is going on or someone found out about it, told him and he sent people after him and they got there in under 5 minutes, this is not because I missed a subtitle, in the action scene in the beginning of the movie the only survivor could not tell people what the assassin looked like.Aside from that it basically encompasses all to expect from this genre of film. The action as typical of John Woo is actually really good. The cinematography is also something to admire from this movie. Not the best but it is worth mentioning and I also think think to some extent the acting is... okay, I mean it's over the top in places - yes but that's the genre.So all of whether you'll like this movie or not boils down to if you like these types of movies.

It basically has all the clichés of Heroes who don't play by the rules Villains who are petty, no development or any kind of arc and at the end... I enjoyed it.The plot is that a hit-man who has a strong moral code (well... for a contract killer) accidentally blinds a woman on his latest contract.

Like video games, sports movies are often hackneyed affairs filled with fading A-listers, wannabe TV stars hoping for a big break and endless clichés. And as if by magic, along comes Ace Ventura Pet Detective to prove my point! Except this has the added bonus of being an early Jim Carrey comedy which means there's added goofing around on show too! Having been told to scrub it off my List Of Shame immediately by work colleagues, I'm struggling to see what the fuss was about. Nostalgia can be a tricky mistress and having missed it the first time around, this immature movie simply doesn't do anything for me.Carrey plays Ace Ventura, an eccentric pet detective working in Miami so if any dogs get kidnapped or rare birds fly the nest, he's your man. Desperate to pay his overdue rent, the mother of all cases lands on his lap when Snowflake, a mascot belonging to the Miami Dolphins, gets kidnapped. Along with the Dolphins' chief publicist Melissa Robinson (Courtney Cox), Ace must track Snowflake down as the forthcoming Superbowl approaches. Despite the sneering interference from Lt. Einhorn (Sean Young), Ace deduces that a former player must be involved somehow and must work fast when the Dolphins' quarterback (Dan Marino) is also kidnapped.It may be as dumb as sticking a fork in a toaster but the film's lead actor is just as energetic. Carrey is a force of nature, stretching his face into all sorts of weird shapes and contorting his body as much as his dialogue. As he goofs his way through the material, the rest of the cast haven't a hope in hell of keeping up with him (is it a coincidence that Carrey would play The Mask the same year?). As a long-time fan of the Fins, it was good to see the likes of Marino (who struggles to act as himself) and the legendary Don Shula involved but they all have a slight hint of embarrassment at proceedings. Either it was the script which is a few pages short of a chapter anyway or maybe it was Carrey pretending to literally talk through his ass. Speaking of embarrassment, can someone tell me why women found Ace irresistible because most of the time, he comes across a some sort of insufferable man-child like Robin Williams used to play? Unless you're a young child or an absolute Dolphin nut, I can't see what viewers new to Ace Ventura Pet Detective would get out of it. It has its moments but it lacks conviction, as though it expects Carrey being a manic ball of fire to be enough to carry the film. It isn't - a true comedy relies on more than crudity, gurning and silliness. Jokes would be a start - for all the energy on screen, I'm at a loss to replay any genuine belly laughs I may have had watching. If you like your puerile drivel then you'll probably enjoy it much more than I did. I knew there was a reason I missed it the first time around...

Although I must say I'm not in love with this film, it is worth a watch, not just for Norris fans.
