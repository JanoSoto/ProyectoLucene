It is a story of deep sacrifice and passion that deals with two star-crossed lovers. The first half is very funny and witty and the second half is very touching. If you really look at who these two characters are and what they have to go through in their search for true love and happiness, it's quite beautiful. Take Terry McKay(Deborah Kerr)for example. She was poor. She worked at a night club. She wasn't in the best conditions, and then, all of a sudden, this rich, handsom man shows up and wisks her away to a better life on Park Avenue.  She just wants to feel secure. Then, all of a sudden, she meets Nickie Ferrente(Cary Grant), a swave and debonair playboy, who is also engaged. When they first meet, he persues her and she refuses. She doesn't want him to disrupt her life and she dosen't want Ken, her fiancee, to be hurt. However, as the trip progresses, she realizes that she has fallen in love with Nickie and she experiences true passion for the first time in her life. She is being torn apart by the guilt she feels for hurting Ken, her obligations to him, and the life she desires, but she just can't walk away from this love she experiences with Nickie. Then, Nickie and Terry agree to separate for six months so they can get their lives in order and they decide to reunite with eachother on the top of the Empire State Building.I have heard all the bad arguments for this movie. And I understand where they come from. People focus on the details that can be misinterpreted, instead of looking past all of that and seeing what the story really is about. Regarding Terry hiding the accident from Nickie, many people see that as ridiculous and dramatic, but its not. She doesn't want any handouts. He loved her as she was. She doesn't want to go back to him broken. She knows he doesn't have a lot of money and he may blow the situation out of proportion. It's a question of pride and besides she already knows that she hurt him so deeply by what happened and she can't just come out and tell the man she loves and hasn't seen for months that she was in an terrible accident. She wanted to tell him but she knew that she couldn't.I think the acting is wonderful in this movie. The chemistry between Grant and Kerr is unmistakeable. The last scene is so heart-warming and you can really see the longing and anger between these two people. I have seen the other two versions of this story, and both are missing something that is present in this movie. Each interpretation of the story has it's own good and bad points. But I feel this movie is the most well-rounded out of the three. And if this version was SO terrible, then why was it number five on AFI's list of the 100 Greatest Love Stories of all time? The original version wasn't even on the list. Therefore, how can this movie be so awful and melodramtic? You have to watch it with an open mind. You can't pick it apart. The language may be a little outdated, I mean, it was made in the 50's, but you can't look at this movie and compare it with the love stories of today. They are two different things. This style of romance may not be everyone's favorite, and I respect that, but that does not make this movie terrible. No. If you understand the story and really look at all the hardships the characters go through, and the sacrifices they make for true love, then you will realize what a heart-warming and touching movie it is.

Yes it is a rather low budget B-movie with not the best effects but it is still good.

The boy also seems to really have gotten into his role and his acting is better than can be expected from his age. I also liked the camera work, it is quite capturing and fluid. The story itself is fast paced, never stalls or gets boring but neither does it get too fast. The ending is not the best so to speak but it passes as ok. I wanna draw a parallel to Halloween (I) which I saw a few days ago too I can enjoy slasher movies and expected a lot from Halloween but after about an hour (when the action was slowly starting) I started to fast forward through it - the reason being that the movie had already lost me, eventho it is certainly better made (not hard when you think of that it needs less special effects) than Critters and also has a more serious story that could almost pass as real. The difference here tho was that Halloween didn't get on with it, it seemed to me like a one hour brake before it really took off. Critter tho got me from the beginning and held my attention throughout because you got to the people it was about and the actors were good at describing the family, so my attention had always something to hold on to. That is something I didn't believe I would experience (certainly not if you think of the difference in status between the two mentioned movies).I was surprised to find Ethan Phillips playing one of the policemen!

They have no idea what they are in for... hell.This is a movie about friendship and courage under stress and not about the Vietnam war. As Micheal Cimino said. It shows how war affects the lives of everyone around it and in it.In my opinion this is Robert De Niro's best performance on film as the noble and couragous Mike; he was nominated for an Oscar. Christopher Walken won the Oscar for best supporting actor. Micheal Cimino won the Oscar for best director, and it won best editing and best picture. It would have been a crime to give these awards to any other picture that year.

In a movie, what could normally be boring chatter turns into an intricate song which helps to tell the story. Anastasia does this with excellence. Throw in a stellar cast of voices and a beautiful scenic backdrop, and you've got an A+ film.I do have to agree with others about the villian of the film.

It captured a universal theme that viewers all over the world can relate to, even after so many years have passed since the movie was released. It is a story of life of a woman, who is struggling to survive and find happiness in spite of the destruction of the Civil War. The events shown in the film are taking place in Georgia in the 1860's. The South lost the Civil War and the whole southern civilization was, just like the title says, gone with the wind. The script written by Sidney Howard was derived from Margaret Mitchell's first and only published, best-selling Civil War and Reconstruction Period novel of 1,037 pages. In the following sentences, I am not describing the plot or spoiling, I simply discuss the opening scenes with the credits and who the main heroine is. I also disclose who her parents are (nationality and what they're known for). The opening credits of the film are presented against carefully selected `before Civil War' nature scenes, with narrator telling the short story of the southern civilization and dramatic music playing in the background. The film was shot in three-strip Technicolor and is a classic tale of love-hate romance. The main heroine, Scarlet O'Hara, is born into a wealthy southern family and is sixteen at the beginning of the movie. Her parents are a truly American blend - her father is an Irish immigrant with the love for land and horses, and her mother is a daughter of a French general, known for her mild temper and excellent manners. They own a huge house, a farm and many servants - slaves. Scarlett is the oldest of the three daughters. The movie first shows the girl that Scarlett was `before the war'. This is to demonstrate how much she has changed throughout the War and the Reconstruction. General knowledge of the Civil War and the key southern battles would help understanding the movie even better, or vise versa - the movie will help understand the Civil War better. In me, it produced an interest in history of the main battles and how it affected people of the South. The movie is realistic and is full of bright, memorable characters. Scarlett has a lot to learn, like human virtues and the value of a true friendship, and does learn a lot throughout the film and gets confusing feelings every now and then, which shape her character and make her into a woman. I certainly enjoyed Gone with the Wind and highly recommend it!

It is based on a novel by William Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay. Director Rob Reiner brings life to this story and effectively evokes the enchanting spirit of the witty 1973 novel.The movie opens with a sick boy (Fred Savage) who receives a visit from his grandfather (Peter Falk) who intends to read to him from his favorite book. The boy is not exactly pleased to be distracted from his world of video games. However, his mood quickly changes as he and the viewer are transported to a place out of time. We are taken to Florin, a kingdom in an imaginary land, complete with dashing heroes, cowardly princes, rhyming giants, rodents of unusual size, fancy swordfights, and yes . . . even some kissing.This fairy tale begins on a farm in the countryside. There lives a beautiful, young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) who learns that as you wish really means I love you when she falls for her farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes). While trying to seek his fortune, Westley disappears at sea and becomes an apparent victim of the Dread Pirate Roberts. A few years later, Buttercup, who is now engaged to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), is kidnapped by a trio of misfits, which includes brains--Vizzini (Wallace Shawn); brawn--Fezzik (André the Giant); and sword--Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). As they sail away toward the Cliffs of Insanity, they notice the pursuit of a man in black. Now begins the adventure . . . .The central idea of The Princess Bride is that true love can conquer all. Throughout the movie, there are many hardships and trials that true love must endure. The movie keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether or not there will be the classic fairy tale ending.This movie is appealing to me because of the classic fairy tale style combined with the witty humor, well choreographed action sequences, and intense instances of suspense. The characters are well developed and all the actors give an amazing performance which adds to the overall appeal of the movie. The Princess Bride is easily one of my all time favorite movies.
