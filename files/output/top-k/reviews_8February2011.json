This is due to various reasons. 1). Its cast is mainly children. Quite often films with casts children dominated lack quality acting as the youngsters simply have just not been in the business long enough to be able to deliver impressive performances. However Stand By Me's young cast all are believable and show great chemistry. River Phoenix in particular is amazing as the brave , yet troubled Chris. 2). The film is very very short. Quite often the best films are around 2 hours in length. Often this duration is necessary for a film to drum up enough depth for it to stay with the viewer long after the credits. Stand By Me has no trouble going into decent amounts of depth and staying with the viewer in only 85 minutes. Its nice to watch a film which doesn't drag on. There is too many of that these days. 3).The focus of this film is on children so you would think it would probably only appeal to a childish audience.Yet it doesn't. It deals with some heavier material than initially expected but this is welcomed by more mature viewers. Plus most of us value our childhoods so its childhood friendship content is refreshing to view as it encourages us to reminisce on our good times of our younger days. In saying that it is epic for what it is I guess it was always going to be in some ways as its written by arguably the most successful writer of the 20th century Stephen King. Richard Dreyfus (Jaws) plays a satisfying side role as the older Gordie who narrates the story. Stand By Me is an excellent film. i recommend it to anyone who values childhood, friendship or just wants to witness a fine and ultimately moving piece of cinema.

The feeling of observing a real, living thing comes across, only a bit funnier than reality.Tell Joy not to get on the horse in back, mutters the show's MC, Salisbury (Joel Grey) regarding an actress playing a white woman abducted by Indians. It looks fake. We're in the authentic business. Later, Salisbury shoots down a band's idea of real frontier music as too Ukrainian.All this is easy to miss when so much is going on at once, while horses nearly run down a pedestrian in the foreground. This is a Robert Altman film, after all, or Robert Altman's Absolutely Unique and Heroic Enterprise of Inimitable Lustre! as it bills itself.As Jeff Lebowski might say, Altman's not into that whole brevity thing here. A two-hour extravaganza, Buffalo Bill stars Paul Newman as Bill and makes its points about how show business and American mythmaking became one with repetitive, haymaker swings. The end result is a comedy that's not that funny and a social statement that's not that convincing, but Altman's secret sauce of a busy camera and piquant performances makes for a pleasant if shapeless affair.Newman's something of a disappointment, giving less a performance than a caricature. I get the feeling he was directed by Altman to just play a slightly older and more pompous Hud with a goatee. He fills out Bill by drinking rotgut from a schooner, loving and spurning a succession of opera singers who never stop singing in frame, and watching over his stardom with a kind of prissy defensiveness that belies his self-cultivated frontier image. He can be a joy to watch still, working his eyes and playing to his mirror, maybe winking at the audience about what they expect from him as both Bill and Paul. If only he had better material.You ain't changed, Bill.I ain't supposed to. That's why people pay to see me.There's also the business of his dealing with the Wild West Show's newest star attraction, Sitting Bull (Frank Kaquitts), which gives the story much of its social perspective. Bill thinks of Bull as an ungrateful pet who needs cultivation in the show business, while Bull thinks Bill sells lies in the guise of history. Hence the history lesson, which feels shoehorned in from a more socially committed source play. Altman wants to tell that story, but most times he'd rather have fun with the show-making part, and while you are watching this, you wish he'd cut loose and do just that.The film succeeds in short bursts, though the eccentric casting choices Altman throws at you here don't work as well as they did in his other films. Geraldine Chaplin as Annie Oakley? Harvey Keitel as Bill's nerdy nephew? Some Altman vets like Robert DoQui and Allan F. Nicholls are barely in the film while stars like Newman, Keitel, and Burt Lancaster get longer spotlight time. John Considine is fun as Annie's flinchy husband, the handsomest human target in the West, though that running joke, like so many others, is plugged more times than one of Annie's nickels. I was impressed also by Kevin McCarthy's publicist character, not only for the juiciness of his grandiloquent performance but the magnitude of his handlebar mustache.Buffalo Bill takes a lot of time saying a good deal less than it thinks. But the spectacle of the show business and the minor bits of Altman kookiness and sardonic commentary around the edges keep this a diverting if underfilling entertainment.

Not only the best Batman film, (I even think it tops Nolan's brilliant vision), I think its one of the best films ever made. So 'Returns had a lot to live up to. And I think with a few changes, a bit of tampering with the plot here and there, it really could have topped it. Firstly, the casting. Brilliant stuff. DeVito's Penguin is grotesque, evil, and quite scary, very menacing. Yet by the end of the film, you ignore all that, and genuinely feel sorry for him. I could imagine no other actor taking that role. It seems The Penguin was created solely for the purpose of DeVito to portray him. Not as good a villain as Nicholson's Joker, but definitely in my list of all time movie villains. Michelle Pheiffer's Catwoman too is purrrfect (sorry, couldn't resist), she takes the role and runs astray (again, sorry!). She is sexy, mysterious, and very alluring. The chemistry between her and Keaton is fantastic. Now, do i really need to talk about the greatness of Keaton as Batman? Well i'm not going to, see my review for Batman 1989, although we all know he is phenomenal. Same with Christopher Walken. Just hearing he's a villain in a Burton Batman film instantly provokes excitement.The plot. Its good, but not great. I find it hard buying the idea of Penguin running for mayor, but i suppose this is fiction after all. Its a Batman film. But i liked the idea of Catwoman and Penguin teaming up, albeit for a short while, and framing Batman. Also an evil corrupt businessman working with Penguin too was a great move. Although, I don't feel the story is as engaging or exciting as the previous film. Its just something about the first film. They really couldn't match it. And no Batman film really has since. Hell, any superhero film for that matter. Ahh screw it, no film really has! Now, the sets. Very, very, dark. Yet, very, very, excellent. Matches the tone of the film perfectly. My only regret is they didn't use Anton Furst's fantastic sets at Pinewood Studios. It was a brilliant piece of architecture, his Gotham City. Nonetheless, these sets are good, and like I said, are very well suited to the atmosphere and overall tone of the film. Overall, 'Returns is a good film.

You would think they would expect it, I personally thought the darkness of both films is what Batman is all about. He's not a happy camper protecting a brightly neon lighted fantastic spectacle of a city. Nudge Nudge Schumacher...Good film. Great cast. Good music (however i preferred the first films score). And fantastic directing. You can tell in some scenes that the producers let Burton go crazy and do whatever he wanted. The first film is a Batman film, this one, is a Tim Burton film.

Nonetheless, these sets are good, and like I said, are very well suited to the atmosphere and overall tone of the film. Overall, 'Returns is a good film. Not as good as the original, but a decent Batman flick. Shame Burton didn't do more. People complained at how dark this was compared to Batman 1989, but that film was dark. You would think they would expect it, I personally thought the darkness of both films is what Batman is all about. He's not a happy camper protecting a brightly neon lighted fantastic spectacle of a city. Nudge Nudge Schumacher...Good film. Great cast. Good music (however i preferred the first films score). And fantastic directing. You can tell in some scenes that the producers let Burton go crazy and do whatever he wanted. The first film is a Batman film, this one, is a Tim Burton film. Its very entertaining, and a good Batman film. And thats all that matters really.

The other good things the film has in its favor is a masterful director, a very good ensemble cast and an interesting script--though one clearly derrived from similar films that preceded it (apart from Rififi, also The Killing, Big Deal on Madonna Street, Bob le Flambeur and even The Pink Panther). In fact, because the film is a bit derivative, I had to knock a point off my vote. Still, it's a nice film and the heist sequence was done well---very tense and meticulous.By the way, although the film never seemed to get much attention, another very good caper film is Grand Slam (1967).

Did it fill said shoes? Well... not quite. Star Trek III The Search for Spock is much different from the previous two films, and something feels a bit off. It takes place exactly where Wrath of Khan left off. Mr. Spock is dead and his coffin has landed on the Genesis planet created in a matter of seconds during the previous film. When Captain Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise crew return to Starfleet, Enterprise is ordered to be decommissioned. Kirk won't have it though, and he risks his entire career to steal the Enterprise and go search for Spock, who he still believes to be alive, just not in physical form yet. The Search for Spock also introduces the Klingon's into the films for the first time. It marked the first time Klingons had been spoken of since the original series. This film is undoubtedly a Trek film, but it lacks a certain something that prevents it from being very memorable.I say this film is undoubtedly a Star Trek film, but that is really only at face value. The Search for Spock has all the right characters and they're all a lot of fun. It also looks great for a 1980's sci-fi film. The interior of the Enterprise is as familiar and memorable as always, and there is also the introduction of the sinister looking Klingon battleship that really stands out. But there's a subtlety and a quiet brilliance that is missing from this film, and that it something that any good Star Trek film has to have. I think of it this way. For this film, the Star Trek slate was wiped clean. Some necessary elements were put back such as the characters and locations, but the filmmakers forgot to put the intellectual spirit that makes Star Trek what it is back where it belongs. It isn't like Star Trek The Motion Picture where everything bad about Star Trek was horribly exemplified and drove the film into the ground, leaving out the brilliance and depth of the original series' subtext. Instead, The Search for Spock just turns Star Trek into a shallow but fun sci-fi film.The story in The Search for Spock isn't poorly written, and overall there isn't a whole lot that is truly bad about this film. It's just when you boil it down this story doesn't mean much and it really only serves as a segway into the next film. The Search for Spock is notably more light hearted than most Trek films or TV episodes. This could have been caused from various factors. One such is Christopher Lloyd's awkward role as Klingon Commander Kruge. At first I really liked it simply because I love Christopher Lloyd. But after a while I realized just how non-threatening the Klingons were in this film. Lloyd has a lot of fun in his role, but it just doesn't feel quite right. There's also a severe lack of Spock in this film since everybody else is searching for him... obviously. Leonard Nimoy's cold yet intuitive portrayal of Mr. Spock always added a certain ingenuity to Star Trek, and without him for the majority of the film there is a strange empty void.I had fun with The Search for Spock simply because it is Star Trek, and I love Star Trek. But overall this film pales in comparison to it's predecessor, The Wrath of Khan, and it doesn't capture everything that Star Trek was about, only some of it. As a sci-fi film it is decent, but as a Trek film its issues are disappointing. There isn't a whole lot truly bad about this film, but there just isn't a lot about it that is good either.

Then I got born again and I saw the movie as being atheist propaganda (there is no heaven), so I threw my ankh into the Sound. When a movie connects with a viewer that deeply, it's real art.Maybe it was the right movie at the right time for a trapped teenager. I'm not so sure it was the product of its age. By 1976, the revolution had already failed, there was no age of Aquarius, and the Summer of Love was just a silly phase a few people had gone through back when they were young. The reality of the mid-70s was inflation, gas lines, and disco music, not the search for freedom and the questioning of faith.I was astounded to see they made this whole movie for only $15 million. A decade ago, they paid Pierce Brosnan $15 million just to read his lines (actual acting would have cost more, presumably) in Dante's Peak. Even though the model city with its model trains is pretty much straight out of Metropolis, and actual locations were juxtaposed rather incongruously (California chaparral next to Texas water park next to kudzu-covered city), the sets are pretty good and do convey the sense of a very clean, pleasurable, Caucasian, and definitely indoor, society -- a suburban shopping mall, in other words.

Kusturica created this dark, gritty magical realism film as an honest window into the everyday lives of these people, without bias. Perhan, the protagonist, is a young Romani boy with telekinetic powers. His grandmother is said to have the ability to heal the sick. She shows a favoritism for Perhan, even over her own son&#x97;the destitute and degenerate uncle, Merdzan. Since Perhan's mother died in childbirth, his grandmother raised him, and Merdzan feels jealous for her attention and love.As a work of magical realism, these supernatural powers are viewed as mundane, as a part of life. No one takes notice when Perhan idly moves a tin can with his mind&#x97;in fact, they tell him to stop using his powers frivolously and get a real job. The film is set in a dirt-poor Gypsy village in the former Yugoslavia. When his destitute and degenerate uncle Merdzan tears the roof off the family house in frustration over their poverty, his grandmother begs Perhan to find work and provide a steady income. A major theme is the corrupting power of money. It is clearly, in Kusturica's eyes, the root of all evil.

Later on, he even rescues a kitten from a raging river to add to his sympathy. When he finally dies at the end of the film, he is unredeemed, but not disgraced.

Kubrick's focus in this film appears to be the soldiers themselves, as they're transformed from your average all-American youth into cold-blooded killers gunning for the enemy. The film is divided into two portions. The first introduces us to a group of fresh recruits who are assigned to a volatile drill sergeant determined to turn these maggots into the hardest of Marines. The bulk of his ire falls on a hapless recruit he dubs Gomer Pyle, who's mind is slowly warped by his hostile training environment until it reaches it's limit. The second half of the film follows another of the recruits, Joker, who has become a reporter for Stars & Stripes embedded in Vietnam. Joker is assigned to follow the Lusthog Squad to Phu Bai and experiences his first real encounter under fire when the squad is pinned down by a sniper.The first half of this film is fantastic and I became so enthralled with the story of these boot camp recruits that I was shaken when the story suddenly shifted to Vietnam for the final half. The first time I'd seen the film, I was confused. I honestly thought the movie was ending with the conclusion of the Parris Island segment. Instead, the audience is whisked halfway around the world for further exploration into the dehumanization of the soldiers when Joker and his photographer Rafterman are sent into the field where they encounter their first major combat experiences. From the start, Joker's retained his sarcastic cynicism throughout the trials of boot camp until his arrival in Vietnam, but we watch as that naivety is ripped away when he sees the violent horrors of his fellow soldiers are gunned down and he comes face to face with a Vietnamese sniper. Kubrick's movie is about, from what I can gather, the dehumanization required for war and slaps us in the face with the effects it has on a man. It's a powerful film and a glimpse into what soldiers experience in their time serving their nation.Some of the dialogue doesn't quite sit well (the one instance that stands out in my mind is the banter between Joker and Animal Mother in their first meeting) but a great deal of it is saved by the actors. There is some great talent here on display early in their careers including Matthew Modine (Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother), Arliss Howard (Cowboy), and a great performance by Vincent D'Onofrio in his first major role as Gomer Pyle. Strangely enough, the best performance in the entire film isn't even from an actor. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor, Hartman, is the most memorable character in the film. He brings his real military experience to the character and explodes in every scene. His obscene motivation has become so embedded in public consciousness that it has been spoofed and referenced everywhere. Ermey and FULL METAL JACKET single-handedly turned me off of ever considering military service as a career, and it's a great film to bring the viewer into the world of a a grunt.

After several decades out of the movie business, he starred in several films that were surprising successes. He did stand-up comedy in Las Vegas. He appeared on talk shows and told silly jokes about smoking cigars, outliving his doctors, and hanging out with women one-fourth his age. He was an octogenarian movie star, and Oh, God! was released around the peak of his latter-day fame.The film begins with God (in the form of George Burns) appearing in supermarket manager Jerry's (John Denver) bathroom. God tells Jerry to get The Word out, so Jerry tells his story to a reporter (George Furth). This of course attracts the attention of several wackos and many theologians (including Jeff Corey, Paul Sorvino, and Donald Pleasance), much to the dismay of Jerry's wife (Teri Garr). There's an amusing courtroom sequence, and Jerry and God say goodbye and part ways. The movie is lightly entertaining with a warm message and has lots of good scenes, but trust me, it has no real laughs. Burns is his usual self, and Denver is surprisingly good in an uncharacteristic acting role. Garr and especially Sorvino (playing an outrageous TV evangelist) stand out in the supporting cast. Two inferior sequels with Burns but without Denver were later released.A lot of the shine has worn off Oh, God! since 1977. Burns and Denver are no longer with us, and George Burns' 1970s fame has been gone for 30 years. Many people probably know very little about either Burns or Denver, their memories fading every day. During the mid-1970s, Burns was an unlikely celebrity, with all the trappings that accompanied it (I used to cringe when Johnny Carson would imply that Burns was actually dating women in their early 20s). The novelty of seeing singer-songwriter John Denver in a movie is long gone. So, the general cultural atmosphere surrounding George Burns and this film has changed completely in the past 34 years. Oh, God! is still good, but to me the movie used to be a lot better, way back in 1977.

Jake, a sleepwalker, is visited by the bizarre vision of a man in a bunny suit. The 'bunny' advises him that the world will end soon. I was expecting the 'bunny' to be a comic figure, but it is actually genuinely frightening.The great thing about 'Donnie Darko' is that everyone has their own take on the film, and an attendant explanation for the strange goings-on of the narrative. This is a challenging and unusual film which requires a high level of concentration. Who knew that Jake Gyllenhaal and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie's sister, Elizabeth, would go on to become A list stars? As another reviewer observed, you will either love or hate 'Donnie Darko'. It does not give up its secrets easily, and requires work on the part of the viewer. The soundtrack is wonderful, featuring such artists as The Church ('Under the Milky Way'), Echo and the Bunnymen (appropriate!) ('The Killing Moon'), Joy Division ('Love Will Tear Us Apart'), and Gary Jules ('Mad World', originally a hit for British popsters Tears For Fears). The film is set in 1988 and features great period detail.Personally, I much prefer the theatrical version to the Director's Cut. Ironically, the Director's Cut was meant to explain things that were not clear in the theatrical version. I found it even more confusing! 'Donnie Darko' embraces a strange and troubled character. The hero of the film is not some Hollywood cliché, but a possibly delusional young man who is witty and immediately likable. A great performance from Jake, as usual. If you are looking for something superficial and easy to follow, then you have come to the wrong place! But if you are willing to concentrate and take a strange, unpredictable journey, you will definitely be rewarded.
