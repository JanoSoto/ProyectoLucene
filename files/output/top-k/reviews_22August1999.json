I look forward to seeing the re-make, but I know it won't be as good as the original. The directing was slick and the characterisations were brilliant, even though you need only to analyse McQueen and Dunaway. The only thing that marrs the film is the split screen direction at the beginning which probably was state of the art at the time, but appears passe now. As you watch the film you notice that the scenes with Dunaway and the detective are fast-paced and strained, whereas McQueen's scenes are drugged and relaxed, a bossa-nova backing tune never far away. The infamous chess scene is a tongue-in-cheek masterpiece that could never be equalled although the fact that recent films love to parody this suggests that it is rather dated. Although Crown is essentially an immoral character, you have to like him - you want to be him. There are certain similarities with The Great Gatsby in that Crown has so much cash that he is after absolute perfection. Unfortunately he can't get it, but unlike The Great Gatsby, this is by no means a tragic film, much more of a romantic thriller with a twist.

Sister Georgia has built herself a career as a successful country music singer and has a stable marriage and family life. Sadie sings too, sort of; she's not that good and performs with semi-pro bands in mostly empty nightclubs. The two women have a complex and fragile relationship. Sadie seems to love her sister and admire her talent, but just below the surface lurk envy and resentment. Georgia for her part is always polite but somewhat on edge when Sadie is around, as if she's afraid her sister might lose control of herself and do something stupid or embarrassing. That fear is not unfounded, for Sadie is, as one critic described her, an emotional black hole, the kind of person who sucks in all the concern and attention in a family.

Sadie seems to love her sister and admire her talent, but just below the surface lurk envy and resentment. Georgia for her part is always polite but somewhat on edge when Sadie is around, as if she's afraid her sister might lose control of herself and do something stupid or embarrassing.

Night Shyamalan   106 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)By Blake FrenchThe Sixth Sense is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but The Sixth Sense does it so perfectly and convincingly  that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not.The Sixth Sense tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like You lied, You did not help me and especially mysteriously Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do. He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.The film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient. After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, I see dead people, the young boy whispers, they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead, he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.The story setup to The Sixth Sense is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle. The film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the sixth sense seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like  come on, get to the point.For the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than Entrapment. More jaw-dropping than Wild Things. More compelling than Goodbye Lover. And  more awe inspiring than Arlington Road. It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted  to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material.

I could go on ...If you're wondering what my comments have to do with each other - well, I wonder the same about the different parts of the film.  Actually, MOST of the scenes play well, and most of the film is enjoyable to watch, but to there is no cumulative effect.  If I must pass a verdict on the film as a whole it must be, misfire.  So it's back to Beauty and the Beast - or forward to Atlantis.

The passionate enthusiasm of the characters, the gorgeous costumes and masterful script swept me along until the close of the film. I do not know where to begin when discussing this delightful film. I adored the little in jokes, such as the wording Stratford-Upon-Avon on Shakespeare's mug, or the man on the street discussing a rose, and how by any other name it would bear the same sweet fragrance. There was the classic balcony scene, swordplay, and passionate romance. Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes made a wonderfully charming couple, although I will admit that the film could have cut down on the nudity just a bit. But other than that, it was a flawless piece. Geoffrey Rush, dastardly evil in Les Miserables, was simply hilarious as a theatre owner in financial straits. I loved his quirky facials and mock terror. Finally, Dame Judi Dench's performance as Queen Elizabeth was so subtle that it nearly caught one offguard. Yet it too was quick, witty and quite worthy of the Oscar it won her.The film's script was a masterpiece in itself, weaving the beatiful wordplay of Shakespeare with some of the brilliance of today. There were plenty of plot twists and unexpected circumstances to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. And I believe that the ending of the film was simply perfect. I recently appeared in a production of What You Will, and it was refreshing to see a familiar moment on screen. Clearly, Shakespeare in Love earned its Oscar for Best Picture. I sincerely hope that it will remain a favorite for years to come.

It really made me apreciate these over paid actors. atleast if they had got them they could have done a better job of not trying to act. Can't remember what friend told me it was good but if I could Id make him give me my money back. The movie concept was unique, but lacked in delivery and so much more. The filming was terrible. and I really thought the end sucked. all in all I gave it a 1.125 out of 10 mainly because they was a cute chick sitting in front of me. maybe I just think it sucked so bad because I was starring at the back of this checks head most of it?

I have just bought Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide 2000,and am horrified by the fact that he gives it only two stars! I usually agree with him, but in films relating to classical music, he is usually WAY off-base----witness his 2 and 1\/2 stars for Amadeus, 2 stars for the 1984 Carmen, and 3 and 1\/2 for the film of Verdi's Otello! The Red Violin is the poetic story of a legendary violin, the greatest musical instrument ever made, designed under mysterious circumstances during the Renaissance in Italy. (The circumstances are revealed fully ONLY near the end of the movie, so if you do not wish to know the solution to the mystery, be careful which review you read.) The framing story of the film is the present day auction in Montreal at which the violin is scheduled to be sold. We are gradually taken, in flashbacks, through the story of the violin and all of its owners, in four different countries and five different languages----Italian, German, English, Chinese,and French.(yes, there are subtitles, but this film is so good that who cares?) The storytelling is absolutely mesmerizing--each twenty minute episode is seamlessly interlocked with the auction and linked by beautiful shots of the sea rolling. The acting is excellent, especially in the German episode featuring little Christoph Koncz as a hard-driven child prodigy and Jean-Luc Bideau as his well-meaning but misguided stepfather and tutor.Greta Scacchi and Jason Flemyng, in the nineteenth-century British episode, are like lovers out of a Harlequin novel, but I have a feeling that this episode MUST have been done tongue-in-cheek; it is just too over-the-top compared with the dignity shown in every other episode. Samuel L. Jackson, in the framing segment, demonstrates incredible subtlety as an actor---watch his eyes as he listens for the first time to the red violin as it is played. The costumes, sets,and photography are ravishing--and most significant of all, there is John Corgliano's music--perhaps the finest musical score written for a film in more than twenty-five years, and no,I'm not forgetting John Williams' score for Schindler's List, though THAT one comes the closest, and violinist Joshua Bell does the Red Violin score full justice.Don't even think of passing this one up.
