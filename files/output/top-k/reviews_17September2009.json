The film is about two bikers (Peter Fonda) and (Jack Nicholson) who are traveling across the country trying to find America. The film starts off with the two men scoring dope in Mexico and selling to a rich man in Los Angeles for a lot of cash. They then buy some California Choppers and set across the country to New Orleans in search of freedom. In the scene where they get the bikes Peter Fonda looks at his watch and throws it to the ground representing freedom of time. They then drive across the desert and the song Born to Be Wild kicks in. They go to a vacant motel and ask for a room when the man sees them he turns on the No Vacancy which leads to them sleeping outside around a campfire smoking pot and talking about interesting things, this first scene portrays in all of the other scenes how they lodge. These scenes to me are the best scenes in the movie because it shows that the narrow minded people at that time were scared of the new lifestyle of these people thus people thinking they are outlaws or bad people while in turn they are. Peter Fonda is the cool, mellow, laid back guy who is looking for what America really is, but in this he really isn't part of any group of people he is the outsider, the observer. Who never really is accepted but instead is trying to find himself. Dennis Hopper is the sidekick, the fool, who is a more paranoid fast paced man, who looks more at life as living it to the fullest. The two drive through the west and then meet a hitchhiker where they then spend the night at an Indian burial ground and smoke a lot of pot. To me this scene is the best campfire scene, of how the wind is blowing and they are talking, it seems so serious and meaningful and yet goofy and fun. The hitchhiker takes them to a commune where hippies are living together trying to grow food for themselves and live off the land. Billy (Dennis Hopper) is getting impatient of the commune and wants to hit the road to Mardi Gras. While Wyatt ( Peter Fonda) thinks life on the commune is good and that is how people should live, but goes along with Billy. Before they leave the hitchhiker gives Fonda acid and tells him to use this at the right place with the right people. Fonda takes it and off they go, they then get to a small town and drive in the parade. The sheriff arrests them saying they didn't have a permit for parading thus them ending up in the jail. They meet George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) in there cell a drunken lawyer who ends up in jail a lot of the time. They tell Goerge they are going to Mardi Gras and he is interested in going but says he cant. Fonda tells him he should and they give him a helmet and he goes with them. Nicholson is the lovable, drunken, American, opposite of Billy and Wyatt but is curious and accepts them unlike his counterparts. They travel on the road and then the scene changes and it is another campfire scene, this scene quite possibly being one of the most denying moments in the counterculture of the 60's showing about the old ways to the new. Nicholson drinks his whiskey Fonda tells him to do this instead. Nicholson thinking it a hand rolled cigarette is actually a marijuana joint. Nicholson is hesitant but is reluctant and takes the joint. This scene is probably the most defining moment about drugs and such. They then hit Louisana where they go into a dinner, the locals have never seen anyone like them, and are making insulting jokes about them. They don't get there food and Nicholson decides to leave they leave and go on. At the campfire scene after that Nicholson talks about freedom where people who live it are feared and people that don't live but say they have it are dangerous this is an important scene since it shows people who are free and people who think they have freedom while really they are not free at all. At night while they are sleeping the hicks from the dinner come and kill Nicholson with a machete and hurting the other two. The hicks were smart not to kill Billy and Wyatt so they could frame it on them and make them look like criminals. They then go to New Orleans where Wyatt is uncertain about things and seems lost and unhappy about what America was. They hit Mardi Gras and go to a whorehouse where they and two women go into the streets and then go to a cemetery resulting in the acid scene. Then cutting off with both of them hitting the road and probably going to Florida. At the last campfire scene Wyatt his sad and says to Billy they blew it the last words in the film. They then drive the next day and see two hicks where one of them jokingly puts a gun to Billy, Billy flicks him off and he gets mad and shoots Billy. Wyatt goes back to him and is going to get help, yet the truck turns around and he is shot and dies. The ending shot goes from them on the ground to the air. The music in this film was great, and the life of the hippies, and shows Americans darker side to a real context. When I first saw this film it changed my ways of thinking and living. i think this film was one of the most important films in America.

Schaffner Starring Laurence Olivier, Gregory Peck, James Mason, Walter Gotell et al.The first thing which attracted me to this film were leading actors Laurence Olivier, Gregory Peck and James Mason, all three not being in their younger years anymore. It's always nice to see aging actors acting alongside each other, because they can sometimes be quite surprising. Before moving on to their acting though, I will describe the plot of the film.The story starts in Paraguay, late seventies, where Barry Kohler (Steve Guttenberg) discovers that several high ranking Nazi party members are having a meeting about something which seems important. He learns that Dr. Josef Mengele (Peck) himself will be leading the meeting and that they're talking about killing 94 men around the globe. He therefore contacts legendary Nazi hunter Ezra Liebermann (Olivier) to tell him about it, but he doesn't seem interested and is too busy with other things. Only when Barry is killed while he's talking to Mr. Liebermann on the phone, does Mr. Liebermann understand there's something really sinister and important going on. He starts an investigation which brings him all around the globe in search for clues. As he comes closer to the truth the Nazi's become more cautious, except for Dr. Mengele, who won't allow Liebermann to kill off his master-plan. Eventually he must take matters in his own hands when Eduard Seibert (Mason), an old friend of Mengele, tells him that the Nazi party won't support him anymore. By this time Ezra Liebermann has discovered the sinister plan of Dr. Mengele, which will bring glory to the Arian race once more when the time is right. Liebermann must race to prevent Mengele from executing his plan and they finally meet at the house of the next potential murder victim. This final confrontation must stop Mengele in his tracks, but it becomes quite brutal, as the two old men struggle for victory.The story begins really interesting and mysterious, but when you learn the goal of this sinister plan, it becomes somewhat laughable. It just doesn't make any sense. Luckily there are enough good qualities to the film to make up for the silly plot. First off, there's some good to really good acting, so there are indeed a few surprises by the older cast members. Gregory Peck is great to watch as Dr. Mengele, his only truly unsympathetic role. He plays Mengele a bit over the top, but it all works, especially since Peck is consistent in his performance and he makes it fun to watch, without losing a credible side to Mengele's evilness. The best scene he has is when he sees Mundt (played by Walter Gotell, known mostly for his roles in the James Bond franchise) on a Nazi party, while he should be killing his targets. He throws him on the ground and starts strangling him in front of the crowd. When the two are separated, he proclaims He betrayed me, he betrayed you, he betrayed the Arian Race!!. It's a great and fun scene to watch. The scene following this one is great too. We see Mengele learning from Seibert that Mundt was back because the operation got canceled. This conversation is really well done and has a great feel to it. James Mason, who plays Seibert, is nice to watch alongside Gregory Peck. It may not be a standout performance, but it is a good one, making Seibert feel like a real character. The best acting comes from the legendary Laurence Olivier. He plays it more subtle than Peck does and he's utterly believable as the frail old Nazi hunter who won't give up. He's at his best when he gets agitated (look for the scene between Ezra and Frieda Maloney), but his acting when he learns about Mengele's plot is some of his best too. Sadly though, I found the acting of Steve Guttenberg and Jeremy Black to be lacking. Guttenberg was unconvincing in my eyes and Jeremy Black was annoying and not really convincing too. These important characters are therefore not really believable, which does hurt the film a bit. The rest of the cast was adequate though, nothing bad, but nothing really special too. The direction by Franklin J. Schaffner is good; he keeps a nice pace and he builds the tension well. The action scenes are handled quite believable and some of them are quite brutal. I am referring to the final confrontation between Liebermann and Mengele, where a number of dogs brutally attack them. There are some beautiful scenery shots as well, the best one being a dam in Sweden, surrounded by snow covered mountains. The shots of Mengele's villa, which is located at a lake, surrounded by jungle, were done well too. The fore-mentioned dam scene is a good one from an emotional point of view too. It features Mundt meeting an old school friend on top off the dam and it seems they're just being friendly, but then suddenly Mundt attacks him and throws him over the top, revealing that the person actually was a murder target.To help set the atmosphere of the film, Franklin Schaffner is helped (once again) by the great Jerry Goldsmith. His main theme, based upon an Austrian waltz is lovely, but especially the Nazi theme and the action music are really good. His music helps set the mood of the film really well, although the previous collaborations between the two were more memorable.All in all this is a really nice thriller, which has a strong build up and nice action, but features a silly plot. It's saved though by good acting from the lead actors and a noteworthy finale to look forward to. Watch this if you want to be entertained and thrilled and if you like to be surprised by older actors.My vote is 7\/10.

His main theme, based upon an Austrian waltz is lovely, but especially the Nazi theme and the action music are really good. His music helps set the mood of the film really well, although the previous collaborations between the two were more memorable.All in all this is a really nice thriller, which has a strong build up and nice action, but features a silly plot. It's saved though by good acting from the lead actors and a noteworthy finale to look forward to. Watch this if you want to be entertained and thrilled and if you like to be surprised by older actors.My vote is 7\/10.

The movie has mystery and a decent storyline that sustains it to the end. There are a few plot inconsistencies, but easy to look past them.
