But those who loves fantastic, for nothing logical adventures, or some bizarre and entertainingly story this is THE movie. Forbidden Zone is the story of a place called the Sixth Dimension, which is reign by the King Fausto and the Queen Doris. There is a door who let you enter to this rare world, which locates it in the new house of the Hercules family. There is the beautiful Frenchy Hercules, a girl with a lot of curiosity. She decides to enter, and she don't knows the crazy adventure she going to pass.Forbidden Zone is a wild and original movie, irreverent and totally rough, but is, of course, totally beautiful and artistic. This movie is like a story for midnight,it is a funny one, comic and very easy to digest, as is must to be mention that is a feast for eyes and ears. The music here is really awesome, just for called some as One of these Days, Pico and Sepulveda, Witch's Egg, Queen Revenge and that big Finale (Writting for that great musician named as Danny Elfman). The scenario is like is a kind of mix of that old 50s and 60s Sci Fi movies (Noted this with the Black and White tone) with a comic book. Forbidden Zone got it all!

He pretty much discarded that sort of innocence here, without leaving behind his appreciation of the commercial value of a story.It's impossible not to be deeply moved. The extermination program of the Nazis was the most horrific offense to human morality of the 20th century, and one of the worst in history. It wasn't the worst of the slaughters. The two world wars qualified for those honors. It wasn't even the worst example of ethnic cleansing, as it's come to be called. But more than six million Jews and more than seven million other undesirables -- homosexuals, the mentally ill, gypsies, political dissidents -- perished in the camps and not a single Jewish family in Europe went untouched. And it wasn't a war in which the victims were fighting back. It was a deliberate and very thorough act of genocide on the part of a people that Madame de Stael once described as a nation of poets and dreamers.It's a kind of cross-over movie in which the protagonist is not Jewish but rather a Christian who comes to their rescue. A basically decent man comes to his senses. This is the formula, whether the despised and abused minority are Jews or African-Americans. If it were otherwise, there would be a danger of this being seen somehow as a Jewish movie by the unenlightened masses and, as a consequence, might suffer at the box office. Better In the Heat of the Night than Superfly. But Spielberg has avoided most of the clichés associated with films of the final solution. No voice overs telling us of the suffering. No stock footage of bull dozers plowing corpses into mass graves. For the most part, the story stays at the personal level. (We hear hardly anything of the progress of the war.) And it's at this level that the film excels, due to the mature script and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Feinnes. There are many other characters, including Embeth Davidtz.The film is good because Neason's character begins not as a racist or a humanitarian but as a moral nihilist. He cares about nothing but money and the sensory pleasures it affords. He couldn't care less about the Jews, or about the Nazis either for that matter. The war to him is just a way of making a profit using cheap labor. And the script rises above the formulaic in not giving him a moment of epiphany. At no point does his brow furrow, his eyes light up, and he thinks to himself, My God, what am I doing? Nope. Instead, his development is informed by minor but important insights distributed here and there. After the surrender, he leaves the camp as a fugitive, dressed in prison clothes, mourning his carelessness in not saving more lives.Spielberg tells the story in a straightforward way but of course some incidents and dialog from events of fifty years ago must be fabricated. And the fabrications are well done. Especially enjoyable is the touchy, sometimes abrasive, and often humorous relationship between Neason, the salesman and con man who simply has no head for business, and Ben Kingsley as the matter-of-fact accountant who does. I'd give examples of some exchanges but there isn't space.Spielberg hasn't quite gotten over his taste for easy sentimentality. There are only two touches of color in this black-and-white movie. A little girl in a rose-colored coat appears two or three times, so that we can know who it is when her body is wheeled past in a barrow, just another victim. And when the workers hold a ceremony on Shabat, the candle flames are touched with a warm orange that signifies life. Effective, yes, but unnecessary in an adult film like this. Most people watching the film may be trusted to know what's going on without being nudged. But that's small stuff. Somewhat more embarrassing is a scene in which a German officer screams like a maniac and makes gargoyle faces at the camera after emptying his pistol into a mountain of burning bodies. Are we supposed to learn from this that the people running the camps were evil? The Nazi's extermination program prompted many studies in social science, none of which has contributed much to our understanding of why this, and similar programs, seem to be so common around the world. It's easy enough to blame Germany and the SS, but what happened in Kosovo, Maylasia, Cambodia, and Rwanda? Perhaps one of the reasons we've never really understood it is that we don't want to.

We all have massive cerebral cortices, much of the functions of which seem devoted to damping down impulses from structures lower down on the brain that generate desires to mate, to flee from danger, and to kill things and people that get in our way.

Although the second and third episodes in the trilogy are set in the sort of post-apocalyptic world familiar from films like The Omega Man and Battle for the Planet of the Apes, there is no suggestion in the first episode that any nuclear holocaust has taken place. Civilisation seems to be in decline- all the buildings we see look run-down and dilapidated- but the institutions of civil society are still in place; there is, for example, still a functioning police force. The main threat to law and order in this society comes from violent motorbike gangs who roam the highways, raping, looting and killing, and the police's main task is to combat these gangs. The title character, Max Rockatansky, is a member of the police's anti-biker patrol. At first, he hardly seems to live up to his nickname. He seems a quiet, dutiful individual, deeply in love with his attractive young wife Jessie, but is disillusioned with life in the police, especially after his friend and colleague Jim Goose is killed in a fight with the bikers. He quits his job to spend more time with his Jessie and their baby son, but when his wife and child are murdered by a particularly vicious gang he returns, swearing revenge.Unless you've seen Summer City- I haven't and doubt if many other people have- this was the film which first made a star of Mel Gibson, although there is not much here to suggest that he would go on to become a major Hollywood name. This isn't, however, really an actor's film. Or, for that matter, a scriptwriter's film. The murder of Jessie and her son takes place very late in the film, which means that the whole revenge plot has to be squeezed into the final quarter of an hour. Apart from those fifteen minutes there isn't much plot at all; all the cast are required to do is go through the motions of acting out a story.Unlike episodes two and three of the trilogy, which were shot in the barren outback of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, Mad Max takes place in Victoria, mainland Australia's most fertile state, mostly in the rural areas around Melbourne. With its seemingly endless long, straight roads and flat, featureless terrain, this seems ideal country for a road movie. What plot there is serves as an excuse for showing as many car chases and car crashes, or motorbike chases and motorbike crashes, as possible, all lovingly photographed by director George Miller. The real stars of the film are not the actors but the stuntmen who make these scenes possible.For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like (as Maggie Smith remarked in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie). Personally, I have never cared much for the film, but then I am the sort of reactionary Philistine who finds acting, plot, dialogue and characterisation to be more important elements in a film than the quality of its car crashes.

Civilisation seems to be in decline- all the buildings we see look run-down and dilapidated- but the institutions of civil society are still in place; there is, for example, still a functioning police force. The main threat to law and order in this society comes from violent motorbike gangs who roam the highways, raping, looting and killing, and the police's main task is to combat these gangs. The title character, Max Rockatansky, is a member of the police's anti-biker patrol. At first, he hardly seems to live up to his nickname. He seems a quiet, dutiful individual, deeply in love with his attractive young wife Jessie, but is disillusioned with life in the police, especially after his friend and colleague Jim Goose is killed in a fight with the bikers. He quits his job to spend more time with his Jessie and their baby son, but when his wife and child are murdered by a particularly vicious gang he returns, swearing revenge.Unless you've seen Summer City- I haven't and doubt if many other people have- this was the film which first made a star of Mel Gibson, although there is not much here to suggest that he would go on to become a major Hollywood name. This isn't, however, really an actor's film. Or, for that matter, a scriptwriter's film. The murder of Jessie and her son takes place very late in the film, which means that the whole revenge plot has to be squeezed into the final quarter of an hour. Apart from those fifteen minutes there isn't much plot at all; all the cast are required to do is go through the motions of acting out a story.Unlike episodes two and three of the trilogy, which were shot in the barren outback of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, Mad Max takes place in Victoria, mainland Australia's most fertile state, mostly in the rural areas around Melbourne. With its seemingly endless long, straight roads and flat, featureless terrain, this seems ideal country for a road movie. What plot there is serves as an excuse for showing as many car chases and car crashes, or motorbike chases and motorbike crashes, as possible, all lovingly photographed by director George Miller. The real stars of the film are not the actors but the stuntmen who make these scenes possible.For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like (as Maggie Smith remarked in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie). Personally, I have never cared much for the film, but then I am the sort of reactionary Philistine who finds acting, plot, dialogue and characterisation to be more important elements in a film than the quality of its car crashes. (I have to admit that the action sequences are well done, particularly in the light of the film's very small budget). I can, however, see why Mad Max has become something of a cult movie, particularly among the motorbike and fast car fraternities. It is (apart from Mad Max 2) probably the ultimate petrolhead movie. 4\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"23 October 2007","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" *SPOILERS!* I came here to read the reviews for The Howling before I decided to record it on AMC (to watch later, since it was on rather early). Let me tell you, this movie was DREADFUL. For starters, I'd heard great things about the story, plot, and special effects. Not so! I watched it with my Dad, and one of the first things he said was What, was this movie from the 70's?. It only went downhill from there. There was a scene where the edges and wrinkles of the rubber glove was clearly visible when one of the werewolves reached through a broken wooded panel to reach the woman. There was a campfire sex scene - the initial transformations were all right, but then the camera moves back to about 20 feet away, and it is the fakest, WORST computer effects I've EVER seen! The f\/x are all right by the time the woman and the remaining officer are in the jeep, trying to escape (the jeep won't start, of course), but still really nothing to write home about.On to the plot and the actual story. I'd read all about how it was so 'original' - wrong again! It begins with a blonde reporter who gets attacked by a psycho while covering a story. She talks to the police, then goes out for a rest at a getaway set up by a reasonably charming psychiatrist - needless to say, pretty much the whole town there is inhabited by werewolves. Now, let me tell you - the movie ran for two hours, but I wish I'd just started watching about 45 minutes in, because everything before that is stupefyingly boring. It can be summed up by Wah, wah, bimbo's scared, gets comforted by boyfriend, lets go for a vacation. They wander around once they get there, and if you're looking for an even remotely spooky set in the wilderness, think again.The action starts pretty much when the boyfriend gets bitten (while he's wandering around in the woods at night by himself, unarmed *eyeroll*). It lasts for all of 20 seconds, and he then stumbles back to their cabin. It's now too painful to recall this horribly boring movie, but let me tell you this there's a cabin that's supposed to be scary, but the hides hanging on the wall just makes it look like a hunter lives there, though the wind chimes made of bones were a little unsettling. Also, even though they're bone, they still jingle as though they were metal chimes. Yea. Oh, while we're on the subject of out-of-place noises, when the werewolves howl, there's also a yowling cat howl in there too. Who knows.Seriously, this movie is not even remotely scary, nor gory, if that's what you're looking for. The goriest thing I recall is when one of the women cuts off the arm of one of the werewolves with an axe, and that *may* inspire a nose-wrinkle of distaste, at best. (And no, I've never seen Saw or Hostel or any of those strictly gore\/torture movies, so I'm not speaking from a severely desensitized POV). We gave up on trying to take this movie seriously about a half-hour in, and did what we do best when confronted by a movie this bad - we have our own little Mystery Science Theatre 3000 with it.Anyhow, let me just warn you once more - this movie is REALLY bad! Honestly, I gave it three stars because I enjoyed immensely the scene, props, and acting in the bookstore scene, and for the abrupt improvement of the f\/x in the 'trapped in the jeep scene'. I don't know why there's such a lack of werewolf movies, but if you need a fix, let me recommend American Werewolf in Paris (or London), or Underworld.

Despite claiming to be the film expert that I am, I had little knowledge of what the film is actually about.Sonny and Sal (that's Pacino and John Cazale) and some other guy enter a bank in Brooklyn with the intention of robbing it. But they simply couldn't be less prepared. One second into the robbery the third robber chickens out and runs away, leaving Sonny and Sal to do it on their own. The staff are jaded and cynical but politely put up with their bumbling and are only too happy to see the back of them. But the police surround the building at the last minute and a hostage situation suddenly arouses.With nowhere to go Sonny can only make the usual demands but the media circus outside makes him a nationwide star and the crowds outside cheer for him whenever he makes an appearance at the doors. I guess that in the 70's (a decade I never witnessed) public morale was so low that a failed bank robber could actually be a kind of hero for even attempting to stick it to the man.Based on a true story, the dialogue is mostly improvised, giving it a raw, realistic feel. Despite this, the script still won an Academy Award. A young Al Pacino seems to disappear and you end up seeing him only as Sonny. Why he never won the Oscar for Best Actor that year is beyond me. But I guess they thought that Jack Nicholson as McMurphy was more iconic\/important\/worthy or whatever. In fact, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest took almost all the Oscar's DDA was nominated for. Having never seen that film, I can't really judge if it deserved them. It was also competing with Jaws for Best Picture that year. Man, 1975 sure was a good year for movies. Something that simply cannot be said for any year in the past decade.One my favorite actors (Lance Henriksen, the man with the coolest voice in the world) has a small role as one of the FBI Agents. I never spotted him for a while (he's still quite young in this) and he has very little dialogue, but it still a pivotal role.It's hard to define the genre that DDA fits into. On the one hand it's a hard-hitting real-life drama but on the other it's a satirical black comedy that's not without several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. Not a film for action junkies, I assume this is more for film buffs of students more than anyone else, but it's certainly an important film and it marks one of the many turning points in Pacino's never-ending career.

If you want to watch a feel good or funny movie, check out Clerks or the 40 year old Virgin. I guess that i am just warning you not to see such an overdone flick that really is not worth your time. On the OTHERHAND, if you liked this movie after watching it, good for you; frankly i did not see anything worth ranting about which explains my dread for this flick. Just about the only excuse to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the following Jason London, Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Joey Lauren Adams, and Ben Affleck. I tried to like it since i am a fan of Joey Loren Adams. This is one of those early films for a lot of these rising stars. I don't know what funny or interesting is according to this film. These are some of the events and themes featured that are supposed to be interesting Stoners that emit a sense of pride as if they were some kind of elite. Fraternity style initiations with paddles, ketchup, and crappy mean acting (the initiations are not even believable; i mean who the hell runs around with a colored kiddie looking paddle?!). High school queer looking freshmen trying to be mature by talking about the babes of the campus. A football player struggling in terms of submitting to his coach or not (come on as if any hard working varsity players would think of quitting the team for pot sessions...). More of the stupid freshmen trying to fit in (character development for the least important....). With all of the little details that the film could do with out, the entire package just gives a sense of i-am-running-out-of-ideas-about-where to-go-with-my-characters kind of feel.

Many of his movies, including this one, are considered some of the greatest films of all time. For me, this is my very first Akira Kurosawa film. I have yet to see Seven Samurai, or Ran, or Yojimbo. But when I sat down to watch Roshomon, I knew right from the starting credits that Kurosawa was going to live up to his reputation. And the film got more powerful, unique, and creative as the running time went on.Roshomon is, like many other foreign film masterpieces, left intact in its original language. All of the cast members speak their native Japanese language and we are only able to interpret their dialogue through the subtitles. But this is the way it should be. Foreign films should be preserved like this, otherwise, they can become unintentionally comical with bad dubbing and bad lip synchronization. Even though most of us can't understand Japanese, it suits the film better and makes it more serious and authentistic.The cast of Roshomon is full of very talented and famous Japanese actors. There is the legendary Toshiro Mifune, who apparently did numerous films with Akira Kurosawa. He was very realistic and chilling as the leading character, a bandit and a womanizer. We also have Takashi Shimura, remembered from Seven Samurai and the popular Japanese monster film Gojira. One of Kurosawa's neat tricks with the screenplay was to limit the number of characters whose names were revealed in the story. Many of them are credited simply by their apparent occupation. Examples are The Priest and The Woodcutter. It reminds me very much of the classic American film 12 Angry Men, in which many principal characters never had a name revealed. Yet, let me remind everybody that Roshomon was seven years before 12 Angry Men. I don't know if Kurosawa inspired this trait for the film or the play upon which it was based, but whatever the case, it was a brilliant idea.Kurosawa had a natural talent for creating innovating and suspenseful sequences and when needed, exploding with high-tension action and then having long moments of symbolism and silence in between. That's how I would describe the basic flow, you could say, of this film. Suspense, action, and then the aftereffects which often result in long moments of silence and consequences that try the morals of our characters. In this film, one does not just sin in any kind of way and then just go off and deal with their affairs without thinking about what they have done and whether it could have been avoided or done a different way. And I appreciate films that utilize this trait of creating an allegorical message for a frailty that human beings tend to have.Roshomon is one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema history. Even know, almost sixty years since it was created, it still holds out as a powerful and popular film. It has already got me, as a cinema goer, instantly interested in seeing more Akira Kurosawa movies, for this example of his brilliant work has already proved to me at least that his talents were even better than his reputation.

It's so unusual to see an American film about ordinary working-class people. Without portraying them as losers. In Hollywood movies the main characters are always rich even if they're supposed to represent standard middle-class people. They always live in either huge villas or very expensive apartments in trendy areas. Another horror film I like is Session 9. It's also about working-class people and the characters are not portrayed as losers in that one either, just because they're not rich. Only realistically portrayed as ordinary, everyday people. I find this a big problem in American cinema that they almost never portray real people. People that are not extremely successful career wise nor have a huge bank account. If people in American movies are not very wealthy they're portrayed as either miserable losers or as just plain bums. Like there's no people in between living in America. What else is really refreshing about Stir Of Echoes is to see other kinds of urban American environments, that is not featuring bums, gangsters, drug addicts nor upper-class architects, Manhattan people. Fantastically realistic production design and photography. It's also unusual to see such realistically portrayed everyday people. Fantastic down to earth performances by all the actors. It's very rare to see such fine performances by actors in horror movies. I think that's another reason I'm also so found of Session 9. The script of Stir Of Echoes is very well written by David Koep. Dialog feels naturalistic and never draws attention to itself. The movie is also featuring some very good camera work and skillfully directed scenes of suspense. The commentary on the DVD by David Koep must be one of the best DVD commentaries out there. Informative and entertaining and gives great insight to how the film was made. Very much in the same class as of DVD commentaries delivered by John Carpenter. The king of commentary directors.I would also like to take the opportunity to recommend David Koeps feature film debut as a director, The Trigger Affect.

It's very rare to see such fine performances by actors in horror movies. I think that's another reason I'm also so found of Session 9. The script of Stir Of Echoes is very well written by David Koep. Dialog feels naturalistic and never draws attention to itself. The movie is also featuring some very good camera work and skillfully directed scenes of suspense. The commentary on the DVD by David Koep must be one of the best DVD commentaries out there. Informative and entertaining and gives great insight to how the film was made. Very much in the same class as of DVD commentaries delivered by John Carpenter. The king of commentary directors.I would also like to take the opportunity to recommend David Koeps feature film debut as a director, The Trigger Affect. Another thriller with very well drawn characters and a careful set up of story elements before the dramatic scenes of suspense sets off.

It deals with a couple of people each with their own specific talent imprisoned in a world of deadly rooms. The many boobytraps hidden in each cube are enough to alarm even the bravest person and they soon begin to lose their patience as well as their hope in getting their lives back.The entire movie is basically one huge mission to make it out of the huge cube alive. The fact that each room has a devious trap in store and the wide diversity of the many characters make up for a very enjoyable movie. Every now and then you are presented with unusual camera shots which adds to the already creepy atmosphere. The movie begins for example with a close-up shot of someone's eye. Near the end you do happen to have the feeling that you've seen everything and any presentation of a new room actually feels more like a stretch than an interesting plot development. Fortunately they don't drag the movie on for too long and the ending has an okay twist.Being a low-budget movie in Canada, one might expect that Cube doesn't have a single famous actor. Not to worry, because all acting is quite good. There are at least two performances that are worth mentioning here. Maurice Dean Wint plays the part of Quentin the cop and he's quite good. The best acting however is by Andrew Miller who plays the role of Kazan the autistic man. Andrew Miller is no Dustin Hoffman so don't expect a Rainman-performance, but his acting is easily the best thing alongside the eerie atmosphere and originality of this beautiful thriller.In short If you want proof that good movies don't always come from millions of dollars - check this one out! It's as good as any low-budget movie could ever be!

This collection of five short horror tales absolutely hits the mark. Many of King's celluloid failures can be attributed to poor direction and casting. With Creepshow, we have a skilled director (Romero) and a wonderfully layered cast of older and up-and-coming actors. The film is intended to look like a comic book in terms of angles and lighting, but it doesn't go over the top like say, Dick Tracy from 1990. The film is genuinely frightening, suspenseful, funny, and gory when it needs to be. The film begins and ends with the story of an abusive father and the revenge taken by his son after the father throws out his comic book containing these five stories. The stories are all somewhat different in tone and structure, but they are all at least somewhat effective.The first story entitled Father's Day is kind of on the goofy side. There really isn't a whole lot to it, and it kind of serves as a warm-up act. The focus of the story is a deceased patriarch rising from his grave and demanding the cake he was denied when he was murdered by his daughter on Father's Day. Look out for a young Ed Harris who gets crushed by an enormous headstone. There are some scares in this one, but it's more silly than anything else.Stephen King is the star of the next story entitled The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill. In it, he plays a hillbilly who comes in contact with a meteorite that lands on his property. After touching it with his bare hands and burning his fingers, he attempts to cool it off with a bucket of water. The results are somewhat funny, and nothing is particularly frightening about this story. King is a hoot, but the way he eventually dies is actually kind of depressing. Poor guy! The third story entitled Something to Tide You Over is one of the best. Leslie Neilson plays a sadistic rich man out to torment his wife and her lover (a young Ted Danson) by burying them up to their necks on the beach while the tide comes in over them. Even though Neilson is playing a dirty SOB, you can see the lighthearted side of him just dying to come out. It's really a pretty neat story, though rather predictable. The ending is decidedly unsettling.The Crate is next, and it's a long one compared to the others. The terrific cast including Hal Holbrook, Fritz Weaver, and Adrienne Barbeau are very good, but this one needed some tightening. The payoffs are quick and gory, but it takes maybe too long to get to the conclusion. This episode has some very tense moments, as well as some very funny ones.Finally, we have They're Creeping Up On You. This one is perhaps my favorite. It has E. G. Marshall playing a Howard Hughes type germophobe living in a supposedly germ-proof penthouse. Trouble is, there seems to be a cockroach scurrying across the floor or counter in every scene. We get a sense for just what a creep this man is by hearing him conduct business over the phone and make various demands of those who work for him. He is a really foul-mouthed chap whose world comes crashing down once the power goes out in his building. The final scene is absolutely disgusting and has to hold some kind of record for most roaches ever on one set. This segment is quick, funny, and very creepy.The work as a whole is worth at least 9 of 10 stars. Don't miss it! The Hound.

She, like many, never wanted to see past the homosexual thing.
