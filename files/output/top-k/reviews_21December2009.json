No more toy models floating across a Chromakey blanket of stars. This is the first TREK to utilize that stunning new invention called - CGI.The Klingon race is dying and Spock (Leonard Nimoy) gives a sermon explaining how Starfleet, their sworn enemies, should help. Starfleet sends Kirk (William Shatner) as ambassador of peace, because only Nixon can go to China. But conspiracy is afoot. Klingon-human peace scares those who would rather retain the status quo, for the convenience of having common enemies. Even some who want peace cannot conceive of it, thereby psychologically abetting those aggressively against it. This is one of the many concepts in TREK VI that raises it as far from the rest of the series as Altair 7 is from Rigel 3.STAR TREK VI is all over its Cold War allegory like logic on Spock. But as a science fiction movie, it is still like English on Pavel Chekov - painfully uncomfortable.The Original Cast (minus Sulu) ends up onboard the old Enterprise NCC-1701-A. Again. And under Kirk's command, meet and greet regal Klingon Ambassador Gorkon (David Warner, Lincoln-esquire in bearing and diplomacy), with his snide, belligerent General Chang (Christopher Plummer, absolutely mokh-tha, as he starts chewing scenery even before opening his mouth).Diplomatic dinner follows, where uncomfortable clashes of culture are spiced with humor, Gorkon opining that Shakespeare is best heard in the original Klingon. He makes a toast to Peace - the undiscovered country (paraphrasing Shakespeare's idea of Death being the undiscovered country, from Hamlet's To be or not to be... speech, Act 3 Scene 1).Mysterious events lead to Kirk and Bones (DeForest Kelley) being framed for Gorkon's death and exiled on a gulag planet, while Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Vulcan Lieutenant Valeris (Kim Cattrall, hotter than a starship's afterburners with her little pointy ears and white bandeau and shaved... sideburns) try to discover Gorkon's real killers onboard the Enterprise.When Kirk and Bones are in prison, Kirk admits he could not conceive of a world without having an enemy to hate. His prejudice was not just against a particular race - it was against a frame of mind! Like the new wave of Klingons here on Earth - Republicans - cannot conceive of a world they themselves say they want, so they fearmonger to retain the Old World modes of thought. Realizing deep down there ARE no real enemies left, only differing frames of mind. For the fear they exhibit towards change at every turn, they are no different than the terrorists whom they fearmonger against.Onboard the Enterprise, the conspiracy is uncovered. Spock performs the most sensual mind-meld this side of the planet of green-skinned women, on Lieutenant Valeris, who moans and whimpers like she's riding a sybian on the Howard Stern Show. It's not sex. But it's the best sex scene STAR TREK has ever had.Valeris and General Chang (quoting Shakespeare at every opportunity) lead the conspiracy against peace (as if proud descendants of Sarah Palin and Dick Cheney), stirring chaos for the simple reason they are terrified that a sea change in society would leave them bereft of purpose.So it is ironic that Kirk later laments to Spock, Is it possible that we have grown so old and inflexible we have outlived our usefulness? Their own prejudices stunted their forward momentum, and therefore their usefulness as leaders Klingons killed Kirk's son (in THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK), so he could never forgive the race; while Spock's respect for Vulcans blinded him to Valeris's treachery.The Enterprise crew save the day in a blaze of hasty action sequence, that seems tacked on to provide a headrush final curtain. Bones gets to work with Spock on a magical torpedo, Scotty gets to be an action hero, Kurtwood Smith gets to be the blind President of the United Federation of Planets, Sulu gets a Zorro entrance as captain of Excelsior, and Kirk performs a dynamic fantasy-man dive to save the President, worthy of ten barrels of German cheese.

Although I haven't seen the original, I highly doubt that a movie made in the early 1930's could have this kind of action and adventure. Apparently it shares a similar plot-line to the Boris Karloff classic, but unlike many remakes, or reboots, this one is entertaining enough in its own right.The film opens in Ancient Egypt, where a priest named Imohtep (Arnold Vosloo) is caught in a love affair with the pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). He and his priests are executed and the priest is cursed. Cut to the 1930's, where an adventurer named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is about to be executed. He is saved by a ditsy Egyptologist named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) because he knows the location of a lost city where rumors of untold treasure await. While there, they of course end up awaking Imohtep, and with him come a few nasty side effects to the curse.The best part about this movie is that it plays manages to chill us and make us laugh. There are some genuinely freaky moments, and there are also some openly funny bits. Not many movies can make that claim. Even better is the general adventurous spirit that the movie is filled with. It's just a grand old adventure! The acting is great. Brendan Fraser is a likable rogue who can fire a gun no problem but, as he puts it, I bet with my life, not my money. His unlikely companion is a klutzy librarian who loves Egypt dearly (her mother was Egyptian), and Rachel Weisz is terrific in her star-making part. Likewise, John Hannah is hilarious as her dim-witted, treasure loving brother, Jonathan. You can almost see the jewels in his eyes every time the word treasure is mentioned. Oded Fehr plays the part of the native who knows all about Imhotep with a mix of adventure sidekick cliché and a serious character; it works. Despite being in only two scenes, Eric Avari steals them as Evie's boss who plays a unique roles in the proceedings. The only cast member who really doesn't work is Kevin J. O'Connor. As the cowardice, traitorous Benny, his character works, but O'Connor's shrill and croaky voice is extremely annoying. Surprisingly, O'Connor has been in nearly every movie with writer\/director Stephen Sommors, so I guess Sommers finds something appealing about him.Stephen Sommers knows just what to do with his material. He clearly did not take offense to critics trashing his previous movie, Deep Rising, a reaction that I found unfair. Luckily, studios didn't either. Sommers brings his knack for action and goofy humor to this movie, and its more effectively used here.Other than O'Connor's annoying performance, The Mummy suffers from a few problems. There are a few continuity issues here and there, and if one takes this movie too seriously, they will realize that the story makes itself up as it goes along. Nevertheless, it's goofy charm will prevent most people from realizing them.Great art, this is not. Nor is it a classic like Indiana Jones. But it's still pretty entertaining.

Programming the mind of one Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), a Korean War soldier captured by an enemy nation of the U.S., is the premise of The Manchurian Candidate, a film wherein the underlying theme is potent, but the story is not.The plot here turns domestic, with Shaw's mother and stepfather playing central roles in the drama. The parental influence negates real potency that the film might otherwise have had. Neither Shaw's mother nor his stepfather has the level of political power that we associate with acts of subversion. Toward the end we see what all of this has been leading up to. But the overall plot is too indirect and circuitous to live up to the power of the underlying premise.Senator Iselin (James Gregory) is too much of a buffoon. His presence weakens the story. Janet Leigh's character is more intriguing. But we never learn much about her. Assorted peripheral characters take hits, but again, they're too unimportant to have any political significance.The script is very talky. Lots of back story and exposition in the dialogue dilutes suspense.By far, the best element of the film is the sequence near the beginning, which shows us the brainwashing of the captured soldiers.

Scenes cleverly alternate between the reality of the Chinese man giving a demonstration of hypnosis, and the delusional POV of the soldiers, listening to a lecture about hydrangeas.Casting is okay, except for Laurence Harvey, whose British accent belies the fact that his character is supposed to be an American, and James Gregory, an actor who does not project well on screen. Overall acting trends melodramatic. The film's overall tone is cold and very impersonal, consistent with the Cold War era.Overall, although it has its good moments, The Manchurian Candidate suffers from a plot that is too domestic.

Most of the time you do not know their names, maybe their job on the submarine. Nevertheless I predict that any viewer can identify any man on board. I recommend watching this film German with subtitles for non-speakers for the military way of speaking is accurate, I assume a foreigner would get this as well, it adds to the authenticity. Clearly the film centers around the submarine which by its technology determines all activities, the action and most important the roles the people find themselves in as soldiers. These roles are their lives as soon as they leave the port. Clearly the submarine comes first, the people second, the machine is their means survival and weapon to kill others as well. As for the Nazi ideology the submarine also serves as a refuge from the nazi-society on land. Another core conflict of the men on board is they need to kill fellow seamen. The film does a good job in making the viewer understand this drama without ever resorting to some style of argumentation, it is all in the pictures. As for the story there is no obvious red line. The submarine follows military orders and reacts to enemy attacks. No single crew-member could possibly interfere with this. It is finest cinema, you are pulled into the screen, you have the illusion of darkness, even smells. The film is a perfect illusion with some thrill of authenticity.

But seeing as I haven't watched anything for ages, I figured that a little light relief might not be such a bad thing. And like most of Eddie Murphy's back catalogue, light relief is exactly what was on the menu. While maybe not a patch on the original, it is a great family film that has plenty for kids of all ages to enjoy even if it does have its flaws.Murphy plays work-committed doctor John Dolittle, working in an inner-city practise and occasionally finding the time to spend with his wife (Kristen Wilson) and two daughters (Raven-Symoné and Kyla Pratt). But after nearly running a dog over, he is shocked to recall his forgotten childhood ability to talk and communicate with animals. And as word spreads around the animal kingdom, Dolittle struggles with his sanity as every cat, rat and horse in the area flock to him for medical advice. He also struggles to persuade his family and colleagues about his claims, just as his practise is about to merge in a big-money deal.Murphy, by now in the middle of the end of his career, doesn't need to try too hard but actually, he is surprisingly good as the increasingly demented doctor. Maybe because he doesn't have to slap on several thousand dollars worth of latex or play every character in the movie but Doctor Dolittle serves as a reminder that he can be an accomplished performer without going completely over the top like he does nowadays. However, Murphy is no match for the variety of animals acting alongside him and even though the animals actually talk through clever and discreet CG, the numerous voices and guest stars (Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Julie Marge Simpson Kavner and more) have all the best lines and make the movie genuinely entertaining. The humour is suitable for a family film - great for kids, mildly amusing for grown-ups - but it does take a while to get going and for some reason, the ending didn't feel particularly satisfying.What it lacks in songs, dance routines and Rex Harrision, it makes up for in characterisation and humour. Doctor Dolittle might not change the world but it is perfect family fare to slap on a slow Sunday afternoon when the weather prevents play outside and you're fed up of hearing them on their Playstations. The only problems I can think of is that it lacks the charm of the original, it could have made more of the premise and the whole thing isn't especially memorable, Murphy's performance aside. But at least he isn't anything like as annoying as he is these days and just like Steve Martin in Father Of The Bride, this film acts almost as a tribute to a former comedian and actor before they decide to ruin their career with some shocking films. So if you're still recovering from the likes of Pluto Nash or Norbitt then I advise you to watch this because if anything else, this is an Eddie Murphy film that doesn't make you want to blow up Hollywood.

Without much time to digest the information, he is framed for his own partner's murder. With only his wife on his side, he takes his accusers hostage easily since he knows all the tactics and rules of engagement.

I watched it last night and it kept me hooked.I cant say anything great about it that hasn't been said but this drama had so much to offer.I honestly didn't even know the story, I thought it was about a black man being on trial for something he did to a white person and he was falsely accused. That is what the movie is about, but that is not the story the movie tells.I am all about hating racism and wanting the world to see the ugliness in judging people, this movie taught a lesson in that but I also admit I don't think you can tell someone that something is wrong without telling them why its wrong and what is right. This movie did a great job of showing so much about a man, about a human being and about how little we know about people. You cant know a man unless you've walked in his shoes.A movie with no horror, no violence, no romance, no big banner telling you what its about, but you walk away feeling that you understand it better than anything spelled out for you or explained to you. Its not deep its not complex or complicated, it is not simple or taken at face value either, it is just an emotion, an innocent look at something we never see in the people around us...the soul.The accused can be innocent yet be guilty of seeing himself through the eyes of his accuser and letting fear make him feel he is guilty. A child can be scared and yet brave because curiosity is stronger than fear. A shy man can be a hero and people can turn their backs on doing whats right in favor of doing whats expected.I cant talk about the movies plot without telling too much, I just tell people to watch it. The movie makes you want to like it. The characters are likable and you watch all that goes on and it just sucks you in. A drama with suspense and a touch of comedy and a lot of heart.The acting was perfect, those kids were just great and Peck was in this movie what every actor in Hollywood wishes they could be. The directing was so good the way it used the light to build up suspense and the way it took a movie made in the 60s and made it feel like it was made in the 30's.

I love westerns and I love Clint Eastwood, but I hate most movies loaded with hype and I think American westerns have sucked since The Magnificent Seven. Spaghetti westerns came in the picture and made anything else seem worthless.I watched this last night for the first time, I was wanting so hard to love it and be entertained but I wasn't, I was bored and angry.The movie had so much cheesiness with the direction and the guys riding and shooting into the air in its opening credits that I felt embarrassed. The first fight scene with Clint riding into the Yankee camp with guns blazing in open range as an easy target was just bulls**t. The way the scenes jumped around at times was so hard to keep up with what was going on and who was doing what.I like Eastwood as a director and I like Phillip Kaufman as well and Eastwood replaced him so perhaps either of them could've shot those scenes that I didn't like, The majority of the movie I thought was shot great, it was just those first few scenes in the movie that were over the top sloppy.Not Eastwoods best acting, but it was good. I personally think he went from being an honest noble farmer to being a rude outlaw very quickly and I was confused, he was practicing shooting and not doing so well, he was hurt but not badly so why couldn't he shoot, was it his anger about losing his wife and child, if so could he have really went from half ass to hero in a few days, and would he have been so eager to jump in the sack with the other girl shortly after? And how did he become so notorious, was he a gunslinging outlaw before all this, perhaps this is a sequel and I don't know his back story. I think my ignorance on that may be a joke to some, but as watching this movie as an independent release and not part of a sequence of films or a sequel I really needed to know this guys back story and I didn't get it. Most westerns allow you to get a sense of a man and who he is or was, but I didn't get it here. I think of truly great westerns like Death Rides a Horse and how you know the boy worked hard and practiced hard to become great and seek his revenge, This movie posed the question...If someone shoots my family can I quickly turn into a magnificent gunslinger and seek revenge....No, I cant and this plot had loopholes for me, but I analyze the crap out of everything.I mentioned above he was rude,I think he was way too rude. Every time he spit it made me like him less, on dead outlaws it was fitting, but what did the damn dog do to him? He was just rude, but he still did a great job.The supporting cast was mixed, some did just as you would expect. Some actors stood out and were very likable. The old Native American (Dan George)was great, I heard he had trouble with his lines, but he did so great on film I could care less about technicalities off screen. John Vernon plays a wonderful jerk in all of his movies and he did well here. Will S. as Chief Ten Bears was perfect, gotta love him. Worst actor goes to Sam Bottoms. He is such a horrible actor, I am not sure where he is from, but he has a heavy accent that makes him a bad choice for many of the simple southern accents he uses in movies, this one was the worst I have seen him in. What a joke...The movie was from the mid seventies, I cant imagine anyone wanting to see a movie with a story that had been done a million times unless it had a great director, great score, acting and a nice side story to back it up.

Two young men, Steve Zahn and Paul Walker, are driving through the Southwest to pick up Walker's girl friend, Leelee Sobieski, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. (Nice campus, attractive little town. Several fine microbreweries but avoid the restaurants.) Walker is a discrete and normal young man. Zahn is normal too but a little on the zany side. On the CB radio, Zahn talks Walker into imitating a woman driver whose handle is Candy Cane. A truck driver with a deep Southern accent picks up on Candy Cane and her seductive invitation to a get-together at the Lone Star Motel -- Room 17. It's supposed to be just a joke. That room happens to be occupied by an obnoxious redneck the boys have just run into. The driver shows up with some pink champagne and enters Room 17, where an altercation follows, resulting in the legal occupant being beaten half to death, having his mandible ripped off, and being left on the highway median. The rest of the movie has the unknown driver of this monstrous truck following the two men and then, after they pick up Sobieski, the terrified trio all the way back from Colorado to Nebraska. There is a final confrontation in another motel, with an ambiguous ending that leaves the way open for a sequel, should this original work of art earn a nickel of profit.Actually, there's not too much blood, no sex, and only intermittent episodes of violence. And there's a good deal of tension generated.The tension is generated by the use of two plot devices.(1) The anonymous trucker, who is glimpsed only once and shown to be fat, huge, bald, and the color of a two-day old cadaver, has preternatural powers. At moments when the would-be victims are alone, he knows where they are and what they're doing. In an ocean of corn stalks, for example, far more vast than Cary Grant's in North by Northwest, and at NIGHT too, he's able to run them down and capture one of them. The guy sounds like a retard but he's unbeatable.(2) The plot requires that the trio of fugitives take advantage of every opportunity to commit a stupid act. There's nothing new about that. It takes an artist of Hitchcockian magnitude to do away with a victim who exhibits any normal grasp of his or her circumstances. (Psycho.) I won't even bother to give examples from the specimen now under examination. I will note that this is well-nourished and vividly displayed. But notice the beginnings of rigor and the indications of post-mortem lividity. And, see here? The boxcars stalled on the retinal track? Yep. It's dead alright.

The rest of the movie has the unknown driver of this monstrous truck following the two men and then, after they pick up Sobieski, the terrified trio all the way back from Colorado to Nebraska. There is a final confrontation in another motel, with an ambiguous ending that leaves the way open for a sequel, should this original work of art earn a nickel of profit.Actually, there's not too much blood, no sex, and only intermittent episodes of violence. And there's a good deal of tension generated.The tension is generated by the use of two plot devices.(1) The anonymous trucker, who is glimpsed only once and shown to be fat, huge, bald, and the color of a two-day old cadaver, has preternatural powers. At moments when the would-be victims are alone, he knows where they are and what they're doing. In an ocean of corn stalks, for example, far more vast than Cary Grant's in North by Northwest, and at NIGHT too, he's able to run them down and capture one of them. The guy sounds like a retard but he's unbeatable.(2) The plot requires that the trio of fugitives take advantage of every opportunity to commit a stupid act. There's nothing new about that. It takes an artist of Hitchcockian magnitude to do away with a victim who exhibits any normal grasp of his or her circumstances. (Psycho.) I won't even bother to give examples from the specimen now under examination. I will note that this is well-nourished and vividly displayed. But notice the beginnings of rigor and the indications of post-mortem lividity. And, see here? The boxcars stalled on the retinal track? Yep. It's dead alright.

Alternately overpraised as a Kubrickian genius, or dismissed as a lame Hitchcopycat, De Palma is still a genuinely interesting director to study if not exactly easy to understand. While I agree that 'Carrie' is his masterpiece, his most unique and re-watchable film is this bizarre take on Gaston Leroux's often-filmed tale, which is filmed with lots of things which will alternately make you marvel or start scratching your head in confusion, not the least of which being that this version probably features THE most faithful portrayal of the Phantom since the days of Lon Chaney Sr and drives home the Faustian element of the story farther than any other version, and in some ways, much better than even in Leroux's own novel.Yeah, you read that correctly.The film sets its tone with the opening scenes(following a bizarre Twilight Zone'-like voice-over)as we see a greaser nostalgia group called the Juicy Fruits perform a deceptively cheerful song about an unsuccessful musician who kills himself so that he will become a legend overnight so that it will help support his sister. Scenes like this are great, as they pretty much tell you that you will be getting more of the same in alternating doses of effectiveness. The whole film is like this opening Fast-paced, bouncy, but with an underlying sense of menace, tragedy and heartbreak. If James Whale was alive in the '70's, this is the film he would have made.The plot is a comedic update of the 1962 Terrence Fisher version of 'Phantom'. William Finley plays Warren Zevon-look a like Winslow Leach, a character clearly patterned after Herbert Lom's Professor Petrie. The nerdy but easily angered(he goes berserk at the prospect of his music being sung by the Juicy Fruits, whom he despises)Winslow is writing a rock opera based on 'Faust' which he insists on performing himself, and although he does quite a good job in my opinion, record dealer Swan(Paul Williams, playing a cross between Phil Spector, Dorian Gray and Michael Gough's Lord D' Arcy character from the 1962 version)decides he likes the music more than Winslow and steals it. After several unsuccessful attempts to get his music back, Swan has drugs planted on Winslow and he ends up getting life(?). However, after hearing his music performed on the radio by the Juicy Fruits, our hero snaps, kills a guard and escapes in a montage straight out of Loony Tunes, only to get disfigured by, wait for it, a RECORD PRESS. Yeah.....You can tell what happens next, but that doesn't mean things don't become more and more twisted. He may now be the disfigured, caped masked madman, but Winslow is soon going to discover he's not the only one inhabiting Swan's performance house who is worthy of being called The Phantom. Often criticized for his overindulgence(only in the '70's could such a minor celebrity have so many guest appearances) and diminutive size, Paul Williams nevertheless crafts a wonderfully slimy and urbane villain in Swan. The Phantom may be deformed, kill and terrorize, but Swan is the real monster in more ways than one. William Finley shines as Winslow, managing to make us instantly care and sympathize with him despite being a nerdy, naive, egotistical goof-ball. Yet, as the Phantom, he is genuinely menacing. Winslow, much like Erik in the novel, is more at home writing and performing than interacting with other people, and although he is targeting a genuinely evil man, he nevertheless has no qualms whatsoever about brutally slaughtering innocent stagehands and musicians he does not care for, annoying though they may be. It is genuinely disturbing watching him cackle insanely with his high-pitched robotic voice as he maims and kills people. Like Erik, he may be a tragic victim, but he really does enjoy being an evil monster more than he would care to admit. Finley makes his murders progress from bad tempered outbursts, to circumstantial ones to Wheeeee!!! Murder is FUN! in a believable fashion. And his Phantom costume, depending on your point-of-view, is either the best or worst ever created, even though he looks more like a superhero(or villain)than anything else. Husky-voiced Jessica Harper is also good as Winslows' love interest, man can she sing. Despite prominent billing, Gerrit Graham has little more than an overlong cameo as quite possibly the biggest gay stereotype on the face of the earth; a metal singer named Beef(!!!??)who ends up being killed in an outrageously offensive quadruple-visual pun(I'll let the smart people guess what I mean, and no, it's not because of his Frankenstein costume).The film has great songs, and a fun cartoon sensibility that makes several gaping plot holes and outrageous coincidences overlook-able. The film's only flaw, is that it is too short, and too fast-paced. Nevertheless, this is still essential viewing for any cult film enthusiast.~ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 December 2009","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ah, what better film to review for my 50th than Brian De Palma's weird and wonderful Rock & Roll send-up of Phantom of the Opera'.

'Scrooged' still lingered warmly in people's memories and while 'Ghostbusters II' had not duplicated the success of the original, it wouldn't be exaggerating too much to say that Murray had much to do with the attention it did receive. Little surprise then that Hollywood felt they could contrive any storyline no matter how hackneyed, throw him into its polluted waters, watch him soar to the surface and make the whole endeavour swim. For 'What About Bob' is a very by-the-numbers sojourn to Odd Couple territory, while at the same time taking the somewhat disturbing premise of a highly invasive stalker whom we are encouraged to think of as 'wacky', while the victim, by cleverly stripping him of all but two dimensions, is painted as the antagonist, and whom is expected to 'correct' his viewpoint until he finds his tormentor as lovable as the rest of the characters. You can almost hear the director encouraging the audience with 'Come on, look at Bill Murray's face. Isn't he silly?' And in response, Richard Dreyfuss as Dr Marvin groans and seethes in frustration, only to be admonished by his wife in much the same way that Sylvia Field did with Joseph Kearns thirty years earlier in 'Dennis The Menace'.Essentially, the film requires you to side with the lead character as misunderstood not because of any reasons the script may suggest, but because it's Bill Murray, and Bill Murray is funny, and anyone who doesn't agree is apparently taking it too seriously. Not one of us! Not one of us! Which is presumably just as well, since any deep - and by deep, I mean shallow end of the kiddie pool - analysis of the premise invites frustration and dare I say it, madness. And Bill Murray is funny. He had me in 'Ghostbusters'. The man has wit and presence. He's someone you want to watch. Richard Dreyfuss, meanwhile, makes for a perfect Mr Wilson, getting almost Jon Lovitz in his delivery at times. Maybe this is 'Dennis' for the 90s, and who better than Frank Oz to direct the whole endeavour away from 'Girl, Interrupted' territory like Cookie Monster side-stepping sugar addiction by rolling his eyeballs around like a damaged gyroscope? There were times I did find myself laughing very much with the leads, moments where their talent managed to rise above the constrictions set in place by the undecided mish-mash that was the direction to good effect.I do think that any and all themes should open their doors to comedy, so I can only conclude that the fault lies in the execution, the attempt to produce simply unoriginal, cookie-cutter cinema, while a more intelligent approach attempting to understand its material could have satisfied my comedic expectations. The hand of Harold Ramis seems an obvious choice, as the director of the far superior 'Groundhog Day', not to mention the screenwriter of 'Analyze This' (an equally formulaic, but more assured production). And I'd still have wanted Bill Murray. Either way, the major Murrayphiles will doubtless be entertained by what they do find here.

Accused of his wife's murder, a doctor (Harrison Ford) goes on the run, hunting down the real killer while a cop (Tommy Lee Jones) pursues him.The original TV series, starring David Janssen, ran from 1963 to 1967.

The story is obviously a big joke and not to be taken seriously, and the special effects are one of the worst I've seen so far. Then why give this movie a 6?Well.. it was because i could not stop laughing seeing this movie. The movie has so much random stuff going on in it. Obviously the story is one big cliché and not to be taken seriously, but its just the sheer amount of random unexpected happenings. There are also some spoofs on other horror movies inside.At some point in the movie the director actually kind of rubs in your face there was no budget. Im trying not to give spoilers, but with all the random happenings its not really possible to give away the movie in one comment.Now it would not be fair to give this movie anything near a 7 or 8, because there are lots of movies with a lot of effort put in to it. This movie has obviously not a lot of effort put into it, but i still find it very enjoyable.All i can say is if you are open minded and looking for something completely random, just put on this movie. Just don't expect any masterpiece!

In the scramble to get home for Thanksgiving, and because of a massive snowstorm that closes O'Hare Airport in Chicago and diverts them to Wichita, Neal and Del become unlikely travel companions as they hit the road for Chicago in a variety of modes of transportation.As we follow their misadventures, this becomes a very funny movie. In a strange way, both characters are equally likable and not. Neal's a good family guy who just wants to be with his family for the holidays, but he's also unforgiving and unsympathetic to others, not to mention a bit snobbish. Del talks too much and has far too many irritating habits, but he is who he is and - as he says - he likes himself and he likes people, but there's also a sadness to him that makes you want to know more about him. Martin and Candy played off each other perfectly, and there are many absolutely hilarious moments throughout. I think my favourite scene is as they travel the wrong way down the highway. Ultimately, the mystery about Del's life and Del's wife is revealed, which leads to a very touching scene at the movie's close, as Neal is moved to invite Del to his home and family for Thanksgiving.In a movie I enjoyed very much, the only thing I didn't like was the scene in which Neal loses his cool with the car rental agent and spews forth an ongoing chain of the f-word at her. I realize this scene has to be looked at in context. I realize it presented an interesting view of the character finally losing it, but to me - although I'm no prude - it was far too out of character for Neal and too out of place when compared to the rest of the movie. That scene aside, though, this movie is one of the best comedies that you'll ever see - a must-see holiday film. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 December 2009","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" They make the perfect odd couple Steve Martin as the prim and proper, fastidious and somewhat uptight ad exec Neal Page and John Candy as the obnoxious, uncultured and unkempt shower curtain salesman Del Griffith.
