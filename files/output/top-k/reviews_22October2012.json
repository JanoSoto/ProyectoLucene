I must confess that I had never before considered seeing this film. Many oldies are slow and tedious, more often than not, but I stand corrected after seeing this one. After a few minutes you overlook that the film is in black and white. And the story is also well told and switches from one scene to the next at well chosen moments.Typically dating back to half a century ago is the number of cigarettes being lighted as a matter of course, outside and inside the house and without politely asking for objections. Such things mark this film more as ancient than the missing colors and the imperfect sound, in my opinion. And I found also remarkable the very very short credits at the end, compared with recent movies where you can sit watching credits for many minutes (but may be missing from the copy they used).In hindsight it was very unusual that nearly 2\/3 of the film's running time, roughly the whole first hour, is devoted to things that happened in the past. This happens after our main character has decided to reveal his not so innocent past to his fiancée. He has continuously postponed telling her about his previous job as a private detective, during which years some unethical things happened. The story is told while riding from their home village to the location where he expects to get a new assignment. It is shown in the form of a continuous flashback, during which you nearly forget that it is indeed a flashback.In the last half hour, the remaining 1\/3 of the 97 minutes running time, the story returns to the assignment at hand. At that point the aforementioned comprehensive flashback is paying off. Several people who haven't seen each other in years, appear one after another, all of them having several axes to grind. Apart from that situation full of tension, able to develop in many directions, we are left in the dark who is telling the truth and nothing but the truth. Even worse, it soon becomes apparent that we cannot even trust our main character to do the right thing.As said before, my hesitations to book tickets for an oldie film proved wrong. This one is neither tedious nor slow, letting us continuously wonder what will happen next. Who cares about black and white, or imperfect sound for that matter?? Most (2\/3) of the running time of this film is devoted to showing the past of the main characters, which fact matches the title of the movie in full, due to the heavy burden all participants bring out of the past.

This has set a standard so high that I think it would nearly be Impossible to have a portrayal better than this, especially the first 30 minute scene. Now this first part is what the world recognized thoroughly and it deserves that. But the second and the major part of the story is equally amazing. The film captures the journey of a group of 8 people who set out to find out another of their comrade named- James Ryan.. They have to travel all the way to him just to deliver the message that all his brothers are dead and that he is relieved from duty. During their journey they encounter snipers, moral dilemmas etc. the idea of 8 people putting their lives at stake for just one person, is an intriguing story and to supplement that you will see a hell lot of action. This is a film not to be missed.PROS Spielberg is a man who does things with huge perfection. There are many ways to see this film. One might see it as a nice action film in which people are assigned a task and they accomplish it by fighting a lot of people. It's the simplest way to put it. But the other way to see it is in a question format. First the question arises as to why 8 people were sent on a near suicide mission to find just one person. Why can't let the war finish. And if he is alive, let him be relieved. But then here comes morality. The superficial answer to the question is that the mother who has already lost 3 of her sons and so her only son should not be risked. So in a way we are taking quantity to be the major factor in here. The analytical reason to send them on such a mission is left to the viewer to decide on his own. Some might say that it is just a form of duty. Correct. Some will say that loss of 4 compared with loss of 1 or 2 is greater. OK. Some might think that a person who has lost his three brothers is more eligible to leave the war than any other, because his grief is higher. OK. So in a way this first question is a direct check on how you view rules of lives or your perception towards human decisions. I would say this is a perfect question and portrayed in the best ways. Second question is direct and is asked by the team people themselves. They are perfectly right in their thinking. Are their lives not as important as any other one who is fighting? People who watched carefully from the starting and thought about the first question nicely, they will be counter attacked by this phase of the film. Isn't it intriguing, to have included the viewer so closely in a film? During this second phase, the team is under a lot of emotional turmoil. They want to abandon the mission. From this moment the third question starts. Which is &#x96; 'is doing the duty and obeying orders so important that you put your lives at risk?' While most will say to this question that they are doing the duty for the country. But keeping myself in their positions, I feel too much agitated about the objective of the mission. Why should I risk my life for this purpose? None of them were reluctant in doing their duty for the country but the objective of this mission stirred them. Next we come across a very emotional moment when Tom hanks says that he is doing this so that he completes the mission and can go home peacefully. He says this line with so much emotion that you will forget everything about the three questions and look for Ryan yourself.This film has everything for people of all ages. It also has light humor at appropriate places. The beauty of the war films is that you have a funny moment and just after that you come across a heartbroken statement. After watching the film you will definitely get convinced that war changes people. One other scene that I will never forget is the authentic knife fight between a US officer and a German officer. That fight depicts what a person behaves in his last moments of death. Also I felt sad over the two strange people fighting and killing so ruthlessly just on some orders.Also I would like to explore the message of the film in detail.

In 1998, when I first saw Chasing Amy I had really enjoyed it, but I too had thought Mallrats was a better film than it actually was. So now, watching it again after all these years I see that although my memories of Mallrats have been tainted, Chasing Amy's have been solidified. The best things from both Clerks. and Mallrats were present in Chasing Amy, and the things that brought down both films were missing.The problems I had with Clerks. dealt with the production value and directing by Smith. It was lackluster and brought down the film to a certain degree, but the writing was so good that it more than made up for it. Mallrats was funny, but it had a lame story line and again wasn't terrible well directed. Jay and Silent Bob, who were in both films, were good and the great dialogue that Smith wrote was present but the only real redeeming factor for Mallrats was Jason Lee. He was the movie. He made the movie. He is the only reason to watch the movie.Chasing Amy had Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams in the leads. It was funny; it was original; it was daring; it was romantic; it was scathingly funny; it was adult. Jason Lee, was fantastic again, and the rest of the cast was great too, with no weak links any where to be found. Affleck was excellent and shared great chemistry with Adams. And everyone was funny. Jay and Silent Bob even make a brief but memorable appearance.And man was it funny. Smith's writing was crude and daring yet laugh out loud funny, but unlike Mallrats it was much more adult, dealing with homophobia, gays and sex openly and often. And you'll laugh often and hard and from the very first scene. There is a well rounded love story that plays through the movie that makes this the first Kevin Smith film to actually feel like a real, professional, adult film. And the first Kevin Smith film to have a well written story around his well written dialogue.The production values are quite good, looking as good if not better than Mallrats, but was filmed at a fraction of the cost. The sets feel real, the rooms worn in and costumes like real clothes on characters that look like real people. And there is more movement within the compositions. Smith has a style that is rather static, with no real movement within the frame or with the camera. Just point the camera, shoot the scene, move on. It made for a rather distant experience from the characters you were watching. But these are nicely composed shots with nice tracking shots and and an assemblance of fluidity that wasn't there before. It's minimalistic, but it's suited perfectly to the material and to Smith's writing.Smith's directing has matured and blossomed, and although I was beginning to think that he was a much better writer than director he has proved me wrong with Chasing Amy. This is the film I was expecting after watching Clerks. not Mallrats. It unleashes the potential that was first glimpsed three features ago. He has written a better, more structured script that maintained the great and hysterical dialogue from his past films but added a great story around it. He pulled out solid performances from his entire cast and an even better production design than Mallrats, considering it cost considerably less. And he brought you more into the film and closer to the characters, by using more than just his script to tell the story. He used the camera and placements and movements of the camera to bring us into film, to feel along side the characters, rather than keeping us at a considerably distant distance from them.Chasing Amy is a great film. One that is fully realized by its creator, is highly original, and at times is outright hysterical.

In 1998, when I first saw Chasing Amy I had really enjoyed it, but I too had thought Mallrats was a better film than it actually was. So now, watching it again after all these years I see that although my memories of Mallrats have been tainted, Chasing Amy's have been solidified. The best things from both Clerks. and Mallrats were present in Chasing Amy, and the things that brought down both films were missing.The problems I had with Clerks. dealt with the production value and directing by Smith. It was lackluster and brought down the film to a certain degree, but the writing was so good that it more than made up for it. Mallrats was funny, but it had a lame story line and again wasn't terrible well directed. Jay and Silent Bob, who were in both films, were good and the great dialogue that Smith wrote was present but the only real redeeming factor for Mallrats was Jason Lee. He was the movie. He made the movie. He is the only reason to watch the movie.Chasing Amy had Ben Affleck, Jason Lee and Joey Lauren Adams in the leads. It was funny; it was original; it was daring; it was romantic; it was scathingly funny; it was adult. Jason Lee, was fantastic again, and the rest of the cast was great too, with no weak links any where to be found. Affleck was excellent and shared great chemistry with Adams. And everyone was funny. Jay and Silent Bob even make a brief but memorable appearance.And man was it funny. Smith's writing was crude and daring yet laugh out loud funny, but unlike Mallrats it was much more adult, dealing with homophobia, gays and sex openly and often. And you'll laugh often and hard and from the very first scene. There is a well rounded love story that plays through the movie that makes this the first Kevin Smith film to actually feel like a real, professional, adult film. And the first Kevin Smith film to have a well written story around his well written dialogue.The production values are quite good, looking as good if not better than Mallrats, but was filmed at a fraction of the cost. The sets feel real, the rooms worn in and costumes like real clothes on characters that look like real people. And there is more movement within the compositions. Smith has a style that is rather static, with no real movement within the frame or with the camera. Just point the camera, shoot the scene, move on. It made for a rather distant experience from the characters you were watching. But these are nicely composed shots with nice tracking shots and and an assemblance of fluidity that wasn't there before. It's minimalistic, but it's suited perfectly to the material and to Smith's writing.Smith's directing has matured and blossomed, and although I was beginning to think that he was a much better writer than director he has proved me wrong with Chasing Amy. This is the film I was expecting after watching Clerks. not Mallrats. It unleashes the potential that was first glimpsed three features ago. He has written a better, more structured script that maintained the great and hysterical dialogue from his past films but added a great story around it. He pulled out solid performances from his entire cast and an even better production design than Mallrats, considering it cost considerably less. And he brought you more into the film and closer to the characters, by using more than just his script to tell the story. He used the camera and placements and movements of the camera to bring us into film, to feel along side the characters, rather than keeping us at a considerably distant distance from them.Chasing Amy is a great film. One that is fully realized by its creator, is highly original, and at times is outright hysterical.

As the company's first project, Zemeckis chose screenwriter Clark Gregg's What Lies Beneath, a modern-day ghost story that, the director told his crew, he wished to bring to the screen as Alfred Hitchcock might have done, IF the Master of Suspense had had access to modern FX technology and computer graphics. (Never mind that none of Hitchcock's 54 films dealt with ghosts or the supernatural per se.) Filmed largely in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont, near Addison, during a hiatus from shooting Cast Away, the resultant picture, released in July 2000, was still another significant feather in Zemeckis' already crowded hat, and, like those other films named, features impressive yet subtly integrated FX to complement a highly intriguing story. As both a horror film and an exercise in suspense, What Lies Beneath must be deemed a complete success.In the picture, we meet an attractive, middle-aged couple, Norman and Claire Spencer, and indeed, as portrayed by Hollywood icons Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, the Spencers might be one of the handsomest couples in the history of the horror film! Living as they do in a beautiful home overlooking a Vermont lake, the professional couple (Norman is a renowned geneticist; Claire, a retired cellist), although their only daughter has just left for college, would seem to have an enviable marriage. But before very long, weird occurrences begin in the newly empty nest. Strange noises and whisperings, a broken picture frame, spectral reflections in the surface of the lake and (in perhaps the film's single scariest scene) bathtub water, all serve to convince Claire that the ghost of a young woman is haunting her abode...possibly the ghost of her new next-door neighbor, who Claire believes has been killed by her husband. But, as it turns out, the truth is considerably more complex, and the unraveling of this truth will go very far in unraveling the Spencers' marriage, too....So, DOES What Lies Beneath strike the viewer as a Hitchcockian exercise, abetted by 21st century computer wizardry? I would have to say yes. There are any number of scenes that are undeniably scary or suspenseful, the most agonizing of which is the wonderful scene in which Claire lies paralyzed in a bathtub that is slowly being filled with water. Some of Alan Silvestri's score is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's classic music for Psycho, while Claire's use of binoculars to spy on her neighbors at night cannot help but call to mind Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window. Pfeiffer and Ford work well together and do have some screen chemistry; they make a credible couple, although Norman, as it turns out, might be one of the least sympathetic characters that Ford has ever essayed. For this viewer, however, the bulk of this picture's success must lie squarely with Pfeiffer, who appears in virtually every single scene and is simply terrific in all of them. Watching her in this film, in which she easily displays far more dramatic heft than her costar, and also reveals what an effective scream queen she can be, the viewer will most likely regret how few other horror vehicles Ms. Pfeiffer has appeared in. And really, besides 1994's Wolf, I can think of no others, unless we stretch the point a bit and include 1987's The Witches of Eastwick and this past summer's horror comedy Dark Shadows. One of the finest combinations of sensational looks and undeniable acting chops to this day (and Michelle is 54 as I write these words), she is quite simply one of the best we've got, and makes Claire Spencer and What Lies Beneath a character and a film to savor. The venerable Leonard Maltin Movie Guide, apparently, does not concur in this assessment, concluding its lukewarm comments with the statement that the story doesn't make sense. But the film DID make perfect sense to me...as long, that is, as one is willing to believe in spooks. And by the end of Zemeckis' highly effective film, most viewers, I have a feeling, will be uttering that famous line of the Cowardly Lion I DO believe in spooks, I DO believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do, I do, I DO believe in spooks....
