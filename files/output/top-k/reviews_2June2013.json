Continue with caution.I've seen some bad movies in my time. Yeah, most of them are bad. But most that bad movies that I know of are so bad that they're entertaining. But this is actually BAD. Not so bad it's good, but SO BAD IT'S CANCER TO YOUR BRAIN. I thoroughly regret watching this piece of crap, and let me tell you why. I am a big fan of the Alien movies. Alien was great, Aliens was even greater, BUT THEN SUDDENLY THE SERIES TAKES A RIDE STRAIGHT DOWN THE HILL WITH ALIEN 3. The story line is just plain stupid, you know I like to think Aliens had a good happy ending, but this movie just ruins everything and made the series ultra depressing.So basically after the events of Aliens, when they all safely go home, a facehugger is found on board. Due to this emergency, they get ejected from the ship and crash on earth (I think could be any planet.)Newt is dead, the last colonial marine is dead and even Weyland gets disconnected. (Not exactly DEAD since he is an android.) This is just sad. So basically a bunch of prisoners find the crashed ship thing and check for survivors. Ripley, of course being the only survivor comes out fine. But a facehugger has come with them! So basically it lays its egg in a dog and we'll get to what happens later. Ripley cries over Newt's dead body, now the fact Newt died just seemed so lazy. Could they not get the proper actor? Eh, whatever. She is dead now. Ripley sees the acid burns on the side of Newt's tube and is convinced that there is probably an alien inside of her. So a doctor performs an autopsy (rather disturbing scene) and there is no sign of an alien. Ripley, on the other hand is still convinced that it probably is still inside her, even though they performed an autopsy. So basically the film goes on, they say goodbye to the dead bodies and Ripley tries to fit in with the sexist prisoners, but they mock her for being a woman. I also forgot to mention, that the doctor guy who performed the autopsy on Newt is the love interest for the story. And for some unexplained reason he shaves Ripley's hair off and she is partially bold now. I really wish it was explained why, but it's not.As they say goodbye to the dead bodies, an alien begins to burst out of the dog's chest. This is an extremely hard to watch and disturbing scene. The alien that arrives out of the dog's chest is not a normal Xenomorph, but a slightly different looking one. Don't exactly know why, but let's just say it's because it was a dog and not a human it came out of.So the alien starts to kill off a few people, first one having acid in his face then falling into a metal fan and being graphically chopped up. Ripley sees doctor love interest guy get killed by an alien, and as she tries to warn everyone, of course, they don't believe her until one asshole guy gets taken by the alien. Ripley performs an x-ray and notices the alien is inside her. So basically she doesn't very much care that she dies or not. So as they EVENTUALLY kill the alien after a very stretched and long scene of the alien chasing them and then eventually them burning it to death, that's over. Also, I forgot to mention that the prisoners have no firearm what so ever. So they just use what they got.In the end, Weyland (the real Weyland, not the android) comes in with a bunch of soldiers and tries to tell Ripley that they can get rid of the Alien inside of her. Ripley doesn't believe that, so she jumps backwards into lava as the alien pops out of her chest as she then dies.So that's it. That was stupid. Considering most of the movie isn't about the alien but about the prison. If that sounded enjoyable to you at all, believe me it was painful to watch. It was absolutely horrid. One of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life. Only one Alien too, no other ones. So in the end, it was a stupid movie that sucked. Even Alien Resurrection is better than this rubbish.

John Voight really did exude the naivety of his character without going over the line and becoming stupid or simple and yet still managed to command a presence in the relationship with Rizzo.

Probably a lot like Jurassic Park III, an almost unwatchable third entry in an otherwise solid film series. Lacking the fun, suspense, and overall entertainment value of the first two films, Jurassic Park III is filled with moments of unintentional humor, tedium, and disappointment all around.Jurassic Park III begins almost identically to Jurassic Park The Lost World. A few people are enjoying their vacation a little too close to the dinosaur-infested Isla Sorna, and ends in disaster. One of these unlucky victims is an unlucky boy named Eric. Eric's divorced parents (who curiously were not with the boy at the time of this accident) are determined to go to Isla Sorna and find him, despite the dangers. They also manage to trick Dr. Alan Grant to come along with them (as well as a friend of Grant's named Billy Brennan). As expected, chaos ensues when they reach the island and there doesn't appear to be a way back home.I wonder if Jurassic Park III was initially planned as a children's film. The body count is much lower than that of the previous two films, and there's more chase scenes than actual violence. The characters seem more like cartoon characters than actual people, and the tone of the film feels more like a sitcom than a Sci-Fi action flick. Not to mention one scene that where three of the main characters are digging through dino doo, as well as an unbelievably awful dream sequence involving a talking dinosaur. My theory is further supported by Eric, the 12 year old son of the Kirbies (the couple that convinced Grant to come to the island with them) who survives on the island by himself for eight weeks and proves remarkably resourceful. This is a dramatic change from the children of the previous Jurassic Park films, but not a positive one.The fact is, the Jurassic Park films already require you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but Eric's impressive survival skills (among almost a dozen convenient escapes) pushes it all over the line.On the bright side, Jurassic Park III doesn't have a the horrendously slow beginning that the first two films had. The original film took at least an hour to really get going, and it took The Lost World a good 40 minutes. In Jurassic Park III, the chaos starts in about 20 minutes (which also shortens the overall run time to about 90 minutes). Unfortunately, the chaos isn't much more exciting than the talking in the first 20 minutes.While the first two Jurassic Park films were extremely suspenseful and unpredictable, Jurassic Park III is almost the opposite. Any and all boo moments can be seen from a mile away, meaning that successful scares are few to none. The action scenes are uninteresting and lack excitement. One scene in particular seems almost an exact copy of the dangling trailer scene from The Lost World, only much shorter, and lacking any suspense.Much of the suspense comes from the small body count. Now, there's no right way to say this part, but here goes More people needed to get eaten. I already mentioned that relatively few people get eaten, but it needs to be emphasized. Adding to my theory that this was initially supposed to be a kid's film, basically all the main characters live. At one point, it seemed Jurassic Park III might have changed it's mind and killed off a semi-important character, but we later discover the character didn't die at all (and I might add that this weak twist was also highly predictable).The entire film seems very cheap and just thrown together. The special effects, while not bad, are far less impressive (and believable) than those of the first two Jurassic Park flicks. And editing seems to be rushed as I spotted a large number of continuity issues.The acting is weak, though this has more to with the script than the actual performances. Because the characters in the film are mostly idiots (some seems unusually stupid), the actors appear to be idiots as well, which is something a film should never do. Especially irritating is Tea Leoni as Amanda Kirby, portraying the single-most stupid and annoying character in the entire Jurassic Park film series.John Williams did not score this third entry (despite his involvement with the first two), which only adds to both this film's slopped together feeling, and my ever-growing respect for the composer. However, replacement composer Don Davis does a pretty commendable job at utilizing Williams' existing themes. While Williams refrained from frequent use of the original's themes for The Lost World, Davis uses them freely and frequently. The score isn't as skilled as either of the previous entries in the series, but it's plenty of fun, and includes some very spirited arrangements of the main theme (especially at the end).Downright awful in almost every respect, Jurassic Park III isn't funny, isn't exciting, and isn't memorable. Having more in common with the Honey I Shrunk The Kid sequels than any of the Jurassic Park films, Jurassic Park III is a highly flawed and highly disappointing movie in just about every regard.

Alas, in following the masterstroke that was The Hunt for Red October, it isn't quite up to the task of providing us with a deft; subtle espionage thriller which keeps us on the edge of our seat's and has its runtime fly by. So gnawing, in fact, is the feeling in Patriot Games that it merely strikes us as a project constantly aware of it's bigger brother that it ends up being a project that's a little too eager to impress and unsure of how to spend all its evident energy. A measure of how inferior Phillip Noyce's effort is lies in a scene nearer the end, a scene set in the African desert where an ally of the Irish enemies, who worked undercover for them in London, finally meets up with them following a failure in his operations. Witness the way in which the Irish terrorists eliminate him now that he's outlived his usefulness; witness the obligatory air of generic familiarity about proceedings in this scene, as if we knew what was coming. Now recall how McTiernan's October ran its course without any such instance.Things have been bulked out in Patriot Games, as if the border-line lone, enclosed locale of the nuclear submarine from before has been identified as an issue and swept aside for somewhat of a globe-trotting escapade that hops from Ireland to Libya bay way of London and Virginia. Gone too is the Scotsman doing Russian, replaced by the Englishman doing Irish &#x96; he is Sean Bean and he plays the innocuously named Sean Miller, a member of an I.R.A. rebel cell whose attempts to kill an affluent friend of the British Royal family fails when a certain somebody intervenes thus saving the day although causing the death of Miller's younger brother.The certain somebody is Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan, a man in London on business with his wife and infant daughter charged with hosting some lectures for the C.I.A. when the chaos kicks off and he eliminates Miller's much adorned younger sibling. In spite of Miller's capture, he swears a revenge on Ryan's own family &#x96; a family with whom it's already established Ryan has a wonderful rapport; right down to the somewhat romanticised exchange of love between he and his wife set to champagne and candles whilst occupying an exquisite London hotel. Needless to say, Miller does eventually break free of his judicial shackles &#x96; his desire to wipe the Ryan family out in an act of revenge is not agreed upon by the rest of the faction but he harbours his grudge anyway. In spite of this, American authorities don't believe he'll come after Ryan.... so naturally, he does and terrorism crash lands on the streets of the United States at a time when, cinematically, this sort of content would have been much more affecting.What is pleasing, however, is that while this is the American thriller whereby the hero actually bleeds when he is caught in combat and needs to spend time in a hospital recovering, the film resists the urge to depict what is essentially a movie-going revenge fantasy. Ryan is both injured and shaken; his family are a target and a threat is at large out there in the wider world. There is a sense of helplessness, of vulnerability &#x96; we do not sense that we're anywhere near the likes of 1985's Commando. In spite of its positive core values, it would be impossible for me to say that the film gripped me as much as The Hunt for Red October did, but equally difficult to say that the film was not gripping at all. The film is much more conventional, and it works as your more standardised thriller, but then this might be out of the fact the series' previous entry was of such a high calibre. The heroes and villains are cleaner cut in this edition. Ryan, the charismatic professional and family man to boot, is up against the rough and ready thug who was out to do some serious damage even before they become preoccupied with ruining Ryan's life. One's fondness for Connery's character in the last film not as a villain, but as a complicated personality doing what he was doing on top of the depiction of Ryan essentially as a middle-man hopping between the Americans and the Russians, is sorely missed.And yet there is little room for one to recommend this as a piece of dumb, fluffy entertainment. Its director, Noyce, carves something out of the core ideas that's watchable and feels somehow superior to most in its genre. There is a desire to follow in the footsteps of the previous effort in trying to construct this broad canvas upon which every-which side is depicted in this global struggle against the terrorist threat, but it just doesn't come off like it did before. The success ranges from that of the moderately engaging depiction of police officers back in Britain striving to find domestic IRA members to just plain pointless, as a member of the Royal Family tries to work his schedule around potential terror attacks. While in desperate need of a final act re-write and disappointing in its boiling down to a one-on-one Thunderball-esque boat chase, its biggest crime remains its inferiority to Hunt. The film is not without a certain energy and we invest rather a lot into it, it just doesn't have the dynamism nor guile its predecessor had.

Needless to say, Miller does eventually break free of his judicial shackles &#x96; his desire to wipe the Ryan family out in an act of revenge is not agreed upon by the rest of the faction but he harbours his grudge anyway. In spite of this, American authorities don't believe he'll come after Ryan.... so naturally, he does and terrorism crash lands on the streets of the United States at a time when, cinematically, this sort of content would have been much more affecting.What is pleasing, however, is that while this is the American thriller whereby the hero actually bleeds when he is caught in combat and needs to spend time in a hospital recovering, the film resists the urge to depict what is essentially a movie-going revenge fantasy. Ryan is both injured and shaken; his family are a target and a threat is at large out there in the wider world. There is a sense of helplessness, of vulnerability &#x96; we do not sense that we're anywhere near the likes of 1985's Commando. In spite of its positive core values, it would be impossible for me to say that the film gripped me as much as The Hunt for Red October did, but equally difficult to say that the film was not gripping at all. The film is much more conventional, and it works as your more standardised thriller, but then this might be out of the fact the series' previous entry was of such a high calibre. The heroes and villains are cleaner cut in this edition. Ryan, the charismatic professional and family man to boot, is up against the rough and ready thug who was out to do some serious damage even before they become preoccupied with ruining Ryan's life. One's fondness for Connery's character in the last film not as a villain, but as a complicated personality doing what he was doing on top of the depiction of Ryan essentially as a middle-man hopping between the Americans and the Russians, is sorely missed.And yet there is little room for one to recommend this as a piece of dumb, fluffy entertainment. Its director, Noyce, carves something out of the core ideas that's watchable and feels somehow superior to most in its genre. There is a desire to follow in the footsteps of the previous effort in trying to construct this broad canvas upon which every-which side is depicted in this global struggle against the terrorist threat, but it just doesn't come off like it did before. The success ranges from that of the moderately engaging depiction of police officers back in Britain striving to find domestic IRA members to just plain pointless, as a member of the Royal Family tries to work his schedule around potential terror attacks. While in desperate need of a final act re-write and disappointing in its boiling down to a one-on-one Thunderball-esque boat chase, its biggest crime remains its inferiority to Hunt. The film is not without a certain energy and we invest rather a lot into it, it just doesn't have the dynamism nor guile its predecessor had.

The turkey, the stuffing the time spent with family you haven't seen in months, if not longer? What if, when it finally arrives, you just wish it would end?Claudia Larson (played by Holly Hunter) is a former artist who now works as a restorer in a Chicago museum. She is summoned to her employer's office during work, but does not know why. Her boss, Peter Arnold (played by Austin Pendleton) informs her that, despite overwhelming enthusiasm for her profession, she is being fired. Claudia protests and mentions coworkers that she believes more worthy of termination, only to find out that, for budgetary reasons, those same coworkers will be fired also. For no apparent reason, she proceeds to kiss her now former boss which ends with her unceremoniously sneezing. He then says, God I hate the holidays and that is the last we see of him. With Thanksgiving approaching, Claudia is driven to the airport by her daughter Kitt (played by Claire Danes) and told that she intends to lose her virginity over the holiday, as she will be spending it with her long-time boyfriend and his family. After entering the airport, the hustle and bustle of the season causes her to lose her coat. She calls her brother, Tommy (played by Robert Downey Jr.) from the plane and, getting his answering machine, proceeds to dictate all of these recent developments to a cassette tape. When her plane lands, she is greeted by her parents Adele and Henry Larson. Adele (played by Anne Bancroft) is a housewife and, before actually speaking to her daughter she remarks on her looks. Henry (played by Charles Durning) is a retired airport worker who is called Tubby by his wife and who is simply happy to see his daughter. The drive home and the day before Thanksgiving are fairly uneventful. The occasion itself, anything but.This is a great movie. There is an obvious difference between holiday movies and movies that simply take place during the holidays. While A Christmas Story and the Home Alone series would be the former, Millions, another favorite of mine, and Home for the Holidays would be the latter. Members of the family just don't get along; the holiday itself is more nightmarish than heartwarming and, in spite of that, there is still a tearful goodbye as the family departs at the conclusion of the festivities. This is a movie you can, and should, watch year-round.
