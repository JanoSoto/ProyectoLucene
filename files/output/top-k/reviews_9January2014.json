The Monster Club was the final entry in this cycle. It came at a time where the quaint format was hopelessly out of date. The early 80's was a time of slashers, splatter films and video nasties, the old school charms of the British portmanteau movies were somewhat out of step with these times. So with The Monster Club, Amicus tried to update the format by including music performances from new wave and hard rock bands, while also ramping up the campy factor even further. The result was an effort that was the most self-consciously silly of them all.My introduction to the movie was a little unusual, in that as a kid I first encountered it in comic format. It was serialised in the magazine 'Halls of Horror'. I remember vividly the one about the Shadmock, it was so brilliantly illustrated and full of nudity and violence. When I saw the film on TV a year or so later I was very disappointed with the lack of any nudity whatsoever and the much less impressive effects. While the denizens of The Monster Club itself looked considerably better than the film version which seemed to consist of people in masks. You can still find the comic if you look for it but even if you don't, trust me it looked excellent and the film could only be a let down by comparison.But I guess what the comic showed was that there was great potential in this movie if it had more of a budget. The low production values really effected it though. Having said all that, I have revisited it recently and went into it knowing in advance what it is and what it isn't. And with that attitude I found it to be pretty good fun overall. It's based on the work of the author R. Chetwynd Hayes, who is portrayed by John Carradine in the movie. He encounters a vampire one night in the streets of a city, who attacks him but then takes him to a secret place where the creatures of the night assemble - The Monster Club. From here the vampire tells the writer three spooky tales of the dark side. The first one concerns a being called a Shadmock, who is a mysterious loner who causes real horror when he whistles. The second film is about a vampire and vampire hunters. The third is about a director scouting for a location for his next horror film, he comes across a weird isolated village populated by flesh-eating ghouls.The first and third stories are actually pretty decent with some nice atmosphere at times. The third was easily the weakest because it was far too silly. Previous Amicus anthologies always seemed to have a 'comedy' story but in this one it's more of a problem because the wraparound story is so silly to begin with and is much more extended than in earlier films, in order to include all the songs. It also means we only have three stories, as opposed to the more normal five. This all means that we don't really need more comedy and it would have been better having something more along the lines of the other two tone-wise.It is a monumentally daft film though overall and I reckon it's probably more fun now than it was at the time. The music scenes are very silly but entertaining never-the-less. And I was pretty surprised to see that the reggae-pop band UB40 were involved in this music! Aside from the bands the other entertainment on display in the club is a stripper who removes&#x85;well&#x85;everything. The Monster Club is an utterly ridiculous film but it is pretty unique, as I sure haven't seen anything quite like this before. If you go in with the right attitude and expectations adjusted accordingly, you might well have fun though.

Alice is suffering from nightmares from the events, though she appears to be in the clear. There is one thing Alice doesn't realize. Jason isn't really dead. He survived the drowning, and he's been living in the woods for years. A mere two months later, Alice is killed with an ice pick. Five years later, Paul Holt opens a camp next to Camp Blood, aka Crystal Lake, despite ample warning from authorities. Paul hires a bunch of counselors to help him run the camp. After explaining to the counselors that Camp Crystal Lake is prohibited, and that Jason is a myth, Jason goes on a murderous rampage. I like this movie to a certain extent. It is quite entertaining, and has all of the stuff you love in a Friday The 13th movie. I'm a humongous fan of the franchise. I know it by heart, because i've seen it so many times. My problem is that it's a watered down version of the original. It delivers the same formula from the original in a lot of ways, only with Jason as the actual killer. They use the same tactic they did in the original. For much of the movie, Jason is concealed. We get plenty of shots of him walking, but not many closeups until the finale. It was an effective tactic, but it was used more efficiently in the original. Jason isn't all that threatening in this one. He doesn't have the notorious goalie mask that would become a trademark for him. That wouldn't happen until the next installment, F13th Part III, and it was actually Shelley who is responsible for Jason getting the mask in the first place. But I digress. Jason has the Town That Dreaded Sundown look in this one. He has a mediocre looking potato sack over his head, and uses various weapons to kill. It isn't all that suspenseful until the memorable finale. It is entertaining in a lovable 80's way, but not much happens.We get deaths, but a lot of them are bland. We get a forgettable slit throat, two people are impaled simultaneously, and a severed head. Someone gets an icepick in the temple, a machete in the face, and more, but it's all rather bloodless. They cut away before you get to see much. Adrienne King returns succinctly in the beginning. I would like to think her role would have been more substantial if it wasn't for her real life stalker. She deserved a much better send off. Amy Steele is an ideal heroine. As far as females go, she is the best heroine in the series. She just seems like a woman you can hang and chill with, somebody normal. She is also a top notch actress. I'm rather shocked her career didn't take off. It is also a bit of a shame she turned down F13th Part III. I would love to see her come back for a future installment. John Furey is solid as Paul. He's got some great hair, as well as some above average acting chops. His campfire tale always give me chills with the way he does it. Stuart Charno is engagingly goofy as Ted, despite an idiotic laugh. Tom McBride was terrific as the dude in the wheel chair. As a matter of fact...Mark (McBride) & Vickie (Lauren Marie-Taylor) had a cute romance. It is one of the rare times where I felt sad when a couple of characters died. The way Mark dies is rather nasty. The finale is by far the most memorable thing about this movie. It is highly suspenseful with some great boo scares, and excellent psychology (I loved when Ginny acts as Jason's Mom, sweater and all). The scene of Jason crashing through the window, unmasked is legendary. My only complaint is that it runs a tad too long, and the ending has too many loose ends. Paul disappears with no proper explanation. We aren't really sure if he's dead or not, despite that he's presumed dead. It was far too ambiguous for my liking. There were rumors that John Furley (Paul) got heated, and left before filming finished, but that was said to be debunked. Whatever the case is, it kind of tarnishes the ending a bit. Final Thoughts I do like this movie. It is enjoyable in an 80's slasher type way, but it's one of the weakest films in the series. The average first half, and the ending kind of hinder the overall impact. There is still plenty of things to enjoy about it, though. If you're a slasher fan or a F13th fan, you will more than likely find things to enjoy. If nothing else, it did give us a classic heroine in Ginny!6.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2014","score":"","review":" The survivor of the original, Alice Hardy is doing some much needed decompressing after the traumatic shock she went through in the original from beheading Jason's mother.

While he is waiting for his wife in her office at her work place, a group of terrorists come in and holds everyone hostage. The hostages make a few demands, but while the police and FBI are outside trying to negotiate their way in, the terrorists are trying to break into a vault that holds a lot of money. John is on his own in there, picking them all off one by one while he tries to save his wife and the rest of the hostages.This is a blast from the past for me. I watched this a lot when I was a kid. The action is awesome&#x85; this really is one of Bruce Willis' best movies.The film is full of funny catchphrases that is quoted every day. I love the language they use in this film. Hans Gruber is the bad guy, he is from Germany and his accent is brilliant. I love the attitude that John has all the way through this film. He makes me laugh at times, but also angry. It is a good combination. His sarcasm at times really makes the film better.The relationship he has with Sgt. Powell is brilliant. I love the fact that the contact he has with the outside world was with one cop. They form a nice bond and a friendship even though they have never met. It is a nice moment when they do finally meet at the end of the movie.The action scenes were epic back then too. The film was made in 1988, and the explosions and gun fights were great. The other thing I liked about this film was the fact there were explosions, gun fights and even fist fights. During the fist fights, the good guy got his butt kicked too&#x85; it was good at the time because he was losing so badly that you really didn't know if he could beat them all.The effects were questionable in places. Some of the explosions didn't look too real, but then others looked brilliant.The casting was fantastic. Bruce Willis in his most famous role. He will always be remembered for being John McClane. He was great. Bonnie Bedelia as his wife Holly was also really well chosen. She had great 80s hair back then, but it suited her and the time. She is a great actress, especially in this movie. Reginald VelJohnson played his friend Sgt Powell. I recognize Reginald from a few films. He always has a very friendly smile and seems like a guy you would like straight away. He is a good actor. Alan Rickman played the leader of the terrorists, Hans Gruber. This was the perfect role for Alan. He is really good at playing slimy, scary characters. Other cast members were William Atherton (another actor who is great at playing slimeballs), Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush.This is such a classic movie and should be seen by everyone. There have been 4 sequels to this movie so far and there are some great films amongst them, but they will never top the original&#x85; although I do love part 3 as much as this one.I will give this film 8 out of 10.Welcome to the party pal!For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 January 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" DIE HARDHell yeah!This film is about a cop from New York, named John, that is spending Christmas with his estranged wife and kids.

The action is awesome&#x85; this really is one of Bruce Willis' best movies.The film is full of funny catchphrases that is quoted every day. I love the language they use in this film. Hans Gruber is the bad guy, he is from Germany and his accent is brilliant. I love the attitude that John has all the way through this film. He makes me laugh at times, but also angry. It is a good combination. His sarcasm at times really makes the film better.The relationship he has with Sgt. Powell is brilliant. I love the fact that the contact he has with the outside world was with one cop. They form a nice bond and a friendship even though they have never met. It is a nice moment when they do finally meet at the end of the movie.The action scenes were epic back then too. The film was made in 1988, and the explosions and gun fights were great. The other thing I liked about this film was the fact there were explosions, gun fights and even fist fights. During the fist fights, the good guy got his butt kicked too&#x85; it was good at the time because he was losing so badly that you really didn't know if he could beat them all.The effects were questionable in places. Some of the explosions didn't look too real, but then others looked brilliant.The casting was fantastic. Bruce Willis in his most famous role. He will always be remembered for being John McClane. He was great. Bonnie Bedelia as his wife Holly was also really well chosen. She had great 80s hair back then, but it suited her and the time. She is a great actress, especially in this movie. Reginald VelJohnson played his friend Sgt Powell. I recognize Reginald from a few films. He always has a very friendly smile and seems like a guy you would like straight away. He is a good actor. Alan Rickman played the leader of the terrorists, Hans Gruber. This was the perfect role for Alan. He is really good at playing slimy, scary characters. Other cast members were William Atherton (another actor who is great at playing slimeballs), Robert Davi and Grand L. Bush.This is such a classic movie and should be seen by everyone.

Ray refuses to be associated with Trent any longer, and turns him in. Ray is presently an outsider, living in Miami Florida, doing odd jobs here and there. May Munro has secretive phone calls with Ray about bombing the Leons, Tomas & Joe. May witnessed the Leons kill her parents as a child from the closet of her room. Ray initially declines the offer, but his outlook changes when Ned Trent is working with the Leons. Ostensibly, the script for The Specalist was passed around a bit. Steven Seagal was offered the lead role, but turned it down when they wouldn't pay him 9 million. Stallone refused the lead part as well at first, but was goaded into it after a while. I'm glad Seagal turned the part down. He didn't fit the description for Ray Quick. In all honesty? Stallone should have gone with his first instinct, and said no to this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Sylvester Stallone, but i'd be lying if I said he hasn't made some forgettable stinkers in his career. After a suspenseful opening with Stallone & James Woods at their absolute best, this goes down the toilet rather quickly. For starters, it's WAY too talky. Instead of infusing it with action like they should have, they fill it with plenty of uninteresting dialog. The only action we get are some dull explosions, and an amusing action sequence that involves Sly, kicking some ass on a bus to defend an old woman's honor. There is also plenty of steamy flirting with Stallone & Stone on the phone if that interests you, as well as some awkward love-making. Sylvester Stallone can peel a potato for three hours, and I would still be entertained. He sleepwalks through a lot of this film, and looks rather indifferent. There are a few scenes where we get the patented Stallone charisma, but he just looked bored. It is hard to take his character seriously when he has a cat named Timer (!) It wasn't a bad performance by any means, just rather ordinary for him. Sharon Stone gives the best performance in the film (Not by much) with her sexy showcase. I thought she elevated this film with her presence alone. James Woods gives it 100%, and I have to commend him for it. Not many people go nuts like Woods does. I love the guy. Eric Roberts is decent for the most part. He had some good intensity, but his part felt phony. Rod Steiger embarrasses himself with his hammy performance.

There is the unnecessary subplot of an American aviator and his interned Japanese\/American girlfriend, which serves as nothing more than a gratuitous distraction. Limits in 1976 technology forced the use of cheap-looking special effects and recycled footage from other movies and war footage, often resulting in incorrect historical portrayals of the ships and aircraft present. Some historical plot details were omitted or glossed over entirely, mostly due to production and budget limits. And the acting was uneven, and in a few parts pretty bad, and sometimes failed to realistically portray a few figures.But there are few war movies that can generate as much excitement in me to this day like this one. I first saw this movie as a two-part NBC Movie of the Week when I was ten years old and instantly developed a passion for the Battle of Midway and WWII military history in general. The climatic scene of the dive bombers pounding the Japanese carriers into wrecks still gives me goosebumps thirty-five years later, as does the horror of watching a young fighter pilot nearly burn to death in his plane. The John Williams score was fantastic, as it was in many movies, and kept the sense of drama on the edge. And for me, the standout performances were by Henry Fonda as Admiral Nimitz, Glenn Ford as Admiral Spruance, and James Shigeta as Admiral Nagumo. Fonda brought to life Nimitz's cool but tough demeanor, and his willingness to take calculated risks based on his intelligence sources, rather than play it safe and guard what he has left. Ford played Spruance well as a calm, cerebral admiral that plays by his own instincts rather than the way the man he replaced (Halsey) would've played it. And I enjoyed Shigeta's portrayal of Nagumo as a leader who, despite his perceived material superiority, is wary of the lack of intelligence and communication regarding the whereabouts of the American fleet, and the uncertainty of what really may be waiting for his carriers as he undertakes his mission.It's real easy to pick apart the historical details of this movie, especially given more recent information and sources that weren't available back in 1976. But even allowing for that, the movie stays mostly true to history. And to those who aren't looking to nitpick details and just want to enjoy the story being told, there's more than enough wow in this movie even almost forty years later. I would recommend it as a primer for young kids (but not too young, there is some blood, language, and tense scenes) with an interest in military and WWII history that hasn't yet researched more comprehensive works written like Walter Lord's Incredible Victory, Gordon Prange's Miracle at Midway, and Anthony Tully\/Jonathan Parshall's Shattered Sword.I would like to see Hollywood do another adaptation of the battle of Midway someday, but am fearful of them turning it turning into another Pearl Harbor, or becoming a political statement rather than the retelling of an incredible true story. Until that day comes, this one will have to do. And it does surprisingly well, if you can tolerate the flaws and just enjoy the show.

Life after the terrorist attack on the Nakatomi building has not been better for Detective McClane. He is happy with his wife, his job is going well and he is happy&#x85; but when he goes to the airport to pick his wife up, things just don't seem right. John sees a couple of men looking very suspicious when police officers walk past them&#x85; little does John know that following them would mean that he is stumbling across a big terrorist takeover at the airport. It is now down to John again to stop the terrorists that plan on crashing a lot of planes to get what they want.This film is a good movie&#x85; but nowhere near as good as the original. It is a lot of fun, but it is a hell of a coincidence that John just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time&#x85; again!The action in this movie is great. Again, like the first film there are some great fighting scenes and shoot ups. The explosions are not very realistic. You can see that a lot of them are pasted onto the backgrounds with computers&#x85; especially the scene where John uses an ejector seat to get out of a plane that is about to explode. It looks bad&#x85; but I can imagine that back in 1990 when the movie was made it looked great. I still like the bad effects though to be honest. It gives it a nice retro feel to the movie.The acting is as good as the first film with a lot of characters making the crossover from the original. Bruce Willis returns as John, his wife is again played by Bonnie Bedelia. William Atherton is also back as the slimy reporter&#x85; and yes, he is as annoying in this as he was in the first. Reginald VelJohnson makes a nice little cameo as Johns partner from the first film, Al. And we have some new cast members for the sequel. William Sadler plays the main villain Col. Stewart. William is an evil looking bloke. He does a great job as a bad guy. He has a very cold stare. John Amos also has a great role in this film as the take no prisoners soldier Maj. Grant. John does a great job. I mainly know John from Coming to America where he is so funny&#x85; but in this he plays a bad ass that takes no trouble. He does it very well and is one of my favourite characters in the film.There are some classic comedy lines in this film, again mimicking the original&#x85; and Bruce says his catchphrase right at the end&#x85; let's face it though, everyone is waiting for him to say Yippie-Kai-Yay, Mother fu&#x85;&#x85; and when he says it, you can't help but smile. The other thing I like about his character is no matter how much trouble he is in, he always seems to manage to be funny. His sarcasm is brilliant.The film is again set at Christmas time, which makes it feel like a Christmas movie even though you don't get to see Santa anywhere. Why does John always get himself in this kind of trouble at this time of year? The good news is in Die Hard 3, it is the summer time.This is a worthy sequel and is a great addition to the franchise. If you liked the first one then you should like this one.I will give this film 7 out of 10.And where do we get those big portable lights?

Why does John always get himself in this kind of trouble at this time of year? The good news is in Die Hard 3, it is the summer time.This is a worthy sequel and is a great addition to the franchise.

Life after the terrorist attack on the Nakatomi building has not been better for Detective McClane. He is happy with his wife, his job is going well and he is happy&#x85; but when he goes to the airport to pick his wife up, things just don't seem right. John sees a couple of men looking very suspicious when police officers walk past them&#x85; little does John know that following them would mean that he is stumbling across a big terrorist takeover at the airport. It is now down to John again to stop the terrorists that plan on crashing a lot of planes to get what they want.This film is a good movie&#x85; but nowhere near as good as the original. It is a lot of fun, but it is a hell of a coincidence that John just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time&#x85; again!The action in this movie is great. Again, like the first film there are some great fighting scenes and shoot ups. The explosions are not very realistic. You can see that a lot of them are pasted onto the backgrounds with computers&#x85; especially the scene where John uses an ejector seat to get out of a plane that is about to explode. It looks bad&#x85; but I can imagine that back in 1990 when the movie was made it looked great. I still like the bad effects though to be honest. It gives it a nice retro feel to the movie.The acting is as good as the first film with a lot of characters making the crossover from the original. Bruce Willis returns as John, his wife is again played by Bonnie Bedelia. William Atherton is also back as the slimy reporter&#x85; and yes, he is as annoying in this as he was in the first. Reginald VelJohnson makes a nice little cameo as Johns partner from the first film, Al. And we have some new cast members for the sequel. William Sadler plays the main villain Col. Stewart. William is an evil looking bloke. He does a great job as a bad guy. He has a very cold stare. John Amos also has a great role in this film as the take no prisoners soldier Maj. Grant.

Unfortunately, this movie can't decide on that. The story follows a mother and daughter who professionalize in being con artists. Their specialty - seducing, marrying and divorcing men into giving them the majority of their money. This would be funny if the film's main characters had focused on a man they had dealt with in the past but no. They decide to take on the everyday guy just for the sake of getting quick money. This is not how it should be done. This should be a revenge comedy against one man, not the entire gender universally.What's even more astonishing is the wide scale range that the casting department chose for their actors. The mother and daughter are played by Sigourney Weaver (the Alien (1979) franchise) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)) respectively. There's Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry (1992)), Jason Lee (who would later play Syndrome in The Incredibles (2004)), Jeffrey Jones from Beetlejuice (1988), Gene Hackman from Superman (1978), Zach Galifianakis (from the Hangover (2009) franchise) and even Carrie Fisher from Star Wars (1977) is acting in here. How could such a large cast of good actors still make such an average film?In fact, a lot of these actors' scenes are wasted because they are similar to other characters they have played. Weaver is probably the most complex but also the character with the on-off conscious. Hewitt plays the confused girl not knowing what to think of her emotions. Liotta continues to play his usual violent egomaniac, although there is a scene where he even grows a conscious (briefly); that scene I enjoyed the most. And Jason Lee just plays the clueless cutie boy who has no idea what's going on around him. As for the rest of the cast mentioned before, they really do have wasted scenes. None of them are funny scenes either.It just doesn't make sense. You have director David Mirkin, who has worked with comedies before like The Simpsons (1989) and the same name titled movie of 2007. Maybe it's his lack of directing features that pass 30 minutes. He's only released one other theatrical film, maybe he wasn't ready? And how come three writers couldn't form a more consistent plot. So much of it is back and forth between what is right and wrong which becomes tiresome. It will make people want to tell the characters to make a decision already. And it's not like they couldn't make a good script. Two of these writers were apart of Liar Liar (1997) which many people consider a good movie (speaking of which that that movie was also related to lying). Hmmm.Anyway, so it's not easy to say who is the weak link here. John Debney's music was OK. It had goofy tunes, which did alright in helping the scenes, but still didn't help the consistency of the tone. The comedy was also very bland. The main actors don't give much charm to their characters. Sure they dress up and talk like other people but that doesn't always make them funny. Some viewers may also find it sexist of how it portrays both genders. Men are lustful and dumb, while women are seductive and calculative. Then again, it can also be taken as an empowering portrayal. It really depends on what the audience wants to see. I for one found nothing of either side except an average comedy that had a little promise but didn't accomplish much.For a comedy with such a strong cast, it seems like this could have audiences laugh a lot.

Furthermore, he realises he also has the power to change the future.This Stephen King adaption was one of the most mainstream efforts from Canadian director David Cronenberg. After the problems he experienced with the release of his previous film Videodrome, Cronenberg decided to be a director for hire for his next feature and in the process relinquished writing duties, while reigning in his more visceral tendencies. He wanted to just get a film out there without the problematic distribution issues he had with his previous film. Adapting a King novel was just the ticket as far as that was concerned, as at the time King was probably the most popular author on the planet. So, unsurprisingly, The Dead Zone, while admittedly more of a sleeper than a smash hit, did a lot better business than Videodrome and it gave Cronenberg more commercial leverage. It's a much more watered down Cronenberg film in fairness, much less personal. Nevertheless, it is still noticeably a fusion of Cronenberg and King. Because while it is true to the ideas of the writer, it has aspects of the director as well, such as the cold Canadian setting (despite being set in the USA it was filmed in Canada), the way that the psychic phenomena is dealt with in a serious way and the idea of a man trapped in a body that is changing uncontrollably.Christopher Walken is excellent in the lead role. He contributes a huge amount in what is a fairly in-depth character. At its heart, the Dead Zone is, after all, a sad story about a man who suffers loss in a very unusual way. It looks at how he copes with waking up from a coma to find everything has changed and also with the manner in which his strange powers are a curse to him. Walken really gets to the heart of this character and is the emotional core of the film. The cast generally, is a better one than Cronenberg had been used to. The larger budget meant that we also have Herbert Lom as Walken's doctor, an understated Tom Skerritt as a policeman and an over-the-top Martin Sheen as a corrupt politician.It's a far less visceral film than any of Cronenberg's earlier work and, for me, less interesting overall. The supernatural plot-line is not something you would associate with the director who always goes for a more science fiction based approach, although the film often feels more sci-fi than supernatural as a result of Cronenberg's overall approach. It is sometimes quite inventive visually though, particularly the vision sequences. Walken finds himself in the scene itself as he observes it, which lends a strange dream-like tone which works really well. The plot is made up of several self-contained parts within an overall whole. The best was the murder investigation sub-plot which was quite chilling and could have been expanded if anything, while the least effective for me was the final part involving the corrupt politician. Sheen is too one-dimensionally evil and clichéd a character for this movie and the whole sequence of him initiating nuclear war seemed strangely poorly done. But this criticism aside, The Dead Zone still remains a quality 80's sci-fi thriller. It lacks the sheer originality and directness of Cronenberg's best work but by most other directors standards it's a pretty good one.

After apprehending him, Archer finds out that there's still a bomb threat, and with time running out and with no other alternatives, he decides to undergo a crazy procedure that will allow him to wear Troy's face and masquerade as him to get the info from his brother.

It helps that both actors are pretty over-the-top to begin with, and it gets even better when you see Travolta doing the best Nicolas Cage impersonation you'll ever see.The action is just as awesome as you'd expect from a John Woo film, with improbable explosions and guns with seemingly infinite ammo all around. The biggest problem I had with the movie is that the lead-up to killing Troy-as-Archer is really, REALLY long. There's a Mexican standoff, a church shootout, a hostage scene, a boat chase, it goes on and on and on, though it does lead to an awesome explosion and unconvincing stunt doubles.

When a main character has a pregnancy scare, she responds not with self-pity but with defiant independence. That arc leaves her a little deeper, a little wiser than before, but no less lighthearted. The principle romantic pair, played by John Travolta (good actor, lousy singer) and Olivia Newton-John (the inverse) are often kept apart by the artificial social barriers of high school, and they each do the silliest things to try to change for each other, but at no point does anyone act as if any valuable lessons have been learned. In another movie about pseudo-rebellious greasers, like Rebel Without a Cause, the car race scene in the final third would have resulted in a shocking death that changes everything; not here, because Grease is smart enough to know what kind of movie it is. It's just fun-loving, winking nostalgia. The final number has all of the characters, even the ones who never got along, declare that they will be together forever. The audience knows that they won't, because life doesn't work like that, and the movie knows that we know, so spelling it out would be pointless. In addition to the pop songs and fun plot, Grease is kept fresh by well-drawn, instantly-iconic supporting characters like Rizzo and Frenchy.

The principle romantic pair, played by John Travolta (good actor, lousy singer) and Olivia Newton-John (the inverse) are often kept apart by the artificial social barriers of high school, and they each do the silliest things to try to change for each other, but at no point does anyone act as if any valuable lessons have been learned.
