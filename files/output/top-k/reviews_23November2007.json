It has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. The straight man deciding to be gay and the gay man Deciding to be straight I did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes, after that i got really offended. As what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles. The leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. All the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not. Unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos.

I've never seen an instant vampire and in this movie, maybe this was for the microwave generation, Kaleb was a vampire in 1 hour or less. At the end of the movie I was wondering what the heck the movie was about and struggling to make sense of the story. There were several great actors (Tim Thomerson, Lance Henrickson, and Bill Paxton); however, I don't think they had a chance to give this movie the nitrous boost it so desperately needed. I'm used to watching movies for college classes and then I would write comments and papers for my college classes. This movie started out OK, picked up tempo and then just went down hill.This was my take on the movie A nice cowboy (Kaleb) meets an intriguing country girl (Maggie). She bites him a little and he's instantly a vampire (he begins smoking as the sun comes up within an hour).Maggie's vampire group\/family pulls him into their RV and they drive off. Kaleb's father, played by Tim Thomerson (the reason I watched the movie), sees his son being abducted as does Kaleb's sister Sarah.Kaleb is taken on a road trip. He cannot kill. Maggie feeds him. The group threatens to kill him unless he kills someone.Kaleb's father and sister find him.Kaleb goes home, his father gives him a transfusion and he's healed. Maggie comes to Kaleb's home.

On WGN Superstation on Thanksgiving Evening via DISH Network. Bad effects supported by awful sound quality. We had to turn off the sub-woofer because every footstep and bump gave us a headache and the blaring hiss blurred much of the dialog. We have a top of the line sound system that this movie made sound like garbageMan this was a massive yawn with everyone above the age of 10.We watched on Thanksgiving last night. We all found ourselves making fun of the botched continuity,annoying product endorsements (Coke and McDonalds), the stupidity of Patch, and the totally lame, lame, lame dialog.Most noticeable continuity goof Pay attention to the Coke can when Corny gives Joe dinner. DVR settles all arguments about this one. How does that Coke can spin around? It is so noticeable b\/c the initial shot of the can is so obviously a paid product endorsement. The second shot is obviously not so well thought out. This was noticed (loudly) by our resident teenager with the drama experience and counted as the greatest laugh of the evening as we jumped back and forth with the DVR with coke can spinning....Even our 10 year old daughter thought it was just OK and she says she still believes in Santa. But she didn't believe that Sanda was so stupid as to give Patch the assistant job after he makes out a bunch of broken toys... and why doesn't anyone notice how messed up they are b\/4 they are delivered? Didn't anyone notice the missing nuts on the wheels? Not in this Maybe an OK movie for little kids, who don't see the obvious faults. Rent the Polar Express instead.
