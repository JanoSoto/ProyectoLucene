[{"date":"22 September 2002","score":"","review":"  The movie Election was one of the funniest and most clever movies I have seen. With a great cast and wonderful acting, this movie about a high school election gone wrong has combined humor, intelligence, and real life situations that the viewer can relate to relay its main messages to the viewer. Election seems to capture certain realities of teen life in the early to mid 1990s fairly well. For example, not everything is perfect in any teenager's life, and each teen has his or her own issues and problems that they are dealing with; Tammy is fighting for acceptance in school, and in finding a companion. In addition, the affairs that take place throughout the movie are becoming increasingly common these days, even between students and teachers. Finally, everyone has wanted something so badly they could almost taste it, and although the viewer may not want to understand Tracy and her motives, one can put themselves in her shoes and feel sympathy for her. The main message that Election seem to convey to its audience is that you cannot always get what you want and therefore, you should not try to interfere with what is going to ultimately result. Take for example, Mr. McAllister's affair with Diane, as well as his interference with the election results. As Tracy stated in the beginning of the movie, interfering will only make things worse. Overall, Election was a worthwhile movie that provides comic relief and aunique technique of allowing the viewer to see inside the character's psyche by giving each of them a voiceover; this is why I give Election 8 stars out of 10.

However with the 1999 film, Boys Don't Cry, it has been hard to do so. I do like it, but it does push the limit to what I like in a movie. Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon, whichever name you want to call this character, was incredible on two fronts. One, on how she kept up the appearance of being a man to the public where she was living, and two, how she still handled the issues of being a woman. This is one of the most confronting, disturbing and brilliant movies of our time.This is true story about Brandon Teena, a person whose living a very complex and dysfunctional life. While everything seems normal on outside, with this extremely charming man, all is not as it seems. Brandon suffers from S.I.C (Sexual Identity Crisis). Nebraska's newest citizen is hiding a deep dark secret. From middle America emerged an extraordinary double life, a complicated love story and a crime that would shatter the heartland for many years.Considering that an independent filmmaker made this film, I still found that it was a very professional one. The director, Kimberly Peirce, did a grand job in bring this to the screen. I am certain that the deep research that would have been needed, was one of the big reasons to the success of this film. I like the way that Peirce shot the film, in a quick paced sort of a way, as if Brandon was on some sort of a rollercoaster that he could not control. Then in a very subtle way would slow certain scenes to hold a very long-lasting affect on the audience. The cinematographer also does a good job of projecting what the director wants us to see. This task was left to Jim Denault. The script was very good to this film. I am sure that all the characters as they were written for in the bigscreen, would have behaved just like this in real life. This again is to the credit of Peirce and her co writer, Andy Bienen.Then the cast that this film had was an extraordinary one. There is not much you can criticize about Hilary Swank's role. It was perfect, and she thoroughly deserved the Academy Award for her work. Her role is a fitting tribute to the life of Brandon Teena. I remember Swank saying that she had to physically live like a man for a certain amount of time, so she could capture who Brandon Teena was. In fact Swank does scrub up pretty well, and was a good choice to play a man. I also like Swank's role in the 1994 movie, The next Karate Kid.I also liked the role of Lana, played by Chloë Sevigny. She was Brandon's onscreen girlfriend. Now from where I see it, this role was the pivotal one for the whole movie, as it gave an insight into how Brandon could pick up nice girls. I really liked the onscreen chemistry between both Swank and Sevigny. The actors who also played the bad men, John Lotter and Tom Nissen, Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III, scarily resemble their real life characters. While their roles were disturbing, I like how they were performed.This movie has some gruesome scenes attached to it. However they gave an accurate portrayal of what really happened. I enjoyed the scenes where Brandon is going out into the world as a man, trying to pick up the girls that he likes. It is amazing how he got away with being a man to so many girls for so long. Then take the hardy scenes to the film. Scenes such as the discovery of Brandon being a girl, as both Lotter and Nissen violate her civil rights. Then there is the vile rape scene, which is cleverly interweaved with the sheriff's harsh integration of Brandon, when he continually pushes Brandon to admit that he was sexually assaulted. Then I would have to say the murder of Teena is one of the most horrible pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Imagining being in such a situation is a sickening thought. All these scenes are brilliantly written and acted in my mind.From where I see it, people such as Brandon Teena, did not deserve to be treated in such a harsh way, by either her murderers or the law enforcers. It is no wonder that such movements as the Gay rights activists and 'the transsexual menace', use Teena's name to help fight for justice for transsexuals and people who suffer S.I.C (Sexual Identity Crisis). If Brandon was given a little help and support, perhaps s\\he might still be alive today. I hope that if I was to meet characters like Brandon that I would not be quick to judge them, but instead help treat their problem and accept them into the community. Remember they are still human beings, whether they think they are a man or a woman.I can understand that some people might not like some of the content that is in this movie, but I question if people simply hate the entire film. What were you expecting to see, a 'feel good' movie? This film was not that, in fact it was quite the opposite. Well I feel this is a brilliant film, with a tremendously talented cast. It also handles a delicate situation with 'gritty' class. It is a remarkable role from Swank, considering she was once 'the next karate kid', and then became the girl who lived her life as a man, a life that was not only foolish, but extremely dangerous. This film will shake you up, in a way that only it can.

Please, watch it, appreciate it and learn from it.Brandon Teena (Teena Brandon) 1972 -1993CMRS gives 'Boys Don't Cry 5 (Brilliant Film)  ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"22 September 2002","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  I usually like to promote good, true story films. However with the 1999 film, Boys Don't Cry, it has been hard to do so. I do like it, but it does push the limit to what I like in a movie. Brandon Teena or Teena Brandon, whichever name you want to call this character, was incredible on two fronts. One, on how she kept up the appearance of being a man to the public where she was living, and two, how she still handled the issues of being a woman. This is one of the most confronting, disturbing and brilliant movies of our time.This is true story about Brandon Teena, a person whose living a very complex and dysfunctional life. While everything seems normal on outside, with this extremely charming man, all is not as it seems. Brandon suffers from S.I.C (Sexual Identity Crisis). Nebraska's newest citizen is hiding a deep dark secret. From middle America emerged an extraordinary double life, a complicated love story and a crime that would shatter the heartland for many years.Considering that an independent filmmaker made this film, I still found that it was a very professional one. The director, Kimberly Peirce, did a grand job in bring this to the screen. I am certain that the deep research that would have been needed, was one of the big reasons to the success of this film. I like the way that Peirce shot the film, in a quick paced sort of a way, as if Brandon was on some sort of a rollercoaster that he could not control. Then in a very subtle way would slow certain scenes to hold a very long-lasting affect on the audience. The cinematographer also does a good job of projecting what the director wants us to see. This task was left to Jim Denault. The script was very good to this film. I am sure that all the characters as they were written for in the bigscreen, would have behaved just like this in real life. This again is to the credit of Peirce and her co writer, Andy Bienen.Then the cast that this film had was an extraordinary one. There is not much you can criticize about Hilary Swank's role. It was perfect, and she thoroughly deserved the Academy Award for her work. Her role is a fitting tribute to the life of Brandon Teena. I remember Swank saying that she had to physically live like a man for a certain amount of time, so she could capture who Brandon Teena was. In fact Swank does scrub up pretty well, and was a good choice to play a man. I also like Swank's role in the 1994 movie, The next Karate Kid.I also liked the role of Lana, played by Chloë Sevigny. She was Brandon's onscreen girlfriend. Now from where I see it, this role was the pivotal one for the whole movie, as it gave an insight into how Brandon could pick up nice girls. I really liked the onscreen chemistry between both Swank and Sevigny. The actors who also played the bad men, John Lotter and Tom Nissen, Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III, scarily resemble their real life characters. While their roles were disturbing, I like how they were performed.This movie has some gruesome scenes attached to it. However they gave an accurate portrayal of what really happened. I enjoyed the scenes where Brandon is going out into the world as a man, trying to pick up the girls that he likes. It is amazing how he got away with being a man to so many girls for so long. Then take the hardy scenes to the film. Scenes such as the discovery of Brandon being a girl, as both Lotter and Nissen violate her civil rights. Then there is the vile rape scene, which is cleverly interweaved with the sheriff's harsh integration of Brandon, when he continually pushes Brandon to admit that he was sexually assaulted. Then I would have to say the murder of Teena is one of the most horrible pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Imagining being in such a situation is a sickening thought. All these scenes are brilliantly written and acted in my mind.From where I see it, people such as Brandon Teena, did not deserve to be treated in such a harsh way, by either her murderers or the law enforcers.

The wins are the performances by the entire cast, especially good are Peter Sarsgaard and Vincent D'Onofrio, who play the roles with a chameleon honesty that is carefully and skillfully done. Val Kilmer gives his standard good performance-- he plays everything casual in this movie, and as a result, you believe his character and believe in his character. Plus, Val Kilmer's casual is always entertaining.Another win in this movie is the overall look, it does draw upon an impractically swank Meth scene and the usual noir crime coloring, but it's presented in a way that's honest and enjoyable. Also, director Caruso makes his environment a character as well, so you never feel there's a want of anything to see in the film.This is where the wins become hazy. The screenplay is interesting. On premise and basic plot structure, it's excellent (although you get the feeling it was heavily influenced by The Usual Suspects) and compelling as a crime suspense film. In execution, it's a little fumbled and therefore lacking in dramatic punch and so the premise and well, beauty, is lost. Screenwriter Tom Gayton has some great ideas, all he has do is learn how to communicate them to their fullest potential.The direction is also troublesome. I think Caruso bit off a little more than he could chew, and although I think he'll go on to do great things, he should have passed the torch on this one. Although there were moments when his vision was perfect, on the whole, it just wasn't there.The Salton Sea is a good movie, the problem was, it could have been a great movie. It's worth seeing just for the ensemble acting and the production design of the film, as well as some funny and great scenes. However, don't walk in expecting a great suspense film, because the film will not give you that.My bet is that if we're all still here in 2025, this film will be remade into a great film. Until then, enjoy what it does offer and try, while watching, to forget about what it could have been.

It's always portrayed in a way that doesn't make the characters look real smart but doesn't make them look like idiots either, more like average people.The main character Megan Bloomton (Natasha Lyonne) is a typical high school girl on the cheerleader squad.

During their makeout sessions Megan is fantasizing about the girls on the Cheerleader Squad which is more understood when you see him kiss.

Megan's first day at rehab she meets the folks at the rehab house that have already taken the first step in the program Admitting they're a homosexual  Megan is reluctant to admit she has homosexual tendencies but after a short confrontation in front of the group she breaks down, cries and admits I'm a Homo which is a classic scene in itself.

Hilary Vandermuller (Melanie Lynskey) who initially shows Megan around the rehab center is still much attracted to women.  One night Graham decides to sneak out and go to the local gay bar (The Cocksucker) and has several others going with her, Megan is talked into going with them at the last minute.  At the gay bar while Graham is dancing with another girl and starts getting intimate with her is when Megan realizes she is attracted to Graham.The whole setting of the Rehab center revolves on very traditional sexual roles such as the mans role in fixing the car, chopping wood and making the proper male crotch adjustments.  Of course the women's roles in taking care of the baby, vacuuming the house and cooking.  The use of Blue and Pink are used to separate the genders and role playing is part of the course.In the end Megan & Graham find out who they are and come to terms with just being who they are regardless of the consequences, although Megan's father at the end gets help to come to terms of his daughter being homosexual.There is not one single part of the movie that is supposed to be taken seriously and like Sugar & Spice it is just a movie for the fun of it. I really enjoyed this movie and also liked many of the songs.The music in this movie was very upbeat and emotional at times.  It's too bad there was no soundtrack released, I had to spend a pretty penny to get Chick Habit..April March,  Trailer Song..Sissy Bar,  If You Should Try To Kiss Her..Dressy Bessy,  Ray of Sunshine..Go Sailor,  Together Forever In Love..Go Sailor,  Glass Vase, Cello Case..Tattle Tale and then had to compile them on one CD so I could easily hear them in one sitting without using 5 CD's, what a pain.I think this is a very good movie and I enjoyed the music.

The use of Blue and Pink are used to separate the genders and role playing is part of the course.In the end Megan & Graham find out who they are and come to terms with just being who they are regardless of the consequences, although Megan's father at the end gets help to come to terms of his daughter being homosexual.There is not one single part of the movie that is supposed to be taken seriously and like Sugar & Spice it is just a movie for the fun of it. I really enjoyed this movie and also liked many of the songs.The music in this movie was very upbeat and emotional at times.  It's too bad there was no soundtrack released, I had to spend a pretty penny to get Chick Habit..April March,  Trailer Song..Sissy Bar,  If You Should Try To Kiss Her..Dressy Bessy,  Ray of Sunshine..Go Sailor,  Together Forever In Love..Go Sailor,  Glass Vase, Cello Case..Tattle Tale and then had to compile them on one CD so I could easily hear them in one sitting without using 5 CD's, what a pain.I think this is a very good movie and I enjoyed the music.  Again, some movies you need to go out to your front porch and set your brain out there and come back for it after you have watched the movie.  This is one of those movies that are for entertainment value only.  If you're the kind of person that feels you need to have redeeming qualities or some philosophical meaning or walk away somehow as a better person from the experience and can't check your brain at the door then this movie will not be for you. For us folks who still have that kid inside us that doesn't need constant reasoning, this movie will be fun.  Besides, it can be nice to give the brain a rest once in awhile.

Maybe it's because I've never read the original Lewis Carrol novels, or because some people take novel translations too seriously. The only other Alice movie I saw was the one aired on NBC in 1999, which also has its share of defense and offense. I liked that one (only because it included a lot of what wasn't used here), but this Disney version has always been my favorite. But then again, many of the original crew who worked on this movie--even Walt Disney himself--hated this movie. I wonder why? Disney usually does a marvelous job of creating quality cartoons & movies. I can see some of what got people ticked off, but if the characters in Alice in Wonderland were so unlikeable (the major gripe of many viewers), how did Disney let it be so? Perhaps given the amount of time they put into making this film (about 10 years, excluding the WWII Era), the Disney artists could only do so much before wearily going with one thing, and seeing what happens.This film is somewhat different from most Disney movies. Alice is the only true hero, two characters (Alice's sister and Dinah) barely make their mark in the story, and practically every character Alice meets in Wonderland are real psychos, whom by the end of the story, are all against her (a million to one). But just about all of the characters (even Alice herself) were having mood swings. A few of those whom Alice encountered were doing such things as to entertain her, while others were either doing things to persecute her, get her in trouble, or just tick her off. I can see (to an extent) why Alice was the unhappy camper on some levels, because she didn't get the wonderland as she had envisioned, but instead one big nitemare. The whole idea was for Alice to find a way to escape from the boring real-world, then decide between staying with her fantasies, or going back to reality. After all, there's always an equal but opposite reaction for every action.There were numerous shots of Alice sedately giving attention to some of the characters' strange habits, rather than enjoying her trip, and others in where she was either mad or sad to be the main passive victim in the story. This all led up to a scene in where Alice begins her trek home, and leads a melancholy moment when she gets lost in the Tulgey Woods. Things didn't get much better for her when she met the Queen of Hearts...All of the characters were individually twisted, but most were strangely funny. The Tweedle brothers' story of the Walrus and the Carpenter was pretty weird (as were the bros themselves), and the flowers seemed friendly at first, but when they realized that Alice wasn't a flower, they instantly turn on her (notice how the Rose didn't do much to help her). The caterpillar was smoking from a hookah (a popular drug reference during the 1970's), and got easily p***ed at anything Alice did to him (such as laughing at his expense when his arms or legs weren't in unison). The Mad Hatter and March Hare both had an unusual way of hosting a tea party (the part where they destroy the White Rabbit's watch was really funny).The Cheshire Cat seemed to be a nuisance the first time, then a brief friend, and later became a troublemaker. The Queen of Hearts was big, fat, ugly, and screamed at almost anything out of line (That must have really put a strain on Verna Felton's voice!), while the King of Hearts was small, meek, and practically powerless (the polar opposite). There was also a ton of other strange characters taking unexplained hostility towards Alice, but I found most of those incidents to be the main vein of humor in this film. While many of these characters were unfriendly for the bulk of the film, nothing came to be as scary as did a couple scenes from Pinocchio. But based from this lengthy paragraph, this overload on story structure is probably another reason (along with the twisted character developments) as to why Alice in Wonderland came to be hated by critics, movie-goers, and the Disney crew upon its first release.Two of the more positive things about Alice in Wonderland are the artwork and the music. The background arts are pretty stylish (thanks to Mary Blair), and many designs I didn't catch until just recently seeing the movie again.The character designs and animation are also beautiful. The designs on Alice (the lone protagonist) were an overall visual standout (thanks to the then-teenage Kathryn Beaumont), and the designs of most of the Wonderland characters were great, too. I also liked the animation of the cards heralding the Queen's arrival (excellent choreography & colors). Most of the songs were wonderful, particularly In a Golden Afternoon. These are the two elements that kept some Disney fans' attention to a strange movie, even to this day.Overall, Alice in Wonderland is a good movie, and I can see some of why a lot of people hate it. I just wish that there was more to the real-world frames to the story, as in the time Alice was with her big sister and Dinah. The opening scenes could've used more impact on the main idea, while the closing scenes shouldn't have been so abrupt. During her trip, Alice made several references to Dinah, although the cat's barely visible role was being Alice's best friend. The beginning of Alice's nitemare (when she was chasing the White Rabbit) doesn't get much of a response, but the interesting parts begin once she meets the Doorknob. The ending (when the Queen of Hearts calls Alice to be killed, while every Wonderland character she met turned against her) was what reminded those who hated this movie that it was all a bad dream. More thankfully for everyone, the movie had a happy ending (as per usual for any Disney movie). But as I was saying earlier, there was a lot of what most people hated that I thought was funny, but I too felt that the story need a little more polishing.

All he wanted to do was get his car fixed and now he is tempted to murder but who should he believe? After his car breaks down outside of a small Arizona town called Superior, Bobby is greeted by a group of inept characters including a scheming mechanic, a sexy Latino and her rich husband, a vile tempered cowboy and his childish girlfriend  and a blind, native, Vietnam veteran. Everyone seems to be keeping a secret but no one seems to ever give enough information for us to figure it out, but still, they all have one thing in common, they all want money and will stop at nothing to get it. What follows is a string of sex, lies, deceit, murder, betrayal and oh did I mention sex? After churning out masterpiece after masterpiece, director Oliver Stone should be entitled to a break but who does he really think he was kidding here? Maybe the sun got to him while filming this film noir-ish piece of trash because I can't imagine this appealing to anyone with one shred of integrity in their body. All of Stone's brilliant trademark style is littered through out the film, but Stone, being know as a master of satire and social commentary has us sitting through the entire thing, trying to pick it apart and read between the lines to try to figure out what Stone is really trying to say and we are lead right up to nothing. As the credits rolled I found myself still sitting in front of the screen wondering when the film would begin. I mean it felt like Stone, it looked like Stone, it was even made well enough to be Stone but what it came down to was nothing, nothing at all. Shades of brilliance try to poke their head through, for instance the native character has so very meaningful lines when he gives Bobby the advice that when a man and women get together they kiss and they do it all over again. In fact Jon Voight's  native character is the only person with anything intelligent to say. Sean Penn play his role of Bobby strictly for laughs and the rest of the cast seem to be acting on their day off from shooting their real movies, expect Jennifer Lopez who takes herself so seriously it almost gets to a point where she is a turn off. The film attempts to be humorous  but does Stone really think we will see ignorance as being funny, I sure don't, but then again we must remember that Stone didn't write this script. Going into this film I has no idea of what it was supposed to be about and now I can honestly say that I still have not a clue what it was about. Not because if was confusing but because I didn't know if I was supposed to be picking up some deep message or just sit back and enjoy myself, I don't think either would have been possible. In Natural Born Killers, Stone used disturbing imagery to show us of the dark underworld that reeks inside all of us and lives all around us without even being aware of it. Here he seems to be throwing it in just for the sake of being different. At least I hope that is why it was shot this way because it was anything but suspenseful. Or could it have been that Stone is getting a little cocky and is throwing shooting his movie in a offbeat style so that we will praise this as another work of art that sits up there right next to the likes of Natural Born Killers, Platoon or JFK? Dream on. How are we supposed to feel anything for a poor  sap who is just as down and dirty as the inhabitants of this town that keep hassling him. You could maybe say that the film is trying to show a man who finally, being the victim of his own selfish actions and is learning the harsh effects of greed and how money can be a controlling factor of human emotions, but in the end what does Bobby gain, or more like in the end what do we gain? Even if there is something of importance to be told within this jumbles mess every character is so unreliable that it would probably go unnoticed anyway. Stone's direction here is just as good as it has been in the past, so I don't know why a man of such high calibre talent is puddling around in the kiddie poll when he has already swam with the sharks before. I hope this is not a indication of what is to come from Stone because if it is, the future is bleak.

Shades of brilliance try to poke their head through, for instance the native character has so very meaningful lines when he gives Bobby the advice that when a man and women get together they kiss and they do it all over again. In fact Jon Voight's  native character is the only person with anything intelligent to say. Sean Penn play his role of Bobby strictly for laughs and the rest of the cast seem to be acting on their day off from shooting their real movies, expect Jennifer Lopez who takes herself so seriously it almost gets to a point where she is a turn off. The film attempts to be humorous  but does Stone really think we will see ignorance as being funny, I sure don't, but then again we must remember that Stone didn't write this script. Going into this film I has no idea of what it was supposed to be about and now I can honestly say that I still have not a clue what it was about. Not because if was confusing but because I didn't know if I was supposed to be picking up some deep message or just sit back and enjoy myself, I don't think either would have been possible. In Natural Born Killers, Stone used disturbing imagery to show us of the dark underworld that reeks inside all of us and lives all around us without even being aware of it. Here he seems to be throwing it in just for the sake of being different. At least I hope that is why it was shot this way because it was anything but suspenseful. Or could it have been that Stone is getting a little cocky and is throwing shooting his movie in a offbeat style so that we will praise this as another work of art that sits up there right next to the likes of Natural Born Killers, Platoon or JFK? Dream on. How are we supposed to feel anything for a poor  sap who is just as down and dirty as the inhabitants of this town that keep hassling him. You could maybe say that the film is trying to show a man who finally, being the victim of his own selfish actions and is learning the harsh effects of greed and how money can be a controlling factor of human emotions, but in the end what does Bobby gain, or more like in the end what do we gain? Even if there is something of importance to be told within this jumbles mess every character is so unreliable that it would probably go unnoticed anyway. Stone's direction here is just as good as it has been in the past, so I don't know why a man of such high calibre talent is puddling around in the kiddie poll when he has already swam with the sharks before. I hope this is not a indication of what is to come from Stone because if it is, the future is bleak.

All he wanted to do was get his car fixed and now he is tempted to murder but who should he believe? After his car breaks down outside of a small Arizona town called Superior, Bobby is greeted by a group of inept characters including a scheming mechanic, a sexy Latino and her rich husband, a vile tempered cowboy and his childish girlfriend  and a blind, native, Vietnam veteran. Everyone seems to be keeping a secret but no one seems to ever give enough information for us to figure it out, but still, they all have one thing in common, they all want money and will stop at nothing to get it. What follows is a string of sex, lies, deceit, murder, betrayal and oh did I mention sex? After churning out masterpiece after masterpiece, director Oliver Stone should be entitled to a break but who does he really think he was kidding here? Maybe the sun got to him while filming this film noir-ish piece of trash because I can't imagine this appealing to anyone with one shred of integrity in their body. All of Stone's brilliant trademark style is littered through out the film, but Stone, being know as a master of satire and social commentary has us sitting through the entire thing, trying to pick it apart and read between the lines to try to figure out what Stone is really trying to say and we are lead right up to nothing.

I was specifically looking for this movie, as i had seen it in the store before, and was about to see it until my friend decided that we'd walk out with Joy Ride.  The cover of this movie intrigued me, and lead me to think that it would be a darkly comeidic yet still very scary story about a boy's descent into madness.The Butcher Boy is about an Irish boy, Francie, whose domestic life is miserable.  His dad is always drunk and his mother is mentally unstable.  However, he lets his anger out through his mischevous behavior in the town, particularly directed towards Mrs Nugent and her son, a perfect mother with a perfect son.  Francie is also best friends with Joe, a sensitive kid of whom we get the impression from that he is losing interest in Francie's treatings of others, which are going a bit too far.A lot more happens in The Butcher Boy, but if you don't like what you just got, don't see the movie.  Though it's not slow, Francie's character development seems to drag, and Neil Jordan seems to advance his personality just before we've had enough.  The acting is what makes the movie what it is.  Somebody call Eamonn Owens and give this kid a part in a movie.  He owns the movie, he is the movie.  Words cannot describe how good th' young laddie is at acting as the troubled Francie.  This has to be one of my favorite acting performances of all time, right up there with Jason Schwartzman in Rushmore, and Kiefer Sutherland in Stand By Me.  This kid needs a good role badly.  Everybody else is decent, though i feel that Stephen Rea as Francie's father underplayed the role, and could've added more depth to the character.  The character seemed to be waiting to become lively and three dimensional, but Rea went for the B minus and stopped there.  The butcher boy was not what I expected, and if you're looking for a horror movie about madness, look elsewhere.  If you want a dramatic character study with a child actor better than a million Haley Joel Osments,  this is for you.  It is thought provoking, upsetting, and doesn't beg for it at all.

So I guess it was a little bit boring for those Kidman fans who want the erotic Nicole Kidman of Eyes Wide Shot, with some extra hanky-panky scenes.Generally, the conclusion is that although the movie was in the genre of horror, but it was not for fun or just spending time...  It was a movie which can easily be seen for the second time for more pleasure.  Quite like The Sixth Sense, it must be so interesting to see the movie for the second time from another angle.  Because when you know the end of the story, you go searching for other details.The philosophy of Alejandro Amenabar about life and death, the living and the dead was somehow sarcastic.  And also it should be mentioned that some lines of dialogues were very intelligent (like the ones about the world war and that all English folks are right in their deeds!!).  Such dialogues are not common in movies of this genre.For more sharp gossip lovers,  the attractive part of the credits is Tom Cruise as one of the executive producers!!  No further comment ;)I would give the movie 7 of 10 ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"22 September 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  ***** SPOILERS ***** The front of the DVD case for The Deep End has a quote from an Esquire magazine review which reads Finally, A thriller that actually thrills. I wasn't. The story idea is a good one. Ordinary mother tries to protect son from being implicated for a murder. The problem here is the screen-writers\/directors, Scott McGehee and David Siegel have so many side plots going on it detracts from the main story-line, and because there are so many of these sub-plots going on, they don't devote an appropriate amount of time to any of them. Tilda Swinton (who looks way to young for the part) plays Margaret Hall, a mother of three that lives in a lake house in Southern California, along with her Father-in-law Jack (who seems to be written into the story for one purpose only, which I won't divulge here). The husband, who we never see, is a Navy man who is stationed on the USS Constitution, and we are reminded of this fact by practically every main character of the film. Margaret's son Bo, played by Jonathon Tucker, is a troubled high-school student, involved in a homo-sexual relationship with a nightclub owner named Avery , and the movie begins with Margaret, not knowing how to confront her son about his sexuality, visits the nightclub demanding Avery stay away from her son. One thing leads to another and Avery winds up dead on the grounds of the Hall home and Margaret stumbles onto the body, and she immediately begins to initiate a cover-up to protect Bo from being implicated. This is where the story begins to fail and never recovers. First of all, she puts the body in what has to be the shallowest part of the lake, and the reason for this I can only assume is because she has to go back to the body to retrieve Avery's key's to his Corvette that she must ditch. So naturally, the body is discovered quickly, and almost immediately, Margaret's visited by a hood named Alek, played by Goran Visnjic, demanding $50,000 from Margaret, because that's how much Avery owed him and his partner. He gives her 24 hours to come up with the money or he'll deliver a copy of a video tape of Bo and Avery having sex to the Tahoe police. They set a meet for 4pm the next day (5pm was no good for Margaret because she has to drive her daughter to ballet. Come on now.). Next we see Margaret going through the motions of trying to obtain a 2nd mortgage, calling credit card companies, ad even a half hearted attempt at hitting up her father in law for the money. She's late for the appointment with Alek the next day and he pays her another visit, only to find Margaret attempting to resusitate the father in law who had a heart attack while carrying water cooler bottles. Alek joins in the effort and together they get his heart beaing again. Naturally she doesn't have the money and Alek gives her more time, but begins to sympathize with her plight and the next day tells her to only get half of the money, but she can still only raise 12K by hocking her jewelry. This sets up a confrontation between Margaret, Alek and his partner that turns bad. I won't divulge anymore of the plot, but I do want to go back to sub-plots for a minute. First there's Bo's music and his attempts to get grants from, Wellsley college. Then there's a lot of flashbacks (never a good thing) Margaret has of a car accident Bo had while driving drunk with Avery in the passenger seat. The teenage daughter's knowledge of cars, the father in law heart attack, and the biggest complaint I have, the ever so minor effort on the parts of the story-tellers of the police investigation of Avery's murder. There's one scene where Margaret's in her car in her driveway and can get it started. A squad car pulls up behind her, and asks if she's heard about the murder at the lake. She say's she has and the police officer says The victim was stabbed with an anchor so we're checking with all residents of the lake. And Margaret says, Oh, we don't use an anchor, we just tie our boat up to the dock. And the cop says, Oh. Okay, have a nice day. and leaves. Come on. Who's running that police department, Barney Fife? The last point I'd like to address is the acting. Every character in this film is flat an uninteresting. I didn't care for anybody in it. I didn't feel for Margaret, I didn't hate the bad guys,and I thought Bo as the stereotyped moody gay musician has been done to death. I've seen worse films this year, but not many.

At the time of its release, the Beatles were the hottest, newest sensation in the world.  Even at the tender age of 13, I thought this fad would fade... but I was wrong.  They just kept on getting better and better. I have seen this film four times... at four different times of my life, and I appreciate it more each time. Naturally I laughed and enjoyed the music when I saw it as a young teen.  Then when I was about 17 they actually had it TV and I appreciated it more, being a more seasoned Beatles fan.  And as an adult, and a parent, I love this story.You probably know the story -- a couple of days in the life of the Fab Four on tour, mobbed by fans, living in hotels, travelling on a train.  The musical numbers just fit right into the story, just like a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers classic.  I think this movie is great because it was made in the finest tradition of British comedy -- namely, we can all have a laugh at ourselves.  I love the scene where George is interviewed by some advertising mogul about what young people like, and gives a rather nasty opinion about a TV show that's supposed to be the hottest teen program. Having Paul's grandfather was a stroke of genius.  What a great character actor he was, always getting into trouble, and trying to get the boys in trouble too.  And of course, the scene where Ringo is wandering around aimlessly, slightly hung over!  Actually, I read that he says he was pretty hung over at the time.Hard Day's Night was the best of all the Beatles films.  I think Help is OK, but lacks the spontanaety of Hard Day's Night.  Magical Mystery Tour had a great premise, great music, two interesting videos, but fizzled because the Beatles tried directing it themselves, with no experience.  Let it Be was interesting to watch, almost as a documentary, and Yellow Submarine was actually very good, but you had to suspend all rules of conventional thinking.  Many viewers had a little help from their friends although I personally don't believe in that stuff.  It just shows that the Beatles really were the very best rock band in history -- there was a magic that only John, Paul, George,and Ringo together could make.  Made on a low budget and tight schedule, I have to say the directing, script (ad libs?), singing, and acting were superb.  Compare this to pathetic attempts by other bands -- Spice World -- Spare me!A Hard Day's Night will still be one of the all-time classic films a century from now, like Citizen Kane, The Band Wagon, or Swing Time.

The musical numbers just fit right into the story, just like a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers classic.  I think this movie is great because it was made in the finest tradition of British comedy -- namely, we can all have a laugh at ourselves.  I love the scene where George is interviewed by some advertising mogul about what young people like, and gives a rather nasty opinion about a TV show that's supposed to be the hottest teen program. Having Paul's grandfather was a stroke of genius.  What a great character actor he was, always getting into trouble, and trying to get the boys in trouble too.  And of course, the scene where Ringo is wandering around aimlessly, slightly hung over!  Actually, I read that he says he was pretty hung over at the time.Hard Day's Night was the best of all the Beatles films.  I think Help is OK, but lacks the spontanaety of Hard Day's Night.  Magical Mystery Tour had a great premise, great music, two interesting videos, but fizzled because the Beatles tried directing it themselves, with no experience.  Let it Be was interesting to watch, almost as a documentary, and Yellow Submarine was actually very good, but you had to suspend all rules of conventional thinking.  Many viewers had a little help from their friends although I personally don't believe in that stuff.  It just shows that the Beatles really were the very best rock band in history -- there was a magic that only John, Paul, George,and Ringo together could make.  Made on a low budget and tight schedule, I have to say the directing, script (ad libs?), singing, and acting were superb.  Compare this to pathetic attempts by other bands -- Spice World -- Spare me!A Hard Day's Night will still be one of the all-time classic films a century from now, like Citizen Kane, The Band Wagon, or Swing Time.  Definitely a TEN!!!

At the time of its release, the Beatles were the hottest, newest sensation in the world.  Even at the tender age of 13, I thought this fad would fade... but I was wrong.  They just kept on getting better and better. I have seen this film four times... at four different times of my life, and I appreciate it more each time.

To them, I present to you EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.  Not only is this one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but one of the best and most imaginative.This is the story of Edward (Johnny Depp).  Edward is the creation of a gentle mad inventor (Vincent Price), but unfortunately for Edward the inventor died before he could attach hands, so Edward is left with a motly collection of scissors and blades for hands.  Of course, this is unnerving to the uber-perky Avon lady (Dianne Weist) who happens upon the young man. Strange as he may look, the kind woman realizes that Edward can't keep living alone like he has been, so she takes him back home to her suburban home to her typical family.  The neighbors are fascinated and are soon patronizing Edward's natural abilities for gardening and haircutting. Edward is enjoying his new friends, but is mostly interested in Weist's teenage daughter Kim (Winonna Ryder).  He has fallen for her, and she begins to fall for him, but problems arise when Kim's thug boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) decides to rob his dad and use Edward as a patsy. Who would have expected that a movie about a man with scissors for hands would yeild such gorgeous results?  The film's style is visually striking and inlaid with a great sense of ironic humor.  Every house in the suburban neighborhood where the story is set looks exactly the same, every car leaves the driveway at the same time in the morning, presumably for the same place. The mansion on the hill where Edward lives is gloomy and gothic, but features a beautiful garden out in front.  The latter transfers into the former as soon as Edward enters the picture and his unique talents are put to place, and this carboard cutout neighborhood becomes a fairy land. Depp's performance is nothing short of astounding.  His character reflects a child-like innocence and is intensely likeable, but still a bit frightening.The real triumph here is Dany Elfman's beautiful score, which really captures the essance of the film. I highly, highly recommend this film to everyone.  It's one of the great American films of our time.
