The story itself was no less superb; Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris), a renegade general, fed up with the lies and treatment that the government has been giving to its people and its soldiers, recruits some of his best men to help him rob a naval weapons depot. Having been ignored on several occasions by his government, he steals 15 rockets armed with a tremendously destructive material(VX gas) in order to get their attention. Hummel indeed gets the government's attention as they receive a ransom demand from his makeshift base on the rock a large amount of money to compensate for the lives of the soldiers that he claims were abandoned by their government, or he deploys the rockets and incinerates the whole of the San Fransisco bay area. The government then calls on an unlikely superhero, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a frail FBI field agent who's speciality just happens to be chemical weaponry. John Mason (Sean Connery), supposedly the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz, is also recruited to help navigate through the tunnels he knows so well. The characters are all very well developed, with fascinating sub-plots to each of them. Whether its Stanley and his pregnant wife waiting for his questionable return from the dangerous mission, or Mason and his long lost daughter, or Hummel and his valiant fight for justice, the characters alone make this movie worth watching over and over again.P.S.- In addition to this gem of a movie, the soundtrack is also excellent.

Ultimately, it's a meditation about film and the nature of story telling. Just what is real, what can be authenticated, and where do history and fiction stop and start? As the movie ends in a puff of backlit smoke, it reminds us that all movies are just that - light.The Usual Suspects recently had its TV premier here in the UK. After imploring my friends to watch it for the past few years, there are still some who haven't seen it. My campaign continues.If you're still one of the unfortunates, tear up that list of your Top Twenty movies. You'll need to create a new spot in there somewhere.

The brilliant decision to film widescreen and use black and white is complimented by Gershwin's equally brilliant music to create (at least cinematically) the perfect city. The script is one of my favorites ever, and certain parts have me rolling every time I see it. The discussion about the Academy of the Overrated is brilliant, and Woody's list of the things that make life worth living is hauntingly touching. Probably Allen's best, and absolutely his most personal. I recommend it to everyone who has eyes to see or ears to hear.

The dialogue, however was fairly good, as well as the special effects and extras casting, which appeared enormous.  The suspense, at least in certain parts, is well developed, but the movie still tended to drag on a bit.  So while this movie has some good scenes, it really does not deserve much attention because of the lack of depth in the characters in plot.  The bottom line? Only see this movie if you really want to, because if you don't, you'll be disappointed.

The plot is essentially standard small town America romantic comedy\/drama fare with one interesting plot twist- the boy was the midwife for the girl! That's pretty unique in the history of film I think. The delivery  is presented in a curiously sanitised but memorable scene and the five year old midwife is particularly clever. There's apparently no blood and the newly born looks about three days old. No wonder the little fellow decides that this baby will be the woman for him.  No mess!!) Years later by accident he meets the girl and her family and pursues her until she catches him in the time honoured tradition. Other than the girl's birth there are some other interesting moments in Music From Another Room, mostly to do with Brenda Blethyn's character Grace. She does the big stuff of life particularly well. Apart from having babies with a bit of a yell and a laugh, as you would perhaps tend to do with a five year olds hands inside, slipping about, she also dies with style and humour, in a fashion that I hope that some of us can at least match. Sentimentality, an admirable emotion in any clean faced romance, can slip to the bothersome sometimes though. The delivered miracle baby grows to become Anna (Gretchen Mol) and guess what. Jennifer Tilley's character Nina, Anna's unfortunate sister, is blind! Roll out the sympathy.Jennifer Tilley is a terrific actress and does what she can with Nina but Music From Another Room just hasn't got the enough bite for the quality of the cast.
