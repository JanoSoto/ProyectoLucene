[{"date":"29 September 2004","score":"","review":"  Captain John Boyd thought that he'd seen enough horrors in the Mexican-American War to last beyond a lifetime. Little did he know that his post-war-life would send him down a stranger and more macabre path than he would ever dare imagine.Ravenous is like an odd Vampire story. The same elements seem to be there the unwitting, unwilling recruit, the unnatural strength that comes from the ingestion of human blood(in this case, meat and all), and the eternal struggle of good vs. evil. However, I must admit that I'm not the biggest vampire film fan, but I loved Ravenous. That's because while it's sort of LIKE a vamp flick, it's really not in a lot of ways too.Ravenous is sometimes scary, often startling, and once in awhile downright funny. The acting is well done all around, especially from Robert Carlyle and Guy Pearce. It's a good time, and it's sure to make the viewer turn from the TV in disgust more than once, and that is what makes it great. This odd and unsettling story does more for the avid movie buff with a taste for the thrilling and bizarre than wet the appetite, it makes them truly...Ravenous.

Sterling Hayden, an often overlooked actor who was only nominated for one award his entire career (a BAFTA award nomination for Best Foreign Actor), does an excellent job in this film in every facet of his acting...from his spoken lines right down to his body language and facial expressions. Indeed, Mr. Hayden was so much more than the corrupt Police Captain McKlusky from The Godfather, a role he's almost always associated with...He was so much more of an actor than that and this movie proves it>>>His career spanned 5 decades!!! Also, I'm not quite certain and I'd appreciate some feedback on this, but it has to be one of the first movies whose chronology has been re-arranged and the story is told out of its natural order; Much like a Pulp Fiction. I won't give up any of the details, but in telling the story out of its natural order Kubrick twists the viewers guts in anticipation It's torture after a while....Every time the viewer thinks the climax is on its way the movie back tracks again and again!!! The affect this creates is incredible it fills the viewer with anxiety and keeps him\/her truly on the edge of their his\/her seat. A great crime movie...a very dark movie...I loved it so much I never want to see it again!!! A+ on the gut twisting scale.
