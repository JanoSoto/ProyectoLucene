Colqhoun (Carlyle) wanders into the Fort&#x85;A box office flop, a troubled production and a weirdness that permeates the narrative and technical credits, would indicate Ravenous as being a potential stinker to steer clear of? Not so though. For a good many film fans will tell you that many of the critics and paying customers of the time just didn't get it, they wasn't prepared to work out the tone and unique vibe of the whole thing.Ravenous is gloriously unique, there's an unpredictability about the film right from the off. From the very first strains of a deliciously oblique music score, to the cracker-jack finale, Ravenous is content to toy with your expectations, to tickle your funny bone, yet to also turn your stomach in an instant.Atmosphere is everything to a film like this, and Ravenous has it in spades, it's claustrophobic in its eeriness, yet visually it's also stunning, where Richmond's photography brings the beauty of the Tara Mountains to life one minute, then mutes the colours the next when the human beings take centre stage and the thematic of plotting unfolds.Characterisations are deliberately off-kilter, as are a couple of key scenes, while performances are splendidly in tune with the material to hand (Carlyle is just great and revelling in playing such a tasty role). Bird, who stepped in at the last minute, does a fine job of blending the dangling threads of three genres, she keeps it tense but knows exactly when to pause to filter in some darkly comic beats.Undeniably the last third is not up to the standard of what has gone before, tight atmospherics and edgy period promise give way to something more conventional in horror parlance terms. So yes! It's not the perfect meal at all, but it's darn near gourmet stuff and once sampled, Ravenous leaves a lasting and favourable taste on the tongue. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 March 2013","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ravenous is directed by Antonia Bird and written by Ted Griffin.
