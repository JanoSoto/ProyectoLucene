These are questions that have occupied the thoughts of scholars and lovers of literature down the centuries.  This raunchy, brilliantly witty film suggests sly answers to these questions by showing us Will Shakespeare as a very real young man, with a very real, very bad case of writer's block. His new play, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter, is not going well.  He has been paid for the play already, and has debts beside.  He badly needs for inspiration to strike, for his muse to grant him a vision.  The fates are kind, and inspiration does strike in the form of Viola, a beautiful young courtesan who loves the theater and wants nothing more than to act on the stage--in an age when women are forbidden to do so.  Viola's gender-bending deception initiates an avalanche of riotous activity as well as a torrent of literary brilliance for Will.  Romeo remains, but Ethel disappears forever, her place taken by Juliet, and pirate adventures on the high seas give way to the greatest love story of all--one mirrored by the love between Will and Viola, and just as impossible.  Joseph Fiennes is wonderful as Will Shakespeare, bemused and befuddled, passionate and brilliant, clear-eyed and heart-breakingly beautiful.  Gwyneth Paltrow continues to surprise and delight with the depth of expression and emotion in her performances.  The supporting cast is dependable and solid--standouts are Judi Dench as a crusty, scathing Queen Elizabeth and Rupert Everett as competing playwright Christopher Marlowe.  There are plenty of in-jokes and references to Shakespeare's work for the literate crowd, but this rollicking funfest can be enjoyed by more than just English Lit majors.  Perhaps the best thing of all is that, as my friend Jeff said, the story ends well. After all, what else could a good film about Shakespeare do?

Certain of Allen's experiments in Mighty Aphrodite, such as the Greek Chorus, just didn't work for me.  Woody's dialogue is always funny, but when it's delivered by twenty people at the same time in a shout it loses something.  The chorus only worked for me when the soloists interact with Woody on the screen.  Woody is his usual unimpeccable self on screen - almost every man can identify with him immediately.  I remember a poll in the late seventies or early eighties among American men asking them with which movie character or star they idenitified with the most, and it wasn't Redford, or Reynolds, or what later would have been Bruce Willis or Schwarzenegger - it was Woody.  He brings the common anxieties of men to the screen in unexpurgated form, never diluted.  I think one of the secrets of his success is that he explores his own anxieties and experiences very closely, and much of what you see is at least a bit biographical.  The attraction to hookers appears in any number of his more recent works, especially Deconstructing Harry, just like the attraction to young girls appeared in Manhattan years before Soon-Yi became a household name.Allen has also adopted any number of children, most when he was with Mia Farrow, and this is clearly him playing out his own little fantasy of traipsing into their backgrounds to find out who was the sensational Mom who gave birth to such wonderfully smart children.  In this case his character, Lenny, gets the bug when his wife begins ignoring him and his young adopted son continues to dazzle him.  His detective work leads him to Linda\/Leslie\/Judy Cum played by Mira Sorvino, a porn actress and hooker who gave the baby up out of financial difficulty and doesn't know who the father is.  Sorvino pulls off the most unusual feat as an actress with Linda - she is dumb, shrill, judgmental, with quick vindictive anger - while at the same time becoming increasingly more real, human, and sympathetic at the same time.  Her voice is art - it is grating and annoying but somehow we come to look forward to hearing it.  A lot of people have written that the voice was offputting; look, if you don't like Joey Lauren Adams because of her little girl voice, then Sorvino's Linda will have you climbing the walls.  Sorvino won an Oscar for the role, and in spite of the fact that the Oscars are just a high school popularity contest and the real winner is rarely the one who deserves it, this is a deserving performance.  Sorvino is a knockout.Allen is Allen as usual (good).  Helena Bonham Carter plays Allen's typecast New York City careerist wife like the rest(okay); Peter Weller stares at Carter unabashedly as her boss and lover.  Allen even manages to sprinkle in his usual cast of characters - the mobster, the dumb guy, and uses the Greek chorus as Lenny's confidante.  It has a touching and unusual ending - Allen almost always knows how to end his movies on the right note.  It doesn't rank with The Purple Rose of Cairo, or Hannah and Her Sisters, or Crimes and Misdemeanors, or Everyone Says I Love You, or Manhattan, or Annie Hall, or Radio Days, or any of the other of his best films, but it's still worth watching.  It ranks closer to Deconstructing Harry, or Zelig, or Broadway Danny Rose, or Bullets Over Broadway.  Allen is indisputably one of the greatest directors of American (or any other) cinema and a national treasure, in spite of his well publicized foibles, and this is a good Woody Allen movie.

Thus, I am a fan of this movie. It feels a lot like one of the Creepshow movies but has enough gore, humor and OTT carnage but it just doesn't have enough scope to brake away from the TV show and stand alone as a big screen movie.Brayker (William Sadler) is a drifter who stumbles upon a lonely desert town after an explosive confrontation with The Collector (Billy Zane), a supremely evil being with Satanical powers who is desperate to get his hands on Brayker's mysterious talisman. Brayker spends the night in a shabby motel but The Collector soon turns up and unleashes hell upon the motel and it's inhabitants.This is where the fun really kicks in. The Collector has fun enticing the residents (made up of Dick Miller, Charles Fleisher, Thomas Haden Church, Brenda Bakke, Jada Pinkett-Smith and CCH Pounder) to join him on his dark quest and steal the talisman from Brayker. Director Ernest Dickerson (who also did Surviving the Game) does not hold back on the gore as he spoofs 1950's B-movies, honor's the TV show and pays brilliant homage to the Tales From The Crypt comic book legacy. It may be nothing more than a cheap, horror comedy with no artistic integrity but Dickerson still successfully pulls of a movie that will satisfy and entertain anyone who watches it. Half of the movie's appeal lies with Billy Zane who acts out the role of The Collector with such wicked charm and delightful evil. You can tell he's having a great time and he makes a counterpoint villain for Sadler's dishevelled hero.

I just finished a positively negative review of The Waterboy, which I screened last week. I am in the middle of writing a critique of Night Falls on Manhattan, that I viewed yesterday. Now, I am on to putting together my thoughts of what I just saw a little less than three hours ago. This is the kind of movie where you have to remember everything, but reveal absolutely nothing.Movies like Goodbye, Lover give me a hard time reporting about. You see I can't explain the actual plot of the movie because that would give too much away for those who plan to see it.The movie starts out with a phone sex conversation and only gets more pervasive. The characters in this movie are more like pieces on an overly crowded game board as they are actual people. Here are the main players' involvement's with one another.

Flying around the room, the two capture perfectly the fire and passion of dance.Unfortunately, this is the only bright spot in an otherwise ludicrous film. Dance with Me tries to be a serious drama *and* a light, frothy comedy, and fails at both attempts.The entire subplot involving Chayanne and Kris Kristofferson, for example, is a deadly bore. I could not summon up an ounce of interest in Kristofferson's character, the removal, or heaving trimming, of whom would have vastly improved this far-too-long movie. (Is there some new rule in Hollywood that a film must be two hours long, regardless of whether the story requires it?)And even if his storyline was interesting, the 63-year-old Kristofferson would still be remarkably miscast as a not-yet retired dancer. Most professionals hang up their competition shoes at the age of 40, tops, yet we're expected to believe that this man is still trying to lift students the age of nubile Jane Krakowski?Chayanne and Williams do manage to generate a bit of romantic heat, but they have so little on-screen time together, the audience is left wondering how they fell in love.Nor is the comedy anything worth repeating; the funniest bit is when Vanessa Williams' zipper nearly comes down at a dance party, and Chayanne's timely rescue prompts a despairing why?! from an elderly student who was hoping to sneak a peek. Talented British veteran Joan Plowright has such pedestrian dialogue as a hot-blooded grandmother that all her valiant efforts go to waste.Worst of all, this is a dance movie with only one memorable dance sequence. The afore-mentioned Krakowski engages in one of the *worst* dance routines in recent movie history, a pseudo-ballet sequence in which she does nothing besides look longingly into the distance and be lifted over and around Chayanne's head under soft pink lighting. The couple shown dancing before them is so obviously superior that Chayanne and Krakowski's ultimate victory makes you wonder if they bribed the judges.The final, professional competition in Las Vegas goes on far too long and none of the dances are particularly interesting. In fact, many of the scenes are so crowded, it's hard to find Williams and her various partners.Those seeking fine onscreen dancing should rent Strictly Ballroom, Dirty Dancing, or any of the Astaire\/Rogers library.

Sean and Catherine are both entertaining enough, and they do the best they can with what they're given. But that isn't much in the way of characterization.  Mac and Gin seem to bond remarkably quickly - they're thrown together, they fall in love (sort of), and it's all left to the audience to assume this.  Not much is played out, and there isn't really a feel, IMO, for why Connery's character falls in love with Gin despite the fact she's a manipulating b***h.The capers, are all excellent.  Most of it is left to Zeta-Jones to perform, as someone noted - all of Mac's thieving is left off-screen.  I found the final money-transfer a bit confusing, and they seem to be doing a Mac\/Old Thief style vs. Gin\/HighTech competition that didn't make much sense  Mac used plenty of high-tech during the mask robbery.  That mask robbery is really the highlight of the film, although it doesn't really contribute much significance to the plot.  But even then, they somewhat mess it up by showing Zeta-Jones performing essentially the same sequence in rehearsal.  As acrobatic as she undoubtedly is, do we need to see the same thing twice??That brings us to the twist angle.  Quite frankly, I thought they didn't play quite fair.  Thibadeaux's first sequence with Mac is between only the two of them.  But they don't act like FBI boss\/blackmailer and caught criminal - they act like criminal and supplier.  But...there's nobody there to see them act like that.  Okay, they might be doing that for Gin's benefit...if she were there!  As it is, this sequence only exists to mislead the audience.  Boo.As for the other characters, Rhames is entertaining as always, but not given much to do.  Neither is Patton, except to look alternately p****d and infatuated.  Maury Chaykin's performance is absurd.So overall, I rate this movie a bit better than average.

Sean and Catherine are both entertaining enough, and they do the best they can with what they're given. But that isn't much in the way of characterization.  Mac and Gin seem to bond remarkably quickly - they're thrown together, they fall in love (sort of), and it's all left to the audience to assume this.  Not much is played out, and there isn't really a feel, IMO, for why Connery's character falls in love with Gin despite the fact she's a manipulating b***h.The capers, are all excellent.  Most of it is left to Zeta-Jones to perform, as someone noted - all of Mac's thieving is left off-screen.  I found the final money-transfer a bit confusing, and they seem to be doing a Mac\/Old Thief style vs. Gin\/HighTech competition that didn't make much sense  Mac used plenty of high-tech during the mask robbery.  That mask robbery is really the highlight of the film, although it doesn't really contribute much significance to the plot.  But even then, they somewhat mess it up by showing Zeta-Jones performing essentially the same sequence in rehearsal.  As acrobatic as she undoubtedly is, do we need to see the same thing twice??That brings us to the twist angle.  Quite frankly, I thought they didn't play quite fair.  Thibadeaux's first sequence with Mac is between only the two of them.  But they don't act like FBI boss\/blackmailer and caught criminal - they act like criminal and supplier.  But...there's nobody there to see them act like that.  Okay, they might be doing that for Gin's benefit...if she were there!  As it is, this sequence only exists to mislead the audience.  Boo.As for the other characters, Rhames is entertaining as always, but not given much to do.  Neither is Patton, except to look alternately p****d and infatuated.

It's easy to see why, at 69, she is the most popular film and legitimate theatre actress in Brazil.This is a story worth telling, lovingly and credibly told.  I stopped waiting for the emotional manipulations so predictable in Hollywood films with this sort of theme -- after a half hour or so I relaxed, knowing I'd be allowed to witness a story unfold on the screen without heavy-handed moralizing or sugar-coated characterizations.  This film was populated with human characters, not stereotypes.  Because of this it was possible to stay emotionally in touch with the two main characters and those in smaller roles throughout -- as each faced crises or morally ambiguent choices unpredictably but true to the characters as they were developed by time spent with them.Caught up in the tensions of the story line, I didn't fully appreciate the cinematography as much as on the second viewing.  I'll bet it strikes a particularly deep chord in its Brazilian audience.Such iconography so naturally blended into the film visually -- the reverse Madonna and child, the religious ecstasy of the celebrants, the barrenness yet stubborn hopefulness in the prefabricated barracks-style freshly created communities in the countryside, the older and younger brother at the lathe, the summary execution of the young thief in the rail line...What a breath of fresh air this film was.  Superior to all its Oscar competitors, and I certainly would have awarded Best Actress to Montenegro!10 of 10.
