Someone once told me Brad Pitt is just an OK actor, but boy were they wrong. Brad Pitt made the movie!The plot ~ Fight Club really keeps you entertained. The story and characters are really interesting and mysterious. One thing I really liked about it was that it wasn't cliché and it didn't take too long to build up the plot.
