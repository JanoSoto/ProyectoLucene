It is also arguably the best. Producer Irwin Allen was the mastermind behind most of them, known for spending millions of dollars on special effects and his big-name stars.A simple plot a tidal wave knocks a ship upside down and a handful of survivors have to climb to the bottom of the ship at the surface before the ship sinks. They are led by a fanatical preacher (Gene Hackman) who conflicts with an ex-cop (Ernest Borgnine) and his ex-hooker wife (Stella Stevens). Jack Albertson (WILLY WONKA) and Shelley Winters are an elderly Jewish couple who are on their way to see their new grandchild. Pamela Sue Martin (TV's Nancy Drew) and Eric Shea (like Bobby Brady, but more annoying) are brother and sister on their way to meet their parents. Roddy McDowall (a fantastic actor) is wasted as a ship hand who dies rather quick. Red Buttons (PETE'S DRAGON) is an elderly gentleman who helps the ship's lounge singer (Carol Lynley) retain her sanity. Arthur O'Connell is a strict reverend who refuses to go along with Hackman.

Now, i'm a huge fan of the entire series. John Carpenters greatest flick of all time plus the best horror movie ever made.  The directing is unbelievable and the music is insane to say the least.  The characters are too real as we go into the life of Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) and Donald Pleasances obsession with the little boy who killed his sister on Halloween night.  Michaels rage still sends chills down my spine when I hear the music. Halloween is not like other pointless slashers, in fact Halloween is the original, the rest came afterwards.  I know people who watch Halloween now and don't know why i'm so in love with it.  It's very simple, most people have seen the modern 90's horror movies and obviously it's much newer than a '79 movie but the mask, the plot, the soundtrack, the directing and Jamie Lee Curtis' first movie which made her a hit is so great that even today I praise its work. As for the rest of the films, I feel the sequel is equal to the original, very well done and very scary and number 3 doesn't matter, but part 4, 5, 6 and H20 maybe ruined the whole story because of Steve Miner.  Steve Miner wouldn't know a horror movie if it picked him up at a night club.  He absolutely ruined the whole story line when he made Halloween 20 Years Later.  I wanna know what happened to Tommy Doyle, Karen and little Danny. I must say but the rest are decent enough to be called horror movies but not the greatest. Other than that, Halloween is a definite must see.  A 10 out of 10 with me. Only movies that came pretty close to being as scary as Halloween is Evil Dead, Stephen Kings IT & Pet Semetary as well as I must admit the new and original I Know What You Did Last Summer ( Great example of a great horror flick ruined by the sequel ).

When I was 9 years old, I was grounded for some reason on a Saturday night & so I went to my room and I had The Movie Network, I saw that a movie called Halloween 4  The Return of Michael Myers is coming on...decided to watch, and that's when it all began.  Now, i'm a huge fan of the entire series. John Carpenters greatest flick of all time plus the best horror movie ever made.  The directing is unbelievable and the music is insane to say the least.  The characters are too real as we go into the life of Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) and Donald Pleasances obsession with the little boy who killed his sister on Halloween night.  Michaels rage still sends chills down my spine when I hear the music. Halloween is not like other pointless slashers, in fact Halloween is the original, the rest came afterwards.  I know people who watch Halloween now and don't know why i'm so in love with it.  It's very simple, most people have seen the modern 90's horror movies and obviously it's much newer than a '79 movie but the mask, the plot, the soundtrack, the directing and Jamie Lee Curtis' first movie which made her a hit is so great that even today I praise its work. As for the rest of the films, I feel the sequel is equal to the original, very well done and very scary and number 3 doesn't matter, but part 4, 5, 6 and H20 maybe ruined the whole story because of Steve Miner.  Steve Miner wouldn't know a horror movie if it picked him up at a night club.  He absolutely ruined the whole story line when he made Halloween 20 Years Later.  I wanna know what happened to Tommy Doyle, Karen and little Danny. I must say but the rest are decent enough to be called horror movies but not the greatest. Other than that, Halloween is a definite must see.  A 10 out of 10 with me. Only movies that came pretty close to being as scary as Halloween is Evil Dead, Stephen Kings IT & Pet Semetary as well as I must admit the new and original I Know What You Did Last Summer ( Great example of a great horror flick ruined by the sequel ). I could go on about how great Halloween is and i'll go off by saying horror movies today wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for Halloween.

Ed Harris is great as Bud and ME Mastrantonio makes a really good 'bitch'. To her credit, of course. Beside the whole story being fantasy, it's still not that unrealistic because it doesn't go that far; it leaves open to the imagination if the underwater aliens were ever really there. The end is a cliche, but that's all right since there's not too much romance during most of the film. Michael Biehn does a good job; I really loathe him in the end (and it's a great criticism of military institutions' brainwashing), but then his fate is sealed so... One of the things I really do like about it is that, despite the introduction of the aliens, it doesn't get all gory like 'Aliens'.

The speaker is Geena Davis --- Captain Morgan Adams herself --- and the 'they' to which she's referring is Carolco Pictures, they of T2, Rambo II and III, Basic Instinct and 20 other titles. One way or another, Geena explains in the Sunday New York Times article Debacle on the High Seas, which was published some two years ago, this was their last movie. That movie, of course, is 1995's Cutthroat Island --- which, as that article reveals, proved to be Hollywood's biggest $100 million flop. But if you love movies about swashbucklin' Pirates (as I do!), here's a film that stands out as a virtual Pirate's paradise! Directed by Geena's husband at the time, Renny Harlin, CTI is a truly unique Pirate adventure. Starting things off in Jamaica during the 1660's, the story begins with the feisty Morgan rescuing her father (Harris Yulin) from the machinations of the nasty Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), only to see Papa Adams die in her arms. Before he does, he reveals the secret to Cutthroat Island's great treasure. That secret has its origins in a map which has been divided into three parts --- the first third of which has been somehow tattooed on his head. The second third is in the hands of Morgan's Uncle Mordecai; Dawg himself seeks to grab the last third before Morgan does, and basically the tale follows the two Pirates and their crews on a fast-paced, occasionally ribald, but wildly exciting quest to see which of them can put it all together first. Problem is, even with all three of its components put together, the map is mostly written in Latin; and it's up to Morgan Adams and her crew, aided by the young con man-turned-wouldbe physician Dr. William Shaw (Matthew Modine), to translate the text, follow the map's instructions, abscond with the Cutthroat treasure and sail for home. Now, why the critics had it in for this film when it was first released is beyond me. I strongly suspect that there is a so-called politically-correct generation that is completely unprepared for movies about Pirates. That is why, I guess, there are folks like myself who long for the days when you could watch a film featuring Pirates --- and not be afraid to tell the world about it.

You cannot know how devastated I was when, through the film's initial U.S. boxoffice flop, those hopes were summarily dashed. Yet, as Founder and Chairman of Electric Pirates Entertainment, I have never failed to lose hope that Hollywood will one day get with the program and make another Pirate movie in this just-now-born 21st Century. As I discovered for myself some 72 hours ago, what makes Cutthroat Island so magical is that it features the one thing I never thought I'd see in my recent life as a Pirate movie lover namely, an all-Pirate happy ending! Believe me, I wept for joy as Morgan and Dr. Shaw kissed to the rousing cheers of their shipmates as the Morning Star sailed off to adventures new, fully loaded with the treasure of Cutthroat Island!

The more I watch it the more I keep thinking why it had a bad wrap.  I can't think of anything but Will Smith playing Jim West. Which was a white character in the original TV show(Not being racist or anything but they should at least be true to the TV show.  Something that been a problem lately with TV show movies.  But other then its extremeily untrue to the show I liked it because it was enjoyable to watch.  I mean I do like the type of movies that are just made to have fun(Lake PLacid, Deep Blue Sea, Big Daddy, The Waterboy, etc)  And this movie was one of them.  I will admit that this movie did have some problems.  The first thing was the racial marks that were made a bunch of times.  That was getting old, even though the scene with Smith and that Loveless guy making fun of themselves was pretty funny.  The other problem was some of the one liners in the movie.  Like That's it, no more mister knife guy and I learned that from a China man.  Those lines should've been off the script but they took the chance to keep them.   Another thing that I didn't like about the movie was having Salma Haleck being in the film where she had no purpose in the film but to show her cute little butt in the movie.   But if u ignore these flaws, you got a very enjoyable movie.  Will Smith and Kevin Kline work very well as with Kenneth Branngh as the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless, which I like to add is in my list of best villains.  Number one is Jeremy Irons from Die Hard With a Vengence.  Kevin Kline also does a good job playing President Grant, originally offered to Robert Conrad but put it down since he too didn't like what they were doing to the movie.Some of the fight scenes weren't bad either and that 80 foot spider scene was awesome. Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of Men in Black and Addams Family, does a good job making this movie into some kind of super hero movie.  He also did a good job making the comedy scenes real funny.  I mean that touch my breast scene was just too much. I've read some magazines where they said this movie was the worst of 1999.  I tell u what I've seen alot worst then this.

I mean I do like the type of movies that are just made to have fun(Lake PLacid, Deep Blue Sea, Big Daddy, The Waterboy, etc)  And this movie was one of them.  I will admit that this movie did have some problems.  The first thing was the racial marks that were made a bunch of times.  That was getting old, even though the scene with Smith and that Loveless guy making fun of themselves was pretty funny.  The other problem was some of the one liners in the movie.  Like That's it, no more mister knife guy and I learned that from a China man.  Those lines should've been off the script but they took the chance to keep them.   Another thing that I didn't like about the movie was having Salma Haleck being in the film where she had no purpose in the film but to show her cute little butt in the movie.   But if u ignore these flaws, you got a very enjoyable movie.  Will Smith and Kevin Kline work very well as with Kenneth Branngh as the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless, which I like to add is in my list of best villains.  Number one is Jeremy Irons from Die Hard With a Vengence.  Kevin Kline also does a good job playing President Grant, originally offered to Robert Conrad but put it down since he too didn't like what they were doing to the movie.Some of the fight scenes weren't bad either and that 80 foot spider scene was awesome. Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of Men in Black and Addams Family, does a good job making this movie into some kind of super hero movie.  He also did a good job making the comedy scenes real funny.  I mean that touch my breast scene was just too much. I've read some magazines where they said this movie was the worst of 1999.  I tell u what I've seen alot worst then this.

What makes them more interesting is if they're made by Frank Capra, Mr. Wholesome America himself! I believe this is sort of his skeleton in the closet picture, an abrupt change from his usual cleancut, all-American picture. This was another one of AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies of All Time (#30), but I think HAROLD AND MAUDE (#45) is funnier.Based on an original play, Cary Grant is Mortimer Brewster, a drama critic who loves his two old aunts Abby (Josephine Hull) and Martha (Jean Adair) and his brother Teddy, who thinks he's President Teddy Roosevelt! Mortimer discovers that his two sweet old aunts invite elderly courters inside and poison them with wine laced with arsenic, then hide the bodies in the cellar so Roosevelt can bury them in the Panama Canal. To add to his surprise, his psychotic murderous brother Johnny (Raymond Massey) and his sidekick Dr. Einstein (Peter Lorre) have escaped from jail and have taken up residence in the house. How will he ever explain this to his new wife? And does this mean insanity runs in the family?Cary Grant has impeccable comic timing, proven here by his reactions to the shocking truth about his aunts and his handling of the facts. I've never been much of a fan of Grant's, what with his annoying voice, but here he gives a wonderful comic performance. He was always a better comic actor than a dramatic actor, anyway. You have to love the scene where he catches the sisters trying to poison a prospective boarder in the house. Josephine Hull and Jean Adair are superb as the two little old ladies who look as if they wouldn't hurt a fly. Their best scenes are when they are explaining their crimes to Mortimer, so matter-of-fact, as if they're describing a family recipe for apple pie. Raymond Massey takes over the role of Johnny from stage actor Boris Karloff (Johnny is constantly told, You look like Karloff!) and is very creepy. Peter Lorre, a personal favorite, is great as the heavy drinker Dr. Einstein. Edward Everett Horton is the head of an insane asylum; he is best-known as the narrator of Fractured Fairy Tales on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show and is fantastic in POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES. Frank Capra is a genius and every film of his is an instant classic. This will surprise those who have only seen Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but is a pleasant surprise indeed.

It's apparent that many people just...to put simply...HATE HIM! Whenever they hear Allen has come out with a new film they almost immediately dismiss it as another annoying typical,self indulgent film. As I've been reading what costumers have to say about not only this film but Allen's other recent films (Deconstructing Harry,Celebrity,Sweet and Lowdown) it seems no matter what Allen does there's ALWAYS someone out there who has something bad to say about his films. Either,his films are too depressing,why doesn't he stop complaining! As in the case of Another Women, Stardust Memories, Deconstructing Harry, and Crimes and Misdemeanors. Or his films aren't depressing enough! Why doesn't he go back to making films like Another Women, Crimes and Misdemeanors, Stardust Memories, instead of making fun movies like Everyone Says I Love You, Sweet and Lowdown, and this movie. When Allen tries to give the public what they want,they change their minds! It's almost funny reading what people have to say about his films. I know I always can't stop laughing at them. One minute it's make more movies like Take the Money and Run, and the next minute it's make more movies like Hannah and Her Sisters. Well to anyone who's reading this review THIS IS A GOOD,FUNNY MOVIE! I don't care what all these other people had to say. The movie is filled with laughs. And it's not only Allen who delivers them. My own personal favorite is Elaine May! I think she's the highpoint of the film. She's the funniest thing in the movie. You should just go see it for her. Then we have Tracy Ullman. She's quite funny as well. She definitely keeps up with Allen,as far as one liners are concerned. I wasn't too crazy about Hugh Grant in the movie. But with his own personality he manages to pull it off quite well. A very good movie done by one of the greatest American comedy filmmaker we have. *** out of **** stars.

As I've been reading what costumers have to say about not only this film but Allen's other recent films (Deconstructing Harry,Celebrity,Sweet and Lowdown) it seems no matter what Allen does there's ALWAYS someone out there who has something bad to say about his films. Either,his films are too depressing,why doesn't he stop complaining! As in the case of Another Women, Stardust Memories, Deconstructing Harry, and Crimes and Misdemeanors.

Just recently, it made the AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies of All Time (#45). Not that the list means anything, it didn't include DUMB & DUMBER the funniest damn movie ever made, but I agreed with this choice.Bud Cort is Harold, a morbid teenage boy neglected by his rich mother (Vivian Pickles), who spends her time trying to match him up with blind dates. Harold delights in pretending to kill himself to get attention from his mother and pulls some gruesome tricks out of his sleeve to scare away his blind dates. He goes to funerals as a hobby and while there, he meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a carefree elderly woman. Maude helps to teach Harold the beauty of life and the two slowly fall in love.HAROLD AND MAUDE was ever nominated for any Oscars, but it should have been. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are both brilliant in their roles; unfortunately, this would be the last good film either of them made. Cort was recently reduced to a bit part in THEODORE REX and Gordon died in 1985. But both here are at shining moments in their careers. Vivian Pickles is right on-target as Harold's rich, prissy mother who tries to run Harold's life for him until he breaks free. Maude is certainly one of the most heartwarming characters in cinema history; her philosophies are so very true that I couldn't help but apply them to my life after the movie was over. Some viewers may be disgusted at the thought of a teenage boy and an elderly woman being a hot item, but the idea and execution of it is more an act of respect and love for one another as people than an act of lust and romance, making this in my opinion the most romantic film of all time. HAROLD AND MAUDE is also told very realistically, making the story unfold gracefully and the twist ending is both poignant and reassuring.HAROLD AND MAUDE is certainly one of the funniest movies of all time, but is also one of the most important human stories as well.

I'm not very religious myself, and I find modern society a little bit too cynical to openly and passionately discuss God and religion without the feeling that others would quickly be turned off. I'm not saying everyone, I'm mainly speaking for the people that I know personally.ANYWAY... I was very intrigued by this movie and found myself thinking about it and revisiting images from the movie in my head. I remember in the beginning I was thinking why the heck is Willem Dafoe Christ and what is Harvey Keitel doing here playing Judas? But when you get past all that and especially the New Yawk accents, you'll find a very underrated masterpiece in this epic story, that blends fiction with the gospels.The locations and costumes and extras were all marvelously authentic, which is seldomly found in religious movies, well in the past anyway. The camera-movement was pure Marty and I just loved watching a Christian movie with actual thought(!) and really looked upon itself and questioned itself much like Jesus does in this film. Am I really the messiah? Is this meant to be? You can hate this movie if you want or find it blasphemous or whatever. But at least Jesus is portrayed as a real man in this movie, with feelings and emotions like all of us, along with his superior divinity. I also don't think I have to tell you that if Jesus questioned Judaism and changed the ways of worship than the same can be done with Christianity.
