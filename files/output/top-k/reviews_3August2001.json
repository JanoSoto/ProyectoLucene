Have I seen any part of this scene yet? No, no, great, it'll get good again.I have to admit, that's what kept going through my head while watching this movie. The exciting action pieces were all that carried this fairly flimsy movie through its meager 95 minutes. The plot isn't really thought through, at least compared to the original, which went out of its way to be logical and set up the story. And it still offered some excellent action (my favorite being Ellie vs. the raptor when she was turning on the power). I also liked The Lost World, though I haven't seen it in a long time. As far as this sequel goes, it seems to be in a mad rush to cart everyone off to the island, for a fairly transparent reason, just so we can see a handful of characters run around and spout bad lines. The plot has been turned over a hundred times, so I don't need to waste time explaining. It isn't the most intelligable scenario I've ever heard of, and Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) seemed a little too willing to be a part of it all, after mentioning earlier on that nothing could bring him back to those dinosaurs. And I would have expected him to be only a little more upset by the fact that he was ONCE AGAIN stuck on an island with the man-eating prehistoric beings, running for his life. A little too calm for my tastes.Amanda and Paul Kirby's (Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, respectively) rekindled admiration and love for one another once stuck in this nightmare seemed terribly inplausible. I can see people working together to survive, but falling in love again? I don't know, running for my life with my ex probably wouldn't turn me on to them again. And their wayward son Eric (Trevor Morgan) is so terrible a character, you wonder why we couldn't have likable JP kids again, like in the original, and even the sequel. (Okay, so the girl sneaking along on the trip in The Lost World was sort of a annoying, but I still liked her character.) Eric is way too resilient, and to have survived for 8 weeks, when in a matter of minutes, two very tough adults, armed with weapons, were killed once they arrived on the island, just doesn't make sense. When he's finally found, looking like some Lord of the Flies reject, smirking about how he survived for so long, you sort of wish he wasn't found at all, or ended up being the sound heard in the dinosaur's stomach in the distance (and not the phone--God, that was weak.)And for further complaints, Billy's (Alessandro Nivola) decision to bring along the raptor eggs made no sense, since he should have known better. It seems the only reason that happened was to give an excuse for why the characters were being hunted down, other than, The dinosaurs are hungry, and then, so later on, when he rescues Billy from the pterodactyls or whatever the hell they're called, or however it's spelt, he can redeem himself and be a hero. Sort of a tired idea. And last, but not least, Ellie (Laura Dern) is so terribly wasted! Why couldn't she come along. She and Alan have such amazing chemistry together, I would have loved to see them back together. The characters that ended up on the island had zippo chemistry, and no one seemed to really fit with anyone else.Anyway, the movie does have its merits. The action pieces are fairly exciting, though lacking some suspense. Still, they were carried out fairly well, and went on for some time. Made the movie almost seem to be a non-stop adventure, had it not paused for Amanda and Paul to make up, or for Alan to spout some wisdom, and Eric to be precocious.As for the acting, it's minimal at best. Sam Neill gives a good show, and I like his accent. He brings some depth to the characters in the movie. William H. Macy is a great actor, but gives a fairly weak performance here. Action movies are not his forte. I think he's better in good comedies and dramas. He belongs in a better movie than this. Tea Leoni, actually, isn't too bad here. She has a good delivery of most of her lines, and I loved her big freak-out scene, with the body in the parachute. She executed that one brilliantly. Would have liked some more of that type of panic and frenzy from her, she did it well. Alessandro Nivola is also fairly good, and I thought he gave a likable show, at least before we found out about the eggs he stole. Trevor Morgan is annoying as the requisite kid, and I could have done without him in the entire movie. Michael Jeter has a limited screen time as Udarsky, and I didn't like him. His voice got on my nerves, and he even got a chance to scream like a blubbering idiot, which only made me happier to see him go. And Laura Dern, reprising her role as Ellie, is terribly underused, and I really liked her limited performance. It's too bad she didn't show up more often.Overall, Jurassic Park III is not a great movie. As a whole, it's a disappointment. But there is some great action, and for fans of the original score (sorry, that doesn't include me, it sort of got on my nerves after a while), it's here again. The production standards are a little lower (check out the terrible backdrop scenes in the close-ups of the earlier hang-gliding scenes) and the setting is a slightly smaller scale, and sort of feels like it's an adventure through the junkyard of the previous two films. The acting and story are so-so, but at least it's sort of fun. In the end, I recommend it for some mindless fun, but don't waste nine dollars on a ticket, and wait for it to come out on video.

It pales in comparison.  And, sadly enough, the first Mummy isn't very good at all!So much to say why this movie didn't work *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. The plot is just cluttered with tons of legends, ancient stories, ancient artifacts, bracelets, spears, gods, armies of destruction and other such nonsense. ex. They wake up Ahmontep to wake up and kill the Scorpion King who made a pact with so-and-so and got condemmed for ever, so Ahmontep can have his dark army, but he needs the bracelet to wake him up, and some Spear to kill whoever, and who knows how the O'Connells got the spear in the first place.  All of this confusing stuff is in the first 30 minutes, mind you, and everything plot-wise becomes cloudy and muddled.  The big problem with Mummy Returns, is that it's just not simple enough. 2.  All the heiroglyphics, that everyone can read, say dumb stuff that would nobody would ever bother to carve. This way to Scorpion King.  He who disturbs this chest (there are numerous chests) will surely die.  And why would they carve how to kill the Scorpion King (with the sceptre of Osiris) in his own temple?! 3.  The ever-annoying Alex.  He's way to brave and smart for his own good.  He's not even cute, and his one-liners are very contrived and not funny.  Why doesn't he just write the name of where they are going instead of building sand sculptures?  And where did he get that British accent?  His parents don't talk like that! 4.  The dazzling special-effects that we expect from every movie these days were non-existant.  The airship idea was incredibly stupid, and it didn't look that cool.  The tiny pygmies.  Where did they come from, and what is their purpose?  Who knows.  But they weren't that cool, and had no motivation.  I wasn't scared.  Anubis army, they were okay, but they looked awkward and most of all, fake.  And the graphics of the Scorpion King at the end were extremely laughable.  It looked like something out of a video game. As for the fight scenes, Is it just me or is anyone else sick of seeing slow-motion every time a punch is thrown? 5.  All aspects of the movie have failed, now it's time to see what we came for.  The Rock.  He's actually a pretty good actor.  Oh, wait, he's only in the movie for a few minutes in the beginning.  In spite of this, he graces almost every poster or promotional item for Mummy Returns.  Why didn't they place Bad Soldier #3 on the poster?  I mean, he was in the movie just as long!  Another prime example of Hollywood just out to squeeze dollars out of everyone.That concludes my synopsis.  When I see this type of movie I don't expect Citizen Kane, or Shakespeare, but I do expect something a little bit more valuable than this drivel.  Something that shows a worthy effort by the actors and the writing team, by someone who didn't read Archaeology for Dummies, before he started.  Anyways, watch the first Mummy or the perfect example of an action\/adventure\/comedy movie done right, Indiana Jones.

They wake up Ahmontep to wake up and kill the Scorpion King who made a pact with so-and-so and got condemmed for ever, so Ahmontep can have his dark army, but he needs the bracelet to wake him up, and some Spear to kill whoever, and who knows how the O'Connells got the spear in the first place.

Another prime example of Hollywood just out to squeeze dollars out of everyone.That concludes my synopsis.  When I see this type of movie I don't expect Citizen Kane, or Shakespeare, but I do expect something a little bit more valuable than this drivel.  Something that shows a worthy effort by the actors and the writing team, by someone who didn't read Archaeology for Dummies, before he started.

Of far greater interest actually is the arc the film traveled in terms of its critical and audience reception.  Actually, this phenomenon can be easily charted by scrolling through the reviews of the film found on either imdb.com or amazon.com.  If you look first at the earliest evaluations of the film - when it was still an unknown entity riding the film festival circuit - you will note the almost universally rapturous response the movie received from viewers caught off guard by the originality of its concept and the uniqueness of its execution.  However, if you continue to scroll through the reviews with the passage of time, you will notice a rather extraordinary development that occurs.   At about the time the film officially opens to immense media scrutiny and unprecedented box office success, the reviews suddenly undergo an amazing change in tone.  Due to the buildup of expectations resulting from the above elements, viewers begin to tear the film apart, mercilessly declaring it to be cheapjack, annoying, hopelessly overrated and totally lacking in terror or suspense.  Rarely have I ever seen such a violent backlash against any film (though just try to find someone who will admit to liking `Titanic' nowadays - one begins to wonder just who were all those people who collectively managed to fork over all that cash to the tune of $600,000,000 in the United States and Canada alone).  In many ways, though `The Blair Witch Project' may have made a ton of money (it is easily the most profitable film ever made), it may ultimately have been a pyrrhic victory for its makers since an audience that feels it has been `ripped off' once is not one who will be favorably inclined towards your next project.Perhaps this helps to explain the dismal box office performance of the sequel, awkwardly entitled `Book of Shadows Blair Witch Project 2.'  As one who actually liked the original film (and, yes, I saw it long after the initial media hype had died down), I can't say that I expected much from this newest addition to the franchise.  The first film was such a unique work stylistically that, even less than most films, it definitely did not cry out for replication.  Actually, this new film starts off rather well, choosing to acknowledge the reality of not only the original project but also the media ballyhoo and frenzy that attended it.  The film cleverly lampoons the cottage industry that sprang up around the first film, catering to tourists who descended in droves on the once-peaceful town of Burkittsville, Maryland, where the original fictional `documentary' was set. Taking over the reins from the first film's creators, writer Dick Beebe and writer\/director Joe Berlinger create a scenario in which a group of fans, obsessed with the original film, embark on a `Blair Witch' tour that, naturally, turns out to be more than they bargained for.  By eschewing fancy special effects of any kind and hewing closely to the `reality' conferred by its documentary style approach, the original film managed to convey a real sense of mounting terror as the people involved became more and more terrified and confused by what was happening to them.  The makers of the sequel attempt to create essentially the same impact here but with far less effectiveness.  Part of the problem is that the demands made on a big budget studio production are obviously worlds apart from those made on a small independent film in which experimentation and imagination are often allowed - and even, at times, encouraged - to flourish.  As a result, the makers of the new film violate the very less-is-more credo that made the original film work in the first place.  Thus, as these new characters begin to spiral down into confusion, terror and madness, we are offered a plethora of quick cut glimpses of demons, ghosts, flashbacks etc. that are more distracting than terrifying.  We could believe what was happening to the characters in the original film because the single-camera technique made it all seem so plausible and real.  This film just feels like the typical stock horror film, filled with fancy techniques but little of the stuff that true nightmares are made of.  More often than not, the viewer feels more like laughing at the silliness of the proceedings than gasping.  Eventually, even the dialogue seems to be providing an almost subconscious running commentary on the film itself as the characters yell out at various points such pearls of wisdom as `This is too weird' and `This makes no sense.'The story does a nice job at the end showing how what is captured on film or tape may not necessarily correlate with the facts of history.  And, I guess, we are also encouraged to read the film in two ways - as both a genuine horror story in which the Blair Witch is somehow exercising her supernatural powers or as a study of mass psychosis playing havoc with a group of emotionally off-kilter people.

Needless to say, I loved it at the time. And even when I saw it again recently it worked for me. Jurassic Park may not be up there with Raiders of the Lost Ark or Aliens, it's still reasonably solid entertainment. I thought The Lost World was a complete dud. One of the reasons I wasn't really that interested in a third instalment of the series. When Spielberg hired Joe Johnston (I hated Jumanji) to fill the director's chair my interest almost much died completely. Almost, because I did decide to go see it.And for the umpteenth time this summer I was disappointed. The first twenty minutes are character exposition (read cardboard exposition) scenes. A lot has been made of the film's short running time. The strange thing is, it doesn't feel that short. Those first scenes are so badly written (I doubt if there's a single worthwhile line of dialogue throughout, actually) you'll think you've been sitting in the theatre for an entire hour. After that I thought the movie would pick up, but after five good minutes the pace dropped again and it becomes one of those tedious 'wait-for-the-action' type films. Worst of all is what the screenwriters have chosen to fill the action gaps with dull character interplay, rather unbelievable (and completely unnecessary) revelations about the raptors and even the introduction of the obligatory kid (a device which has been over- and misused after Aliens). On top of that there doesn't seem to be any effort on Johnston's part to keep the tension sustained between attacks.Now, you could just chalk a lot of the un-amazingness up to over-exposure to CG dinosaurs, with the BBC's Walking With Dinosaurs and Disney's Dinosaur (a project which really should have been made silent and by Paul Verhoeven) having been released since The Lost World. But that's not it. The set-pieces here play more like traditional action sequences without requiring the audience to go 'ooh' and 'aah' at the latest in virtual vermin (although there still are a couple of those shots slotted in). So lack of wonder isn't the problem. What is? Try rushed editing, shocks that don't shock and no suspense whatsoever. I can take bad dialogue, a downright stupid storyline and cardboard characters in a summer blockbuster, but I do expect the set-pieces to be either ultracool or nerve-wrecking.

Honest to God, I felt tears coming to my eyes seeing (and hearing) it. This opening is enough of a reason for watching the film in the movie-theater instead of waiting for it to come out on video. It was great!The first half of the movie has a very interesting plot showing how Alan Grant has figured out more about the Raptors' way of communicating. At the same time he is scared to death only thinking about returning to the island in order to find out more about the dinosaurs, until a rich couple pays him to be their guide in an airplane guide over Isla Sorna.

They get scared and give you enough information to find another, slightly more involved, shady perp. You find that perp and repeat. And repeat. And repeat. It takes four different variations on this theme before I realized that nothing was actually happening in Boiling Point.Boiling Point begins with a nice premise. Jimmy Mercer (Wesley Snipes) is a federal officer whose partner is killed in a poorly executed bust. He's given seven days to kill the killer before he gets demoted from the Los Angeles office to, horror of horrors, Newark. At the same time, life-long crook Red Diamond (Dennis Hopper) is given seven days to pay off his debt to a mobster. He tries to work up a scheme with his old prison buddy Runnie (Viggo Mortensen). Red and Jimmy have intersecting lives, you see. They pass each other at a luncheonette. The use adjoining urinals. They're unlucky in love. They frequent the same high class hooker (Lolita Davidovich). And, well, it was Red and Ronnie who killed Jimmy's partner. So we know that they're bound to meet in the end.In some ways, despite the settings, Boiling Point is a surprisingly down-to-earth old fashioned film. There's no sex. The violence is muted. The language is only slight. The debt Red owes the mobster is only $50,000. The peripheral crimes are only counterfeiting. It's all so very small and restrained. This movie could have been made in the 40s or 50s, a period conjured up by the nostalgic scenes dancing at The Palace.It's fitting, then, that Boiling Point was directed by James B. Harris, who's something of an old-timer himself. Harris produced several of the old classic Kubrick films including Lolita and the similarly themed masterpiece The Killing. Harris has only directed periodically, helming James Woods in 1987's Cop and 1982's Fast Walking as well as two other films in thirty years. He clearly intended for Boiling Point to been seen as a slow and involving character study of two men approaching an important deadline. There's not even a pretense of action. Basically Snipes and his partner (criminally underused Dan Hedaya) wander from one underworld functionary to another getting one tiny piece of information at a time. One guy tells them there's a guy. The next guy says he has red hair. The next guy says his name is Red Diamond. Etc. Meanwhile Snipes as two cryptic conversations with his ex-wife. Hopper goes out dancing twice with the prostitute. And somehow seven days pass. There's one very slow car chase. The Breakfast Club's Paul Gleason makes a brief appearance. And the film's only explosion is done in such clumsy slo-mo that you wonder why they bothered.And the point, I guess, is that cops and detectives and officers don't necessarily live sexy exciting lives. And that criminals are sometimes boring and innocuous as well. So what Harris does is take a normally wacky villain in Hopper and make him quiet and slow. And he takes an exceptionally vital physical actor in Snipes and makes him quiet and slow. And he takes a quirky dark actor in Mortensen and doesn't bother to give him a character. And the result is predictable. You can't get involved with any character for even a second. There's no sympathy and no and very little understanding. Nobody gives a bad performance, but the actors all seem handcuffed. I suspect this was intentional, but that doesn't make it compelling. The writing occasionally has an appealing grasp of the criminal jargon, but nobody seems to enjoy saying it.The lives of our characters keep weaving back and forth as they pass through the same spaces initially unaware of each other. For such a conceit to work, though, the film would have to be amazingly edited. The fact that the editing is just horrible is what finally deadens the movie. Never for a second does the film gain any kind of rhythm or pace.

I didn't even know what this film was about. All of a sudden I hear a familiar trumpet and horn melody in the opening credits and I was filled with joy. For these were the notes as composed by the late great Gustav Mahler. I quickly realized that this was going to be a film about one of my favorite composers and I was totally drawn into the film. Of course, though, this film is not about Mahler, but his wife Anna. The parts that included Gustav and Anna were wonderful. There was some honest passion going on that very few films I have seen lately have exhibited. The overall communication between the two near the end of Mahler's life was very gentle, bittersweet and very believable. Gorgeous work from Wynter and Pryce together. However the film gets considerably worst with each relationship Anna has after Mahler. Everything seems forced and rushed and consequential. It almost seems that Beresford was out to make a film about Mahler and then right in the middle of production he finds out the Mahler died much earlier than an erroneous script had told him. So he decides to  make a film about a confused female 'player' who only went out with successful men before having some success of her own. Oh well. Still though I had a good time with this film.

Transformers The Movie has two low points that I can think of. The first being that most (if not all) of the classic Autobots, such as Ironhide, Wheeljack, Ratchet, Prowl, Brawn, and Optimus Prime, and are replaced by new characters. Unfortunately, the writers didn't think they the fans would MISS the Autobots. The other low point sticking out in my mind is how bland the newer characters are. Ultra Magnus (Magnus is Latin for great. Ultra Great????

Perceptor is a nerd. And Blaster is the only decent one.
