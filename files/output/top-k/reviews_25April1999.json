[{"date":"25 April 1999","score":"","review":"  Election, though not a film receiving excellent press or publicity in the shadow of the Phantom's Menace's release, could quite possibly be the best satire seen so far in 1999. The movie bears a striking resemblance to the allegorical Primary Colors, invoking all the cynical and disturbing references to the American political culture. Indeed, as the story is set in a Middle-America high school, where convention is the norm, here it seems is the best place to demonstrate that no place is safe from dirty pool.Each scene is rife with some perverse allusion or innuendo. The actors all cultivate the appearance of victims while being predators to each other. Director Alex Payne has taken all that we as Americans hold dear about democracy and subjected it to our inner fears. The result is hilarious, disturbing, and ultimately too familiar. That being said, Election deserves the classification of satire as much as any movie certainly in this decade.
