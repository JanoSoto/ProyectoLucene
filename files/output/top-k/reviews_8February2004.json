Everyone knows they are made by sad people with planks of wood working in the middle of the night. That is apart from the simple circles that are caused by freak mini whirlwinds. Here we are expected to throw away such knowledge and start down the route of maybe, just maybe.Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest turned farmer who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife (oh flashing lights and heavenly choruses - will this come in to play later in the film!?). He lives on his semi-isolated farm with his two children and his brother and seems to have an ideal rural life before he becomes bothered by night time invaders who don't seem to be able to be caught.At several points this film fails to make any sense. This is America and better still an American farm and yet no guns are available. Equally this is a story where the real story is elsewhere, broadcast on TV and only partly explained. While not wanting to take on any film that goes down any route in telling a story - if you want to tell a story about overcoming then there are many routes. Why this one?What can you say without being a spoiler? Very little. If you have seen Close Encounters, War of the Worlds and The Birds then you will get the general idea of what the film is about. Although all the above films are good, I don't rate any of them as being classic because they are such simple plot devices that only work by expensive special effects.Here we have cheap special effects of the rattling doorknob variety that almost bring to mind a cheap Hammer horror film. There is, sadly, nothing new to offer just a lot of something-is-about-to-happen that, bizarrely, even the actors don't seem to be taking seriously!(Although how people act under real stress might well seem silly - so maybe I have to qualify that.)There is nothing really wrong with the film in terms of acting or production, but we have been here before. The director (Shyamalan) needs a bit of help - he is taking on too much himself. Taking an acting role in this film is by far the biggest mistake. He created a modern classic in the Sixth Sense, but - on the evidence here - he is running out of ideas fast and merely forming greatest hits tapes from other people's movies.

I borrowed this on DVD from a friend and didnt expect much. The first scene is inside an asylum, where the inmates go all crazy one night. The madness ends with the asylum burning down. The ghosts of the head doctor echoes into the future and the house becomes haunted. The house is the entire setting in this film, after a small introduction of the most important characters. I was alone watching this and when Marilyn Manson's version of Sweet Dreams thundered out of my home cienema speakers I got the feeling this wasnt an ordinary horror movie. And I was right. A party is taking place in the house, but people who shouldnt be there in the first place shows up. They are all connected somehow and they start dying... The movie is scary - for real, which is unsual today. It will keep you on the edge until the last 10 minutes when the true evil inside the house shows up. If the movie would have ended in the manner it begins and progresses it would have left me very uneasy. It didn't and I am somehow happy for that.If you want to scare yourslelf and bring someone with you into the horror, watch this!
