Yet to look at the trailer, the sci-fi fantasy aspect and the films title you could be fooled into thinking this might not be too bad. The title is pretty sweet if you ask me, definitely an 80's movie title right there.The plot is set in 2080 and mainly on the moon which is now called Little America. A location where gambling, girls, criminals and all things seedy are rampant, a bit like Las Vegas in the old days. Eddie Murphy is a retired smuggler who runs a nightclub on the moon and wants a quiet life, but this is all messed up when some goons come along and force Murphy out by destroying his club under the orders of a mysterious kingpin. Its now up to 'Pluto Nash' to find out why, who is the man behind it all and try to get his club back, or what's left of it.I think the first issue with the film are the visuals. The film is oldish but not that old and unfortunately the CGI effects are pretty poor. Shots of the moon, moving vehicles, the lunar surface and of course Little America just look average and obviously CGI. When we close in on the urban areas the sets aren't too bad in design but again its terribly obvious its all sets. It all looks like a very mediocre attempt at a 'Blade Runner-esque' grimy neon lit urban district. The colour palette doesn't really help with everything being grey and boring, yes I know its the moon and the moon is typically grey but come on. There were some nice 50's-esque designs on some buildings and vehicles though, there was that element throughout the film but it still felt drab and lifeless, virtually black and white.Then you have all the interior sets, design and costumes...its all grey!! everything is grey! flippin' eck!. Not only that but the interior designs look so dated, like its all been reused from a 60's TV sci-fi show. I understand that doesn't necessarily make it bad, there are plenty of examples where films have deliberately gone down the homage route or retro design\/vibe which can work wonders giving a great charm factor. The problem here is the film had a massive budget and you wonder what they actually used it on.Take the robot character played by Quaid (and the maid robot character). What they have done is simply apply a lot of makeup to Quaid to give him a doll-like appearance, then he merely acts out the robot role. Now again this can be done and it can work but probably best in low budget films that have little choice. In a big production it just tends to feel lackluster, the maid robot was the same but dressed up in a sexy French number as if that makes it more acceptable. I did quite like the 50's sci-fi sense I got from Quaid's robot though, like a butch Robbie the Robot in human form...kinda hehe.Whilst watching I also found the plot to be a tad confusing really, or at least it didn't make much sense because it was all a muddle of grey. There are a lot of character names flying about here, a lot of seemingly pointless stuff, aimless boring dialog and not much action believe it or not. We just move from one cheap looking grey set to the next with little to laugh, disappointing seeing as its supposedly a Murphy sci-fi action romp.But is it? you think it is but its not really, its more like a 1950's nightclub murder noir homage, 'Harlem Nights' in space perhaps. I must admit to thinking of 'Total Recall' at times whilst watching, it has that kind of vibe going on, minus all the excellent action and blood of course. Do I get the feeling this was made and acted the way it was on purpose?...was it?! I'm not sure, I'd like to think that but deep down I really doubt it. I just think it was a poorly executed movie which had potential to become a bit of a classic. I can see why people might enjoy bits of it like Quaid's cheesy robotic performance and the minor visual gags dotted throughout, but end of the day this really feels like its trying to achieve what 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' achieved.I'm still not really sure whether or not this film was intentionally made like a low budget sci-fi B-movie for artistic reasons, or it just came out that way.

Go travelling around the world? Go to college to study for your dream career? Get a job and save up for that new winter coat you wanted so bad? Or just sit around random bars and coffee shops and pock fun at everything and everybody, who has the unfortunate displeasure of stepping in your path. You just hate every guy on the face of the earth, That's not true; I just hate all these extroverted, pseudo bohemian losers. In that one quote alone you can almost summarise all that is Enid Coleslaw, one head of the two head pseudo intellectual, cynical, misfit heroines of Ghost World. Enid Coleslaw is a walking talking cliché, who the more we get to know her the more realise that she is the very thing she hates them most, and is the epitome of what the quote says, except swap bohemian for punk wannabe and you have her down to a tee. Then you have Rebecca Dopplemeyer played by Scarlett Johansson, who also indulges in mocking all of the mere mortals in the unnamed town, but unlike Enid she has possess a lot more maturity and a better grasp who she truly is, as well as the attention from most of the guys, which is a fact Enid secretly can't stomach and most always step in to crush any possibility from love ever blossoming &#x96; what are friends for right?. The two together act as the villains of the film, slowly but surely making everyone's life as misery, even sweet old Seymour (who has a strong resemblance to Gollum from LOTR) who is the hero of this little story, which is pretty big fete seeing that Steven Buscemi who played a crazed lunatic serial killer in Con Air could be made to look like a good guy, just shows who you're dealing with in concerns to these terrible twosome. Even their first meeting was purely down to one of their mean pranks, as they coax Seymour into a 1950's inspired dinner that - plays nothing but hip hop, claiming to be the women he was searching for in the lonely hearts sections of a newspaper, only for him to turn up and find her not there &#x96; poor Seymour. But Enid doesn't count on soon becoming obsessed ( maybe even falling in love) with this weird little man and his weird little world; swamped in old vinyl's, useless junk and old pictures of racist fast food mascots he can't get rid off &#x96; which I'm pretty sure makes Seymour a hoarder. Whilst at the mean time the rest of Enid's life seems to be crumbling around her, and even the special friendship she shared with Rebecca isn't safe, as it slowly begins to disintegrate as their lives move in entirely different directions. But this the sort of rich characterisation that makes Daniel Clowes script such a walking paradox, mixing cult humour with mainstream charm, which appears as a even more impressive of fete when you realise that the film was based on Daniels originally created underground comic book sensation, under the same name, then with the help of director\/ co writer Terry Zwigoff, known best for Bad Santa, they were then able to adapt the work into a commercially and critically successful piece of cinema, that effortlessly stands out by itself as a masterpiece on its own merits, completely separate from its comic book source. I loved the film so much, probably one of my favourite cult comedies; up there with the likes of Wayne's World, Big Lebwoski and Clerks. My favourite aspect were the two main characters, who made it almost difficult to hate them for two long, because as much as it may seem too easy and warranted dislike both Enid and Rebecca, but the more you dive deeper inside the minds of both girls, the more you find them endearing and lovable, because at the end of the day they are just too young girls trying to find out who they are and where they fit in this big wide world &#x96; aren't we all deep really? But as good as Scarlett Johansson (also known for Lost In Translation and Her) was at playing Rebecca when considering especially that at the time of shooting she was only 16; which I find very difficult to wrap my head around, because she played the role with so much maturity meaning that not once did she over act in any of her scenes, thus making her performance seem every time to appear so natural and thus that little bit more believable. At the end of the day I still preferred Thora Birch as Enid, because I feel Thora despite playing a similar type of cynical character as she did so well in American Beauty, in Ghost World you can really tell that she had developed well and greatly improved as an actress; bring a fresh new perspective and exuberance to her acting arsenal. If you are a fan of larger than life characters, a gripping coming of age tale and laughs galore; then sitting on your sofa on a Friday night, with Ghost World playing on your TV, would quiet possibly the single greatest achievement of your life.

But this the sort of rich characterisation that makes Daniel Clowes script such a walking paradox, mixing cult humour with mainstream charm, which appears as a even more impressive of fete when you realise that the film was based on Daniels originally created underground comic book sensation, under the same name, then with the help of director\/ co writer Terry Zwigoff, known best for Bad Santa, they were then able to adapt the work into a commercially and critically successful piece of cinema, that effortlessly stands out by itself as a masterpiece on its own merits, completely separate from its comic book source. I loved the film so much, probably one of my favourite cult comedies; up there with the likes of Wayne's World, Big Lebwoski and Clerks. My favourite aspect were the two main characters, who made it almost difficult to hate them for two long, because as much as it may seem too easy and warranted dislike both Enid and Rebecca, but the more you dive deeper inside the minds of both girls, the more you find them endearing and lovable, because at the end of the day they are just too young girls trying to find out who they are and where they fit in this big wide world &#x96; aren't we all deep really? But as good as Scarlett Johansson (also known for Lost In Translation and Her) was at playing Rebecca when considering especially that at the time of shooting she was only 16; which I find very difficult to wrap my head around, because she played the role with so much maturity meaning that not once did she over act in any of her scenes, thus making her performance seem every time to appear so natural and thus that little bit more believable. At the end of the day I still preferred Thora Birch as Enid, because I feel Thora despite playing a similar type of cynical character as she did so well in American Beauty, in Ghost World you can really tell that she had developed well and greatly improved as an actress; bring a fresh new perspective and exuberance to her acting arsenal. If you are a fan of larger than life characters, a gripping coming of age tale and laughs galore; then sitting on your sofa on a Friday night, with Ghost World playing on your TV, would quiet possibly the single greatest achievement of your life. A must see all cool kids and misfits alike.

Some people are thoroughly entertained by his exuberant on-screen persona, whilst others believe he's too outrageous to be found funny. Personally, I have never come to a conclusion.The first movie I saw was 'The Cable Guy', one of the popular mid 90\u2032s comedies that began to shape his style, helping him become the household name that he is today.'The Cable Guy' revolves around Steven (Matthew Broderick), a designer who relocates after an unexpected breakup with his girlfriend, Robin (Leslie Mann). Tempted by the idea of illegal television, he contacts Chip Douglas (Jim Carrey) who becomes increasingly involved in every aspect of his life. When Steve attempts to terminate the 'friendship', Chip goes out of his way to make his life a hell.The movie has a darker sense of humour than Carrey's previous roles as he walks the line between insanity and loneliness. He builds upon his usual performances as his character flits between various television references at a speed, clearly showing a man who has been deprived of a proper childhood. My only gripe being that it didn't expand on this a little further so that the audience could build more of a connection with the character, perhaps showing more of his solitude rather than just his excessive search for acceptance. However this isn't what the film set out to achieve.This is primarily a comedy and it works well doing just that but it veers incredibly close to horror at times as Jim drifts between overly- devoted friend to a complete psychopath. With surprise appearances from the likes of Jack Black and Owen Wilson, I was taken aback by their lack of screen time. Jack isn't even part of any of the laughs, playing more of a concerned friend overall whilst Wilson, who I am no particular fan of anyway, only appears in one scene.'The Cable Guy' is an early example of Jim Carrey trying to develop himself as an actor and whilst it isn't too far from his quirky roles like 'Ace Ventura' or 'The Mask', it showed his potential and how he could try to distance himself slightly from his average goofy portrayals prior to him being involved in later films such as 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or the less successful 'Number 23\u2032. It wasn't a perfect film although it did give some satisfaction in knowing that his acting range is more varied than I was led to believe by others as he had moments where he truly shined.

Of course, it's a fun film and Christopher Reeve will always be the standard that cinematic Men of Steel will be measured by. He looks powerful and radiant in his costume. He makes an iconic Superman. Further, Reeve balances out his Superman with Clark Kent and does a good job of differentiating these two individuals. He behaves like a square head when he plays Kent, while he is firm, confident, and naturally in control as Superman. He isn't overbearing, but he has a businesslike attitude. He manages to be both personable. Donner and Godfather novelist Mario Puzo have crafted the ultimate origins movie. Essentially, Superman is the grandfather of all costume-clad superhero sagas on the silver screen. Remember, Kirk Alyn had cleaved the airwaves as the serial Superman in the late 1940s and early 1950s, while George Reeves, no relation to Christopher, forged his image of Superman into the hearts and minds of television audiences for the better part of the 1950s. Reeve's Superman constituted the first to appear in a colorful costume. Everybody else had been confined to black and white. Donner and Puzo make the Krypton prologue look visually intriguing and on a far grander scale than either the serials or television series could. However, nothing has changed in substance other than the three Kyptonians that Jor-El sentences to prison sentences before running himself aground the disbelief of his peers when he informs them about Krypton's doomed future. The starship that Jor-El sends his infant son into Earth looks like a gigantic Christmas ornament of crystals. Crystals play an important part in this adventure. We follow Superman as an infant found by Martha and Jonathan Kent, who grows up into teenagers and then leaves the farm on foot to walk to his Fortress of Solitude in the north's frigid regions. Later, he winds up in New York City as a reporter for The Daily Planet where Managing Editor Perry White (Jackie Cooper) with Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and photographer Jimmy Olsen. Eventually, Superman runs afoul of evil Lex Luthor who obtains a specimen of Kryptonite from Africa. Lex wants to blast the California coast at the San Andreas Fault so it will vanish in the ocean and he will be the owner of the new coast that he can sell for a fortune. First, Lex and his cohorts must reprogram the rockets. Second, they need to take out Superman. Lex sets out hero up so that he opens the crate containing the kryptonite and suffers horribly.Altogether, Superman definitely rates as an above-average movie with a memorable performance from Christopher Reeve.

And while Another 48 Hrs is not as good as the original,the film is still a solid sequel.Set seven years after the original,Another 48 Hrs finds Jack Cates(Nick Nolte)trying to track down and nail a drug lord named The Iceman,a drug dealer who has been operating in San Francisco. With nowhere to turn,Jack needs help once again from Reggie Hammond(Eddie Murphy)who's been in prison for five years and is about to get out. The only problem is that The Iceman wants Reggie dead. Now,Jack and Reggie have Another 48 Hrs to bring down The Iceman and with Jack and Reggie the boys are back in town with more laughs and thrills.Released in 1990,Another 48 Hrs is an entertaining sequel that not only came out 8 years after the excellent,landmark Action-Comedy classic 48 Hrs but also came out after the Box Office success of the first two Lethal Weapon films. While Another 48 Hrs was a Box Office success,the film received a mixed reaction from film critics who felt Another 48 Hrs was too much like the original and while this film isn't very creative or truly groundbreaking like the first film it's still a fun and thrilling movie that entertains you for 95 minutes. Another 48 Hrs is a good Action-Comedy that pretty much taking what worked in the first movie and bringing it to this film mixing thrilling,intense Action with hilarious Comedy that is non-stop from beginning to end. The Comedy and Humor in Another 48 Hrs. is funny and will make you laugh out loud because the Humor is very much in line with the first film showing how Jack and Reggie deal with each other while looking for The Iceman and getting into various situations that are funny with Eddie Murphy being the funny guy and Nick Nolte being the straight one. Although the Comedy in Another 48 Hrs is funny,the Humor sometimes lacks the edge and politically incorrect tone the first one had. If there is one thing that is different and bigger from the first 48 Hrs it's the Action scenes. The Action scenes in Another 48 Hrs are not only amazing but are bigger and louder than they were in the first film because director Walter Hill(who was given a much bigger budget with this film)goes completely insane with the Action with each Action scene being more explosive than the last. Hill's Action scenes always feature people flying in the air or going through broken glass and while there is people flying in the air,there is more broken glass shattered in Another 48 Hrs than in any other Walter Hill film whether it's with windows or glass doors. There is enough Action,gunfights,explosions and thrills in Another 48 to satisfy any Action film and Walter Fill fan. The main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond show in this film that despite not seeing each other for seven neither one of them has changed since the last time they saw each other with the two still throwing funny jabs and insults at one another almost like they were never apart. Throughout the film we also see Jack and Reggie try to repair their friendship which has been strained(the two haven't seen each other in seven years)but as the film goes on and the two work together their partnership and friendship grows despite the funny lines the two throw at each other and the chemistry is still there. The ending of Another 48 Hrs is great and filled with Action,excitement and laughs and a twist you wont see coming at all. There is also a wonderful bit at the end that is a funny homage to the ending in the original film that will make you laugh. A great ending.The cast is terrific. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte are excellent once again as Reggie Hammond and Jack Cates,with Murphy and Nolte displaying great laughs and chemistry. Brion James is great as Kehoe,Cates' fellow cop and friend. Kevin Tighe is wonderful as Blake Wilson,an Internal Affairs cop that is on Jack's back. Ed O'Ross does a fine job as Frank Cruise,another San Francisco Cop. David Anthony Marshall(Willie Hickok),Andrew Divoff(Richard 'Cherry Ganz)and Ted Markland(Malcolm Price)are outstanding as the three murderous bikers. Bernie Casey is fantastic as Kirkland Smith,a fellow convict that Reggie owes a debt to. Brent Jennings is sensational as Burroughs,a man that works for The Iceman. Tisha Campbell(Amy Smith),Page Leong(Angel Lee)and Cathy Hasse(Girl Bartender)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is wonderful,with Hill always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Hill.The score by James Horner is great,intense and matches the tone of the film. Fantastic score,Horner. There is also the return of the classic song The Boys Are Back In Town by The Bus Boys and another version of the song by Jesse Johnson.In final word,if you love Action-Comedies,Walter Hill,Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte,I highly suggest you see Another 48 Hrs.,a terrific,Action-packed and funny Action-Comedy that will keep you entertained.

The Comedy and Humor in Another 48 Hrs. is funny and will make you laugh out loud because the Humor is very much in line with the first film showing how Jack and Reggie deal with each other while looking for The Iceman and getting into various situations that are funny with Eddie Murphy being the funny guy and Nick Nolte being the straight one. Although the Comedy in Another 48 Hrs is funny,the Humor sometimes lacks the edge and politically incorrect tone the first one had. If there is one thing that is different and bigger from the first 48 Hrs it's the Action scenes. The Action scenes in Another 48 Hrs are not only amazing but are bigger and louder than they were in the first film because director Walter Hill(who was given a much bigger budget with this film)goes completely insane with the Action with each Action scene being more explosive than the last. Hill's Action scenes always feature people flying in the air or going through broken glass and while there is people flying in the air,there is more broken glass shattered in Another 48 Hrs than in any other Walter Hill film whether it's with windows or glass doors. There is enough Action,gunfights,explosions and thrills in Another 48 to satisfy any Action film and Walter Fill fan. The main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond show in this film that despite not seeing each other for seven neither one of them has changed since the last time they saw each other with the two still throwing funny jabs and insults at one another almost like they were never apart. Throughout the film we also see Jack and Reggie try to repair their friendship which has been strained(the two haven't seen each other in seven years)but as the film goes on and the two work together their partnership and friendship grows despite the funny lines the two throw at each other and the chemistry is still there. The ending of Another 48 Hrs is great and filled with Action,excitement and laughs and a twist you wont see coming at all. There is also a wonderful bit at the end that is a funny homage to the ending in the original film that will make you laugh. A great ending.The cast is terrific. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte are excellent once again as Reggie Hammond and Jack Cates,with Murphy and Nolte displaying great laughs and chemistry. Brion James is great as Kehoe,Cates' fellow cop and friend. Kevin Tighe is wonderful as Blake Wilson,an Internal Affairs cop that is on Jack's back. Ed O'Ross does a fine job as Frank Cruise,another San Francisco Cop. David Anthony Marshall(Willie Hickok),Andrew Divoff(Richard 'Cherry Ganz)and Ted Markland(Malcolm Price)are outstanding as the three murderous bikers. Bernie Casey is fantastic as Kirkland Smith,a fellow convict that Reggie owes a debt to. Brent Jennings is sensational as Burroughs,a man that works for The Iceman. Tisha Campbell(Amy Smith),Page Leong(Angel Lee)and Cathy Hasse(Girl Bartender)give good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is wonderful,with Hill always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible direction,Hill.The score by James Horner is great,intense and matches the tone of the film. Fantastic score,Horner. There is also the return of the classic song The Boys Are Back In Town by The Bus Boys and another version of the song by Jesse Johnson.In final word,if you love Action-Comedies,Walter Hill,Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte,I highly suggest you see Another 48 Hrs.,a terrific,Action-packed and funny Action-Comedy that will keep you entertained. Highly Recommended. 9.5\/10.

That overwhelming necessity to really explore the deeper meaning of the movie. They don't just aim to entertain, but to challenge opinions and push people to comprehend short-comings in society.When the young, cocksure Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) moves to the city hoping for a more thrilling line of police work, a string of murders are set in motion. He is consequently partnered with the diligent veteran, Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) to resolve the case, forcing them to put aside their differences to end the sequence of events, only to become pawns on a much larger board.Throughout the feature you get the feeling that these are two very different walks of life, the generational divide in their work methods are shown clearly. Whilst Somerset is cultured, world-weary and methodical, Mills is very impulsive and head strong, aiming to make an impression within the force yet not having the same determination when investigating. A montage shows Pitt's character is struggling to concentrate at home, meanwhile, his elder is shown pouring over books in a library, making reasonable headway with the case.This is no buddy-cop movie, it's unrelenting and brutal throughout. Although all the murders happen off-screen, the events are retold via the crime scene investigations and photographic evidence which enhance the aura of mystery around the killer, building up to the final chilling performance by Kevin Spacey as their very own John Doe. Blank of regret and emotion, he fits the performance perfectly as you can see the criminal exuding delight as the detectives are forced to pursue him through the grisly cat and mouse game.One of the ways that Fincher expresses how twisted the city-living can become is by the similarities between the characteristics of the 'insane' Doe and the disciplined Somerset. They act as two parallel examples of how someone can deal with a poor hand. Where the detective originally set out to better the world via law enforcement, using his intellect to prevent misconduct, John Doe executes a series of pre- meditated murders using his knowledge as a message to the masses. Their cynical outlook on how humanity has become so apathetic is resolved in two completely polar ways, their likeness fascinates me.I believe that part of David Fincher's plan when filming this was to hold a mirror to modern society. For us to scrutinise why, when murders are committed, we show no empathy? Horrors and tragedies are a staple fixture of the world today and much like Fincher's 'Fight Club' adaptation, it questions the very core of how compassion seems to have become less predominant, replaced by a love for money, consumerism and our own well-being. How accustomed we have become to awful events described by various media outlets on a a daily basis. All roles perfectly delivered by all actors involved. The ending flawlessly ties all loose ends within the plot whilst delivering its distressing climax, undoubtedly still provoking debates over a decade after its initial release.
