[{"date":"21 March 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  When I first heard about this film, I had no desire to see it, dismissing it as merely an excuse for much blood and gore.  Later, I happened to catch the last twenty minutes or so on the Sci-Fi Channel, and could see that it had style, and that it just might be a worthwhile film after all.  Since it was not rerun since then, I finally rented a video of RAVENOUS, despite my weak stomach and the realization that the worst instances would not be edited.There was little to worry about on that count, as there is nothing in the film that should bother anybody, except the most sensitive viewer, beyond an initial few seconds.  Antonia Bird, the perceptive and talented director at the helm, has shown a remarkable and most welcome degree of restraint. Directors who use excessive gore usually do so in order to cover up the fact that they have no story.  Here, there is a very compelling story to tell, and there is no need for unnecessary excess.  For those of you looking for much more blood and gore, and disappointed by the relative lack therein, that's not an issue for me to comment on.  We'll leave that matter between you and your psychiatrist.The story that remains is still a sufficiently grim and grisly tale, with dashes of well-placed dark humor, punctuated by a truly offbeat music soundtrack.  It is c.1849, and a phony war hero named Boyd is posted far away to isolated Fort Spencer.  Besides the permissive and unassuming commander, Col. Hart, there is a small detachment of assorted personalities Reich, an enthusiastic gung ho type;  Toffler, an annoyingly weak-willed holy joe; Knox, a drunken doctor;  Cleaves, a blurry cook; and two Native Americans named George and Martha.  A stranger soon intrudes upon this setting, with his terrible account of cannibalism and people being held prisoner in a remote cave.A rescue group is then formed, consisting of Hart, Boyd, Reich,  Toffler, George, and the stranger, and sets out to find the cave.  Once there, events both inside and outside the cave reach a tense, pulse-pounding conclusion, as the true identity of the cannibal becomes known.  The scene is driven by a totally unsettling score playing in the background.  Then, surprisingly, the tension is eased or at least redirected, with a catchy banjo tune playing as the cannibalistic killer pursues hapless Toffler through the woods.  As Reich and Boyd give chase, some yodeling can be heard to accompany the banjos.  Who would think of that?  A twisted sense of humor is at play here, and it all works.Guy Pearce has the protagonist role of Boyd, a war hero who was not really a hero and is anything but heroic.  This actor is not meant to play run-of-the-mill good guys, but is at his best when playing troubled characters, tormented by their inner demons.  Such is the case here, when it is slowly revealed that some of Boyd's later actions are guided not so much by any cowardice but by something far different.  No one could have given this part the same emotional depth.Robert Carlyle, who can project sinister without hardly trying, creates an inspired incarnation of evil.  His dominating performance is actually four different characterizations.  First he's Calhoun, the supposed survivor of the ill-fated party that became stranded and resorted to cannibalism. Then he apparently deteriorates into a babbling idiot, unhinged as the rescue group approaches the cave where the atrocity took place.  Then he reveals himself to be the cannibal, a crafty, playfully murderous individual, who toys with his victims and exhibits a wild energy.  And finally, he turns up yet again, this time in the guise of the outwardly cultured Col. Ives.Jeffrey Jones gives another memorable performance, convincing and sympathetic as the well-meaning fort commander.  Of the other actors, only the intense Neal McDonough makes any impression, all too briefly effective as the recklessly fearless Reich.  Maybe parts of his role were trimmed, but David Arquette's Cleaves makes little sense career-wise unless he thought his performance as an 1849 doper would be hilarious.  It isn't.  He doesn't have much to do and is unable to do anything with it.  Jeremy Davies is equally forgettable as Toffler.  Joseph Running Fox and Sheila Tousey, as Native Americans employed at the fort, aren't given much to do either, but their undeniable presence adds a note of authenticity.However, after Boyd makes his big leap, the story literally has nowhere to go but down.  This is only a slight turn because the story is still compelling, just not quite as compelling as the first half of the film. The second half is unable to maintain the same tension, humor, and surprise, but that might have been an  impossible task.  In the latter part of the story, momentum is somewhat lost, and everything is almost (I said almost) bogged down by a lot of mumbo jumbo on the benefits of cannibalism (apparently curative, in addition to its revitalizing and addictive powers).But the climax is impressively destructive, a brutal and bloody confrontation between good and evil, here represented by the flawed Boyd and the ghoulish Ives.  Right up to the very end, it remains an open question as to which is the stronger man's sense of morality or his will to survive. Profound, eh?A unique and original, humorously macabre classic that will gain in reputation through the years.

I didn't guess the ending of the SIXTH SENSE, I had no idea who Keyser Soze was, and I didn't predict the twist in PRIMAL FEAR.  But with the BOURNE IDENTITY, it was perfectly obvious exactly who Jason Bourne worked for in the first five minutes, and in the first ten minutes it was clear what his job was.  I simply can't understand how people could call it suspenseful, much less confusing.  Frankly, I don't think Director Doug Liman meant to keep anything about Bourne secret from the audience.  And that is stupid, because whatever potential the movie had to generate tension and suspense depended on us being as clueless as Jason Bourne as to who he was.Compare this movie to THE MATRIX.  THE MATRIX is a pretty second-rate movie too, but it's good for its first half, for one reason we know no more than Neo does.  He doesn't know who Morpheus and Trinity are, or what they're up to, and neither do we.  The brief glimpse we got of Trinity just deepened the mystery.  In THE BOURNE IDENTITY, there is no mystery for us to penetrate; we're just waiting for Bourne to catch up to where we already are, which is simply an exercise in tedium.  This is aggravated by the fact that Bourne is pretty slow on the uptake.  By the time he got out of the Zurich bank, he should have realized that there were only two possibilities for what he was intelligence agent and professional criminal.  The audience, of course, doesn't even have that much uncertainty, since we are shown Bourne's employers early on.Very little thought went into this movie.  For instance, when Bourne discovers his pile of passports, each with a different identity attached, he should have had no way of determining which one was actually him, since he had no memory.  But he just guesses right, miraculously.  The Swiss police are shown as being unaware that a U.S. Embassy (not present in Zurich anyway) is sovereign U.S. territory.  The Marines guarding the embassy are shown as being unarmed until they get into the arsenal; I've never been to the Swiss embassy, but in Nicaragua the Marines carried their M-16 rifles in the very door of the embassy, and even in the consulates.The best I can say about Franka Potente is that she managed at times to distract me from the fact that she adds nothing to the story.  This movie should have been entirely Bourne's show, and she's there just to provide a love interest and to be a springboard for dialogue, because Liman is too lazy to provide exposition with just Bourne himself.  Julia Stiles is window dressing; the director obviously hasn't the foggiest idea what to do with his female actors.Anyway, THE BOURNE IDENTITY isn't a complete disaster. It gets markedly better in the second half; it's no more credible than before, but at least the stupidities, like Bourne's escape scene, have a payoff in thrills.  The acting is good by everybody.  Take a note of the small touches when Agbaje enters the morgue, his nostrils quiver as the smell hits him, and when Stiles hands over the information to the assassin, you can detect her fear of him even though he is on her side.  And it has a superior car chase scene.  The acting by everybody is good.Overall, the movie is tolerable, but the premise could have delivered a much better film.Rating ** out of ****.Recommendation  Action fans should catch it on TV.

This is a very disturbing movie that goes absolutely nowhere, adds nothing to the characters of Clarice Starling or Hannibal Lecter, features some terrible dialogue, and ends with a cruel joke that makes Hannibal considerably less likeable rather than a clever twist that makes him more appealing, as in the final scenes of The Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon. The film essentially follows two separate storylines, one involving an Italian detective in Florence trying to catch Hannibal for a reward, and the other involving Clarice (now played by Julianne Moore in a low-point of an otherwise amazing career) and her personal journey to catch her old friend\/foe. I found the scenes in Florence fascinating; Giancarlo Giannini is great as the aforementioned detective, and I genuinely felt for him as he misguidedly attempts to take on an unstoppable killer against his own (and Clarice's) better judgment. Also, Ridley Scott again achieves an amazing look for the film through timing the color a little off and interesting choices with cinematography, as he did in Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. His Florence is a gloomy, tragic playground for Hannibal, who makes the most of his freedom in a very tasteful city. Like in Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, however, Scott loses all sense of substance or suspense in favor of style. Gladiator worked as a mindless action film and Black Hawk Down as an utterly engrossing visceral battle experience, but Hannibal is not scary or suspenseful, which it probably should be. Instead of crafting actual suspense by hiding the gore as Jonathan Demme did in Silence and Brett Ratner did in Red Dragon, Scott throws effect out the window and underlines the gore. I'm sure at least one scene in this film will become the stuff of legend, and I had heard about it well before I actually saw the film. But the scene is effective only because it is disgusting, and for no other reason than that. As in his earlier (and best) work such as Alien and Blade Runner, Scott works best with grand operatic settings, such as the extraordinary sequences in Florence. But once he enters smaller spaces, such as FBI offices, train stations, and dining rooms, this film falls apart. Mamet's script doesn't help much either; the scene where Ray Liotta talks about why he thinks Hannibal is a queer is completely gratuituous and mindless, trying to force us to dislike this guy in order to justify the ending. Hopkins is great as usual, and fans of the Hannibal Lecter character will certainly get a cheap thrill out of seeing him on the loose. But the film is ultimately a failure, especially when you consider the deft use of Hannibal in the far superior Red Dragon which came out a year and a half later. The director of Alien and Blade Runner overshadowed by the director of The Family Man and Rush Hour? Ouch.

Hopkins is great as usual, and fans of the Hannibal Lecter character will certainly get a cheap thrill out of seeing him on the loose. But the film is ultimately a failure, especially when you consider the deft use of Hannibal in the far superior Red Dragon which came out a year and a half later. The director of Alien and Blade Runner overshadowed by the director of The Family Man and Rush Hour? Ouch.

When the monster first appears it is so GODDAMN frightening that you are just awestruck, along with the rest of the all male cast. It's that surreal theme of just a single repeated note.... It's the way the ending is left completely ambigious, something Hollywood seems to have forgotten how to do. Remember Contact? Why have we have 17 hours of footage comment at the end instead of leaving it ambigious, promoting eternal wonderment and use of your imagination to decide for yourself how it all turned out. The Thing is a wonderful, terrifying, utterly captivating what-if social experiment that far transends it's b movie, horror\/sci-fi categorization. In fact in that category it is it's Star Wars.

Marion has a run in with the hotel's eccentric proprietor, Norman Bates.The Review While I certainly can't refute Tedg's argument of this Psycho remake, I'm just putting my own two cents in. I saw the original, thought it was great, and now I see this, and I don't think it's a great film. It sounds weird for saying that, well believe me, I do think it's weird. I can't say I disliked this film either, because that would direct disrespect toward the original, which strangely, and not particularly original, is a shot by shot, near word for word remake of the Hitchcock film, that just didn't seem necessary. Why would Gus Van Sant, hot off his oscar nomination, decide to direct a remake of a film that's virtually untouchable. It's obvious that when you try to remake a film, there are inevitably going to be comparisons. But you shouldn't remake a film that still leaves an impact on contemporary movie audiences like Psycho, because regardless of what you try to do, the original will always eclipse the remake.This film is literally, one giant anachronism full of characters that seem as if they'd stepped off a bus from the late fifties, early sixties, and started living a normal, everyday life in the near Millenium, as they did in this film. The costuming, the dialogue, it all seems to go back to the original which I'm unsure of, might be a tribute, or a faithful recreation because of the remake. The casting is decent, although I always thought they could've gotten other actors to fill the roles. Nicole Kidman was offered a role in the film as Marion Crane, and I think she would've been a better choice, although Anne Heche was pretty well cast. Vince Vaughn, while a great actor, didn't seem to pull off the timidity that made the Norman Bates character so memorable, not to mention his physical frame. I think a person who would've been able to pull the role off much more convincingly, would be Jeremy Davies. It also seems to me that Joe Mantegna may not have been a bad choice to play Detective Abergast for the sometimes wisecracking detective who sees through and through, or George Clooney in the Sam Loomis role, but I'm speaking my mind and this is only an opinion. I will however say, that the casting of Robert Forster was an ideal choice as the doctor.Other than that, I praise Van Sant for taking the courage to remake the original, and I don't think it was his intent of making it a one upmanship competition, but more of a tribute to Hitchcock. Unfortunately, I don't think audiences nor critics understood his intent to honor the film.

Sure, the wardrobes change, but they're almost always filled with the same characters making the same stupid mistakes that are accompanied by the same scare tactics we've all seen a million times.  I'm beginning to curse that day in my twelfth year I bought a ticket to FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI - that was my first slasher, and I've been hooked ever since.  Sure, I may not see these in the theatre any more, but I still rent them all the time.  Hopefully, HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION will perhaps break this genre's hold on me; I'm getting tired of constantly questioning what I'm supposed to just accept in these movies.H20, the previous chapter in this series, was a wee bit better than average, with a satisfying ending; in my IMDb comments about it I wrote, I couldn't ask for a better conclusion; very chilling and appropriate (and it means they'll be no more sequels, I hope).  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I guess I deserve what I got.Let me understand how HR picks up after H20.  That was a medic whom Jamie Lee decapitated at the end of H20?  His larynx was crushed, so he couldn't save himself?  Riiight.  Do EMTs usually zip victims up in body bags before checking for a heartbeat?  Why didn't the medic just remove the mask before Jamie Lee separated him from himself?Besides the opportunity to shoehorn Jamie Lee into HR, I cannot see the reason for the prologue with her character in the hospital.  No mention is made of her son, or where this hospital is.  Is it in California (where H20 was set) or Illinois (where HR takes place)?  Or is Haddonfield now like the Simpsons' Springfield, existing wherever the plot needs it to?  Cut out the pre-title sequence, and the movie improves.And I don't get Jamie Lee's final line - one that's got so many whiskers on it that I thought it'd been retired.  She says to Michael, See you in hell!  Why would her character, Laurie Strode, believe she's going to hell? This exit line is the lamest I've ever heard for such a long-running icon, and the writers should be ashamed of offing her in such a routine, blasé and unceremonious way.  It was very disrespectful to both Jamie Lee and fans of the HALLOWEEN series.Moving on.  The plot of a horror sequel is of no consequence, so I'll ignore it for the most part in these comments; I'll just make note of other questions I pondered throughout this movie.  For example, I noticed that the email address of the heroine was Sara@HaddonU.org.  Just Sara?  Should we assume she's the only student at her school with that name?  Lucky her.Is the Myers house public property?  Who okayed this dangertainment to be webcasted from this house?  And wouldn't the police raise objections?Yeah, what about the police force in Haddonfield?  With all that's happened in this town over the years, one would think that the PD would be on extreme high alert every October 31, but they don't arrive at the Myers house until long after a 911 call; it took a deadly inferno that burned a building to the ground for them to respond.  If I lived in this town, I'd demand to know how my tax dollars were being spent.I'm also wondering why there was no reaction from the peanut gallery at the costume party to Henry Rowengartner's death.  It was clearly on camera; did the partiers take a mass bathroom break at that moment?I know, I know  I shouldn't ask questions like this during these types of movies.  I was occasionally able to put my complaints aside and enjoy some of HR.  Some of the suspense was actually pretty creative; I dug the idea of placing p.o.v. cameras on the actors, which produced some interesting shots.  The premise of the movie, unlikely as it may be, worked for the most part, as long as I didn't think too much about the logistics of it.As for the acting, the cast, with one exception, was adequate.  The one exception is, of course, Busta Rhymes. Why did the Razzies snub him?  Not since that bitch with the pearls in F13 PART VII have a wanted a horror movie character to die.  But did I get my wish?  Of course not.  Why, like LL Cool J in H20, does the has-been rapper survive?  When did B-level hip hop artists become our slasher saviors?

For nearly twenty years now I've been seeing basically the same movie.

I'm beginning to curse that day in my twelfth year I bought a ticket to FRIDAY THE 13TH PART VI - that was my first slasher, and I've been hooked ever since.  Sure, I may not see these in the theatre any more, but I still rent them all the time.  Hopefully, HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION will perhaps break this genre's hold on me; I'm getting tired of constantly questioning what I'm supposed to just accept in these movies.H20, the previous chapter in this series, was a wee bit better than average, with a satisfying ending; in my IMDb comments about it I wrote, I couldn't ask for a better conclusion; very chilling and appropriate (and it means they'll be no more sequels, I hope).  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I guess I deserve what I got.Let me understand how HR picks up after H20.  That was a medic whom Jamie Lee decapitated at the end of H20?  His larynx was crushed, so he couldn't save himself?  Riiight.  Do EMTs usually zip victims up in body bags before checking for a heartbeat?  Why didn't the medic just remove the mask before Jamie Lee separated him from himself?Besides the opportunity to shoehorn Jamie Lee into HR, I cannot see the reason for the prologue with her character in the hospital.  No mention is made of her son, or where this hospital is.  Is it in California (where H20 was set) or Illinois (where HR takes place)?  Or is Haddonfield now like the Simpsons' Springfield, existing wherever the plot needs it to?  Cut out the pre-title sequence, and the movie improves.And I don't get Jamie Lee's final line - one that's got so many whiskers on it that I thought it'd been retired.  She says to Michael, See you in hell!  Why would her character, Laurie Strode, believe she's going to hell? This exit line is the lamest I've ever heard for such a long-running icon, and the writers should be ashamed of offing her in such a routine, blasé and unceremonious way.  It was very disrespectful to both Jamie Lee and fans of the HALLOWEEN series.Moving on.  The plot of a horror sequel is of no consequence, so I'll ignore it for the most part in these comments; I'll just make note of other questions I pondered throughout this movie.  For example, I noticed that the email address of the heroine was Sara@HaddonU.org.  Just Sara?  Should we assume she's the only student at her school with that name?  Lucky her.Is the Myers house public property?  Who okayed this dangertainment to be webcasted from this house?  And wouldn't the police raise objections?Yeah, what about the police force in Haddonfield?  With all that's happened in this town over the years, one would think that the PD would be on extreme high alert every October 31, but they don't arrive at the Myers house until long after a 911 call; it took a deadly inferno that burned a building to the ground for them to respond.  If I lived in this town, I'd demand to know how my tax dollars were being spent.I'm also wondering why there was no reaction from the peanut gallery at the costume party to Henry Rowengartner's death.  It was clearly on camera; did the partiers take a mass bathroom break at that moment?I know, I know  I shouldn't ask questions like this during these types of movies.  I was occasionally able to put my complaints aside and enjoy some of HR.  Some of the suspense was actually pretty creative; I dug the idea of placing p.o.v. cameras on the actors, which produced some interesting shots.  The premise of the movie, unlikely as it may be, worked for the most part, as long as I didn't think too much about the logistics of it.As for the acting, the cast, with one exception, was adequate.  The one exception is, of course, Busta Rhymes. Why did the Razzies snub him?  Not since that bitch with the pearls in F13 PART VII have a wanted a horror movie character to die.  But did I get my wish?  Of course not.  Why, like LL Cool J in H20, does the has-been rapper survive?  When did B-level hip hop artists become our slasher saviors?

If they ever decide to make an adaption of John Steakley's Armor, I pray that they leave it out of the hands of John Carpenter.  Two John's don't make a right. HAHA.

Lea Thompson showed that she could do comedy & that she looked so good on a nude beach. I read someplace that when they first tested the film Lea & Dice did not get together as in the final version. The test audience wanted the unlucky Dice to get the girl in the end. I totally agree that ending would have been dumb if it just ended with DICE back in NYC alone. It needed to happen. All in all it was a good 80's flick. I still watch it when its on TV. For you tv version buffs, the TV edit has more scenes with Lea & Victoria outside of Lea bedroom after she makes it with that bad actor wannabe. Do I smell a directors cut?
