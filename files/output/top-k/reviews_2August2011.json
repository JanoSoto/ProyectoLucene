So we're in a space shuttle and everything seems all futuristic and weird, the camera's making a lot of use out of the hand-held, shake to create a feeling of panic and we crash land on this deserted planet with three suns, creating an extremely off-putting filter, you'll be wishing it would just hurry up and turn pitch black! The filters are really awful and in bad taste, the range from an over exposed goldy filter to a strange black and white looking blue filter which doesn't really make sense, it's as if the directors just putting them there because he can. We are then introduced to far too many characters that we lose track of and therefore don't particularly care about! The least one being the hero Riddick, played by the lack-luster Vin Diesal who thinks that he looks cool by wearing swimming goggles in the middle of the desert! I thought he was about to jump into a pool or something! Anyway, he's annoying and egotistical there's no way we can like him especially as the other characters make out he's the bad guy anyway!After a long wait (about an hour) the film eventually revs up a bit, the planet plunges into darkness so we can get rid of the blinding filters and we're treated to poorly animated aliens and the film then plays out as one big rip-off of Aliens in the dark! This swarm of creatures attack the group as we egg them on to, however Imust admit there were times of excitement and some parts were well-paced.But when all is said and done Pitch Black is Aliens with a clunky screenplay and just plain weird directing!

Mike (Favreau) is a down on his luck actor and comedian who is heartbroken over his lack of contact with his girlfriend of six years. His best friend, Trent (Vaughn), tries desperately to help him out by taking him out on the town and getting him back in the game. The film follows Mike, Trent, and their other screwball friends as they invade the neo-lounge scene looking for chicks, booze, and a good time. It surely sounds like a dull concept that can't go anywhere, but with the fast driving dialogue and hip acting the film becomes a masterpiece of suave and a pitch perfect portrayal the Los Angeles night life.Slick, smooth, and suave. That's what Swingers is. But it's not a film that gets too wrapped up in itself and it never forgets that it is a comedy. And what a comedy it is! Even in its most seemingly sincere moments Swingers is still hysterical, whether through irony or satire. It's also a higher quality brand of humor. It is true wit and true intelligence used to get a big laugh. This is a movie where you have to be hip to pop culture as there are a lot of movie references and things like that. If you don't get the reference then you don't understand the joke, thus you feel left out. But if you are savvy with those types of things then you will surely love Swingers for all of its clever humor used in uniquely hilarious ways.This film really succeeds not because it is just really funny, but because it follows a golden rule of comedy. Characters. Most of the time the characters in a comedy will do certain things just to get a laugh and they are things no normal person would ever do. Rather than actual human characters they are more vehicles for ridiculous jokes and situations. Swingers, on the other hand, does not fall victim to this common comedy occurrence. What's so great about the film is that the characters are all so real and convincing. When I watch this movie I feel like I am watching Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn out at a bar enjoying themselves. The characters in this film talk, act, and interact exactly how you would expect a group of young guys like them to act. Nothing is forced or over the top in this movie. Swingers is a film that produces an uncanny amount of authenticity, with incredibly entertaining results.This is a film all about the characters and dialogue. If it hadn't hit those two elements right on the nose then it wouldn't be half the amazing film that it is. I loved every second of this 90 minute film and I'm sure I'll spend plenty of time quoting the movie, calling this and that So money! Seldom do you find comedies this smart and this hilarious at the same time. This film only furthers my longing to live in LA now that I've seen such a perfectly authentic portrayal of the bouncing and wild night life that Swingers details.

Yes, Swamp Thing. For real. Wes Craven really directed a Swamp Thing movie.Showing the world that he was capable of handling more than just mutants and lowlifes, Craven set to adapting the comic series of the same name to film. The results? Well, let's just say there's some mutants, some lowlifes and a topless Adrienne Barbeau. Not a bad mix if one may say so.Meet Dr. Alec Holland. Holland, played by the great Ray Wise, is a scientist who likes spending his free time bogged down in the swamp. On the verge of an ecological breakthrough, he is tragically transformed into a hideous yet unstoppable mutant. Treading water and stomping through the bayou, it's up to him to help save a beautiful colleague (Barbeau) from certain danger while trying to come to terms with his rubber suit&#x85;I mean his new body.The film is mostly harmless fluff. Craven has his heart in the right place, and even when the film misfires (as it so often does) it's hard not to love it regardless. Barbeau absolutely steals the show and runs with it, although it must be noted that in the short time he spends on film, Ray Wise delivers a charming and wholly human performance. David Hess also pops in to do what he does best playing a merciless thug. There's also a score by Harry Manfredini at hand that evokes images of Crystal Lake, but for the purposes of this film, let's just call it Crystal Marsh. Also, look out for a cameo from the elusive Manbearpig towards the end of the film.In the end, Swamp Thing is far from the finest comic adaptation, but then again, it's not the worst either. Fact of the matter is that it's a harmless and enjoyable affair, provided one is in the appropriate state of mind. Filled to the brim with oddball characters (Jude deserves his own spin-off) and goofy monster antics, Swamp Thing is an odd creature that you can't help but adore.
