After seeing this movie you start to realize that there was a purpose to integrating black and white and color. A main theme of the movie was living life to its fullest, taking the good with the bad, taking a chance once and awhile. Tobey Maguire's speech at the end when he talks about sweeping things under the rug and basically acting pleasant all the time isn't the right way to live. It is a part of life that bad things happen. When you show yourself having passion its going to come with positive outcomes and negative, when you keep in the passion for the sake of being kind or cordial it becomes a empty life. Its a everlasting key to the human condition. People quite often fear change, its universal from beginning to end of time. The film does a great job of showing this fear and when society comes together they grow as a society and it becomes a good thing even when scary. The transitioning from black and white to color expressed this fear perfectly. Some would say that the director is promoting promiscuity, out of wedlock sex. Although there was a suggestion of a point about openness and not conceal ones feelings. Reese Witherspoon's character was already promiscuous but when she finished a book with no pictures the act of completing something and changing her behavior is what changed her into color. The catalyst of people changing in the movie is the eagerness to experience new things and to become vulnerable. I feel that movies like Pleasantville confront the viewer and compel them to think are very rare in today's world of Hollywood movies. Which should be treasured by any avid film-goer. To wrap this all up this is more than the old way and the new way after change. We need to see ourselves inside and out. If you live a life that is stuck and not changing then what you get is black and white. It is when we allow ourselves to mature as people that we are granted with the ability to see in colors or outside the box. The town is only opened up to the rest of the world when everyone is in color and then they are all able to travel outside the few streets in town. Its odd how everyone knows what color is but then don't want it or change when it appears everywhere.

I'm not going to point out the differences because you can get the book and read for yourself. But what we have is a young man Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) making up his own mind contrary to what his parents want, primarily his father, to join the military and become a citizen. However he must graduate from school. He has four main friends Carmen (Denise Richards), Dizzy Florez (Dina Meyers) and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris). While friends they each have their own unique talents and interest. All four enlist in the military or the Federation. Rico and Flores to the Mobil Infantry, Carmen to the Fleet Academy and Carl to Military Intelligence.They each go off to their respective training elements to gain the knowledge and skills they will each need to succeed. Rico becomes a Squad Leader but during a live fire exercise one of his squad members is killed. The end result he receives disciplinary punishment. He receives 10 lashes. Which makes no sense to me in a society so educated can fly to the stars and communicate anywhere with no time delay they use lashing as a form of punishment. In the meantime Carmen is on her spaceship. She has just made a course correction which is more efficient. Some individuals feel this was a mistake on her part because it put her ship in direct line with the asteroid that eventually struck earth and destroyed Buenos Aires. That's just nonsense how was Carmen to know that was to occur. When it did occur, in my opinion she responded coolly and confidently. Her actions saved most of the ship and preserved her shipmates. Naturally her Captain should compliment her. Most pilots will tell you that flying is hours of boredom punctuated by moments of stark terror.Eventually the Federation realizes the mistake of landing directly Klandanthu the Sky Marshall resigns and a new one is appointed with a different plan. While on Klandanthu Rico was severally wounded and was listed as KIA ( killed in action). When he was actually placed in a rehab tank so the wound is leg could be repaired. When he gets out Ace Levy, Dizzy and Rico are assigned to the Roughnecks. Sort of equivalent to Army Rangers or Marine Recon.It's while in this group that Rico is first promoted Corporal, then to Sergeant and eventually Lieutenant. It is at that rank that he rescues Carmen and is responsible for capturing a brain bug. The bug responsible for controlling all the other bugs. I'm not about to get into the mind of Heinlein and state what the bugs represented. The book is great read and the movie is a great movie. Make of each what you want. The movie is out on DVD and if you subscribe to Netflix and stream it you can get the movie that way as well. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2012","score":"","review":" What a great movie.

With Gonzo taking on the role of Charles Dickens and Rizzo the rat taking on the role of Rizzo the Rat, the pair act as our guides through want is one of the most charming Christmas movies I know.Trying to talk about this film is like trying to decide which packet from a box of Options to have first. It's all so good! OK&#x85; The music. I'll start with the music. From the opening number (Scrooge) we're treated to hearty, well written tunes that you can join in with by the second chorus. It's genuinely difficult to highlight a stand out number as they are all utterly charming. From Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley, to Scrooge regaling us with 'Thankful Heart' via the Ghost of Christmas Present singing 'It Feels Like Christmas' every song is fantastic. Disclaimer That's not actually true. In the original cinematic release and the VHS version there is a song sung by young Scrooge and Belle called 'When Love is Gone'. While it still exists on the closing credits &#x96; in a inferior version sung by Martina McBride &#x96; it has been cut from the widescreen DVD release. OK, the song wasn't great, but I don't agree with the cut, mostly because now the scene is rather jarring, with Belle rather softly accusing Scrooge of no longer loving her and then suddenly departing, leaving Rizzo in tears. It feels like the hack job it is.Golly I hate finding flaws in this film, so lets move onto the acting. Pleasingly it's mostly the Muppets here, but with them is Michael Caine as the man himself Scrooge. Now it might be easy to forget that, back in 1992, Sir Michaels career hadn't exactly been shining for the past decade. In fact he had been in some tosh and hadn't really done himself any favours with his performances. However this movie was, far and away, his best in ten years. He is stupendous! Something else great that this movie does is make Tiny Tim likable. I don't know about you but in most versions of a Christmas Carol I just want to punch the kid. They are normally either not that tiny, or to young to give a convincing performance and, no matter what, I almost always feel sorry for the other Cratchet children as they are forgotten in favour of their saintly brother. But because in this version Tim is a Muppet well&#x85; it's OK! It actually works! Though I do get frustrated when I see the Cratchets living in a nicer house than I have&#x85; This movie is a crafted piece of Christmas merriment. With so much going on in each shot you do not get board with repeated viewing, a 'must' for an annual favourite, it stays fairly true to the book, which again is good as, in my opinion, if you're going to start messing around with a work of genius you want to be *really* sure you can improve on it.

Every element of this screams class. Even from the opening shot as the camera pans over a model of Victorian London crafted to a level of detail I'd expect from some modelling fetishist you know that you are in very safe hands. With Gonzo taking on the role of Charles Dickens and Rizzo the rat taking on the role of Rizzo the Rat, the pair act as our guides through want is one of the most charming Christmas movies I know.Trying to talk about this film is like trying to decide which packet from a box of Options to have first. It's all so good! OK&#x85; The music. I'll start with the music. From the opening number (Scrooge) we're treated to hearty, well written tunes that you can join in with by the second chorus. It's genuinely difficult to highlight a stand out number as they are all utterly charming. From Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley, to Scrooge regaling us with 'Thankful Heart' via the Ghost of Christmas Present singing 'It Feels Like Christmas' every song is fantastic. Disclaimer That's not actually true. In the original cinematic release and the VHS version there is a song sung by young Scrooge and Belle called 'When Love is Gone'. While it still exists on the closing credits &#x96; in a inferior version sung by Martina McBride &#x96; it has been cut from the widescreen DVD release. OK, the song wasn't great, but I don't agree with the cut, mostly because now the scene is rather jarring, with Belle rather softly accusing Scrooge of no longer loving her and then suddenly departing, leaving Rizzo in tears. It feels like the hack job it is.Golly I hate finding flaws in this film, so lets move onto the acting. Pleasingly it's mostly the Muppets here, but with them is Michael Caine as the man himself Scrooge. Now it might be easy to forget that, back in 1992, Sir Michaels career hadn't exactly been shining for the past decade. In fact he had been in some tosh and hadn't really done himself any favours with his performances. However this movie was, far and away, his best in ten years. He is stupendous! Something else great that this movie does is make Tiny Tim likable. I don't know about you but in most versions of a Christmas Carol I just want to punch the kid. They are normally either not that tiny, or to young to give a convincing performance and, no matter what, I almost always feel sorry for the other Cratchet children as they are forgotten in favour of their saintly brother. But because in this version Tim is a Muppet well&#x85; it's OK! It actually works! Though I do get frustrated when I see the Cratchets living in a nicer house than I have&#x85; This movie is a crafted piece of Christmas merriment. With so much going on in each shot you do not get board with repeated viewing, a 'must' for an annual favourite, it stays fairly true to the book, which again is good as, in my opinion, if you're going to start messing around with a work of genius you want to be *really* sure you can improve on it. And finally, like a favourite Christmas jumper, this film will warm and comfort you and is guaranteed to put you in that Yule spirit. Watch it.

Even his cat has his ways with him and sends Marlowe off in the middle of the night to get some cat food. But when he fails miserably, the cat smells a rat, well, sort of. And now that we've set the tone How about a favor for a friend? That's OK with our hero as well, no need to ask too many questions. Well, big mistake, boy!When getting into The Long Goodbye it helps to know that the version of a Philip Marlowe as Eliott Gould portrays him in Robert Altman's film is far removed from the original character created by Raymond Chandler in his novel series. It's a Rip Van Marlowe as Altman himself referred to it, a character from the fifties who wakes up in the seventies. Only to tumble into a strange kind of film noir. In color of course. With a coolness bordering on lethargy exhibited by the protagonist, exquisite deadpan humor with dozens of sharp-tongued one-liners and a serious dosage of Altman approach. The latter translates to nothing less than a bold re-invention of a whole genre. The plot is negligible, quite complicated actually to untangle, be it on first or subsequent viewings, but it's not what this flic is about. All the ingredients of a Chandler noir are still there, but Altman wouldn't be Altman if he hadn't some own ideas up his sleeve. He satirizes conventions, plays with them, lets Gould improvise and eventually opts for a different ending which sets everything that happened before in perspective. Also a nice touch Throughout the movie the film's title theme - with or without lyrics - is repeated over and over again in variations, making perfectly clear where it's heading... To conclude If you love film noir and are appreciative of a fresh take on it I'm sure you'll welcome the often seriously underrated The Long Goodbye with open arms.

Don't get me wrong here, it is by no means a good movie but compare to some some of it's neighbors on the bottom #100 list, Santa with Muscles is pretty watchable. It has a consistent narrative, all be it an inane one. There are well defined characters, flat as cardboard they may be, but at least they act consistently throughout the film. And best of all, the humor comes naturally, the jokes don't feel as forced as they do in Epic Movie or other bad comedies. I have some nitpicks though. First, the bad guy is having people tortured in his back yard, how is he not in prison already? The henchmen destroy property, threaten people an nearly kill a guy, why does no one call the police? When trying to catch the hero for speeding, the police try to shoot him with a rocket launcher, why is internal affairs not there arresting these murderous coppers? Not to mention, why does the police even have a rocket launcher? Questions like this keep popping up but that just makes the film more entertainingNow, this a children's movie and as such less effort has gone into the details of making it, thus the plot is too simplistic, the characters, especially the bad guys are just ridiculous and the acting leaves a lot to ask. Given that there are good, well made children's films out there, having a younger audience is no excuse for making a bad film. Good enough for children maybe, but not good.

From studio interference and in cases re-editing, to funding problems, his film output was sparse, but his status as a true genius in the medium has never dissipated. Othello (his second Shakespeare adaptation, after 1948's Macbeth), was shot over a three year period largely due to the forthcoming bankruptcy of the films Italian backers, which closed production, but extra funding came from Welles himself, who used money made from acting jobs. But with the capricious production a rich and beautiful film of the Shakespeare tragedy was brought to the screen.My knowledge and relationship with the work of the Baird is very limited. Outside of the cinema I have read 'Macbeth' and 'King Lear', and I saw a fringe production of Macbeth at the Battersea Arts Centre starring Corin Redgrave. Aside from these very narrow experiences, my other connections with the material is through film (which again mostly centre on Macbeth - Throne of Blood (1957), or Roman Polanski's version, - or Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996)). Therefore my knowledge of the text of Othello was set at absolute zero, resulting in a fresh experience of the intricacies of the plot, and the relationships between the characters.The story involves four central characters. Welles plays the title character, a Moorish General to the Venetian army, his wife Desdemona (Suzanna Cloutier) whom he secretly married, his lieutenant Cassio (Michael Laurence), and his ensign Iago (Michael MacLiammoir). After displaying his charm to the detractors off Othello and Desdemona's marriage, convincing them that he did not win her love through witchcraft, but through fantastical stories. A web of deceit builds within these characters, as they all tussle for control of both the situation and the affections of Desdemona. As the complexities of all the relationships begin to fuse, and the rage and jealousies of Othello erupt, Desdemona's want for individuality and freedom from male dominance leads to bloody conclusions.With the erratic production came some incredible choices of production design. Filmed in Morocco, Italy and Venice, Welles made fantastic use of real locations, giving the images some urgency and architectural splendour. Filmed in black and white, the images justify the filmic function as light and shadow, the bright whites contrasting with the strong and powerful shade and silhouette. In the opening scene, the funeral procession moves in stark contrast to the burning sun in the sky. It is beautifully shot, utilising the remnants of building and the weaving canals through the structures of Venice, it is (I assume) a wonderful introduction to this very elaborate and involving narrative.

This is a poignant and moving fable about a sacrifice to save a son and a wife . It's an unforgettable story formed by two halves that proves imagination, family and love conquer all ; as Benigni's focus is on the love between daddy , mummy and son . The first part results to be an Italian comedy style , the second is horror along with humor . It concerns upon Guido (Roberto Benigni, a magnificent rubber-faced funny man), a Jewish man who has a wonderful romance with the help of his humour, but must use that same quality to protect his son in a Nazi death camp . He's a madcap romantic man and women wish him . But he falls in love with Dora (Benigni's real-life sweetie Nicoletta Braschi). Every day Guido dreams of marrying her , under Nicola Piovani score . When the Second World War spontaneously breaks out , he and his family is imprisoned at concentration camp . Guido is determined to save his lover and son (Cantarini) from dangers around them . His effort sometimes is pure fantasy , though with ruse he pull off more impetus to keep his son and accomplishes feats no man could realistically execute . Guido fabricates an elaborated game to convince his child that the whole ordeal is an endurance proof to be won with prizes forthcoming , as it turns out to be a special contest to win a tank.This is a story about love , war and sacrifice , well starred and directed by Roberto Benigni who develops a fire-line between comedy and tragedy . Inventive gags and wacky humor are splendidly proceeded . At first consideration , the theme of a feel-good holocaust comedy war was a non-sense . However , Benigni doesn't describe a holocaust film but rather a tale of endurance of family love . Benigni tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity, even as the horror war escalates. Actor and director Benigni shapes simultaneously haunting and hilarious comedy out of the tragedy of Nazi concentration camp . In a especially humorous scene , Guido translates a guard's barking at the inmates as furthers clarification of the rules of game . The picture is divided into two parts , the first half deals with an entertaining boy-meets-girl tale , a light-weight comedy in which Guido relentlessly pursues Dora ; the second half shifts and depicts the horrors of the concentration camps . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries as the Spanish Marisa Paredes , Lidia Alfonsi and Horst Buchhold as a Nazi doctor . The film displays an emotive musical score by Nicola Piovani, who deservedly had Oscar winner . Furthermore , it won Academy Award to Foreign film and of course to Benigni ; Roberto Benigni's Oscar for best actor marked only the second time that an actor had directed himself in an Academy Award winning performance , the other was Laurence Olivier for Hamlet .

The methods used by the police and the killer couldn't be more different, as the LAPD place a high value on adhering to standard procedures whereas their quarry uses his considerable ingenuity and expert knowledge of electronics to outwit his pursuers. This all makes for a fascinating cat and mouse game which is compelling to watch and becomes increasingly intense as it moves towards its exciting and visually impressive climax.In the early hours of a summer morning, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is trying to break into an electronics store when he sees a police patrol car approaching and casually walks away. The police car follows him and when he's asked to produce some identification, Martin pulls out a gun and shoots the police officer at point blank range. Detective Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell) are assigned to the case by Police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) but their initial efforts to identify the killer draw a blank because there are no leads to follow.Martin regularly sells electronic equipment to a dealer called Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) who becomes suspicious after one of his customers recognises a television projector (which Martin had supplied) as one that had been stolen from him. After Reeves reports the matter to the police, Brennan and Jones wait in the dealer's office with the intention of arresting Martin but his eventual arrival culminates in a shootout which ends with both Martin and Detective Jones having been shot. Jones is seriously injured and Martin goes home and successfully operates on himself to remove the bullet.The LAPD are determined to hunt down Martin but he continues to keep one step ahead of them by regularly changing his appearance and listening in to their radio communications until Detective Jones has a hunch which enables the police to positively confirm the identity of the killer. This piece of knowledge together with information that they subsequently find about Martin's previous employment, soon enables them to continue their manhunt with greater speed and success than had previously been possible.Roy Martin's story is told in typical docu-noir style complete with the obligatory solemn narration (by Reed Hadley) and some acting which, by today's standards, is rather stiff and formal. Richard Basehart, however, is exceptionally good in his role as the psychopathic loner and World War 11 veteran who's cold, calculating and extremely ruthless. He's a particularly interesting character as he's both intelligent and highly skilled in some areas but also paranoid and a man of few words.It's widely acknowledged that Jack Webb (who appears in this movie as a laboratory technician) was inspired by the experience to create his own very popular radio and TV show Dragnet which also emphasised the value of methodical police work.He Walked By Night looks very realistic and is often suspenseful but its most impressive feature is John Alton's incredible cinematography which enhances the look of the whole movie considerably and contributes to the claustrophobic feel of certain passages. His use of low key lighting, deep focus photography and interesting camera angles is inspired, effective and dramatic and at times, bathes the screen in compositions which create a rather disconcerting atmosphere.

But it surprised me--it has levity, style, and punch. It's a smart movie. It has some creaks, a couple of moments of excessive violence, some humor that may or may not strike you--in other words, it might not be perfect. But it's really good.There are few films since 1960 that are true film noirs in character, and this one is genuine in terms of style. That alone makes it worth watching. The color throughout is a cool, drained palette. Camera angles are dramatic, there is a voice-over (Gibson) that approaches the classic style, and the core idea of the lone guy against the world is at play. Compared to post-War noirs this one is a selfish, violent binge--it's not trying to be about some soldier returning to a changed country. If anything, the plot is where we go contemporary--borrowing an awful lot from the classic (and also brilliantly filmed) Point Blank, the one with Lee Marvin.There are some other nice surprises here. For one, an Asian s&m hooker is a total campy comic relief (and her badass caricatured comrades in their SUV). Another is the avoidance of mob clichés (the ones cemented by the Godfather movies more than anything)--it plays against them as much as with them. The cars are great, the city is gloomy without rain. It's a kind of dystopian near-past with modern attitudes. Strange stuff that might wear well with the decades.I'm glad I didn't see it in 1999 because it would have probably just seemed thin and full of itself. Now it has the makings of originality and style.But get this--this is the original version of the release, and the director Brian Helgeland went back to the original footage in 2006 to re-work, re-edit, and re-release the same movie. Guess what he took out? All the things I liked here--the cool tonality, the noir sensibility, the humor. I haven't seen the new one so won't compare or judge, but the director felt that the original release (which luckily they can't take away from us) wasn't what he had envisioned. The new one, which is apparently more cruel and violent, is called Payback Straight Up and it might be worth checking out.But I wouldn't hesitate to see this one, straight up. I liked it!

Let me begin by saying that this is the one and only film that I've watched twice, in a row. Directly after each other (!). Since then I have watched Ghost in the Shell many times again, at least 20 times. This may sound a bit crazy, but the film is of such depth, with such a complex story, that you have to be very attentive to get the whole story, and it's quite impossible to fully understand the movie after one viewing. (especially when you watch it with subtitles) In fact, not all plots in the movie have tied up ends, which makes the film all the more intriguing. The main reason I've had multiple viewings, is, well, because it's art.I'm a fan of science-fiction, especially the intelligent kind, and I like manga, and this movie is the best in its genre. The artwork is sublime, with incredible detail. The music is mesmerizingly beautiful, and fits the existential atmosphere perfectly. The story is based on the book of Masamune Shirow, who deserves a lot of credit, for coming up with all these original ideas (the fingers that type the code!, to mention one). There's a lot of philosophy in it, enough to keep a few discussions at the pub going.At last a lot of credit goes to Mamoru Oshii, the director, for the intelligent script, excellent editing and infusion of Weltschmertz and existentialism. It's been a while since I've seen Ghost in the Shell, and there's only one reason for it I've lent my copy to a friend. Can't wait to watch it again! Watching Ghost in the Shell is like going to church for me, the good kind -) Enjoy the movie!

It premiered In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on location in Acton, West London in England and is a UK production which was produced by English producer Sally Hibbin. It tells the story about a single mother in her mid-30s of four children who all have different fathers named Maggie Conlon, who due to an incident where she left her children with a child-minder and something went very wrong, all her children has been taken by child services and placed in foster homes. When Maggie falls in love with a Latin-American immigrant named Jorge her life lights up, but her conflicted personality turns out to be quite a challenge for Jorge who has to give her all his love.Distinctly and compassionately directed by English filmmaker Ken Loach, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws an utterly heartrending and evocative portrayal of a citizen's dispute with social services and her struggle to create a family and regain custody of her children. While notable for its naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by English cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, production design by English production designer and art director Martin Johnson (1939-2003) and distinct realism, this character-driven, narrative-driven and social and psychological documentary drama which title derives from the 18th century English language nursery rhyme Ladybird, ladybird fly away home, your house is on fire and your children are gone&#x85; and where a person whom has gone through a childhood of trauma and several oppressive relationships is faced with consistent adversity from state authorities who regard her as unfit, depicts an in-depth and heartfelt study of character and contains a great score by British composer George Fenton.This accomplished narrative feature from the early 1990s which is set in England in the late 20th century and where a woman for the first time in her life meets a man who unlike her previous boyfriends who always put her down, is more engaged in lifting her spirit and showing her that she is as worthy of love as anyone else, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, the wholehearted and powerful acting performance by English actress and comedian Crissy Rock in her debut feature film role and the fine acting performance by Chilean actor and composer Vladimir Vega in his debut feature film role. A heart-shaped and unwaveringly gripping love-story which leaves an unforgettable impression and a virtuous statement which gained, among other awards, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury Ken Loach and the Silver Bear for Best Actress Crissy Rock at the 44th Berlin Film Festival in 1994.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"4 December 2012","score":"","review":" This is an action film redeemed from being merely okay by the performances of Robert De Niro and Jean Reno and by the car chases. They made it actually good.This 1998 movie was directed by the able John Frankenheimer and stars De Niro, Reno, Katerina Witt, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean, Jonathan Pryce, and an international smorgasbord of others.It's a story that's been done many times. A bunch of guys who don't know each other show up for a job nobody knows about to steal something that isn't identified. It stumbles a little out of the gate, as De Niro's character is suspicious of everybody and everything, and he's always right. Once we get established, however, things crank up, and we have a good action movie with a great buddy film thrown in. There were several plot holes that gave me pause, but the chase soon started, and plot holes were blown away by action. Frankenheimer does car chases as well as anyone, maybe better, and every time our heroes were in touch with the prize, it was jerked away from them and put on a very fast car driven by a very professional driver. Over and over again. I lost track of how many innocent bystanders were shot, run over, and otherwise killed -- many more innocents than bad guys -- but no one in the movie cared. On to the next chase. Reno and De Niro were very good, pulling the movie into the range of being good instead of mindless. The plot is forgettable, but those two guys gave heart to the movie. There's some kind of samurai stuff that the screenwriters attempted to graft onto the story, but it was a waste of time and had no bearing on the action. They want us to have something to puzzle out, but forget it. Watch for the two stars and the action.
