Smiling at the end wanting more. Brilliant and realistic performance by Mathew, Woody and everyone. Very good script. Superb direction. No vulgarity. No special effects. No big stars. Some parts of the movie are even better than The Truman Show. A nobody looser, accidentally chosen for a reality show becomes a superstar. Finds true love, respect of family and brother. Then has to choose between relationships and stardom. Best scenes are when Ed's video is reviewed and selected; Ed gets up and a camera is on his face. When he and his brother are about to fight; The cameras following Ed's every move; Ed's final revelation and pulling the plug.
