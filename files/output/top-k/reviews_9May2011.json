I think about the billions of dollars being made and all of the record profits being made by the fortune five hundred companies. The people on the lower levels of these companies usually never see the benefits of their labor. Walmart for example is a powerful company that makes enormous profits, just like the big business in Metropolis. The people from the movie make me think about the hundreds of workers who work in the store for minimum wages and for long hours. I also think of the conditions of many who work under the minimum wage standard and what they have to endure. The problems are the same as metropolis. Just like when the people were getting flooded in their small ghetto where they were stacked on top of each other, the big business people where having a party, blinded to the hurt, harm, and danger endured by the workers. I think that the people believed that if they couldn't see it then it was not happening. The most intriguing part of watching this movie is realizing that the directors are not trying to portray the owners as bad, but they are just giving an actual depiction of the time. The workers during these periods were treated as worker, people who are here to perform a duty and then leave. The owners are there to be in control and decided what happens, not there to make peoples lives better. I don't personally agree with it, but I do understand that the people with the money make the decisions and that still has not changed today, nor will it change in the future.

Completely self-indulgent, contrived, soulless, and pretentious. And yet people keep calling it one of the greatest movie musicals ever. It's literally all style and no substance.There were many things about this movie that annoyed me so I'll try and keep it to a minimum.1) The plot I've never seen a romance in a movie that felt so fake as in MOULIN ROUGE. Kidman and Gregor have no chemistry on screen but to be fair that's probably more of the director's fault then theirs. They keep saying crap like love will shine through or love will conquer all or the popular the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return. Give me a break. I literally counted how many times they said love in this movie and it was 126 times. (Although I may have lost count during the Madonna number when the chorus sings Love! a dozen times every 5 seconds.) The love that this movie babbles on about isn't real love. It's formulaic, planned, polished, and fraudulent Hollywood romance. The relationship between the writer and actress never felt true because whenever their relationship was in danger, it was because the one-dimensional Duke threatened, never the two in love. That Duke only exists to the convenience of the plot. Real problems in a relationship come from the lovers like their personalities, life choices, etc. There's more to love than just pure romance. It's about getting past problems and working through them instead of just waiting around and doing nothing hoping that love will conquer all in some clichéd climax. There are better romance films out there (musical and non) that actually show real love like CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND, CABARET, LOST IN TRANSLATION, and more.2) The characters These people seemed so non-existent. In fact, the characters in this movie weren't characters; they were set pieces that could move around, sing badly, and make stupid faces at the camera. There are great actors in this movie like Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, and Jim Broadbent; yet, director Baz Luhrman favored their costumes and bedrooms more than their acting. A real shame and a real waste of potential.3) The editing Based purely on this aspect, I believe MOULIN ROUGE! was made for people with severe ADD. Not one shot lasted more than 3 seconds. All it is is just people mugging at the camera as it zooms from one room to the next. It's as if Luhrman is afraid that the actors will distract from the movie's style so he yells CUT!! right before the actors summon a real emotion. Characters should never be upstaged by the visuals; the visuals are there to add to them and the story. Ironically, this MTV-style approach actually hurts the movie's look because we can never get a good look at the amazing art direction. These sets are fantastic! Let us see them! 4) The music My friends kept telling me how brilliant and innovative the soundtrack is and when I saw the trailer I thought I was going to adore it. But when the McGregor character first sang The Hills are alive with the Sound of Music!, I groaned thinking to myself, Great, it's a jukebox musical. For those who don't know, a jukebox musical is a musical that uses already existing music for its score. It's damaging Broadway right now with shows like American IDIOT and preventing musicals to move forward artistically. It should be used as an homage to great composers and their work, but nowadays it's just a cheap move to enhance album purchases. I guess in MOULIN ROUGE it's supposed to show how love is universal in all kinds of music but it makes the movie seem anachronistic. Plus, if a movie like MOULIN ROUGE is going to have this much hype around it, it better have original songs. Some people say Come What May is the only original piece but I've done some research and it apparently was used for Luhrman's previous film, ROMEO+JULIET. It wasn't even written specifically for MOULIN ROUGE. (It's an awful song anyway.) I can't stand it when people praise this soundtrack because there's nothing really brilliant about simply rearranging and orchestrating existing pop songs and having them sung horribly. (Kidman is not a singer! Why is she used in this and NINE?!) 5) The directing Pretty much everything I've complained about is because of Luhrman's direction. People wonder why he never got an Oscar nomination for Best Director. It's because he didn't care about the story or characters, only the sets and costumes. It's actually kind of amazing how much he didn't care. There's no sense of pace, subtlety, or consistency. There's nothing wrong with trying to make your movie look spectacular. But if your story and characters fall flat, then the images just become something nice to look at and dissolve from the audience's memories once the movie's over. There's got to be something else that gives the film its drive other than clothes, art direction, and choppy editing.Well, that's all I can think of for now. Hopefully I didn't rant too much. Obviously I'm in the minority but that won't change my opinion. But who knows? Maybe I'm just missing something. I just wish people would acknowledge and admire real musicals instead of a collection of pop songs pretending to be musicals.

I laughed a few times, but it was more because the situations the characters were in were so uncomfortable. Overall that is not necessarily a bad thing. The bad thing about the movie is that is filled with interesting characters that you tend to get invested into, but then you spend too much time aware from them while spending time with other characters. You would almost forget about a character and all of sudden they were back.I honestly enjoyed all of the acting especially Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, and Lara Flynn Boyle. So Dylan Baker managed to play a sympathetic pedophile, or as sympathetic as they can be. His conversations with his son were some of the most awkward, but somehow endearing. I loved Lara Flynn Boyle's character. She was just over the top enough that she seemed to fit in atmosphere created by Solondz. I think I have a crush on Jane Adams now. For me she was extremely relatable, but at the same time kind of frustrating as a character. You just wanted to shake her and yell at her to get her life together, but then hold her and try to make her happy (she probably would break my heart just like Lovitz character though).Overall the movie is probably filled with some terribly awkward moments that are funny but in an uncomfortable kind of way. The movie did not flow from one character's arc to another. I forgot about the characters as the movie went a long, which is even more frustrating because so many of the characters are interesting and I wanted to spend time with them. But being away from any given character for as long as you are makes it hard to invest in the characters in any meaningful way. It is an OK movie that I probably not recommend to anyone, except possibly for the overarching concept of happiness and what it means to different people and how some don't know what it means to themselves. That was interesting, but with such a terrible flow it made it hard to stay interested in anyone character's happiness.

William Wyler knew how to make the country look big indeed, and the production quality is unparalleled for the time. It is a beautiful sweeping western epic. It doesn't quite fit the mold of the classic gritty westerns that were common for the time. The plot involves water rights and feuding families, which seems like a commonplace theme. However, the film isn't commonplace at all and stands head and shoulders above weaker films with similar plots.I also like having some romance in a film, and I think there is just enough without detracting from the overall drama. I will say that I prefer my heroes to be more...well,... heroic. At first, Gregory Peck seems a bit of a sissy, but if the setting was on a ship at sea, then I'm sure he'd be quite the commanding hero. Having seen the film several times now, this doesn't bother me anymore. He proves his point to himself and the audience in the bucking bronco scene. That scene really works for me.I have a bit of sass and spitfire in me, so Peck's pacifist approach to life also took some getting used to initially. However, due to multiple connective and genetic immune diseases, I've learned to tone down myself and am now inspired by his pacifism. I also know that Peck is a fine actor with a wide range, and I've been a fan for decades. I was never a Jean Simmons fan until this film. Carroll Baker is ho-hum to me, but Simmons' magic shines through. I actually have made a point to watch more of her delightful films after seeing her in this one. I was blown away by Burl Ives' performance. Wow!! One tough cookie and so glad he won the Oscar.I could go on, but I think it's clear that I highly recommend this film.

Feeding off of two separate strands, children will no doubt be consumed in the undying pleasures one equilibrium offers when two infants, one male and one female but brother and sister all the same, bicker and argue with each other as they journey on the adventure of a lifetime; essentially undertaking a quest which will see them strive to save the day and do the grown-ups a favour for a change in bailing them out of the trouble they get themselves in. The scenes and sequences are harmless enough for youngsters to enjoy and brief and charming enough for the adults seeing it with their kids to enjoy; the second strand consisting of the grown ups ambling along with parental life and cracking tired Oh, aren't we both getting old! gags which will no doubt induce grins onto that of the faces of thirty-something mums-and-dads watching on with an arm around each other and one of their two tots on either side of them.The problem being, and if like me, you land somewhere in the middle of all of this demographic pandering as a non-child whom isn't a parent and doesn't have any kids, chances are Spy Kids will be a bit of a chore; a film whose success rate in this case relies on it being an interesting and engaging enough adventure piece, something it isn't necessarily and thus doesn't quite pull through; a piece bordering on that of a monumental drag as it shuffles along doing its best to encompass people from better films that you've probably seen &#x96; by the end, I was having more fun mentally ticking off those whom had before worked with the aforementioned Rodriguez and were present here than I did from the film itself. For the Folks if your kids answer you correctly after having turned to them post-credits in order to offer them a pop-quiz on what the only other film George Clooney and Robert Rodriguez had previously worked together on, chances are you're a pretty irresponsible parent.Joking aside, the film does offer up a meek if somewhat interesting study on how to utilise teamwork and one's skills for that of good, honest and upstanding means yadda,yadda, yadda; the film effectively a tale about two nippers seemingly at war with each other coming together to foil a common enemy through hard work, dedication and working together explored in a manner which is a bit better than dull but not really as good as 'slightly interesting' - although it is done so in a rapid, punchy manner tots will enjoy. Where the kids have what is for them, everybody else will observe the ridiculously photogenic parents of the two titular Spy Kids in Antonio Banderas' Gregorio and Carla Gugino's Ingrid Cortez, respectively; two people living a seemingly normal life (whatever 'normal' constitutes in this film) in an isolated cliff-top villa hiding out as retired spies now trying to function as office workers and keeping their previous incarnations private from their offspring.Those kids are Carmen (Vega) and the younger Juni (Sabara), two more often than not at each others' throats in that innocent enough way brothers and sisters this age usually are; Juni's existence somewhat lowlier than Carmen's in that he appears weak and is easily victimised, sports warts on his hands and is disenchanted with school life. His escape from this life is that of the transporting of himself into that of the world of television; specifically, a show headed up by Alan Cumming's suitably nasty and suitably sadistic, but wholly within the boundaries of the film, Fegan Floop; a man with a colourful and joyous TV show featuring all manner of wacky characters; sets and ideas.These circles of characters will come to integrate with one another much more later on; Floop's surface existence masking something more underneath running parallel, when he's later revealed as essentially that of an arms-dealer, with that of Carmen and Juni's parents whom additionally subscribe to a cloaked living that is similar only in nature. The catalyst which kick-starts the titular kids' adventure out into the unknown; a journey encompassing the learning to co-exist with one another; the realisation of what it means to take on certain responsibilities and Juni's own realisation of the true meaning of Floop's show, which he holds so dear to him, occurs when parents Gergorio and Ingrid are swiped by an unknown quantity. From here, surprises and revelations whisk the pair off on an espionage and action imbued adventure featuring bad guys; double crosses; sordid plots and a lot of humour revolving around fully grown adults falling down. Where it's easy to sneer, and boy is it easy to sneer at Spy Kids, it is on the other hand difficult to get as excited about as one would have liked; Rodriguez demonstrating a knack for completely shifting gears and coming up with a piece acceptable to all ages which isn't exceptional but is a long way from woeful.Who knows? Like somebody whose introduction to Brian de Palma was in the shape of 1996's Mission Impossible as however young I was; maybe, in years to come, youngsters whom saw this with their folks and have such happy memories of it will discover what else Rodriguez has to offer, before quietly exclaiming that they find it hard to believe such a film here was even made by the man &#x96; let alone was their introduction to his back-catalogue of which they've come to really admire.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"9 May 2011","score":"","review":" Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids is a perfectly rounded, perfectly harmless adventure film; a piece that will no doubt play to an audience consisting of parents of whatever age whom happen to have kids around about similar ages to that of what the kids characters therein are. Feeding off of two separate strands, children will no doubt be consumed in the undying pleasures one equilibrium offers when two infants, one male and one female but brother and sister all the same, bicker and argue with each other as they journey on the adventure of a lifetime; essentially undertaking a quest which will see them strive to save the day and do the grown-ups a favour for a change in bailing them out of the trouble they get themselves in. The scenes and sequences are harmless enough for youngsters to enjoy and brief and charming enough for the adults seeing it with their kids to enjoy; the second strand consisting of the grown ups ambling along with parental life and cracking tired Oh, aren't we both getting old! gags which will no doubt induce grins onto that of the faces of thirty-something mums-and-dads watching on with an arm around each other and one of their two tots on either side of them.The problem being, and if like me, you land somewhere in the middle of all of this demographic pandering as a non-child whom isn't a parent and doesn't have any kids, chances are Spy Kids will be a bit of a chore; a film whose success rate in this case relies on it being an interesting and engaging enough adventure piece, something it isn't necessarily and thus doesn't quite pull through; a piece bordering on that of a monumental drag as it shuffles along doing its best to encompass people from better films that you've probably seen &#x96; by the end, I was having more fun mentally ticking off those whom had before worked with the aforementioned Rodriguez and were present here than I did from the film itself. For the Folks if your kids answer you correctly after having turned to them post-credits in order to offer them a pop-quiz on what the only other film George Clooney and Robert Rodriguez had previously worked together on, chances are you're a pretty irresponsible parent.Joking aside, the film does offer up a meek if somewhat interesting study on how to utilise teamwork and one's skills for that of good, honest and upstanding means yadda,yadda, yadda; the film effectively a tale about two nippers seemingly at war with each other coming together to foil a common enemy through hard work, dedication and working together explored in a manner which is a bit better than dull but not really as good as 'slightly interesting' - although it is done so in a rapid, punchy manner tots will enjoy. Where the kids have what is for them, everybody else will observe the ridiculously photogenic parents of the two titular Spy Kids in Antonio Banderas' Gregorio and Carla Gugino's Ingrid Cortez, respectively; two people living a seemingly normal life (whatever 'normal' constitutes in this film) in an isolated cliff-top villa hiding out as retired spies now trying to function as office workers and keeping their previous incarnations private from their offspring.Those kids are Carmen (Vega) and the younger Juni (Sabara), two more often than not at each others' throats in that innocent enough way brothers and sisters this age usually are; Juni's existence somewhat lowlier than Carmen's in that he appears weak and is easily victimised, sports warts on his hands and is disenchanted with school life. His escape from this life is that of the transporting of himself into that of the world of television; specifically, a show headed up by Alan Cumming's suitably nasty and suitably sadistic, but wholly within the boundaries of the film, Fegan Floop; a man with a colourful and joyous TV show featuring all manner of wacky characters; sets and ideas.These circles of characters will come to integrate with one another much more later on; Floop's surface existence masking something more underneath running parallel, when he's later revealed as essentially that of an arms-dealer, with that of Carmen and Juni's parents whom additionally subscribe to a cloaked living that is similar only in nature. The catalyst which kick-starts the titular kids' adventure out into the unknown; a journey encompassing the learning to co-exist with one another; the realisation of what it means to take on certain responsibilities and Juni's own realisation of the true meaning of Floop's show, which he holds so dear to him, occurs when parents Gergorio and Ingrid are swiped by an unknown quantity. From here, surprises and revelations whisk the pair off on an espionage and action imbued adventure featuring bad guys; double crosses; sordid plots and a lot of humour revolving around fully grown adults falling down. Where it's easy to sneer, and boy is it easy to sneer at Spy Kids, it is on the other hand difficult to get as excited about as one would have liked; Rodriguez demonstrating a knack for completely shifting gears and coming up with a piece acceptable to all ages which isn't exceptional but is a long way from woeful.Who knows?

Because there is still a certain breed of films that managed to perfectly capture the essence of War, among them, the masterpiece Apocalypse Now, closely followed by the one I will review now Das Boot.Das Boot, the boat, what a title! Very restrained, yet extremely meaningful, for two reasons  first, it sets the film, the U-Boat commanded by the experienced and respected Captain Lieutenant Lehmann-Willenbrock, the boat as a Goddess-like character in the film, who has the power to kill or spare her infants. Secondly, the language German. The protagonists are German and if you look at them at Nazis, you miss the point. The film doesn't invite us to cheer for guys who belong to the bad side, but to reconsider our own approach to War. Spielberg makes glorious War movies with simplistic 'good vs. bad guys' formulas, when he should have taken some lessons of realism from Wolfgang Petersen who made a movie about &#x85; men. They are only men who happen to wear one military suit, and we can't blame them for wearing 'the bad one'.Indeed, there is a lot to root for in the beginning, as they are not the cruel and stereotypical Germans, cinema used to portray, we're not in Stalag 17 anymore, and the United States doesn't have the monopoly of War movies. A German director makes a movie about German soldiers for a change, and without any bias. He even, detached the main characters from any Nazi etiquette. At the drunken party in La Rochelle, the two veteran officers express very cynical ideas about Hitler  nice touch from Petersen not to portray the leads as zealous fanatics. The rest of the crew follows the orders, and during the first sequence, they just drink, dance, shout and vomit. The realism again works on a double level, it helps us to feel empathy for these young rosy-cheeked boys and pity at the same time; because this party could be their last. The fun is so extreme it almost looks like a last burst of youth and amusement before the serious adult stuff happens.And when it starts, you just have to hold your breath and prepare yourself for one of the most nightmarish and hellish journeys ever, making Apocalypse Now's mission look like a cruise. It's a modern odyssey conducted by one of the most haunting cinematic scores ever, and a beautiful cinematography. And the central character of this odyssey is Lieutenant Werner, the Correspondent. We discover the boat through his eyes, and share his discomfort among the regulars. He represents the audience, the coming-of-age element of the story, and inspires through his clumsiness some very interesting statements from the Captain, like in the beginning, when he asks him to wait till the soldiers have grown beards before taking pictures of them. They still look too shamefully young, but as the movie goes on, their facial features become mature and likelier to make us accept a tragic fate. Facing other clean-shaved and well-dressed officers later, we notice the difference; they didn't act like Nazis; at the end, they don't even look like soldiers. Das Boot creates indeed a quite alienating environment, like living a War in microcosm.There's a growing feeling of claustrophobia invading our hearts, as we're embarked with these men making the empathy work on a physical level. When they listen to the ultrasonic detector with that scary repetitive sound, you know the shock is imminent. The question is when? The thrills are so intolerable that the shock comes almost as a relief. But the worst has yet to come when they're hit by a flight attack that cause their sinking. It goes down, deeper and deeper, even below the pressure limit the previous false alarm taught us. It's a suffocating experience, and an extraordinary thrilling moment ... For my part, I literally held my breath, couldn't even gulp, didn't know what I was waiting for. Since there were Germans, and we know they won't win the War, they could really die in the boat, but that would have been too predictable I guess. And from the way they handled the crisis, becoming just men, crying, going mad, praying, struggling, while driven by their self-conservation instinct, we understand, that they're only victims of the alienating effect War applies on human minds, and when they think their fate sealed, they realize that all the military pride is just bullshit.But the ending is probably what saddened me the most, not to mention the shock. After all they went through, they died anyway, on the harbor, at their arrival. The point? I guess if the Germans were not the good guys of WWII, when it came to the individual battles, it was just a side against another one, they were still fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, dying there. We feel uncomfortable in the scene where they refuse to help the poor Allies soldiers drowning after the bombing of their destroyer, but in a way, it's another sign of maturity from the German director now they are the 'poor' soldiers, every death is tragic &#x85; And we feel sad because we rooted for them.

I'm not going to spoil it but now I'm so glad I watch the Simpsons because it just makes you laugh when you see how many references that TV show has made to so many classics. And it was even funnier seeing it in this movie - it just made me laugh. It also begs the question of do we follow our desires without looking at the consequences - or should we just face them as they come since no one never really knows what happens when we make certain choices?Perhaps at my present time in life - now knowing exactly what I want to do with my future, you can relate to Ben's character at being lost and confused. I don't know if I would have a fling with an older woman though but you can see how desires and temptations often lead you to do things you never thought you might. I guess it's the whole thing about being young and thinking you need to do everything before it's too late.

Gojira a feared beast with rock-like skin, likened to the texture of radiation burns, with the ability to shoot radioactive fire from his mouth and whose footsteps leave radioactive fallout in his wake, seems the perfect living depiction of a Nuclear Bomb. The first shot, of that unfortunate ship is believed to be a reminder of the Lucky Dragon No. 5, a ship that when fishing for Tuna, and instead was delivered a heavy dose of radiation from testing done by the U.S Military on Marshall Islands. The ship, well outside the radius was hit with radioactive fallout when the tested atomic bomb was more powerful than the U.S military realized. As with those in the film, who died as the ship sank, the crew of Lucky Dragon No. 5, obtained radiation poisoning and died quickly. This same atomic testing that killed the crew of the ship, is also attributed with awakening Gojira, a menacing beast that attacks Japan in the same manner as that of an atomic bomb.

The 80's was a time when nearly 60% of America snorted cocaine on a daily basis. The other half was drunk. And all cartoons were just 1\/2 an hour commercials. You could buy anything and everything you seen on a show. You want to be that guy that was in a scene for literally 2 seconds... You could buy his toy and he had a name. These people who like these shows now most weren't even born at the time. So, they say... Oh, this is so cool. You know why? Because they have parents who are\/were dorks at the time and that's what they liked. So, the kids love it. Transformers was a steaming pile. And Optimus always saying... Let's roll out. Got annoying. GI Joe? Another pile of crap. Who can shoot all the bullets in every clip they have on them and never hit anyone?! Transformers was crap then and it's an even bigger load now. Go ask your parents if they ate paint chips as a child if they liked the transformers. Chances are that they did and they're the reason people can't have lead based paint on their houses now.
