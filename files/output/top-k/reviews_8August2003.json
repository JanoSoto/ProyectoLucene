However this film shows that Penn should probably give up acting and become a director.The film plays at a wonderful pace, one of those film's, which like 'The Man Who Wasn't There' never feels slow yet if you take your mind of the film very clearly is.  The acting in this film is excellent, with Nicholson giving one of his best performances.The story is that of a retired police officer who has made a pledge to a woman to find the person who killed her daughter.  Penn's film deals with how Nicholson deals with this pledge, but in a rather ambiguous and interesting way.  We see Nicholson doing things that may or may not be to help him to carry out his pledge.There are times in the film when it appears that Nicholson may not be doing much to fulfill the pledge and this is possibly troubling him.  However, these scenes are excellently written, acted and directed and leave viewer to mull over what is happening on screen.Penn has not simply made a slow burner here, he builds tension throughout.  A scene where Nicholson believes a Preacher maybe the killer is one of the most tense scenes I have seen in many years.Nicholson, one of the finest actors ever, is on excellent form.  This is the second of three excellent Nicholson performances, the others being As Good As It Gets and About Schmidt, which show that unlike De Niro and to a less extent Pacino, he is still an actor worth watching today.  The way Nicholson uses body language and subtleties in his speech show that he is a greater actor than those who have just seen him playing 'Jack', although that actor is of course among the most watchable in the history of cinema.The film features an ending which arguably lets the film down.  The film's sense of ambiguity about Nicholson's character more or less disappears at the end.  The revelation that Nicholson's character was a drunk when there was nothing that implied this was totally unnecessary.  The fact that the end is strongly implied at the beginning of the film does not help the film as well, because this implies an inevitability which simply is not there in the rest of the film.

The visuals are so important that I cannot imagine watching a pick and scan version on a conventional TV set.  Too much would be lost that way.The scene, early in the movie, where one of the Mars astronauts gets blown up made me levitate.  Also, I though Tim Robbins' and Connie Nielsen's weightless dance in the spaceship on the way to Mars was lovely.  The scene with the startling all white surroundings that the astronauts faced in the faceship (to coin a phrase) was also well done.  I thought the performances were uniformly excellent.  That fact and the wonderful visuals overcame sometimes excruciatingly bad dialogue so that it did not really detract from my enjoyment of the film.  That being said, though, I loved the exchange where it was observed by one character that the mere three per-cent difference between the genetic makeup of men and apes gave us Einstein, Mozart and a second character adds, Jack the Ripper.Some reviewers complained about the similarity of the film to 2001, but that is exactly what De Palma had in mind, I think.  Mission to Mars pays homage to every sci-fi cartoon and movie ever made, from Buck Rogers to Close Encounters, and does it well.  Anyway, De Palma proved to me again that he really does march to his own drummer.

I really don't like golf, I find it boring, but this film shows a golf in a whole new perspective, in interesting and entertaining way, so I change my mind about it. Really good film with interesting story, amassing acting, picture and directing. Will Smith and Charlize Theron are absolutely superior, but Mat Demon is bad as he always is. He always needs someone to back up on him, to support him, so Will and Charlize did it this time, and they did it extraordinary. More I watch movies with Charlize Theron, more I like her. This is her best performance till now, she was excellent in Cider House Rules too. She is perfect for this part, she is graceful, charming, gentle, ambitious, temperament, beautiful and very very very sexy. It is obvious that Will Smith is great in this kind of role, and that they should giving him it often, radar than stupid roles such as one in Man in black, film also stupid. It is interesting that this film carries a title of non main character Bagger Vance, whom plays Will Smith. I think main character is one that plays Mat Demon, but when you think about it, you realize what importance has Bagger in main character's life. He helps him with golf, what attached him again with his girlfriend, and bring him to life again. I was very amused of directing of this film all through. And in the end when i saw name Robert Redford, I very surprised. How can one actor be so good in directing? I was really amazed. Well done Robert. So, in the end my vote. It is between 7 and 8.

Lawrence Elbert once told Mary instead of going to film school he should just listen to director's commentaries. I wish there would also be as a matter of course writers' and cinematographers' and even editors' and musicians' commentaries dammit.I'm suddenly reminded of a remark AC makes on the dvd about how yoga is a way for people in l.a. to show that they have their spiritual mojo in place or whatever (he and JJL do yoga themselves and their real life yoga teacher plays the yoga teacher). There's an instance in which maybe in middle america a little bit of the reality of the humor of the scene is lost but none of the entertainment value! Yoga studios are like McDonald's in l.a. only instead of hefty hideaway customers going in and out it's all the gorgeous l.a. monsters.And whoever put the text up happened to hit on the one part I often find myself thinking back on, when Phoebe Cates is warning JJL of the likely outcome of things. That scene is so funny! What can you say about the cast. Best not to even get started.On the commentary there was one thing I found a little disturbing, but now it makes sense.  J and A explain that the neighbors are supposed to represent the film audience. I felt that was snobby, like why wouldn't the audience identify with the other characters? I get it a little better after reading the reviews that could have been written by the neighbor husband. But to me they're all just people really well drawn. And clearly not 'everyone' in this movie is a mess, for instance the Phoebe Cates character.Anyway I kept thinking Robert Altman must be so proud and Alan Rudolph and tra la la I loved this movie dammit.

This is somebody I hope to see a lot more of.  Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a strong performance and I am not surprised to discover the two are siblings as the onscreen chemistry was excellent between them.  Beth Grant, who played Kitty Farmer (The neurotic dance team's coach) was also excellent.  Noah Wylie is always fun to watch.  Though I was totally unconvinced by Drew Barrymore's short cameo, I was impressed that she co-produced the film.   Based upon the stupid evil bunny ad and lame title, I would never have rented it if it weren't so well ranked on IMDB.  When I rented Donnie Darko, I had no idea what kind of genre the movie was in. The opening scene of Donnie Darko didn't really help either, but I knew this was going to be a good movie when the first song of the score played.  I thought the choice in songs was excelllent (though overplayed at times) and added to the underlying sense of melancholic anxiety and euphoria of the film; a rare talent in filmmakers, save a very select few (as in David Lynch per Angelo Badallamenti).  I don't think the direction of the film was meant to actually go a specific place.  What makes the film good is how it leaves interpretation up to the viewer.  I think any good psychological thriller leaves plenty to the imagination (er, psyche).There was, of course, some very obvious foreshadowing and explicit symbolism.  When Donnie Darko had a talk with Prof. Monnitoff (Noah Wyle), they had to stop talking when fate and god became the topic.  This movie, on a more obvious level, was about Donnie CHOOSING to accept his fate and follow the path of god.  I gave 8\/10 stars.  I am very hard to please.  I would watch the movie again.

Not since RAISE THE TITANIC have I seen such a boring movie (ironically, both films' scores were made by the great John Barry, who should have chosen his projects a little bit better!). I can't believe the script was greenlighted. There's nothing in it. Zip. Nada. Nothing! The first half of the movie, we basically see Debra Winger, single woman she plays tennis; has sex with tennis instructor; drives around; listens to her answering machine; works; drives around some more. Then she hears that the tennis instruction called Mike was killed. She reluctantly tries to know why he was killed. So we see her driving around L.A. for what seems to be an endless amount of time. Eventually she goes to a mansion where Mike used to live. The owner of the mansion is played by Paul Winfield. She learns a few things about Mike. Then one night, after going to a performance art thingy, she returns home and the story suddenly becomes a claustrophobic hostage-like situation, with Mike's psychotic friend forces his way into her house because the killers who killed Mike are after him after he and Mike stole some drugs during an exchange. The friend eventually gets killed from inside Winger's house. End of story. That's it. WTF?!?!The people who wrote the script and grennlighted this project must have been high on drugs or something because there's nothing worthwhile in the entire film. Except for Paul Winfield, the acting from everyone else is terrible, including Winger, who seems to be completely bored out of her mind. The dialogue is painful to listen to. And the story is slooooow. Scenes of Debra Winger alone, talking on the phone for almost 5 minutes, with the camera on her face for almost that entire 5 minutes, do not make for compelling viewing. Things aren't made any better by the script's humongous improbabilities, like Winger being affected by his death. She didn't seem to care about him one bit. Or Winger going to see the apartment where Mike was killed. Sure. Or the whole videotaped moment Winger was shown, for no apparent reasons, by that male stripper at Winfield's house. Who was behind the video camera when the argument took place? Why did the person behind the camera kept on filming the argument or why didn't anyone around, like Winfield, ask the person to stop recording the moment? Or the flimsy plot point of when Mike's psychotic friend decides to go to Winger's place. Moments like this made my eyes roll. The film tried to be edgy and current but only ends up looking poky and trivial. For instance, the whole film is populated by characters who are obviously gay or bisexual but the producers were so afraid to deal with the subject that every time they showed some homoeroticism, they always showed some girls in bikinis or something else to detract the underlying subtext. If you're going to make a movie about a hustler, who does everything, including selling his body, don't fidget about it. But the worst thing about this ill-conceived project is Mike himself the character is ugly and totally unappealing. It's impossible to care for the loser.

Julia Roberts has the highest asking price in Hollywood at present, and John Cusack, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Billy Crystal, Christopher Walken and, er, Seth Green aren't exactly famed for having low prices. But when all are together on screen, the result is unsurprisingly good.

The overall effect is that of a likeable, enjoyable but not necessarily groundbreaking movie. While there is the occasional in-joke on Hollywood, this is too soft-centred and conventional to consider a satire. And it certainly isn't a film of `artistic depth' as the interpretation of Hollywood is skin-deep and shallow. But who cares about that? Especially when there are such talented leads on show.Roberts, Cusack and Zeta-Jones give deliciously bubbly turns in the love triangle of bitchery (the latter greatly sending up her `shallow' reputation) though it's questionable why Julia Roberts is playing the `deep' one. Crystal is as funny as he'll ever be, though this is hardly his best performance to date. Seth Green (`Austin Powers', `Can't Hardly Wait') is also humorous as the nerdy assistant, though could have done with more screen-time. And there are wittily eccentric turns from Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken. The former does a brilliant riff on `Scientology' (though it was done better in `Bowfinger') and the latter is excellent as the reclusive, meticulous director. The real standout is Hank Azaria as bumbling, lispy Hector who clearly has the funniest character.Joe Roth's directing is as average as one might suspect. But he gives the film an appropriately sour-spirited touch to avoid it being soppy and heart-warming. The narrative isn't bad either- blunt and to the point. Some scenes go on for a bit too long without laughter, but the closing moments are funny enough to make you forget about all that. The slapstick wit works perfectly well but the acerbic verbal wit is top-notch.While it certainly is a nice way to pass an hour and a half, with all the talent on board, this had the potential to be groundbreaking.

The former does a brilliant riff on `Scientology' (though it was done better in `Bowfinger') and the latter is excellent as the reclusive, meticulous director. The real standout is Hank Azaria as bumbling, lispy Hector who clearly has the funniest character.Joe Roth's directing is as average as one might suspect. But he gives the film an appropriately sour-spirited touch to avoid it being soppy and heart-warming. The narrative isn't bad either- blunt and to the point. Some scenes go on for a bit too long without laughter, but the closing moments are funny enough to make you forget about all that. The slapstick wit works perfectly well but the acerbic verbal wit is top-notch.While it certainly is a nice way to pass an hour and a half, with all the talent on board, this had the potential to be groundbreaking. I prefer to think of it as a nicely wrapped bundle of laughs, as opposed to a mediocre movie from a cast to die for. My advice is to go in with low expectations and you won't be dissapointed. My IMDb rating 6.9\/10.

It's just that once you start playing with what is real and it is not meant to be the newest fantastic story, it invariably screws things up and hurts credibility for many viewers.One last note.

To say it is unfaithful to the original is like saying George Lucas' recent installments in the Star Wars movies have an ounce of creativity in them. It just comes down to one question Why? Why make a scene-for-scene remake (literally!) of the 1960 classic, when people can simply watch the 1960 classic itself? To dupe stoned teens into seeing something modern while they are unknowingly watching a replicant of an earlier film? Do the filmmakers want these teens to come out of the theater with a newfound knowledge of essential cinema? I think not. If so, they would have had the smarts to film it in black and white, and make it more of a brother to the original than a disowned son.I think it is simple As many films' remakes are extraordinary, others are not, and Psycho tries to be that one-in-a-million special remake. I think that the filmmakers wanted to also pay an homage to Alfred Hitchcock For what other reason would they shoot every scene exactly the same? Save the glimpse of Norman masturbating while watching his guest strip down (which happens for about two seconds), and some extended nudity and focuses on Bates' mother in the infamous Shower Scene, it is all the same. Even the camera techniques, such as when the PI walks up the stairs of the Bates residence and is slashed to death by a crazy old woman. There are, of course, small things such as facial expressions that differ, but if you think that I'm being humorous I am not. Maybe the keen observer will notice that certain things are not focused the same way, such as the stuffed birds in Norman's office--they are out of focus, softer, and not as sharp. We don't get a sense of paranoia, fear, or the feeling that we are being watched by dozens of small eyes. The film is just not as sharp, dark, scary, freaky or filled with paranoia. It is more of a soft Psycho, which is odd since the film is often more gory than its father.Gus Van Sant seems to have the purpose and the desire to make a good remake here, but when we know what is going to happen already, we want something knew. There is no sense of unknowing, no sense of fear. We know what is going to happen. This would have been the great chance to provide some more gritty detail into the tale, to modernize things. Of course, if the film had been made this way, no doubt people would have complained it was too different. It's a catch twenty-two. And Alfred Hitchcock is a much better director than Gus Van Sant. It is easy to mimic another film exactly. It is like a toddler mimicking its parents If you stuff a toddler in a room by himself, the chances he will pronounce Momma perfectly will be much smaller than the chance of putting speaking parents in the room with that toddler. Gus Van Sant is the toddler, and Alfred Hitchcock is in that room with him, feeding him the words. All Van Sant has to do is mimic them.Another of the film's flaws is the casting of Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn just isn't freaky enough, or scary enough. Anthony Perkins always gave me a sense that he was a lonely man inside a wretched soul. He was insecure, and he made the audience feel that if we were in that motel room with him, we'd feel pretty uncomfortable, too, just like Janet Leigh's character was in the 1960 version. Norman's laugh doesn't have enough insecurity in it. When Perkins laughed, it made us feel as if he was nervous to do so, as if he expected to be picked apart for laughing at the wrong thing. When Vaughn laughs, it's more of a giddy laugh, an airhead's laugh as opposed to a maniac's.It all comes down to the fact that though Psycho is a good film, and a faithful remake, it has no specific purpose. Why would any audience want to watch a scene-for-scene remake of a much, much better film, when they can simply watch the much, much better film?

Psycho isn't even a bad remake. To say it is unfaithful to the original is like saying George Lucas' recent installments in the Star Wars movies have an ounce of creativity in them. It just comes down to one question Why? Why make a scene-for-scene remake (literally!) of the 1960 classic, when people can simply watch the 1960 classic itself? To dupe stoned teens into seeing something modern while they are unknowingly watching a replicant of an earlier film? Do the filmmakers want these teens to come out of the theater with a newfound knowledge of essential cinema? I think not. If so, they would have had the smarts to film it in black and white, and make it more of a brother to the original than a disowned son.I think it is simple As many films' remakes are extraordinary, others are not, and Psycho tries to be that one-in-a-million special remake. I think that the filmmakers wanted to also pay an homage to Alfred Hitchcock For what other reason would they shoot every scene exactly the same? Save the glimpse of Norman masturbating while watching his guest strip down (which happens for about two seconds), and some extended nudity and focuses on Bates' mother in the infamous Shower Scene, it is all the same. Even the camera techniques, such as when the PI walks up the stairs of the Bates residence and is slashed to death by a crazy old woman. There are, of course, small things such as facial expressions that differ, but if you think that I'm being humorous I am not. Maybe the keen observer will notice that certain things are not focused the same way, such as the stuffed birds in Norman's office--they are out of focus, softer, and not as sharp. We don't get a sense of paranoia, fear, or the feeling that we are being watched by dozens of small eyes. The film is just not as sharp, dark, scary, freaky or filled with paranoia. It is more of a soft Psycho, which is odd since the film is often more gory than its father.Gus Van Sant seems to have the purpose and the desire to make a good remake here, but when we know what is going to happen already, we want something knew. There is no sense of unknowing, no sense of fear. We know what is going to happen. This would have been the great chance to provide some more gritty detail into the tale, to modernize things. Of course, if the film had been made this way, no doubt people would have complained it was too different. It's a catch twenty-two. And Alfred Hitchcock is a much better director than Gus Van Sant. It is easy to mimic another film exactly. It is like a toddler mimicking its parents If you stuff a toddler in a room by himself, the chances he will pronounce Momma perfectly will be much smaller than the chance of putting speaking parents in the room with that toddler. Gus Van Sant is the toddler, and Alfred Hitchcock is in that room with him, feeding him the words. All Van Sant has to do is mimic them.Another of the film's flaws is the casting of Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn just isn't freaky enough, or scary enough. Anthony Perkins always gave me a sense that he was a lonely man inside a wretched soul. He was insecure, and he made the audience feel that if we were in that motel room with him, we'd feel pretty uncomfortable, too, just like Janet Leigh's character was in the 1960 version. Norman's laugh doesn't have enough insecurity in it. When Perkins laughed, it made us feel as if he was nervous to do so, as if he expected to be picked apart for laughing at the wrong thing. When Vaughn laughs, it's more of a giddy laugh, an airhead's laugh as opposed to a maniac's.It all comes down to the fact that though Psycho is a good film, and a faithful remake, it has no specific purpose. Why would any audience want to watch a scene-for-scene remake of a much, much better film, when they can simply watch the much, much better film? You tell me.And as the credits role, notice the thanks to John Woo for his kitchen knife. Needless to say, John Woo's kitchen knife isn't going to be worth as much as the one used in the original. 3\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"8 August 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Richard Donner is one of the most diverse directors I have ever seen.  While he seems to have his head stuck in many veins of comedy (Maverick, the Lethal Weapon movies, Scrooged), he can't resist the various changes in gear.  I will excuse the ultra-ridiculous Superman movies from my comment altogether.The Omen is Donner's only mainstream horror attempt and I must say I am surely surprised by his lack of a television influence.  Donner worked on the Twilight Zone and I think he took a few cues from Rod Serling as towards pacing and what to (not) reveal to the audience.  While Omen is conservative enough by today's standards, it is superior to both The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby because Donner understands the audience better than Friedkin and Polanski.Gregory Peck has never been diverse in his acting appearance, certainly by comparison to someone like Nicolas Cage.  He is wooden, I will admit that, but there is an air of authority that rubs off in many of his roles whether it's Captain Ahab, Lt. Clemens, or Atticus Finch.  Here his stoicism doesn't help because a character in his position needs to be flexible.  Donner understands this shortcoming and more than makes up for it with his interaction of the various characters.Of course, the real highlight is not visible.  Jerry Goldsmith provides some of the best pompous horror music ever created that exceeds what John Carpentar has composed.  It is so vibrant, and more than a little spooky, that the film itself cannot hold a candle to the power he unleashes with his notes.Donner's camera is very loose for a 70s movie, that was a bit of a surprise.  He isn't interested in money shots, just creating a mood.  David Warner complements that mood as the quirky photographer who never learned basic do's and don'ts of automobile safety.  See it, you'll understand.Unfortunately, the basic story is what takes the worst fall.  Many of the elements, the priest in particular, are mere parodies and the numerous sequels and spin-offs of the story have given rise to the cockamamie anti-Christ genre that is deader than Madeline Murray O'Hare.  (brief spoiler) While I knew that Peck would never complete his mission--who would ceremonially slaughter a child in a movie like this?--I was rather surprised as to how he failed.  The epilogue alone flaunts Donner's directorial skills.Overall, a slightly better-than-average horror movie to pass the time.  While it is aged, the movie is not about shocks (although there are quite a few) and defines the genre.  End of debate.  Donner's work is never deep, but he knows the audience and has a much better knowledge of the film process than someone like Michael Bay.  We'll see how his rendition of Timeline comes out, certain to be a misfire.  3 out of 5 stars.
