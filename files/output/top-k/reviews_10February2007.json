Many people seemed not to like it because it completely destroyed the line in which the first two moved. But that was until I saw it.I didn't expect too much from it, because of all the things that people used to say. But as I was watching it I realised how wrong all those people were. This movie reflects the end of one of the most tragical stories ever told, it shows another vision from the main character, Michael Corleone, who is wonderfully performed by Al Pacino. His life has been all full of something he never wanted. But he carried on with it until the end because it was kind of his responsibility after his father and brother death. But in this film, He appears to really want redemption for all what he has done.This is one of the things that people like the least from the Godfather III. And I can't understand it. Of course, it would have been easier for Francis Ford Coppola to film another movie with the remaining bad acts from Michael, full of violence and similar to the other two. But this movie gets into the mind of Michael, and shows his inner feelings, that have stayed there forever, ever since he killed his brother. It is one of the most powerful films ever psychologically speaking.If The Godfather part III had been a continuation of the other two, the trilogy would have been open for more, and it wouldn't have been as perfect as it is, as the three are, all together.And to talk about the performances, this may be one of the best performed movies ever. Al Pacino offers a masterwork in a grown up moment of his career, with solid speeches, and powerful acting full of emotion and expression, totally one of the best in his career. He amazed me in the final scenes, with the killing of his daughter, he really showed a Shakespearean dramatical performance. Awesome. And Diane Keaton gives the perfect answer to him as the unforgiving ex-wife of Michael Corleone, Kay. Then there is the young actors, such as Andy Garcia, in his early career, sums up with this movie the essence of the Corleone family in just one character, and Sofia Coppola acts really well too, despite all the people who say the opposite.The story of this movie is so touching that it could make you cry, because it's about a person who has suffered a degeneration because of some external circumstances and after all his life, he apologises for everything, because he wants to die in peace.Maybe it's not the best one of the trilogy, and maybe the two first were more impacting, specially for that time, and of course I think that The Godfather I or II is the best movie ever, but let's not think that's a good reason to say this isn't a great one too. It's the closing to the story of Michael Corleone.So, to sum up, I can understand that it didn't won any Oscar and all that stuff, but no one should think this is a bad movie, cause it's a must-see for everyone interested and it's probably one of the most underrated films in history (obviously it had a hard work to do, due to the quality of the first ones). It's unthinkable from my point of view, to see the two first parts of the Godfather without seeing this one, just to complete them, as totally perfect as they are.

This the first movie I got to lie about my age with a bunch of friends to get into see by myself. This was before mega-plexes and folks could come in to a film 1\/2 though and sit through it again just to see the whole thing...well...at least my friends and I had. We all saw Altered States in Center City Philadelphia at the end of 1979. At that time, there were several streets that were close to each other that were showing top feature films. We didn't intend to see Altered States, we just wanted to see a movie. And here's the big nostalgia piece of this story Altered States was not widely released until 1980, so we were one of the first to sneak peak it and didn't know that's what we did!!!I'll never forget the films we had to choose from that were playing in that section Hurricane (with SEN-SO-ROUND), Alien and Altered States. We heard that Hurricane was really bad except for the big budget hurricane scene (hence the SEN-SO-ROUND gimmick), and besides no one was at the theater. We heard that the only cool part in Alien is when the thing pops out of the man's chest and other than that it was boring (which much later I found to be untrue, I loved Alien!). And then there was Altered States which we knew nothing about. We thought we'd give it a whirl. We lied about our ages, payed our money and went in. This film blew our little minds. We didn't know any of the actors in the film, the film was one discovery after another.I immediately fell in love with William Hurt as Eddie Jessup. He was spot on as a brilliant and young tormented professor who would go on a relentless pursuit of Why am I here - what is life all for? ignoring everything in the present including the neglecting of his brilliant girlfriend\/wife Emily, played by Blair Brown and his colleagues.Jessup has deep routed and unresolved psychological problems that seemed to begin when he was a child daily experiencing the slow and painful death of his father to whom he had deep affection for. Watching his demise daily set Jessup in motion to want to know what life and death was for.He grows up ever having that nagging question in his mind and in his psyche. He goes to college, excels...meets a part of himself he has buried in Emily. It is she that irks him into marriage. They have children, they seemingly grow apart ... because Jessup is still after his truth instead of his present.Jessup is informed that a tribe of Indians have a drug\/substance that can assist him in reaching that of which he seems to want, so he goes and gets it, and experiments with it. The question is - is he placing himself in danger with this untried, unlicensed usage of this drug or is he actually finding out what he seeks? This film is a trip itself as we watch Jessup experiment with the drug and as he needs more 'free form buoyancy', he adds the sensory tank - where things really externalize with each administration of the drug. His colleagues (played by the wonderful Bob Balban and Charles Haid) and ex-wife are truly worried by this stage - not just about the experiments, but about his health - but Jessup feels he's growing every-so-close to his mission - to get it on with God. But is it that's he's after or is it something more closer to home? I didn't know anything about the controversy with the author Paddy, and how many directors walked off the set. All I know is that this was quite the cool and trippy film that gave you insight into one man's brilliant obsession with something he could not know or control. And that was wild to watch! A few years later when we all got older and totally into 80's new wave music ... we recognized the most famous and fantastic part of the film used in an 'A-HA' video and at that point we knew that this film was not quite the failure some thought it was. And the best way of flattery is imitation...and Altered States was\/is imitated often. I was just glad to be one of the first folks to see it when it came out and that is how I will always remember it.

It is a Middle Eastern film from Iran and therefore is subtitled and very different from American movies. It does move rather slow and has many scenes with little or no talking. I believe this is good because it gives you time to think about and recognize what is going on in the movie without relying on the characters to tell you. Many things in the movie are implied rather than stated outright. Very few, if any, of the actors were professionals, however the cast is brilliant. The main character, the young boy Ali, is especially convincing. The movie has heavy Islamic themes which you should be able to easily pick out if you have knowledge of the religion. I believe the overall theme of the movie would be that God will always take care of you, even if he does it in a way you did not expect.Ali is a young boy who accidentally lost his younger sister, Zahra's, shoes. Their family cannot afford to buy a new pair, so Ali and Zahra race back and forth from school to share one pair of sneakers. At the end of the movie, Ali participates in a race to win a pair of sneakers for his sister. He must come in third place to win the shoes, but through his determination he accidentally comes in first. He is very disappointed and extremely exhausted after the race. He goes home to Zahra knowing he has let her down. The movie then cuts to a scene of his father at the market and shows new shoes for Ali and Zahra on the back of his bike. Then it comes back to Ali and we watch as he soothes his tired, blistered feet in a pool of water.Ali and Zahra worked very hard to share one pair of sneakers and to keep their parents from worrying about Zahra's lost shoes. Although it was hard, they worked together every day. Ali was very excited when the prospect of new sneakers came up. He knew he could win them and tried his hardest. But in the end, he did not get what he wanted. He felt like a failure and knew his sister was disappointed. However, the viewers see that everything is taken care of; both children will get new shoes. This clearly shows the author's belief that God will give his people what they need. He gives Ali a cool, refreshing pool to soak and cleanse his aching feet in. And even though He did not give Ali the shoes from the race, He still provided shoes; a pair for each child. So God provided even more than what was needed. So in the end, God will take care of you so long as you work hard and care about others.

A hint of comedy, reality, and the obvious diverse use of the f-word is something that TBS presents whole heartedly to the screen.I strongly urge all who have not scene this piece of cinematic history to pick up a copy today.

When I saw the movie, I not only got a sense of her personal life, but also of the culture out of which she grew. We see how her family was one of the most destitute imaginable, with more children than they could handle, and so Loretta's parents felt like they had no choice but to marry her off at the age of thirteen. As for Doolittle, we see how he clearly had a lot of problems - namely drinking and womanizing - but was a decent person at heart.From the beginning, the movie fascinates. Playing a thirteen-year-old, Sissy Spacek has no trouble looking the part. As the story progresses and Loretta ages, she still looks the part (I don't think that I've ever seen anyone else do that; that alone may have been what won her the Best Actress Oscar). Tommy Lee Jones is equally great as Doolittle, showing him as a sorry but still respectable person.There was one mildly unrealistic thing that I noticed in the movie. Loretta's father Ted (Levon Helm) looked a little too clean and polished for someone who spent his days working in the coal mines. But that doesn't drag the movie down at all. CMD is a very good movie, affirming Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones as two of the greatest actors of our time.Among other things, the movie also shows that Michael Apted (happy birthday, Michael!) is a director whom we need to recognize more. He also directed the 7 Up series, Agatha, Continental Divide, Gorky Park, and the never-released-on-video-or-DVD Stardust, among other things.Anyway, it's a very good movie. I definitely recommend it. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo as Patsy Cline.

It's INTENSE. It's DARK. There's not a single character in the movie who's likable, and some viewers attack that like it's a bad thing. The story line is complex, the relationships between the numerous characters are subtle and nuanced; and still, some viewers attack that like that's a bad thing.Just because a viewer doesn't understand something, doesn't make the film bad. It's a difference of opinion, absolutely, but that doesn't make The Way of the Gun a bad film. Au contraire, this is a very smart film... and when a filmmaker is making a smart film about amoral, gun-toting outlaws, the people who come to see that sort of movie are going to feel confused and angry. Because they wanted it to be simple. They wanted easy answers, a clear-cut good guy and bad guy, and a happy ending. The way movies have gone since film noir faded away, decades ago.But this film is not so simple, and neither are the characters within it, nor is the plot. Chris McQuarrie refuses to write something so cut-and-dry, so black-and-white. It's taut, it's tight, it rides a bad vibe from the opening sequence all the way down to the last line. This film is so gritty it makes me feel dirty after watching it... McQuarrie may be a victim of his own success, because it was released in the aftermath of The Usual Suspects, but if it built up an underground following like The Killer, it would be on the shelf of must-haves next to John Woo, Guy Ritchie and any other art film your parents wouldn't approve of.Every character has his own motive, has his own backstory, and not all are necessarily spelled out for you. The dialogue is wound so tight, it snaps Fifteen million dollars is not money. It's a motive, with a universal adapter on it.I own this movie, and on a dark, rainy afternoon, I'll whip it out on the unsuspecting guest... It's from the writer of 'The Usual Suspects' I tell them.

Sharon Stone is good in her role, but she is just so unlikable that you don't feel any sympathy for her. Same for Joe Pesci. He has none of the humor that he brought to his role in Goodfellas, where he played another mob psycho.That is why I hate this movie, because all three lead actors are so unlikable that you don't care what happens to any of them. Only the supporting cast, led by Don Rickles and Alan King breathe any life into this movie. James Woods is great in his limited role as well. Funny how you sympathize more with his scumbag role than you do with the other three. Woods could have been the lead in this movie. It just goes on FOREVER, and there are long stretches where you feel like nothing happens. A great cure for insomnia.This was the last Scorsese\/De Niro film, but hopefully not the last.
