[{"date":"17 August 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Billy Chapel has grown up his whole life being with the Detroit Tigers but on this final game of the season several things affect him his girlfriend is leaving for London, the team is about to be sold and he is guaranteed to be traded once it is all over. So this night he is going to throw hard as we get glimpses of his life up to this moment. Have you ever seen one person brood so much? The movie seems very long at points despite the fact how the game and the flashbacks go back and forth is well done. Brief points of melodramatic mush do not seem to match the emotions of what any ball player (minus this brooder) would actually act like. Overall the movie is not bad, so it is an OK rental. Compared to other baseball movies though, it probably will not rank as anybody 's new #1 hitter.
