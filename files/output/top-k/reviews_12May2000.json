Now, I like Tom Hanks. I like Meg Ryan. I loved them together in Joe Versus the Volcano (haven't seen Sleepless in Seattle - and have no intention of ever doing so). But they completely fizzle here. It's not really their fault. The script is so hard-wired to prevent any audience sympathy or interaction. The premise would appear to be golden two people fall in love with one another via the Internet, only to realize that in real life they can't stand each other. This is an intriguing set-up (and a savvy and intelligent update of Shop Around the Corner's pen-pal conceit); the scenes where we hear (through voiceover) Tom and Meg's communiques with each other are low-key and sweet. But. . . oh, there are so many buts - such as*Did the script really need to pair up the stars with respective live-ins (Greg Kinnear for her, Parker Posey for him)? These characters never get explored in the least, are blatant caricatures (he of N.Y. intelligentsia, she of the brash and crass world of publishing), and are dispensed of without any noticeable fanfare.

Surely, having the leads be separated by not knowing each others' identities should have been (and is) complication enough.*Why is Hanks' character privy to the secret identity of his e-mail partner so long before Ryan's is? True, this development corresponds structurally to the one played out in Shop Around the Corner, but that's not really a fair comparison. There, the entire movie was more or less seen through the eyes of Jimmy Stewart's character, and our identification with him made us wonder how he would make use of his knowledge. Here, though, Hanks and Ryan are given equal weight and screen time; neither represents the definitive perspective through which the film is to be seen. As such, awarding his character knowledge which she does not possess strikes of a desire to play favorites - and wreaks havoc with the trajectory of the movie's second half. It suddenly ceases being a movie about equals and becomes more about the deliberate manipulations and evasions of Tom Hanks' character - making the whole thing seem insincere and smarmy, rather than fun or heart-warming.*And speaking of smarmy, what's with the moral of this story? Is there one?! I mean sure, going in, we more or less figure that there will be a sappy but endearing message about love winning out in the end over personal differences. Which we're prepared for (and frankly, if you're not, you've stepped into not only the wrong movie but the wrong genre). Since, in the film, Hanks and Ryan are the heads of rival bookstores - he a large and impersonal chain, she a small, independently owned neighborhood store catering lovingly to children - we get to see their personal peccadillos played out in the world of business. This is a good idea, particularly as his chain is attempting to drive hers out of business. Problem is, no one really had the heart to make Tom Hanks the yuppie s.o.b. he really needed to be for this story to work (of course, the Hanks of the '80s was born to play just this role - but now that he's graduated to bland nice guy parts I suppose all nuance and complexity have gone out of his work). What the filmmakers do instead is truly laughable (and here comes a major SPOILER, so if you don't want to know how this film ends stop reading here) - they have Hanks' company run Ryan's out of business - and then have her fall in love with him anyway. HUH?! Could someone explain that to me? The two don't reach a détente, a middle ground, in their personal and business bickering. They don't join forces, or find some compromise way to co-exist. I was at least expecting some diatribe against big business in favor of small and independent shopowners who truly care about their product. Corny though it might have been, it at least would have been consistent with the genre it found itself in. Or the movie might have been truly brave and suggested that, under the circumstances, there was no way Ryan could ever be with Hanks, as much as she loves him in cyberspace, for their fundamental difference in temperament and philosophy would always keep them apart. Then, maybe, Tom would have to undergo some kind of transformation or catharsis or. . . . but, hey, since he's already such a nice guy in this movie, screw it, let's just have him win heartlessly in business, and get the girl anyway. Under all the gossamer and syrup of the ending, it's a pretty mean-spirited and cynical message this movie is pushing. Very distasteful, too.

","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"12 May 2000","score":"28 out of 53 people found the following review useful","review":"  10) Francois Truffaut - I'm sorry, nothing against the guy personally, but Spielberg casting him in this movie was a mistake. At least without giving him a solid, intensive course in how to speak English. I don't mean to be so U.S.-centric, but come on - when one of your main characters has to have his every sentence translated, it gets awfully annoying, and calls undue attention to itself. A real Special Edition would have shown mercy for the audience and had his entire character edited out.9) Terri Garr - Again, nothing against her, but this has to be, next to Willie Scott in Temple of Doom, the worst written female character in any Spielberg film. Ok, we're supposed to get that Roy Neary is becoming obsessed, moving dangerously away from his family - but how well served is that premise if his wife is such an unfeeling bitch from the get-go? We never see any kind of harmonious rapport between them, but neither are any marital problems examined or made clear to us. She's just the cardboard bad guy of the piece, and such two-dimensionality is cheap in a movie which purports to at least be partly about real people. After all, Darth Vader or the Nazis make more enjoyable and less offensive villains than Teri Garr ever could.   But her character is only symptomatic of a much bigger problem the film has, which leads directly to. . . 8) Who the hell ARE these people?! - And why are they so gosh-darned obsessed with UFOs. Why is it so important that Roy Neary get on that spaceship? Why is Melinda Dillon's kid - alone amongst the entire pre-adolescent population - singled out for abduction by the mysterious aliens? Why are all these seemingly normal people drawn to making replicas of that ooga-booga lookin' Devil's Tower? I mean, I know there's a place for dramatic ambiguity (hey, I love 2001!), but Steven can you at least throw us a bone? What is it about the particular people who are invited (in the words of Truffaut's interpreter) to see the alien landing that makes them so special? If Spielberg could have figured out some way to tie these peoples' emotional lives to the urge for extraterrestrial contact (as he did in E.T.) he might have had something powerful here. In the absence of any such clear link, however, all we get is a bunch of sound and fury (oh, and LIGHTS, too!) which ultimately signify nothing.7) The funereal pace - Steve, yo Steve - who told you that you had to be so damn solemn about this whole thing? I guess, after Jaws, you were trying to prove that you could be SERIOUS, and WEIGHTY - and that translated inevitably as SLOW. Things take forever to happen in this movie - probably to cover up for the fact that not much does. 6) The running up the mountain sequence - Ok, this is perhaps a crass criticism, but am I the only one who noticed that Neary's and Jillian's escape to the top of Devil's Tower (against direct Army orders) could have made for a great action chase? In a movie, I might add, which desperately needs some action! A whole ten-minute cat and mouse game between Neary and co. and the Army helicopters in pursuit could have been a tour-de-force of style, tension and kineticism. You know, the kind Spielberg is known for. Instead, he just throws the sequence away. They get to the top of the mountain - end of story.5) Mothership sequence lasts far too long, with no real payoff - Yeh, all those flashing lights were cool, and that five-note musical motif is ominous and haunting - but what of it? Ok, so the set pieces are in place for a great sequence, but. . . nothing really happens, does it? And, as with the rest of the movie, it takes so long for it not to happen, that you're numb about halfway through. This is where all the individual failures of the movie come together to lay one big colossal turd upon the viewer. Since we don't care about, or even understand, the characters we are cut off from their personal rapture at the landing; since the aliens' plans or general purpose is never articulated (or even suggested), there is no tension generated by wondering what they are going to do when they get here; and since the entire movie has been so deliberately slow and ponderous, this scene has to be even slower - you know, to show how important and climactic it is. What we're left with is a big sound and light show, nothing more.

Ok, we're supposed to get that Roy Neary is becoming obsessed, moving dangerously away from his family - but how well served is that premise if his wife is such an unfeeling bitch from the get-go? We never see any kind of harmonious rapport between them, but neither are any marital problems examined or made clear to us. She's just the cardboard bad guy of the piece, and such two-dimensionality is cheap in a movie which purports to at least be partly about real people. After all, Darth Vader or the Nazis make more enjoyable and less offensive villains than Teri Garr ever could.   But her character is only symptomatic of a much bigger problem the film has, which leads directly to. . . 8) Who the hell ARE these people?! - And why are they so gosh-darned obsessed with UFOs. Why is it so important that Roy Neary get on that spaceship? Why is Melinda Dillon's kid - alone amongst the entire pre-adolescent population - singled out for abduction by the mysterious aliens? Why are all these seemingly normal people drawn to making replicas of that ooga-booga lookin' Devil's Tower? I mean, I know there's a place for dramatic ambiguity (hey, I love 2001!), but Steven can you at least throw us a bone? What is it about the particular people who are invited (in the words of Truffaut's interpreter) to see the alien landing that makes them so special? If Spielberg could have figured out some way to tie these peoples' emotional lives to the urge for extraterrestrial contact (as he did in E.T.) he might have had something powerful here. In the absence of any such clear link, however, all we get is a bunch of sound and fury (oh, and LIGHTS, too!) which ultimately signify nothing.7) The funereal pace - Steve, yo Steve - who told you that you had to be so damn solemn about this whole thing? I guess, after Jaws, you were trying to prove that you could be SERIOUS, and WEIGHTY - and that translated inevitably as SLOW. Things take forever to happen in this movie - probably to cover up for the fact that not much does. 6) The running up the mountain sequence - Ok, this is perhaps a crass criticism, but am I the only one who noticed that Neary's and Jillian's escape to the top of Devil's Tower (against direct Army orders) could have made for a great action chase? In a movie, I might add, which desperately needs some action! A whole ten-minute cat and mouse game between Neary and co. and the Army helicopters in pursuit could have been a tour-de-force of style, tension and kineticism. You know, the kind Spielberg is known for. Instead, he just throws the sequence away. They get to the top of the mountain - end of story.5) Mothership sequence lasts far too long, with no real payoff - Yeh, all those flashing lights were cool, and that five-note musical motif is ominous and haunting - but what of it? Ok, so the set pieces are in place for a great sequence, but. . . nothing really happens, does it? And, as with the rest of the movie, it takes so long for it not to happen, that you're numb about halfway through. This is where all the individual failures of the movie come together to lay one big colossal turd upon the viewer. Since we don't care about, or even understand, the characters we are cut off from their personal rapture at the landing; since the aliens' plans or general purpose is never articulated (or even suggested), there is no tension generated by wondering what they are going to do when they get here; and since the entire movie has been so deliberately slow and ponderous, this scene has to be even slower - you know, to show how important and climactic it is.

Here is another one, a good one, set in a time and place we haven't seen depicted in cinema for quite some time. The film uses its height-of-the-Roman Empire setting well and delivers on the promise of action and adventure. Set in the last days of the good Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the film takes on the familiar subject of a World Power worrying a little too much about its neighbors and not tending to its own growing problems at home. In the opening scene, Marcus watches his powerful Roman army, led by his general and respected friend Maximus (Crowe), tear into a rebelling army of Germanic barbarians. This opening scene is a huge, loud, impressive spectacle that the movie never really tops. The Emperor would like to pass along rule of the Empire to Maximus, which comes as disturbing news to Marcus' disgraceful son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Commodus sees to it that his father's dying wish is not carried out, and promptly orders Maximus executed. From here on, bad things happen to Maximus and to Rome, with the evil nervous wreck Commodus behind it all.Maximus, thought dead by the new Emperor, is sold into slavery and trained to fight in the &#145;gladiator' games, the entertainment choice of the times until they were abolished by Marcus Aurelius. Commodus, however, brings the games back. In the past, gladiators who could win over the crowds in the Colosseum would earn their freedom. Maximus has something else to fight for-revenge. Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, G.I. Jane) stages the arena scenes with pure entertainment in mind, just as the real things were. The whole idea of the games was to re-enact in a way, great wars fought and won by Rome. So here is Maximus, as a gladiator, pretending to be a soldier in an army he had likely conquered as a general in real life. This is when Maximus' character really gets under our skin. A lesser person might wallow in the obvious humiliation of his situation, but Maximus doesn't. He finds every opportunity to use it for the benefit of himself and his estranged countrymen. The story is so strong that these arena scenes become simply pieces of the whole that help to propel things forward. Scott never succumbs to the temptation of showing any more brutality than is necessary.Joaquin Phoenix creates a truly loathsome human being in Commodus. This is the kind of twitchy, insecure kid a father would keep his daughter miles away from and here he is in charge of the world's greatest empire. The casting of Phoenix; along with Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Oliver Reed, and of course Crowe, shows that Gladiator's creators preferred substance over style.The casting, the photography, the writing-all of these things seem to have been given great care.

Perry gets very little to do in this film, but plays his character in such a monotonous in such a monotonous way that, after a while, he only succeeds in being irritating rather than being funny.The others show us no comic talents either Rosanna Arquette(with some sort of French accent?)irritates too, Amanda Peet gets her best moments in the nude scenes(!), which however seem totally out of place and even Kevin Pollack has an bad part as the mob-boss-son(is that an Hungarian accent?). Michael Clarke Duncan(the giant from THE GREEN MILE) gives a reasonable performance, but has to watch out for type-casting. Only Natasha Henstridge(best known from the awful SPECIES-films)is satisfying in the only serious role of the film. Could it have something to do with the fact that she gets nothing funny to say?All in all, this film is disappointing as a comedy. However, it is gentle and good-natured(despite some mild violence) and I guess that it could work too, for people that haven't seen many other parodies on the crime genre. But the jokes are too familiar and the timing is too bad to make this film actually funny. And, let's admit it Willis is no De Niro and Perry is no Crystal either. But I think that even those two couldn't have saved this film. 5\/10   ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"12 May 2000","score":"","review":"  I have seen near-perfection, and it is Gladiator.Others have said more eloquently what I could here, so I will not go into any detail.

In such a way, Battlefield Earth is the satisfying next chapter in filmed science fiction that Star Wars The Phantom Menace was supposed to be. It has all the raw energy and crisp, brilliant storytelling of the original Star Wars, along with it's own blend of intense, relentless action and ironical humor that made that film a landmark offering. The classic sf book, Battlefield Earth must have been a major headache to adapt; action scenes spanning the universe, intrigue, political drama, speculative science, and a long cast of unforgettable characters.  That the team that brings us this new film managed to capture the spirit of the book as successfully as they have is a testament to what could only be an intense personal dedication to getting it right, and audiences will reap the benefits. The actors do a magnificent job.  Barry Pepper looks like he worked his ass off doing this part. His intense, chiselled looks and expressive determined face really sell the heroics, and you believe his dedication completely. John Travolta takes a chance on his career that no other leading man would- an evil alien.  And he finds a way to have the most fun doing it.  I laughed and laughed at his evil glee. Forrest Whittaker, as well, takes a huge gamble and pulls off one magnificent performance. Kim Coates is delightful.  His contribution is really key, and in the final battle, really drew me into an understanding of why one makes the ultimate personal sacrifice.

Awesome effects in the finale. Some have found cause to criticise Battlefield Earth because of the religious beliefs of the producer\/star Travolta.

For some reason, though one never reads (not since nazi germany) of Jewish messages being a reason to avoid a work of entertainment, such courtesy is not extended to Travolta, whose Scientology status is well known and publicized. I find it in very bad taste to let one's intolerance of another's religion get so out of hand as to bad mouth Travolta's talents, which are formidable, because of it.

I paid nothing to see this movie, and I got my passes through a local radio station. But I was not alone. This preview crowd was enormous, as evidenced by the square yardage the whole flock of us took up in the food court outside the theatre. Believe me, this was a huge gaggle of folks. And they all seemed excited to be there. Why was I there? Well, I somehow knew how it would all turn out in the end...But my dear sweet heaven... I had no idea that a movie could really and truly be so incredibly bad. Words do not begin to describe the times when the stupidity of the dialogue or the inanity of the plot smacked me cross-eyed with embarrassment for whoever directed this monstrosity.Okay. Okay. Calming down. Surely there were good points... Ever want to see John Travolta stomp around in Gene Simmon's KISS boots and an 8-inch forehead? Well, this is the movie you have been waiting for. Ever want to see a poor agrarian tribesman fly a Harrier jet with Luke Skywalker-in-the-Trenches precision after seven days training? Then step right up, my friend...The plotholes are enormous. The acting is so over-the-top that it drops over the visible horizon, whirls around the equator and smacks you right across the back of the head.

And it isn't helped by what has to be the most gratingly banal score since Eyes Wide Shut.

It's absolutely unbelieveble, from the begining until the end. David Fincher proves again his extraordinary abbilities as a director (after he amazed the world with The game and Seven) and realizes a real work of art. A perfect combination of thriller, dark comedy and psichological. David Fincher+Brad Pitt+Edward Norton--super! Brad Pitt shows everyone that he's not only appreciated because of his looks, but because he has a certain ammount of talent.And Edward Norton... what can I say? I am Jack's mountain of rage and anger. If that wasn't an Oscar performance, then which is? He plaied fabulous, and if those people from the American Film Academy weren't that one-sided, taking in consideration only dramas or love-stories, and would take a short glance at another type of movies, like Fight Club, Norton would have been admiring right this very moment a well deserved gold statue. The movie is too violent to have any other effect on critics but repulsion, but its real value cannot be judged. At least in my mind, the Oscar for a leading role sounds like this The winner is... Edward Norton. About the movie... only good things to say. It's absolutly delightful. The furniture needed by Edward's appartement, the explosion, the reason for people to fight, the horrible, unconscient laughter of Pitt, when he's beaten by the owner of the bar, the scenes between Edward and his boss, everything is made to perfection. I can't end this without saying something about Helena Carter, who completes the greatness of the movie, playing very good a tough and interesting role. And the ending... great!So, all of' ya, who wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT! All of' ya who don't wanna see this movie, GO SEE IT! All of' ya who saw this movie before, GO SEE IT!It would be the wisest choice ever.Grading 11 (out of 10).Chris, Brasov, Romania.

I guess it has something to do with that Ron L. Hubbard thing, the founder of Scientology, Travolta's religion.  And it's no surprise that Travolta has his wife, Kelly Preston, also appear in the film.  And that Travolta help produced this film as well.     BATTLEFIELD EARTH takes place in the year 3,000; where Earth is nothing more than a ruin.  The humans are endangered spieces, and Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) is searching for food for his tribe of fellow humans.  Johnny comes across some other humans including Ker (Kim Coates), who shows Johnny the ancient ruins of a big city, and the frozen humans who were actually mannaquins and statues.  Then the humans are captured by a race called Psychols.  Psychols are about nine feet tall, have dreadlocks, bad dental hygene, and yellow eyes. Terl (John Travolta) is the head officer of the Psychols on Earth.  Terl and his assitant Ker (Forest Whitakerker) have a plan to enslave the humans and search for some gold and take all of it back to their home planet of Psychlo.  Meanwhile, Terl educates Johnny to know about the Psychlo race and history. This way Johnny could fly and understand what the Psychlos are doing.  It's also to assist the audience on what the hell is going on.      BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a bad sc-fi film in the tradition of DUNE and POSTMAN.  There are spectacular effects and sets, but the acting, story, and pacing of all three are too slow.  At least BATTLEFIELD is under two hours.  I don't know why the camera had to do a dutch angle, (or in English terms, tilt) whenever we see a Psychlo.  Does the titlting of the camera make the Psychlo look taller?  Not to me, it just made me sicker.  And the acting by Travolta is as big as a Christmas ham.  While Barry Pepper shows little acting talent compared to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and GREEN MILE.        This is a bad movie, it tries, but it doesn't succeed.  I guess the only thing that Hollywood film director Roger Christian should have done is leave BATTLEFIELD EARTH to the imagination of the reader, instead of making this a two hour film promoting Scientology.  I was waiting for one of the Psychlos to be reading a copy of DIANETICS.
