With it's quiet feel the film can really jump into life at any moment and you won't find many films that can pull this kind of thing off and still keep you entertained until the last few moments. I felt First Blood was a solidly pretty good action movie, and here is why below.The story is thrilling yet has a slight dramatic depth to it to say that most of these type plots usually end up all guns blazing and deaths constantly. This film manages to avoid the over the top amount of kills and settles for a slow pace that really does work. I especially liked the start when Rambo is pushed over the edge emotionally, it brings the whole film to a thrilling start and even the most hardened veterans of action films will still feel their heart beating faster.Sylvester Stallone is an actor that many times is criticised, but here he is at his near full best, doesn't talk an awful lot but his emotion carries and you really start to feel for what he says(well, if you can at times make it out). I liked Richard Crenna and his calm demeanour in the film, even in the most dangerous of times he still seems to keep a straight face and mind and the actor really knows how to make himself look like a father figure.It is directed quite well and same goes for the writing, Ted Kotcheff I feel maybe didn't need to do much in scenes as Stallone just knows it all anyway but is hand is steady throughout the movie. Stallone is among the writers and he does well too, although with the 3 and the dialogues sometimes kept at a minimum, it is easy to see just how easy this was to write really. I liked some stunts but I felt more was needed in that area and more things like big jumps and run chases would have been appreciated as well.My main critical points focus on the slightly dull dialogue and parts seem a bit rushed in honesty, it doesn't hurt the film badly as I have already said, it is a pretty good movie, but it definitely makes some scenes seem rubbishy. I wasn't too keen either on the way the film has to keep pointing out Stallone is hard to kill and a seasoned veteran, it got on my nerves because we hear it 20 times when Richard Crenna arrives, and even more after just a few minutes.I think those who love good action and a story pieced together actually quite well, you will enjoy it, has a good back story but also doesn't focus too much in the past, stays in the present story. If you like massive explosions and car chases etc, this may not be for you really, lacks in that department but if it had them in the film, it would have ruined it and made it so much more unrealistic and rubbish.Overall it is Solidly Good and although not quite straight good, still is moving there by the end. It just needed a little more time I feel and it could have rated even higher, worth a watch though for anyone who likes film. One more thing, if you like Stallone and his many movies that include fighting and shooting etc, you should have a blast with this, this could be Stallone's best action thriller film he has ever done(and he does a lot of them), a great watch for you guys and with so many sequels too, why not watch it.

The problem at the beginning was the stupid black screen that didn't gave a clue to the spectator about what was happening or what was the director trying to show. It was later that I discovered that in fact it was that monolith thing trying to communicate or something like that, awful. The problem with this movie as many others said in the reviews was that it was too slow. It was showing you the same thing from different angles over and over again, instead of just running the movie. If you can believe this there were actually four main scenes in the entire movie. The one with the monolith at the dawn of men, the one with that men coming to that ship and having his speech and the discovery of the monolith on the moon, then that mission to Jupiter and the battle between an useless computer and the guys from the mission, and in the end that stupid evolution thing which doesn't make any sense at all.Now I won't try to deny the evolution or say anything about it, but the problem with the first scene is that the thing with the dawn of men is just silly. You don't get anything from that first scene except the fact that those beings were there at our beginnings but didn't influenced us at all, nor even it shows if those beings created us or something like that. How could monkeys began to behave so crazy? Why there isn't any logic in that? What's the reason for that scene? So basically, what was so special about Dave that those superior beings wanted to evolve him into that starchild? Was he any different than those men who discovered the monolith on the moon? They were living in the same period of time, so basically they were almost the same in every aspect.The problem with the starchild that I have seen is that it doesn't represent another form of human existence, because you can see it, is material, and all that you can see, all that is made of flesh and bones will one stop existing or pass from this world. I guess here is were God comes in and transforms our bodies into another form of existence that we will never understand it because we are human, and all that a human can think of is something material, from flesh and bones, something that will one day cease to exist.Another problem in this film is that the human kind appears to be to advanced in 2001. We actually didn't advanced much since 1920's till 1960's, what possible miracle could make us advance so much in 40 years. Even now with all of this technology we don't advance, but sometimes remain the same in some ways. Oh, wait! The moon landing that will unlock our technology or brain potential and we will evolve ourselves to something like what we see in the movie.Well i guess Stanley Kubrick's genius didn't think of that before making this movie. Well, what could have he thinking of? Following the same pattern of all other people believing we will advance so much in so little time. No, we'll not. Not even in 100 years we won't. If Kubrick was a genius he would have not taken into consideration only the evolution theory but tried to listen to some other principles, like those of what I said earlier in this review. But... no we're gonna evolve beyond our comprehension. Good luck with that one.So basically what Stanley Kubrick tried to show was something that even he couldn't understand it completely, so he just left room for guessing which in my opinion is a waste of a great potential movie, with great special effects.Only a four from me, and that's for the amazing special effects.

The Godfather II made its predecessor look like an outdated piece of mushy cake with a left-over warped-face - it was JUST THAT GREAT, and it was BOUNDS ahead of the first one. And then, there's this one - The Godfather Part III - which is a very interesting and concluding film to the series. Thrilling, entertaining, and so much more. But you can't help find difficulty in saying it's better than any of the predecessors as it, in all honesty, is not. The Godfather III is a very good crime-thriller that concludes the much- loved trilogy in epic ways - however, that being said, it's still far worse in comparison to the second one, and it's not as the first one either. With plenty of good acting, of course, you can't help but love it; or parts of it, even. Was part of the problem HOW LONG THEY LEFT IT!?!? Nah, probably not. But presumably, it's because there wasn't anything spicy, or new they could add to the bowl --- all the greatness had been left behind, ultimately, in Part II - which is a masterpiece, might I add. The Godfather III deserves its 7.6 rating, I guess. But I wouldn't give it 7.6, I would give it 7.0. EXACTLY SEVEN. It's a good film that you'll probably enjoy MORE if you ACTUALLY HAVE seen the first two. Decently good rating of 7.0, I award it.

The fans that had remained through the show's second-season decline doubtlessly wanted a conclusion to the show's many narrative strands. A feature film could have provided a sense of closure, as with future cult TV shows Firefly and Veronica Mars. But of course, David Lynch has never been one to give people what they want.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel, and one that doesn't really provide any information about Laura Palmer's death that isn't revealed in the first half of the TV series. As such, it's inessential even for fans of the show, and at times can feel like a rehash of old material (especially in the first half hour, another quirky detective investigating another murdered young girl).So why watch Fire Walk With Me? Well, there are some fun appearances by the likes of David Bowie, Kiefer Sutherland and Harry Dean Stanton. But more importantly, the film pares down the supernatural tangents and weird townspeople that littered the TV series. Those things had their value, but they eventually made the murder of Laura Palmer a half- forgotten conceit. As in so many murder mysteries, the actual murder victim becomes inessential. In Fire Walk With Me, that violence takes centre stage. We see Laura Palmer's world, a world of constant sexual violence and her futile attempts to cope by owning the depravity. It's Lynch at his bleakest, and it's genuinely unsettling in the way that, say, the Log Lady is not. Rather than being the story of a strange small town, Fire Walk With Me tells the story of Twin Peaks as a story about a girl who is repeatedly raped and eventually murdered, and there's absolutely nothing charming about that.It might just be because I was less focused on deciphering the plot, but Lynch's style seems heightened in comparison with the TV series and even some of the other movies he made around this time. The story unfolds in a kind of jazz-like alternation between absurdity, kitsch and horror. There isn't really a plot, but nevertheless I couldn't turn my eyes away. The return to horror makes Fire Walk With Me a worthy companion to the original series, and much more worthy of a revisit than some of those season 2 episodes.

In my opinion, Wes Craven here presents the most novel and compelling re-envisioning of the Dracula story since Lugosi. As far as originality and a fresh direction, this makes Coppola's production seem like a bloated but tired, over-produced rehash. Yes, Gary Oldman is a consummate actor and a great Count. But in Francis' version, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are totally flaccid and uninteresting. And Anthony Hopkins embarrasses himself with such an over-the-top portrayal of Van Helsing that I wouldn't be surprised if Oldman hasn't talked to him since. Tony almost seems to be purposely lampooning the story.Don't expect $100 million special effects. Craven had to make do on a shoestring budget. But that seems to have forced him to focus on the story rather than the flash. Butler could certainly have upped the intensity rather than relying so heavily on his drop-dead good looks to establish Dracula's charisma. No question, Gerard underplays the role, though that only seems to add moodiness and atmosphere--and is consistent with the character as he is presented in the story. Dracula is so bitter and internally conflicted that he hasn't got a lot to say to his victims--or even his pursuers. Also conflicted is the wonderful Christopher Plummer, who is so present in the role of Van Helsing that he really sells the premise of the whole re-invention in the film's first few minutes.For levity, Dracula's new brood of followers have a lot of trendy, new-age comments to make on the pluses and minuses of their new, undead status. They come off as Katzenjammer kids with fangs--but as amusing as they are, they still bite.

If you were addressing him as Count or Vlad, yes, Dracula would be the correct form. But if it's the only identifier, then the single term Draculea, just as Plummer pronounces it, is correct.Three cheers for the Count.

They Live directed by John Carpenter is absolutely one of those films that I was shocked to find that it had actually pretty great reviews online and is seemingly well received as a whole. John Nada (Roddy Piper) is an unemployed drifter who gets work in Los Angeles and becomes friends with another construction worker Frank Armitage (Keith David) and they both live in a local soup kitchen. Nada notices strange things going on with a church nearby and a helicopter flying above them in more than one instance. But the main strange thing happening is the TV signal being constantly interrupted with a warning about those in power.

The characters are bland and two-dimensional and many of the actors are mediocre at best. We have plenty of bad one-liners that only get soft chuckles. We have scene after scene of admittedly well-directed action scenes but they become boring when they just come one after another.

This movie could have said plenty of great things about the effects of advertisements on the human brain, the effects of television and how it can actually very much negatively effect people or influence their thinking in a bad way, and essentially could have made some very serious comments on how many people lack thinking for themselves or real independence. I do admit that maybe the movie was ahead of its time especially considering this movie could easily be remade nowadays with the effect of the Internet on people, which goes far deeper than television with social media outlets.

The thing that makes it special is the execution, of how all the technical stuff bind together to create a hallucinating movie experience. Moreover, I watched this movie right after I spent the night before in lacking sleep. It took me some minutes to clear things up and get back on stuff. The technical stuff and I mean all of them, the fast- forward style, the coloration selection, all the messed up camera angles, the irritating and ever-present music scoring, and of course, the gruesome scenes of the consequences make this movie strong in conveying the message of how messed up the life of a junkie is and will be even more. I praise the acting performance by the four main cast. It's clear then how Leto, Connelly and Wayans can gain the trust of some of the big production names to cast them on later works. But I especially salute Ellen Burstyn for her performance that is able to portray the most physically irritating changes of what will happen to a junkie's body. Yet again I give this movie a 6 out of 10 score because in my opinion it is not very suitable for an entertainment. It does help to convey the message of never touch addictive substance for good.

What is there left to say about it? From it's countless reviews, accolades and the fact that it redefined cinema should already tell many how brilliant this movie is and how it's legacy has changed the face of cinema forever. With all of that praise, many have talked about it and analyzed it to death, so it would imply that there is simply nothing left to talk about. However, as I love this film so much and really like writing reviews, I will also discuss what a masterpiece this film is.Firstly, the way the story is told is fantastic, as it does it in a non- linear fashion, each focused on a certain bunch of characters and their actions, and how some of those actions affect the other stories. Sure the separate plots maybe simple on their own, but the way they mesh together in this film is quite beautiful. Sure, not all of the stories are great here, as there are one or two slow, boring ones that you have to sit through, but you will be rewarded with other great and exciting stories to make up for it. The fact that each story has about 20-40 minutes of screen time allows each story to breath and leave an impact, something which many of it's copycats (Snatch for example) fail to realize. As it is told in a non-linear fashion, meaning that certain stories happen after others, it allows for many surprises along the way. It is like 4-6 short films for the price of one and most of them are fantastic and offer you a different experience with each story.The first story is about a couple of gangsters, Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield who are going to carry out a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace. What follows is a hilarious mix of violence, comedy and Kahuna Burgers. The same thing can be said of their other stories one of which involves them accidentally killing a hostage and having to clean the car before time runs out as they have parked in a friend's garage whose wife is coming home. This is story is definitely the most comedic in the film as there are the most jokes and humiliations in it, particularly with Vincent and Jules being very humorlessly clumsy. Their most action packed story is the final one where a diner is held up and Vincent and Jules are caught right up in the middle of it, being held hostage by a gangster called Pumpkin and his loose cannon wife. While there is a lot of humour here, it is definitely the most tense due to the situation and how psychotic both Pumpkin and his wife are. It isn't the most violent however. This is where Bruce Willis, playing a boxer called Butch comes in. After killing another boxer in a fight that he was meant to lose, Butch quickly escapes with his girlfriend and intend on leaving the country. There is one problem however, he left his gold watch behind, an item that has been in his family for generations. So he has to go back in order to reclaim the watch. This is definitely both the most violent and the most surprising story, seeing as how it takes a turn into the exploitation and samurai genres. However, the transition of genres is a smooth one considering how it keeps with the tone of the film and is played more over the top, which considering how this film is partly a black comedy fits.The only dud here is when Vincent has to look after Marsellus Wallace's wife, Mia. It is such a slow story, and there is barely any sort of excitement in the story despite plot points like an overdose. There is hardly any chemistry between Vincent and Mia and Mia herself is quite a boring character. She's just a bland party girl. Uma Thurman does her best, but even she can't rescue the story from blandness.However, that is my only compliant with the film. Another good thing about it is the dialogue. Sure, like Reservoir Dogs, it discusses hardly interesting things, but it works and can often times be really funny. There is also a lot more character development in this than Reservoir Dogs, with most of the characters at least having a different personality to them, and as in these stories there are many duos, there is much chemistry between the characters. Vincent for example, is a calm quiet man who really doesn't want to screw up meanwhile Jules is a much more psychotic, religious and dangerous character who is thinking of retiring soon. Butch is a paranoid person who only manages to get through life with his wit and often by the skin of his teeth. Marsellus is a very though person who while a person who shouldn't be double- crossed does care about his wife and what happens to himself, and not even he can protect himself all the time. There are also some stylistic choices I really like as well. The soundtrack is great (if not as good as Reservoir Dogs), the film has a great loose tone which allows for a lot of fun and there is even some ambiguity as well, which I won't spoil for you here. Overall, this is by far one of the best films of the 90's and of all time. It is a mixture of many things and many genres which all mesh together to give us a spectacular experience. Despite some problems here and there, this a complete masterpiece that improves on Reservoir Dogs while being great on it's own. If you haven't seen it already, go and see it, because you are missing out on great cinema otherwise.

Sure, not all of the stories are great here, as there are one or two slow, boring ones that you have to sit through, but you will be rewarded with other great and exciting stories to make up for it. The fact that each story has about 20-40 minutes of screen time allows each story to breath and leave an impact, something which many of it's copycats (Snatch for example) fail to realize. As it is told in a non-linear fashion, meaning that certain stories happen after others, it allows for many surprises along the way. It is like 4-6 short films for the price of one and most of them are fantastic and offer you a different experience with each story.The first story is about a couple of gangsters, Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield who are going to carry out a hit for their boss, Marsellus Wallace. What follows is a hilarious mix of violence, comedy and Kahuna Burgers. The same thing can be said of their other stories one of which involves them accidentally killing a hostage and having to clean the car before time runs out as they have parked in a friend's garage whose wife is coming home. This is story is definitely the most comedic in the film as there are the most jokes and humiliations in it, particularly with Vincent and Jules being very humorlessly clumsy. Their most action packed story is the final one where a diner is held up and Vincent and Jules are caught right up in the middle of it, being held hostage by a gangster called Pumpkin and his loose cannon wife. While there is a lot of humour here, it is definitely the most tense due to the situation and how psychotic both Pumpkin and his wife are. It isn't the most violent however. This is where Bruce Willis, playing a boxer called Butch comes in. After killing another boxer in a fight that he was meant to lose, Butch quickly escapes with his girlfriend and intend on leaving the country. There is one problem however, he left his gold watch behind, an item that has been in his family for generations. So he has to go back in order to reclaim the watch. This is definitely both the most violent and the most surprising story, seeing as how it takes a turn into the exploitation and samurai genres. However, the transition of genres is a smooth one considering how it keeps with the tone of the film and is played more over the top, which considering how this film is partly a black comedy fits.The only dud here is when Vincent has to look after Marsellus Wallace's wife, Mia. It is such a slow story, and there is barely any sort of excitement in the story despite plot points like an overdose. There is hardly any chemistry between Vincent and Mia and Mia herself is quite a boring character. She's just a bland party girl. Uma Thurman does her best, but even she can't rescue the story from blandness.However, that is my only compliant with the film. Another good thing about it is the dialogue. Sure, like Reservoir Dogs, it discusses hardly interesting things, but it works and can often times be really funny. There is also a lot more character development in this than Reservoir Dogs, with most of the characters at least having a different personality to them, and as in these stories there are many duos, there is much chemistry between the characters. Vincent for example, is a calm quiet man who really doesn't want to screw up meanwhile Jules is a much more psychotic, religious and dangerous character who is thinking of retiring soon. Butch is a paranoid person who only manages to get through life with his wit and often by the skin of his teeth. Marsellus is a very though person who while a person who shouldn't be double- crossed does care about his wife and what happens to himself, and not even he can protect himself all the time. There are also some stylistic choices I really like as well. The soundtrack is great (if not as good as Reservoir Dogs), the film has a great loose tone which allows for a lot of fun and there is even some ambiguity as well, which I won't spoil for you here. Overall, this is by far one of the best films of the 90's and of all time. It is a mixture of many things and many genres which all mesh together to give us a spectacular experience. Despite some problems here and there, this a complete masterpiece that improves on Reservoir Dogs while being great on it's own. If you haven't seen it already, go and see it, because you are missing out on great cinema otherwise.
