In almost every aspect, this is a competent and well-made movie. However, nobody involved seems to have had much of an interest in making anything beyond a competent and well-made movie. It's essentially a paint-by-numbers entry into the romantic comedy genre that doesn't have enough blood in the comedy or in the romance to be very memorable or involving beyond casual TV viewing.Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek are the leads. I can understand why they were cast (Perry for his sitcom fame, Hayek for her good looks), but neither one really impresses me as a very good actor -- Perry mainly stand around looking helpless and conflicted and moves his arms in random directions when he speaks, and Hayek comes up with some line readings that make me wonder whether she bothered to read the script.The plot, which is a not-too-imaginative variation on a ubiquitous one that plays pretty heavily on stereotypes of Mexicans and rich people from Connecticut (a rich man from Connecticut gets a Mexican woman pregnant, then decides to marry her for love, but runs into complications with their respective goals, families, and customs), is time-tested, solid, and has a lot of opportunity for good drama, but that opportunity is mainly squandered -- we don't really get to follow HOW the two protagonists get over their differences and earn their happy ending.This movie seems to serve up its romance with a generous side of it's-good-to-believe-in-signs, which as a non-superstitious viewer I did not really buy, but it's easily ignored for the character device it is.That said, there are some amusing moments, and there are some sweet moments -- just fitting the requirements for the genre the film is a product of. It's a perfectly adequate date movie or television time-killer if you're in the mood for it (most movie viewers will be able to read a short description and know just what to expect), but don't go in looking for anything special.

He is found floating in the sea with bullets in his body and bank account details implanted in his hip. And he has amnesia. Fortunately, while trying to find out his own identity things start to come back to him . . . . skills. Skills that enable him to avoid enemies and defeat most people in savagely impressive hand to hand combat. After an incident at a US Embassy (when it is becoming increasingly clear that his past leaves him in serious danger), Bourne gets a lift from Marie (played by Franka Potente) and it then becomes a challenge for both of them to stay ahead of the authorities while Bourne uncovers more dangerous truths.Damon's acting is superb here, convincingly believing someone unable to comprehend his own abilities as his body goes into autopilot. Potente is okay in the female lead role, bringing an enjoyable quirkiness though not becoming too unbelievable despite the spiralling situation. And with roles for the likes of Brian Cox and Chris Cooper fans of decent acting are not left wanting. Surprisingly, there are also good turns from the likes of Julia Stiles (who I have not liked in many other movies) and Clive Owen (who I do like though it seems many others loathe the man).Everything here is, ironically enough, executed with style and polish. The action sequences are adrenaline-pumping, there's a cracking car chase sequence that ranks up there with some of the best and while the plot is interesting and full of little twists Liman pitches things just perfectly in the pacing department. Some people may still complain about how far-fetched some of the situations are but, bearing in mind the central concept, it's all realised so well that everything does seem plausible.Whether it's because of being adapted from Ludlum's work or just because of a solid screenplay, every element from the script to the editing to the audio and visuals works superbly and any fans of the action genre should give themselves a treat and see this movie as soon as possible.See this if you like The Long Kiss Goodnight, A History Of Violence, Casino Royale.

Set in the middle of a family and it's family business it always keep a level of pressure, a level of suspense on the character Leo and the story itself. Without any up tempo bits, without explosions and without any high paced chases it still keeps interest. And that's good. However, it doesn't really reach any climaxes either. No scenes when almost everything comes to a point, when you are on your edge as a viewer. It only walks slowly along its storyline, with only small changes in pace. And that makes it good, but without any real high points. It is a good movie, but it will soon be forgotten.It relies heavily on the acting, and fortunately it has casted well.

He's a deserter and all alone. He's been on his own for months. Finally he reaches the house of his erstwhile lover, Julie Christie. His eyes fill with tears as he surveys the bleak, empty apartment that he will call home, at least for a while.He stumbles exhausted into the bedroom, stares at the bed where he and Christie slept together long ago, then catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a physical wreck. His face is an oily white, his facial hair a frozen muff. His clothes are tattered rags wrapped around his trembling body.And -- get this -- there is still a bit of snow on his clothing and the snow-soaked wool is STEAMING in the slight heat of the room. The shot only lasts one or two seconds. In the name of Bog, would anyone but Lean have thought of such a slight detail? There are other moments that might make the hair of the vulnerable rise.A passenger train stuffed with refugees has been chugging along eastward and is shunted on to a spur to allow the passage of an express. The passenger train is dilapidated, without toilets, without chairs, nothing. Each car has a single stove that throws negligible heat. The floors are covered with hay and disinfectants. While the train sits silently, some of its passengers step out into the snow to stretch their legs and grumble at the delay. Then the express appears on the horizon. It's the personal train of Strelnikov, Tom Courtenay, and it's panels are painted red and its crossed red flags are whipping in the wind as it roars past the astonished pedestrians. WHOOOOOSH! And it disappears in a swirl of snow.The story itself is, to me, less interesting than the film as a whole. It reminds me of Crime and Punishment, in which everyone seems to know everyone else, as if Petersberg were a small village. This tale is long, a little confusing, criss-crossed with meetings between men and women who are relatives, old friends, present or past lovers, or virtual strangers.

By the time Sheriff passes from the scene, he's a nationally famous figure, adored by all. Why? Because he wrote such splendid poetry. What a queer country, right? (Question for Americans Who is our Poet Laureate?) I've had a young Russian, who's self-taught English was no more than two years old, point out to me contradictions in a famous poem by Robert Frost. I don't know why so many of us find a love for poetry to be effete, not masculine or practical enough. General Patton wrote poetry.

He's a deserter and all alone. He's been on his own for months. Finally he reaches the house of his erstwhile lover, Julie Christie. His eyes fill with tears as he surveys the bleak, empty apartment that he will call home, at least for a while.He stumbles exhausted into the bedroom, stares at the bed where he and Christie slept together long ago, then catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a physical wreck. His face is an oily white, his facial hair a frozen muff. His clothes are tattered rags wrapped around his trembling body.And -- get this -- there is still a bit of snow on his clothing and the snow-soaked wool is STEAMING in the slight heat of the room. The shot only lasts one or two seconds. In the name of Bog, would anyone but Lean have thought of such a slight detail? There are other moments that might make the hair of the vulnerable rise.A passenger train stuffed with refugees has been chugging along eastward and is shunted on to a spur to allow the passage of an express. The passenger train is dilapidated, without toilets, without chairs, nothing. Each car has a single stove that throws negligible heat. The floors are covered with hay and disinfectants. While the train sits silently, some of its passengers step out into the snow to stretch their legs and grumble at the delay. Then the express appears on the horizon. It's the personal train of Strelnikov, Tom Courtenay, and it's panels are painted red and its crossed red flags are whipping in the wind as it roars past the astonished pedestrians. WHOOOOOSH! And it disappears in a swirl of snow.The story itself is, to me, less interesting than the film as a whole. It reminds me of Crime and Punishment, in which everyone seems to know everyone else, as if Petersberg were a small village. This tale is long, a little confusing, criss-crossed with meetings between men and women who are relatives, old friends, present or past lovers, or virtual strangers. History is pitted against human emotions like love. It's either one or the other. You can't have your babka and eat it too.There is an abundance of suffering with brief interludes of serenity that are always disrupted by historical events. Zhivago is in love with Lara but is married to someone else, Geraldine Chaplin. He has children by both. Well -- as I said, it's not ALL suffering.What impressed me as much as the striking visuals, as much as the Jack Frost window prints dissolving into a field of nodding jonquils, was the fact that, as narrator Alec Guiness puts it, He was a Russian and Russians love poetry. By the time Sheriff passes from the scene, he's a nationally famous figure, adored by all. Why? Because he wrote such splendid poetry. What a queer country, right? (Question for Americans Who is our Poet Laureate?) I've had a young Russian, who's self-taught English was no more than two years old, point out to me contradictions in a famous poem by Robert Frost. I don't know why so many of us find a love for poetry to be effete, not masculine or practical enough. General Patton wrote poetry. The commanders of the armies of ancient Greece wrote poems on the nights before battles. The Japanese warriors of World War II left poems behind for their loved ones before suicide missions. Yet, for Americans, such an amour fou implies one foot in fairydom.

Payback is about tough guy Porter who wants just one thing and one thing only, Payback! As the title so justly puts and he wants his money that was taken from him and he'll do anything and everything to get it back.What I found interesting about this film was the malicious way it was played out it was like an evil little wind up monkey that kept clattering and making noise and irritating yo until you got fed up and just step on the darn thing. Well that's the main plot for the movie, it's meant to zip along at only an 1hr. 34 mins. and it expects you to be entertained by this mess, but a good mess it was. Mel Gibson plays a character he's played a thousand times the macho tough guy with no fear. He played this type in all four Lethal Weapon movies, he played this again in Mad Max 1,2 and 3. So why did he try and see if he could pull it off again? Well because he can! And he did! Gibson puts some humanity and somewhat of a soul in an almost soulless character and he does it with such style and grace that it almost makes you want to slap Porter instead of punching him. And that's something, not by much, but something. Brian Helgeland( co-write for L.A. Confidential) tries to play on that moody, devil may care, I'll shoot you if you look at me cross eyed type of Anti-hero and that's all in good but the anti-hero he's created Porter is not somebody you can relate to, or even like for that matter, there were some scenes like I said that you wanted to hit Porter and then there were some scenes that you sympathized with him very well. And there is where this films greatness lies it gives you two sides of the coin to see, on one side the nasty Porter on the other side the kind and loving Porter. It gives you two sides to a very complicated and very world weary man and in my opinion that makes this a good movie.Payback is not action thriller greatness like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard but it does come very close, oh so very close, But the thing is with this movie is that it borders on almost a Noirish type style of cinematography and that up's it appeal to me and who know who else, but in the under lying layers of the film it does have greatness in it it just hasn't been able to tap into it fully but as time goes by this film will become a Mel Gibson classic and a cult classic for that matter. But is Payback a terrible movie? no way! Is it movie making magic? Sorry to tell you no, nothing magical about this one but it is great fun to watch play out and follow along. All in all Payback is an almost can't miss action drama, it flows along nice and it delivers it's punches nicely, it doesn't waste your time and it is great, irresistible fun.

Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGegor are both fantastic.Oh, yes, a word of warning don't be scared off by the first 10 minutes - trust the director. He will make it all come clear.This is in my Top 20 movies ever! Just sit back and 'On with the show'.

The main reason for this is that director Richard Fleischer, the Disney production team and the writers did an efficient job in pulling all the elements of filmmaking together from the script, to the casting, to the cinematography, to the soundtrack. Unlike today's screenplays, the script for this adaption of Jules Verne's classic novel was written smart. There are wonderful sequences where Professor Aronax (Paul Lukas), Conseil (Peter Lorre) and Ned Land (Kirk Douglas) are discovering the underwater world for the first time. This movie also features an exciting episode with cannibals, another with a giant squid, the precursor to the atomic bomb and much more. Obviously these ideas were already written, but the screenwriters should receive credit for putting them in the screenplay without cluttering the story line with subplots and undermining the coherence of the narrative. Moreover, the cinematographers visualized this ideas perfectly with the result that the cinematography appears lush from the underwater sequences to the palms in the Pacific to the volcano liar. The other achievement in this film is that even though the special effects in the 1950s were in their infant stage, the giant squid and the atomic explosion still look convincing. This is a major advance compared to the inept special effects in Journey to the Center of the Earth. But finally the casting was expert. I always thought Paul Lukas was a bit too intellectual and nice to play villains, like in The Lady Vanishes. This movie proves it because Lukas does a wonderful job playing Professor Aronax, a decent person who is temporarily blinded by his idealism. Peter Lorre is also interesting as the professor's mousy assistant Conseil, while Kirk Douglas delivers a subtly effective performance as the rebellious and down to earth sailor who is more interested in concrete goals, such as helping himself and his fellow man survive, than with Aronax's lofty idealism. But the most effective performance is given by James Mason. Supported by a great screenplay, James Mason brilliantly reveals all the shades of gray in the movie's title character Captain Nemo. To this day, I have not yet read a review that could adequate describe Nemo and this is as much an achievement of Verne as of Mason. Mason conveys Nemo's genius, his eccentricity, his internal struggles, his idealism and then his disillusionment to perfection. 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, in closing, works as an above-average adventure film that is entertaining for all ages. The film also works as a fascinating character study that is likely to intrigue more intelligent views.

That said it is great to see a longer version.The extra material included in the American cut are mainly bridging scenes and expository scenes. There are a few extra moments within scenes that are cut from the European version.The first is a scene with Wendy talking to a female Doctor about the fact that Jack has indeed hurt Danny by dislocating his arm in a drunken attack. This episode is explained later by Jack to the 'imaginary' barman in the ballroom, so the scene is redundant.An other is an extension of a scene where Jack explains to Wendy that he had a strong sense of Dejavue when he first arrived at the hotel. This moment also crosses the camera line as the first part is shown in the reflection of a mirror. By cutting the end of the scene the transition to the next one is crisper and tighter.The cook's part is larger in the American cut and shows more of the stages of his progress in reaching the hotel. One scene with him talking to a garage owner from the Airport on the telephone feels unnecessary and I can see why it was cut. One expository scene has Wendy talking to herself to inform us of her means of escape. It is much better that this scene is cut as it is theatrical expository device. Wendy then goes to Danny's room and we are shown that he has reverted into the character of his imaginary friend as he tries to deal with the horrors of the hotel. I think again this scene is not necessary as it labours a point.Then there is another bridging scene with Wendy and Danny watching a cartoon together, which is only there to explain that she wants to go and talk with Jack. Again removing this moment is a wise one as it keeps things tight.A couple of extra lines by Jack and the 'imaginary' barman are in the longer cut. Women can't live with them.... Their removal helps with the focus of the scene.There is an extra scene with Danny saying Redrum. This takes away from the creepy scene that follows with Danny again saying Redrum....so I am sure it was removed to make the impact of the later scene greater.In the European version, when Wendy finally see visions within the hotel, they are brief and shocking. The American version has more shots of Wendy witnessing these horrors. Suddenly, the reception area is dressed in cobwebs and skeletons are siting on sofas. This tacky moment made me laugh and I am sure it was the first thing Kubrick removed from the European cut so as not to get the same reaction. The European version is more polished than the American cut because the flow is far more dynamic. The shorter cut is also more subtle and challenging.

Here, some sort of Nazi splinter group has purchased an old bomb and is making the Russians think that the U.S. has attacked them and vice versa. Amidst the chaos of a huge atomic explosion that wipes out a stadium, it's up to Jack to reach someone in power before they push the red button and each country wipes out the other, leaving the world free for - who, Germany? - to take over.

I find him bland and boring. Other than that the movie is brilliantly casted. Chalize Theron is fantastic as both a southern lady and a complete psycho.

He is cared for by Hana (Juliette Binoche), a French-Canadian nurse, who set out to care for the man in an abandoned monastery in rural Italy. The two develop a bond and he slowly regains his memory where he was a geographer in Egypt, making maps of the desert. He remembers having an affair with Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) who was married to his best friend Geoffrey (Colin Firth). The affair was the reason for why he was injured. As well as the memories and the story in North Africa, Hana starts to have a relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh Indian engineer who was in the British Army. But she struggles to truly led herself go. The other person at the monastery is David Caravaggio (William Dafoe), a Canadian Intelligence Operative from Italian descent. He had his thumps cut off by the Germans and he blames The English Patient for what happened.The English Patient is an actor's film. Many of the actors were nominated for Oscars and other awards, Juliette Binoche even won on for best Supporting Actress. All the actors offered great performance, Ralph Fiennes, William Dafoe and Kristin Scott Thomas are all top talents and I personally thought Naveen Andrews was also very good. The film was also able to blend the flash-backs and present time effective, allowing the audience to follow the plots easily enough. He is a well structured film, with solid writing and direction. The direction is solid. They are some good scenes with some tension and the mystery is reviled slowly. They is wonderful cinematography. But is the film worthy of Oscars for best film and best director? Doubtful in my opinion.If you like romantic films such as Titanic you should enjoy the English Patient.

Things get complicated because the real president suffers a debilitating stroke, and the poser is asked to maintain the deception for national security reasons by a corrupt power mongering chief-of-staff.Kevin Kline does an excellent job as the innocent who finds he is a modern day Mr. Smith going to Washington, encountering scandals and corruption going on at these levels. The shadow-government conspiracy theory is nothing new, but this film utilizes the idea with an optimistic viewpoint, since the lead character chooses to effect positive changes, rather than exploit the situation. Corruption is seen as the exception rather than the rule, and that honest people can remove this blight from the landscape, if only they had the bravery to do so. Certainly this is a wildly idealistic premise, but it works.Political insiders are the baddies, the rest of us are the good guys, represented by Dave (a great acting performance by Kevin Kline). Ben Kingsley is great as the sincere and benevolent vice president. Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as the ignored first lady who keys into the deception, and Frank Langella is well cast as the plotting diabolical foe of democracy, Bob Alexander. There are several standouts in the supporting cast, as well.An entertaining feel good movie, certainly worth a watch.
