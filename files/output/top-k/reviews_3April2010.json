Now into my mid-twenties, I had a chance to watch the film again, and it is still very enjoyable.What Video game adaptations seem to be doing wrong these days (especially fighting game\/manga adaptations like DOA, SF Legend of Chun Li, and Dragonball Evolution) is that much much respect is given to its source material - often the story is twisted some other way or the actors' acting is just hilariously bad.This movie got most of the factors right in making a good video game adaptation1. Sticking to the story. This film, while directly taking the story ofMK1, incorporates the elements of MK2, and it works great. The viewer goes through on a journey into the tournament with the hero Liu Kang, as he battles several fighters such as Subzero, Reptile, ShangTsung and other unknowns. Sticking to the story of the first game is one of the biggest credits I would give to this movie. Sure the director did make some liberties (such as Scorpion and Subzero on the same side, Johnny Cage fighting Goro when in game Liu Kang defeated him etc), but the overall flow of the story still remains intact.2. Fighting is top-notch. The fights are also the highlights of this movie. In movies such as Dragonball Evolution or Legend of Chun Li, we were treated with almost no fight at all, or even if there were fights, they were below expected quality (poor). The best fights that I would pick are Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. Other fights were okay, except I was maybe disappointed a bit with Liu Kang vs Subzero, and Liu Kang vs ShangTsung, cause I wanted those fights to be longer, and could have been choreographed better to be more epic. Another point to add to the fighting is that we see various special abilities of the characters such as Scorpion's spear with the taunt Get over here!, Subzero's ice beam, Shang Tsung's soul drain, Liu Kang's bicycle kick etc. It just makes me reminiscence about the games.3. Acting is passable. Acting is done great from Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa,he has done many villain roles in many films, but the most memorable character he played (till now) is still his ShangTsung from the MK film. Other characters' acting is passable - though I could have wished for some characters to not use cheesy lines or one-liners, but heck, this is a video game film after all, and those lines weren't that bad.The only thing which pulls this movie from being great is that cgi is a bit dated now (its been released 15 years ago!), but considering the advancement in cg technology, it is understandable.Many people still consider this film to be one of the best video game film adaptations, and I definitely agree (even with its cg setbacks\/cheesy lines\/some fights which could have been improved). It stands the test of time pretty well - sure it's no Oscar material, but it sets out to deliver what fans really want and whole lot more). It's such a shame that the sequel annihilation was so horrible that it took 13 years to reboot the franchise(with upcoming MK film by Warners, that is if they can get past this legal dispute with Threshold)However, the first MK film still comes on top as best video game adaptation along with Silent Hill film.**I guess this will be tested by the new Prince of Persia film, Tekken film, King of Fighters film coming out - whether these films would be better adaptations than the first MK film ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2010","score":"","review":" I remember when I first watched this film, I was about 10 years old.

On the one hand there were pictures of sentimental, homespun escapism, and on the other those of blunt, cynical realism. At the 1944 Academy Awards the former won the day with the delightfully innocent Going My Way. In 1945 the latter took the top prize with The Lost Weekend. And although the Oscars are not as accurate a reflection of a picture's success as box office statistics, they represent a success of a different kind, for they reward the achievements of which the industry itself is most proud.Despite its grim subject matter, The Lost Weekend appeals precisely because it also has that humanist edge to it. It is, after all a sympathetic and rather touching portrayal of alcoholism. It is also devastatingly authentic. Compare it to The Struggle (DW Griffith's last film) from 1931, which despite also being a tragic tale of excessive drinking, contains the same kind of stereotypical drunkard performances you can see in any comedy of the era. Ray Milland on the other hand expertly plays a forlorn and dilapidated alcoholic, and there is nothing to be laughed at in his shambolic state.The director is Billy Wilder, who unusually for a writer-director had a very keen eye for effective visual storytelling. Wilder fills Don Birnam's world, not with bottles themselves, but with reminders of bottles. Take the opening scene, where we are first shown the whiskey dangling outside the window. We then move up to the billowing net curtain and the swinging blind cord. As the scene goes on, Wilder occasionally sneaks this window into the shot, but only when there is nothing else important (such as the introduction of Jane Wyman) going on. We are reminded of both the location and, by the dangling cord, the look of the whiskey bottle, and like Birnam its presence gives our minds a little tug every now and then. Wilder can't make us feel the alcoholic's thirst, but he can make us aware of the nagging obsession.For added punch, The Lost Weekend actually does something rarely seen up to this point, and incorporates trappings of the horror genre - for example in the nightmarish cinematography, the haunting theremin score and the eerie screams and burblings of the men in the hospital. While this is all very well, sometimes it is done to excess. Bim, the nurse played by Frank Faylen, is too surreal to be believed, and the hallucination sequence is tacky as anything. These are really the only points where The Lost Weekend comes apart. A picture like this may work through presenting reality in as disturbing a manner as possible, but should never swerve from an unflinching account of what reality is.

It's a film with a very simple story but that story is engaging, charming and often quite humorous. The fact that so much of the humor survives intact all these years later is perhaps most impressive. Obviously sensibilities were quite different in 1934 than they are in 2010. But most everything still works. And it's not just a good film, it's also a time capsule of sorts, a look at an entirely different world. Obviously many modern films have been produced set in the same time period as this film's story. But those new films look back at the past through different eyes, presenting modern perceptions of what life was like back then. This movie is the real deal, a slice of 1930s American life, the way it really was. To the modern eye some of the things we see in this film seem almost unbelievable. This is how people really lived? But it was only 75 years ago, an eye's blink of history really. And that is part of what makes this film so fascinating.Of course the one thing above all else that this film has going for it is that it has Hollywood royalty in the two lead roles. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are just as terrific as you would expect them to be and both duly picked up Academy Awards. Of course pretty much everyone involved with the film except the caterer picked up an Academy Award but I digress. Gable and Colbert certainly earned their golden statues. Gable plays Peter Warne, a newly unemployed newspaper reporter. Colbert plays Ellie Andrews, a spoiled runaway heiress. Running away from what? Well she recently got married and her father most certainly did not approve. So before the marriage could be consummated Daddy dearest essentially took his daughter hostage on his yacht down in Florida, far away from the new husband in New York. What's a girl to do? Well, jump off the yacht of course. From there it's going to be a long, strange trip to New York. Ellie gets on a bus, meets Peter and now the film really gets going.Once our story has been set up there's really not much left in the way of plot. It's a simple story about the obstacles Ellie will face on her long journey. There sure are plenty of obstacles though. And this woman, used to all of life's luxuries, really has very little idea how to interact among the common folk. She needs someone to look after her and Peter falls into this role. It's a fun trip, with many memorable moments along the way. One scene in particular stands out with Peter and Ellie having to pose as a quarreling married couple. They could have stopped the film and handed Gable and Colbert their Oscars right there. There's also the famous hitchhiking scene, there's the Walls of Jericho, there's even a possible inspiration for Bugs Bunny. Now for all the moments which do work there are admittedly a few which don't. Some things are a little hokey but not absolutely everything is going to translate over 75 years. And while it's an engaging story it's not an altogether dramatic one as there's a sense of inevitability hanging over the whole thing. But the movie has to be deemed a success. It's witty, charming, amusing and ultimately quite memorable. Director Frank Capra, helped in no small part by the performances of his two great stars, produced a film which not only was a classic in its time but which still stands up today all these decades later.

(John Williams) is the one who can make the symphonies so marketable. What I love about such a man is his understanding when it comes to expressing many themes in high passionate way. And the way how he gave that plain tale a profound shadows and enthusiastic spirit. Without his music this movie could have lost good deal of its personality and prestige. Away from all of those points, the script wasn't that competent (something to be assured of with the next, not written by George Lucas, sequel. And to hold by your own hands with the next, wholly doomed, wholly written by Lucas, 3 prequels !). I don't remember a twist or surprise. The thrill wasn't that super. The characters were so comics; namely funny and naive. And I hated points like for instance how Chewbacca was so unnecessary, rather unused ! I watched it more than once, and I can't deny the feel of bore in some places. For one reason the dialog is so-deeply-insightful-it's-uninteresting, seeming so geeky and no entertaining. It's things to be written but not to be said (exactly as Carrie Fisher referred to Lucas once). And for another the direction was ordinary; many scenes were tepid and humdrum.The action sequences weren't the best. The long last one of exploding the death star was yes kind of new image but surely artificial, monotonous, and lacking any real suspense. Although the lightsabers idea was impressive but the swordplay wasn't. Generally the movie relayed more on the cool look more than the smart directing. Unlike many of the movie's attackers I didn't hate the acting. It was suitable and fresh. The thing is that script didn't endow these actors with many characteristics, or hard situations to watch and enjoy them deeply. Still Harrison Ford is the winner. Aside from his wit, the lovable cowboy was absent for years. And simply his character was the more human; the type that will be nonexistent in the prequels. The New Hope matter was a new carp! I don't know how Lucas did that in cold blood? But clearly he did it only for himself. Otherwise, it's a practical lesson in how to toy with an old movie to change and alter, how to irritate viewers by some useless CGI, and how to destroy the history (since it makes you totally out of the mood and distracted between the original 70s's quality and the 90s's one !).The sequel is way better. Mainly because Lucas was out of the writing and the directing. These previous defects I mentioned will be doubled in the next trilogy of prequels; where the script will go down, the action will be so missed, the direction will be downright tedious, the CGI will hugely and provocatively rule (as if it's the point), and the acting &#x96; sorrowfully &#x96; will hit the rock bottom also ! Nostalgia got a big hand in the top rank (Star War) achieved. No doubt, the viewers of the late 1970s were so thirsty for that substitute dazzlingly-made world, being extremely fed up of countless anti-heroes, needing desperately a portion of sheer noble adventures or good American values. Not the Dirty Harry, not the British James Bond. So they got all the reasons to adore this movie. It looked different and desired for them, unlike someone who watched it in 1998.

Flashing back to the present day we see a copy of the first film with two naked men appearing in America, both with the intention of seeking John Connor. As with the first there is a wonderful vibe of anticipation and inevitability as both futuristic robots seek the supposed saviour of the human race and as the clock moves forward the action gets hotter as through chases through the shopping mall and then the unforgettable motorbike versus truck chase that examines fabrications of physical ability as we see wonderfully shot low angles following the back wheel of the bike and high aerial shots of the chase in progress, an unforgettable montage of adrenaline that was poorly attempted again in Terminator 3, but this is one of those action sequences for the ages.The T-1000 is a brilliant creation, a man with the ability to change his arms into any weapon he chooses and the power to transform into any living organism it touches, fantastic. Certainly when it slides through the prison doors and reforms after countless hits is mesmerizing. Patrick has created a true villain.This film has been recalled for its usage of turning the charisma of Arnie's villain into a good guy and certainly there is more of a comedy vibe and more dialogue from the actor thus round which is more beneficial if not as captivating as when he was a bad guy.Whilst there isn't the same flowing intensity as the first film this provides plenty of action adrenaline and maintains a futuristic probability that cannot be ignored, a great watch.

Flashing back to the present day we see a copy of the first film with two naked men appearing in America, both with the intention of seeking John Connor.

She performs realistically and she is beautiful and radiant. The story of a young woman in love, who gets her hand on some money and wants to be better off in life with her lover. The scenes with her and the cop were absolutely thrilling. I was expecting the cop to search her bag and bring her to justice. The shower scene in the hotel room is a classic. How many films we know have tried to copy it!! And the scene which was shot from her eye was haunting.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was absolutely wonderful and terrifying in the end. He made me care for his character who was under his mother's subjugation and did what any son who loves his mother would do (atleast, to him it was true. I would have been scared out of my mind).Also, the little things in the movie do count. Milton Arbogast as the private detective, I wanted him to leave Bates alone as Norman was such an understandable character. Hitchcock delivers horror in a movie which has no gore. I never thought this old movie could be this awesome. I mean, the score was chilling and its still used today with all kinds of variations. This is the one of the films which spawned every horror filmmaker out there to follow the footsteps of Hitchcock and be as great as him (unfortunately, there are only a few).Words don't do justice to this movie.

To prove his innocence, he has to escape from prison and, despite being the subject of a massive manhunt by the tenacious but ultimately fair and just Deputy Gerard, single-handedly prove his innocence by tracking down his wife's real killer. Ultimately he just gets some medical records and makes some phone calls, which apparently he couldn't hire a private detective to do before the trial despite being rich, but hey, the beauty of the movie is you probably won't even notice or care.The movie is paced brilliantly, and if you read about the production of this movie, the director and key actors were given a great deal of freedom to write scenes on the fly, famously shooting the parade sequence with real parade participants who didn't even know they were going to be in a movie (neither did the director until the day of the shoot - they got permission to film the parade that very day). Then, after a great deal of footage was shot, thousands of edits were made, cutting entire subplots if that's what it took, and the end result was a fine-tuned movie with pacing that, for much of the movie, is almost irresistibly riveting.The movie is known for its iconic action scenes - there is of course a real train derailment captured on film and Harrison Ford jumps hundreds of feet off a dam. Many movies in the 90s has these, but what makes the Fugative work so well is that you can actually enjoy the non-action elements of the film too. Tommy Lee Jones and his crew are consistently funny and entertaining while still seeming believable as they track down Kimble. Kimble wows the audience with his brilliant moves at every step (although one wonders why he didn't think of any of this stuff *before* the trial... grumble grumble) and of course, the audience can't help be sympathetic to him as he has the compassion to save lives despite being one wrong move away from arrest and a death sentence for the entire movie.If the movie has one weak point, it has to be the way it wraps up the story, which involves an overly convoluted conspiracy that comes out of left field. It's not exactly bad, but after every single detail in the first two thirds of the movie was absolutely perfect, the unwieldy explanation of why Kimble was framed seems a bit disappointing. Perhaps any explanation would have had this problem, though, because it's trying to provide a logical explanation for what was basically a fantasy sequence of events, so whatever you come up with is going to be a let-down.Ultimately, this is a wonderful movie with two nit-picky flaws that shouldn't ruin the movie for anyone.

Ultimately he just gets some medical records and makes some phone calls, which apparently he couldn't hire a private detective to do before the trial despite being rich, but hey, the beauty of the movie is you probably won't even notice or care.The movie is paced brilliantly, and if you read about the production of this movie, the director and key actors were given a great deal of freedom to write scenes on the fly, famously shooting the parade sequence with real parade participants who didn't even know they were going to be in a movie (neither did the director until the day of the shoot - they got permission to film the parade that very day). Then, after a great deal of footage was shot, thousands of edits were made, cutting entire subplots if that's what it took, and the end result was a fine-tuned movie with pacing that, for much of the movie, is almost irresistibly riveting.The movie is known for its iconic action scenes - there is of course a real train derailment captured on film and Harrison Ford jumps hundreds of feet off a dam. Many movies in the 90s has these, but what makes the Fugative work so well is that you can actually enjoy the non-action elements of the film too. Tommy Lee Jones and his crew are consistently funny and entertaining while still seeming believable as they track down Kimble. Kimble wows the audience with his brilliant moves at every step (although one wonders why he didn't think of any of this stuff *before* the trial... grumble grumble) and of course, the audience can't help be sympathetic to him as he has the compassion to save lives despite being one wrong move away from arrest and a death sentence for the entire movie.If the movie has one weak point, it has to be the way it wraps up the story, which involves an overly convoluted conspiracy that comes out of left field. It's not exactly bad, but after every single detail in the first two thirds of the movie was absolutely perfect, the unwieldy explanation of why Kimble was framed seems a bit disappointing. Perhaps any explanation would have had this problem, though, because it's trying to provide a logical explanation for what was basically a fantasy sequence of events, so whatever you come up with is going to be a let-down.Ultimately, this is a wonderful movie with two nit-picky flaws that shouldn't ruin the movie for anyone. It's one of the best thrillers of the 90s because it remembers that it's not all about the action scenes - it has pacing and it has characters you actually care about. It's a great package.

Choosing to understate the role and not to go over the top with the drug scenes or action, but play it in the calm controlled way expected of a Victorian gent. It's tempting to compare Depp's Inspector Abeline with Robert Downey Jr's Holmes but one should remember Holmes was fictional allowing RDJ to go over the top, where as Abeline is real and Depp plays it more so.The tale of Jack the Ripper is well known, this version however explores a particular belief that Jack had royal connections and was protected by the Masonic order.

It's really a one man show with the supporting cast playing second fiddle all the way to the late, great thespian. The film dates back to 1980 during the height of the Cold War. Matthau plays Miles Kendig, a veteran CIA agent who takes down a Soviet spy ring but declines to eliminate the leader of the operation, his KGB nemesis, Yaskov. Kendig has been friends with Yaskov for years and when his new boss at CIA headquarters, Myerson (played by an unpleasant Ned Beatty who continually employs the F word throughout the movie), is angered by Kendig's refusal to eliminate Yaskov, he transfers the veteran operative to the file room.Kendig then destroys his own file and takes off without telling anyone at the CIA where he is off to. He then meets with Yaskov who offers him a job as a double agent but Kendig regretfully declines. Yaskov then asks Kendig what he'll do with the rest of his life and when Kendig replies that he's uncertain, Yaskov suggests that he write his memoirs. This is the impetus for the second act of 'Hopscotch' in which Kendig decides to take his revenge on his former employer by sending the first chapter of his memoirs to various spy agencies around the world including the CIA. The memoirs chronicle a long history of CIA 'dirty tricks' in which Myerson had a big hand. Myerson is bent on eliminating Kendig in order to prevent the big expose.The rest of Hopscotch involves a cat and mouse game where Myerson, along with the operative who replaced Kendig, Cutter (ably played by a young Sam Waterson), attempt to discover Kendig's whereabouts before he finishes his manuscript and has it published. Kendig ends up globe trotting including a trip to Myerson's house in Georgia where he places firecrackers inside the living room and then phones the CIA from Myerson's home phone. The FBI joins the CIA and they end up shooting up the house as the firecrackers go off. Kendig escapes by taking one of Myerson's bumbling operatives hostage, driving off in a small truck (since this is supposed to be a comedy, no one ever tries to jump Kendig while he brandishes a gun, knowing full well that he would never shoot anyone!).Nothing much else happens until the climax when Kendig rigs an old bi-plane to fly via remote control. As Myerson chases the bi-plane in a helicopter, Kendig pushes a button and the plane explodes, leading the CIA to believe that Kendig is no more (it's not clear how Kendig makes it look like he never got into the plane). With the CIA no longer chasing him, Kendig's memoirs becomes a best-seller and he walks off into the sunset with his old flame, Isobel, played by the now retired Glenda Jackson.We first meet Isobel at the beginning of the film where Kendig rekindles his old relationship with her in Austria. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two actors fizzles, since they are never seen face to face until the end of the movie (they communicate constantly via telephone). The same goes for all the other principals (including Beatty and Waterston) who have virtually no screen time face to face with Matthau (there's a rather flat scene where Kendig ties Cutter up in a hotel room).If you're looking for many twists and turns, you will not find it here in 'Hopscotch'. The whole thing is a rather pedestrian affair, adapted from a popular novel whose screenplay did not translate very well into the intended visual tour de force. Hopscotch is also supposed to be witty and amusing but is undercut by the one-note, nasty image of the CIA, represented by the aforementioned unpleasant Myerson, bent on taking down a rogue agent at any cost. The CIA's attempt to eliminate Kendig (instead of capturing him), ruins the otherwise whimsical tone of the film's narrative. On the other hand, Waterson's 'Cutter' and Herbert Lom's 'Yaskov' are too warm-hearted to have much effect on the proceedings, as the story simply plods along.My late father, a big classical music aficionado, was a big fan of this movie and with a plethora of all that Mozart constituting the film's soundtrack, I can understand why. Despite the endearing musical score, Hopscotch's plot is a big dud as its protagonist's machinations do not prove to be very clever. If you're willing to give Hopscotch a 'pass' based on your love for Walter Matthau (as Roger Ebert did in his 1980 review), then you might deceive yourself into believing this is a well-written movie. It's not and in reality it's a rather dull and boring affair!

Kendig has been friends with Yaskov for years and when his new boss at CIA headquarters, Myerson (played by an unpleasant Ned Beatty who continually employs the F word throughout the movie), is angered by Kendig's refusal to eliminate Yaskov, he transfers the veteran operative to the file room.Kendig then destroys his own file and takes off without telling anyone at the CIA where he is off to. He then meets with Yaskov who offers him a job as a double agent but Kendig regretfully declines. Yaskov then asks Kendig what he'll do with the rest of his life and when Kendig replies that he's uncertain, Yaskov suggests that he write his memoirs. This is the impetus for the second act of 'Hopscotch' in which Kendig decides to take his revenge on his former employer by sending the first chapter of his memoirs to various spy agencies around the world including the CIA. The memoirs chronicle a long history of CIA 'dirty tricks' in which Myerson had a big hand. Myerson is bent on eliminating Kendig in order to prevent the big expose.The rest of Hopscotch involves a cat and mouse game where Myerson, along with the operative who replaced Kendig, Cutter (ably played by a young Sam Waterson), attempt to discover Kendig's whereabouts before he finishes his manuscript and has it published. Kendig ends up globe trotting including a trip to Myerson's house in Georgia where he places firecrackers inside the living room and then phones the CIA from Myerson's home phone. The FBI joins the CIA and they end up shooting up the house as the firecrackers go off. Kendig escapes by taking one of Myerson's bumbling operatives hostage, driving off in a small truck (since this is supposed to be a comedy, no one ever tries to jump Kendig while he brandishes a gun, knowing full well that he would never shoot anyone!).Nothing much else happens until the climax when Kendig rigs an old bi-plane to fly via remote control. As Myerson chases the bi-plane in a helicopter, Kendig pushes a button and the plane explodes, leading the CIA to believe that Kendig is no more (it's not clear how Kendig makes it look like he never got into the plane). With the CIA no longer chasing him, Kendig's memoirs becomes a best-seller and he walks off into the sunset with his old flame, Isobel, played by the now retired Glenda Jackson.We first meet Isobel at the beginning of the film where Kendig rekindles his old relationship with her in Austria. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two actors fizzles, since they are never seen face to face until the end of the movie (they communicate constantly via telephone). The same goes for all the other principals (including Beatty and Waterston) who have virtually no screen time face to face with Matthau (there's a rather flat scene where Kendig ties Cutter up in a hotel room).If you're looking for many twists and turns, you will not find it here in 'Hopscotch'. The whole thing is a rather pedestrian affair, adapted from a popular novel whose screenplay did not translate very well into the intended visual tour de force. Hopscotch is also supposed to be witty and amusing but is undercut by the one-note, nasty image of the CIA, represented by the aforementioned unpleasant Myerson, bent on taking down a rogue agent at any cost. The CIA's attempt to eliminate Kendig (instead of capturing him), ruins the otherwise whimsical tone of the film's narrative. On the other hand, Waterson's 'Cutter' and Herbert Lom's 'Yaskov' are too warm-hearted to have much effect on the proceedings, as the story simply plods along.My late father, a big classical music aficionado, was a big fan of this movie and with a plethora of all that Mozart constituting the film's soundtrack, I can understand why. Despite the endearing musical score, Hopscotch's plot is a big dud as its protagonist's machinations do not prove to be very clever. If you're willing to give Hopscotch a 'pass' based on your love for Walter Matthau (as Roger Ebert did in his 1980 review), then you might deceive yourself into believing this is a well-written movie. It's not and in reality it's a rather dull and boring affair!

Crimes have been occurring around Gotham City, involving a group of Circus Freaks, than the city calls Batman (Michael Keaton) to stop the ongoing and escalating crimes. A local businessmen named Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) forms an alliance with the leader of the Circus Freaks, a man named Oswald Cobblepot (Danny Devito), who is a deformed man just trying to fit in to the real world, and Max tries to help him by making them colleagues, but when Max's assistant Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) discovers he's a evil businessmen she tries to leave the building but Max catches her, and shoves her out of the nearby window, she later becomes Catwomen, and wants revenge on Max for what he did, Batman is framed for things and is now believed to be just another evil villain, and than Batman tries to take down the the evil team...All the actors do a perfect job in their roles, Michael Keaton is always great and will always be my favorite Batman of the whole series and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman was a perfect choice by Tim Burton, Danny Devito plays his part well, he really pulled it off,it is really over-acting at it's finest, Christopher Walken was great as the slimy evil businessmen Max Shreck, which his name is a reference to the first 'Dracula' movie, 'Nosferatu', because the actor that played the vampire was named 'Max Shreck'.The atmosphere of the film was perfect, dark, gloomy, perfect for a Batman film, the script must have been written really well, because the film always keeps you interested and it never drags or becomes corny it just stays as Tim Burton Wanted it.This film it for any good action lover, it's not to be taken very seriously, hardcore Batman fans will not be disappointed, so if you haven't seen it, go rent it, buy it, it's an absolute blockbuster.
