[{"date":"31 December 2013","score":"","review":" Wow. Who knew one of the greatest gay movies is actually a lesbian film?I absolutely loved, adored and admired this classic tale of forbidden love. It helps that I lived through this era and what the characters of But I'm a Cheerleader had to endure.You see, my parents were the same. While they didn't go as far as send me to Straight (Str8) Camp, they did encourage me to see psychiatric help with my choice of this lifestyle. Well, just like this movie's true moral, it didn't help.I am who I am as these people are. And I am not just proud of it because of what others tell me I should be. I am proud to know my true self.Enough about me. This movie was fantastic. Small, yet large. Deep, though light. Funny and bright. The acting was brilliant, the writing dead-on and the direction perfection. It's a wonder this movie was set to receive an NC-17 just because it showed acceptance towards lesbians.Poor teenage, cheerleading Megan. She's given an intervention when her family suspects she's a lesbian and sent off to Str8 is Great camp. There she must learn the steps to becoming normal again. Of course, in today's age (2013, soon to be 2014) this hopefully isn't as accepted, but back in 1999, parents just didn't know what to do when they weren't promised a married man\/woman grandchild.Along the journey in this camp, Megan meets a whole lot of interesting and wonderful characters, each with depth and wonderful stories of their own. She must make the right choice, i.e. to be true to oneself.I haven't seen this movie in many years and back when I had, I had watched it many times. No matter the number of views, I love it each and every time. The music is fantastic &#x96; LOVE the soundtrack. The story, emotions, depth and direction superb. I love the lines, acting, script and all characters. All actors gave their 100% including a fantastic performance from Rupaul, Cathy Moriarty, Natasha Lyonne and definitely Clea DuVall.This is a classic fairy tale with more layers than 17 onions and more fun than most str8 love stories. I truly believe it can be loved and admired by most people, str8 or gay and lessons can be learned from both sides. Truly see this and know how to treat your children so they can become better people.* * * Final thoughts Years and years later, I would sit in a movie theatre and hear the song Chick Habit but only this time, it would be in the Grindhouse double feature and at the end of Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof. While effective there, I will never remember or know that song by any other reference than But I'm a Cheerleader. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 December 2013","score":"","review":" Wow.

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. And I am taking into account that I have seen many good ones, as well as the fact that this movie is over 20 years old and STILL holds up.Okay, so this movie is a continuation of 1984's The Terminator, where a cyborg from the future is sent back through time to kill Sarah Connor, whose unborn son John will in the future lead the human resistance against the machines that wiped out most of mankind. (Also a very good movie, especially at making its budget seem ten times bigger than it really is) In T2, however, once John is ten years old, a new terminator, the T-1000, is sent back to kill John, but the model from the first film is reprogrammed for good and is sent back to protect John.Every single actor in this movie is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger may not show any emotional range, but that is why he is so perfect for the T-800. He's a robot, he's not supposed to have feelings! Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, she was great in the first one and is just as good here too, where you really believe she's a different person than she was in the last movie but still the same character, as well as all the stress she is going through. Robert Patrick as the T-1000, both scary and hard-to-see-as-evil, blah blah blah, you hear it all the time about this movie. (Although I think the special effects play just as big of a role in his character) And Edward Furlong as John Connor, although he is a bit of a jerk at first, after awhile you really latch onto his character a lot more. He is probably the best child actor I've seen in a movie.And the script and directing for this movie are fantastic. The film is very nicely paced. James Cameron really knows how to grab your interest and never let go. T2 is very exciting, intelligent, and even emotional. It is absolutely engaging for the entire run time. And honestly, can you find a single plot hole or something that doesn't make sense? Nope, didn't think so. (Did I mention Cameron directed, produced and co-wrote this movie? All that work and it still comes out flawless!) But of course, the most memorable aspects of this movie are the action and special effects. The action sequences are astounding. They are extremely well done and very realistic, and still feel like they progress the plot. And the special effects are amazing, a perfect blend of stunts, practical effects and CGI. The visuals used for the T-1000 are absolutely incredible. This movie was extremely ahead of its time, especially considering the technology to create computer-generated characters was only created two years before, and its advancement in such a short time. And without this movie, we wouldn't have Jurassic Park, The Lord of the Rings, The Matrix (Possibly), the Star Wars prequels (Okay, not so good), etc.So overall, amazing amazing amazing. This movie is awesome in every respect. It is easily in my top 10 favorite films, I give it a 10\/10.
