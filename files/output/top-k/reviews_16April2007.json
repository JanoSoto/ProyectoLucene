No wonder, since she is not sexually attracted to him and he is sleeping with her sister. Then we enter his old college friend, who is no longer anything like him and has developed a weird fetish for filming women. Sometimes people break down.I have heard this is the film that made Soderbergh's career and also pushed James Spader, Peter Gallagher and Andie MacDowell. I can see why. MacDowell has a very reserved character here, yet her range is quite good. Gallagher plays a jerk, and his eyebrows are half the size they are in While You Were Sleeping (I guess they grow when you get famous). Spader, who excels in such films as Stargate and The Secretary, is at home here -- the nerdy, yet somehow attractive introvert and minimalist. He is in the late 1980s and early 1990s what Adam Brody is for us today (2007).While much of the plot revolves around the affair, that is not really very interesting. A man cheating on his wife isn't really strange and even a man sleeping with his wife' sister isn't unheard of (though a bit gross in my mind). Spader's character shakes things up... the videotape third of the title is where the movie stands out from other such films. Confessions, secrets and intimacy over a home video system... no other film does this. And maybe you'd say why would they? but when you seem how raw the emotion is when done by home video, you'll see what the big screen cannot offer.I can't pinpoint what sold this film for me. I just became very engrossed in it, with its character-driven plot (and with such great actors, there's no need to worry if a character-driven plot will work. It will). Some parts are predictable (you know in the first few minutes the marriage is falling apart), but much of the film is anyone's guess who will get punished, will new love spring up? It's a very beautiful expose of the human drama and of human emotional versatility.I recommend this film to you. Check it out... probably not when the kids are around (although the language and nudity are surprisingly tame for a film with this subject matter). It's probably not what you expect it to be...

But when the old guy is not looking, the Golden Retrever with the other two soon following embark on the incredible journey to the place where their owners are staying. They have many long walks through the countryside, come across many risky and sometimes dangerous tests of nature, e.g. water, animals, but they eventually make it back to the owners on the day of one of the kids' birthdays, good for him. Based on a true story, with narration by Rex Allen (narrator of Charlotte's Web). It was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending. Very good!
