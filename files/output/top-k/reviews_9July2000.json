Unfortunately, that's not true. The Sixth Sense tries hard to be a good psycho-thriller and in fact the idea behind it was good. But as the script was written, someone must have had the idea to put the real big bang in there, something no viewer can guess to happen, the totally total of all story twists there ever were. But, bad luck, the grand idea has to fit into the rest of the script, so you have to modify it and make compromises. And really, I was disappointed with the end. Not because of it, but because everything else was set up for it. I didn't guess the twist because it was so sneaky, but because it was completely implausible. To clarify that I will try hard not to give anything away, in case you didn't see Sixth Sense yet, so I will ask only one question, which you'll understand later how do you get into someones apartment without ringing the doorbell or knocking? There are numerous more points like that but by stating them I would give away the surprise. It's too bad the whole film had to suffer just to get that in.And then there are horror scenes, not too many, but I guess the writers figured that the movie had to give some more than the general idea and the last big bang. And again, they just serve the purpose and are badly integrated young Cole, they boy who can see ghosts, later finds out that they want him to help them. I think even a ghost can anticipate that scaring someone to death isn't a good start for getting help.Probably the best asset of the movie is Haley Joel Osment, who played Cole. Marvelous what this young boy could do with his role. Bruce Willis stays a little unbelievable as a psychologist, but that could be the script as well. So far I yet have to encounter a psychologist who handles therapy that way. Well, nice idea, nice movie, but nothing overly sensational. Horror movies greatly benefit from taking part in our world and incorporating the horror into it. But then they have to stay true to rules we all are familiar with and to those they need to set up to make us bite our nails. If Sixth Sense would have mastered both, I'd be yelling great one!

George Clooney leads a terrific cast of stars and acting veterans in this tale of man against nature, based on a true story.Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is a sword fisherman who has had bad luck of late.  He is determined to bring in one large catch before the season ends so he takes his crew far offshore to the Flemish Cap, a place where the fish practically jump into the boat.  They fill the boat, but the ice machine breaks down, making it impossible to keep their catch fresh for long.  So, they head for home brimming with fish.  Unfortunately, nature has other plans and kicks up the mother of all hurricanes.  The rest of the film is an epic battle of man against nature, as the little fishing boat fights high winds and 50-foot waves as it struggles home.Peterson tries to create another `Das Boot' but comes up a little short this time.  In many regards, it is superior to his most famous film.  `Perfect Storm' has the most amazing visual effects of a storm at sea ever created.  It is to hurricanes what `Twister' was to tornadoes, and then some.  You get a vivid understanding of the awesome power of nature and how puny we really are by comparison.  Peterson attempts once again to get us emotionally involved with the characters by offering various character studies that humanize them.  In this regard, he was not as successful as in `Das Boot' and it leaves the film just short of greatness.The film throws in a non sequitur of a subplot by adding the Coast Guard's sailboat rescue.  Though this was some fabulous footage, it had no real relevance to the main storyline.  The time would have been better spent doing more character development and crew interaction scenes to bind us to the characters.What Peterson does better than almost any living director is to create suspense.  `Perfect Storm' is a white-knuckle ride from the first thunderbolt.  In scene after scene, you are climbing out of your seat with every muscle tensing as the crew performs yet another death defying act to stay alive.The acting was wonderful by the entire cast.  Clooney played his typical proud tough guy role with much more of a rough-hewn look, and was perfect for the role.  Mark Wahlberg turns in another fine performance bringing both strength and sensitivity to his character.  John C. Reilly gave a supporting performance as good as any of the stars.  This film got a lot of criticism because it didn't have a happy ending.  Well, the film ended the same way as actual events, so I really fail to see how that is a valid criticism.  It is also effective symbolism, as it shows the futility of the human struggle to conquer the forces of nature.  The scene of Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) helplessly bobbing alone among the fifty-foot swells drives that point mercilessly home.I rated this film a 9\/10.  What it lacks in story development, it almost completely makes up for in visual effects and suspense.  I highly recommend it.

In many regards, it is superior to his most famous film.  `Perfect Storm' has the most amazing visual effects of a storm at sea ever created.  It is to hurricanes what `Twister' was to tornadoes, and then some.  You get a vivid understanding of the awesome power of nature and how puny we really are by comparison.  Peterson attempts once again to get us emotionally involved with the characters by offering various character studies that humanize them.  In this regard, he was not as successful as in `Das Boot' and it leaves the film just short of greatness.The film throws in a non sequitur of a subplot by adding the Coast Guard's sailboat rescue.  Though this was some fabulous footage, it had no real relevance to the main storyline.  The time would have been better spent doing more character development and crew interaction scenes to bind us to the characters.What Peterson does better than almost any living director is to create suspense.  `Perfect Storm' is a white-knuckle ride from the first thunderbolt.  In scene after scene, you are climbing out of your seat with every muscle tensing as the crew performs yet another death defying act to stay alive.The acting was wonderful by the entire cast.  Clooney played his typical proud tough guy role with much more of a rough-hewn look, and was perfect for the role.  Mark Wahlberg turns in another fine performance bringing both strength and sensitivity to his character.  John C. Reilly gave a supporting performance as good as any of the stars.  This film got a lot of criticism because it didn't have a happy ending.  Well, the film ended the same way as actual events, so I really fail to see how that is a valid criticism.  It is also effective symbolism, as it shows the futility of the human struggle to conquer the forces of nature.  The scene of Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) helplessly bobbing alone among the fifty-foot swells drives that point mercilessly home.I rated this film a 9\/10.  What it lacks in story development, it almost completely makes up for in visual effects and suspense.  I highly recommend it.

Kelly's Heroes and 1941 probably went a little too far, pretending that   war is really fun & cool when you've got people like Clint Eastwood in   charge.    But then you have other war films that are black in its humour but   manage to keep into focus the cruelty & horrors of war at the same time   - M*A*S*H and Catch 22 are the best examples.    With Dirty Dozen we have something of a go-between; the humour amongst   the characters is light & welcoming but never falls into farce or   bad-taste; and Aldrich quickly pulls us back into the fold with some   tight scripted scenes of drama & mass murder (throwing petrol &   grenades into that German bunker to name but one. I often wonder about   that scene, and whether it was some kind of metaphor for the gas   chambers & concentration camps in Belsen)    But unlike MASH & Catch 22, Aldrich resists the temptation to openly   politicise the effects of war, after all this film was made in '67 near   the height of the Vietnam war\/protests. Instead he takes a straight   line course of action and lets us be moved & entertained by the   convicted GIs doing their duty.    Marvin is excellent as the hardnosed but disobediant Major. He plays   the anti-hero far better than Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes. Marvin just   looks the type who'd give the top brass as well the Germans a real hard   time.

His character is so refreshing & wild   amongst a relatively mild cast of supporting extras, with the exception   of Savalas.

Benjamin Martin, as pacifist as he was, could very well have forgiven the British for killing Thomas, his second son. (Since he is not William Wallace this time, he wouldn't need to hack down 1000 Englishmen and invade a country to get revenge.) The writer killed Martin's first son (Ledger) to keep that burning hate for the British alive on the part of the audience and for Martin. Any exaggerated passions that the movie displays is because our very own patriot saw it that way.All in all, I believe this is the best movie I've seen in a long while, much better than some think. This movie is as brutal as it is so that we as Americans, can stop taking what we have for granted and see what we had to do in order to earn our status as the best country in the world.

Those who disliked it state their arguments firmly.My turn.This movie was not about the Revolutionary War-- it's about the strength of family amongst a background of war. Every human emotion is displayed. The human spirit soars in this picture. As for everyone complaining about historical inaccuracies, this picture is a piece of art, of entertainment, not an educational tool. (I did observe, however, that The Patriot contained the smallest detail in that the British never use the term aim, as the Americans do, which is historically accurate. So I would not discredit this movie for being flawed. The movie-makers for this one knew what they were doing.)But while everyone else is picking out imperfections, look for its strong points direction-10, music-10, acting-10, special effects-10, and the story, most of all-11.(!!!---Mild Spoiler---!!!) This is a story from the eyes of an American, a patriot named Benjamin Martin. In his eyes, blacks are treated fairly, as depicted in the film. War is brutal, as depicted. The British are character-less walking killing machines, as depicted. So don't look at the larger picture, see it through Mel's eyes! See the war as we would if we were living there in South Carolina at the time.(!!!---If you haven't seen this movie, read no more, this is the SPOILER OF SPOILERS---!!!)Another uncomfortable grudge that we hold against the film is that Heath Ledger's character is killed.  But he had to die. He fought to keep a cause alive; he never once fought for himself.

The story on the surface is absurd and something you'd expect from a grade 'B' international intrigue thriller. Anne Parillaud plays Nikita, a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who is faster than a kung fu fighter and packs more punch than a Mike Tyson bite. She's killed some people and is given a choice between death and becoming an assassin for the French government.This premise should lead to the usual action\/adventure yarn, with lots of fists flying, guns going off, people jumping off of buildings, roaring through the streets in souped up vehicles, spraying bullets, etc., as blood flows and bones shatter. And something like that does happen. However there is a second level in which Nitika becomes the embodiment of something beyond an action adventure heroine. She is coerced and managed by society. Her individuality is beaten out of her so that she can be molded into what the society demands. She comes out of her 'training' with her individuality compromised, her free and natural spirit cowed, but undefeated and alive, and she sets out to do what she has been taught to do. And then she falls in love. And she notices, somewhere along the way, amid the murder and the mayhem, that there is something better than and more important than, and closer to her soul in this world than killing and being killed. She finds that she prefers love to hate, tenderness to brutality. She sees herself and who she is for the first time, but it is too late. She cannot escape. Or can she?Parillaud brings a wild animal persona tinged with beauty and unself-conscious grace to the role of Nikita. Marc Duret plays Rico, the tender man she loves, and Tchéky Karyo is her mentor, Bob, whom she also loves. Jeanne Moreau, the legend, has a small part as Amande, who teaches Nikita lipstick application and how to be attractive.Now compare this to the US remake called Point of No Return (1993), starring Bridget Fonda. (Please, do not even consider the vapid TV Nikita.) What's the difference? Well, Fonda's flashier, I suppose, but nowhere is there anything like the psychological depth and raw animal magnetism found in the original. The Fonda vehicle is simply a one-dimensional action flick stylishly done in a predictable manner. Besson's Nikita is a work of art that explores the human predicament and even suggests something close to salvation.As always with a French film, get the subtitled version.

The plot wasn't that hard to follow, the acting was great and Tom Cruise played a vulnerable though smart and resourceful agent named Ethan Hunt. He was involved in this huge mission with expert secret agents that weren't any worse than him, with the exception that they weren't the main characters and therefore the movie didn't focus on them that much.      However, MI2 or whatever you wanna call it is some bad spy flick which doesn't have anything to do neither with the first movie nor with the TV series. Ethan Hunt must be dead or something because the character Cruise plays only shares the name in common, for he's a completely different person. (Since when does a self-effacing character like him kill all the bad guys himself and work alone? All Ving Rhames and the other guy do is shoot from a helicopter.      And now comes my biggest complaint. I'm Spanish and I've lived in Spain my whole life, so I do know what this country is like. I recall a James Bond movie with Roger Moore in which he goes to Madrid, which was nothing but a bunch of white houses with Mexicans (who must be fed up with Hollywood mistaking their country with the utterly different and boring Spain) leaning back against the walls and some ancient bus with a sign on it which said Madrid, as if it was the only bus there was in the city. Apart from that film there are many other American movies which depict Spain as some third-world country full of South Americans, whom I respect a lot but who don't have absolutely anything to do with Spanish people.      But these were all old movies and I thought Hollywood had learnt to do some research before setting a movie in a foreign country. I was, however, wrong.      The first few minutes (after the climbing scene) take place in Seville which looks nothing like that kind of a Mexican Hacienda we see there. Sevilla is a city, and it looks just like Paris, Vienna or Rome. People wear regular clothes, they don't go around dressed up in those weird outfits shown in the movie which aren't even Spanish. (Some of them are, though, but from a different part of Spain)  I remember Anthony Hopkins saying that locals burn their saints as he looks out the window and watches some weird ritual which is supposed to be a national Spanish feast. Then we see people dressed in real regional Sevillan costumes (but they're just regional though, people don't wear them on the streets, it's like those green costumes Austrians have), people dressed also in regional Valencian costumes (which would never be found at a Sevillan feast, since they come from up North) and some other folks wearing dressed that come directly from the imagination of the costume designers. Then we see them burning wooden statues of saints in a huge fire in the middle of a square, and they all move around like zombies. That doesn't exist!! People don't burn saints in Spain, and they don't walk around as if they were possessed by the devil. And the worst thing is that it's supposed to be a religious feast. Don't worry foreigners!! We don't do that, we're normal people just like you, that wear the same clothes as you do, live in buildings just like you and probably think like you!!!  Maybe the thing of the fire comes from a non-religious feast that takes place in Valencia every year where people light fire-crackers just for fun and there are spectacular fire-works. But it's just a show, that's all. Something for the tourists.  Then I was also surprised to see the supposedly locals speak with a strong South American accent with a touch of Arabic (Two beautiful accents that don't have anything to do with the Spanish one, and besides Arabic is a different language)and also not a single blonde or white skinned person. Hey, people in Spain are blonde, red-haired, brunette, etc. I myself am blonde. And we aren't dark-skinned (even though we try hard to be, since it's very sexy and fashionable skin color.

So far the best movie of the summer is Gladiator....hands down!

Sure, the Zevo factory turned out no guns, no replicas of World War Two tanks, no violent arcade games.  Their toys lacked all traces of violence - a virtue, but an entirely negative virtue.  There wasn't anything GOOD about the oversized, sticky-coloured plastic, ugly, gimmicky trash that they sold to children, and there was no disguising this.  Most of the toys looked as if they wouldn't be out of place in a horror movie about demonic animated dolls.  All looked crude and under-designed.  How can we be expected to cheer for them?Likewise, while the Zevo factory was no doubt meant to be a cheerful, progressive workplace, it comes across as a totalitarian nightmare.  It's hard to avoid the impression that employees are FORCED to smile and dance all the time.  The decor alone probably makes them want to scream.  It has a similar effect on me.  After a while I just couldn't stand this world consisting of colours that children are supposed to like cadmium red, bright yellow, middlebrow blue.  Maybe very small children DO like these colours.  They also like pure sugar crystals, and for much the same reason.The basic story is a strong one and it's all that makes the film watchable.  It IS watchable.  But you have to look behind almost every frame and pretend, against the evidence of your senses, that Zevo's factory is worth preserving.  You also have to ignore Robin William's inappropriate performance, Robin Wright's sickening and extraneous character, and the fact that, every so often, for no reason whatever, the film becomes a music video.  I'm not joking.  I don't simply mean that the editing is bad I mean that the film actually lapses, literally, into music video, much as West Side Story lapses into song and dance - except that in West Side Story it isn't a lapse.

Very convincing. Going into this movie I expected to hate it and call it awful.  However, I can't hate any movie with the great thespian James Spader in it as a rule. Therefore, I give the movie 2 and 1\/2 stars.  James Spader is so kettle that his core is showing.  I hope this review was as Russo-booked as I hoped it would be.

I guess that, while the performances are great and the direction is very good (it was the first Jane Campion film that didn't make my head fall down on my chin now and then), the story by Campion and her sister Anna is the problem.Ruth is a very pretty, smart young girl who falls under the spell of a guru in India. Her father and mother are determined to talk some sense into her and they hire a exor... excuse me, Cult-deprogrammer. Reluctantly, Ruth allows this man to take her to a desert cabin where she will undergo a three day session.Is Ruth really under the spell of an Indian cult? This girl can't be more regular she smokes, she drinks; goes to parties; drives a car; sings along with pop music; has sex &#150; O, my goodness, what kind of twisted cult did this girl join?! She chants a few times, she lights a candle and has a photo of her guru on her, but hey, Jane and Anna, you can't fool the audiences. This story has nothing to do with religion or philosophy; the use of a cult is just an alibi for another battle of the sexes, and, indeed, that's what we get. Harvey Keitel's self-indulgent character (`183 successful cases') is introduced as a man for all seasons. The scene on the airport says it all he's selfaware, muscular, gallant, but still looks like the slick manager of a cheap back-street boxer. Three days is the standard time for Keitel to wash the cult out of someone's head, but when he lays his eyes upon Ruth, he smiles and remarks `Let's make that twelve hours.' But Keitel is gonna have a hard time with this girl. He tries to get through to her, but she resist and all it takes for Ruth to swap roles and bring Keitel down is to get undressed and have sex with him a couple of times. A female using sex to get what she wants and a man who can't resist a woman offering herself. Wow, Jane and Anna, what a revelation! And while we watch and actually enjoy this film, we do continue to keep asking ourselves questions like Ruth is such an independent, strong woman. How could she possible fall so quickly under the spell of a guru?  And if Keitel is the best in his field, how is it possible that it takes only having sex with Ruth twice to change him from the self-indulgent man we saw at the airport to the beaten, pathetic cross-dressing loser in the end?Like I said in the beginning, I would have paid admission to see this film because it's never boring, it got a healthy sense of humor; it's pretty well made and acted, but in the end, it has nothing to do with cults; this is a rather shallow revisit to Battle Of the Sexes-county.6 out of 10.

I found myself laughing at parts, and thought that it would be better if I had a different look on life than I do.  But, I don't.  The movie has a laid-back feel, which is good to alot of people.
