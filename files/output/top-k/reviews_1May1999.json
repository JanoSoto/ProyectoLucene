Spinal Tap is the fake documentary of The sights, the sounds, the smells of one of England's loudest bands.  They also happen to be one of England's (or anywhere's) worst bands, and they are on a fast decent to nowhere while promoting their album Smell the Glove.One of the many, many delights of the film is in showing just how low the band goes (the lowest is being billed behind a puppet show at a local amusement park).  But this film gives so much more than that descent.  It truly has its pulse on the vast humor that stupidity can provide, and as it gives us a clueless and derivative rock band, the cleverness in how it brings us it's stupidity is never less than breathtaking.The film is only 82 minutes, which is hard to believe, given how many jokes, both subtle and not so subtle, are thrown at us.  It's like Airplane, except instead of giving us sight gags and groaners, it gives us biting sarcasm and brilliant insight into the worst that rock n' roll can provide. The amazing thing is that unlike Airplane, there isn't one miss in the bunch.  Every joke in this film is at least funny, and many need a stronger adjective to express it's level of humor.This film is in one way an attack on a Rock n' Roll industry that allows a band like Spinal Tap to hang around, inexplicably, for twenty years, but this film is in no way a great social commentary.  It is a spoof. Well, actually, that's not really accurate.  It is THE spoof.  Every one before and after it will inevitably be compared to it, and ultimately, unfavorably.This is Spinal Tap is now rightfully a comedy classic.  I dare say that only The Holy Grail compares in being the most quoted movie of all time (at least among the Gen X set).  It deserves its place.  In my viewing of over 2,000 films in my life, I not only say without hesitation that it is the funniest film I have ever seen, I probably won't ever see a funnier oneIf you have seen Spinal Tap once and strongly disagree, my advice is to see it again.  It will allegedly be in theaters next year.  Spinal Tap needs at least six viewings to fully appreciate all of its humor.  The first time I saw it I was confused, the second I was amazed, and the third I was dying laughing.Although there are at least fifty jokes that are truly hysterical, a few do stand out, especially Big Bottoms and These go to eleven.  But don't see it watching for just the biggies, because there is so much humor tucked slightly beneath the surface that you will miss most of it (chances are you will miss at least twenty jokes from laughing alone).  But do yourself a favor and see the funniest movie ever captured on film, and find that fine line between clever and stupid, because if you do, you will never look at cucumbers the same way again.

It presents new ideas, a great premise, and fascinating characters. The plot, which should probably be pretty familiar with anyone who knows their science fiction, is about immortals battling it out over the centuries with swords, fighting for the mystic prize, in which the final immortal left will recieve. They can't die unless another immortal takes their head and consume they're powers, a process called The Quickening.

This time of final battles is called The Gathering.Following the lead, the film tells the story of Conner MacLeod (Lambert), an immortal who was killed in battle and magically resurrected, and then banished from his home in Scotland in the 1500's. He is found by Ramirez (Sean Connery...who was having a lot of fun), an ancient immortal who must train him and teach him the ways of the immortals. The film has many parallels and takes place in both the 1500's in a series of flashbacks, and in the 1980's in New York City, the place, we soon learn, of the Gathering.The villian of the story is the evil Kurgen (Clancy Brown), who has existed for centuries and is responsible for the death of many immortals.

I was one of the considerable number of people who, as the credits appear, sit quietly till one has to leave -- still stuck in the film's experience.  I'm not angry at others who merely fell asleep.  It's odd how some of the film's harsher critics seem compelled to vent their anger in disparaging comments against those who loved it -- most of those who liked the film were gentler in commenting on its critics.In contrast to what some have written, The thin red line has nothing to do with the British infantry in its imperial past.  Jones referred to two related quotes in his excellent book, both having to do with a thin line between sanity and insanity.  Whether justified or not, necessary or not, there is a lot of insanity in the war experience by anyone's definition of insanity.War exists and seems to recreate itself -- I never got the idea from Malick's film that he was preaching that we should just stop having wars. On the contrary, he takes war as a given in the human part of nature, and shows how individual human beings variously adapted (or mal-adapted!) in order to be able to keep eating, breathing and, yes, killing.  The war experience is not primarily about shooting and blowing things up -- as Jones described from his own experience, it's largely about what happens between skirmishes -- strife and comradeship, fear and bravado, homesickness and freedom from past constraints, and waiting to die or to see a buddy die. People came, died, and were replaced -- much as portrayed by the cameo appearances in the film that confused or upset some viewers.  Veterans always talk about how hard it is when you have to rely on your buddies (and feel for them) even though odds are most of them will die.What is most important to me (and it doesn't have to be for anyone else, I know that) is how the eternal themes of humanity are affected and expressed in such circumstances.  All great works of art have something to do with the themes of beauty, pain, triumph, despair, good and evil.  There's nothing wrong with entertainment as a diversion (The Matrix was fine fun); there's room both for film for fun and for film as art.  Saving Ryan's Privates was mostly good entertainment (although I found it terribly manipulative and jingoistic), while TTRL explores the themes I mentioned above, never with easy answers.  If you found the voice-overs heavy-handed, maybe it's because you're used to Hollywood telling us what to think and feel and thought Malick was doing the same.  Watch again and see if he's not just giving us access to various individuals' often conflicting perspectives.As for those who think the film portrays our soldiers in a bad light, my family members who fought in WWII described their experiences and their reactions much as those shown in TTRL -- they were ordinary men, decent enough people, not heroes though sometimes unpredictably capable of the heroic, and devastated by their experiences.  I'm proud of them for having done all they could to do what they felt was their responsibility, and to keep some humanity intact in spite of the horror.  None of them told me they felt ennobled by war; they endured it and were badly hurt by it but didn't feel sorry for themselves, either.In TTRL I got to see this portrayed with such compassion I wept.  Even the guy (Dale) who ripped gold teeth out of the mouths of dying Japanese soldiers was no stereotypical villain -- he has his moment of grace as do they all.  No one's defenses are portrayed as impregnable, not even Witt's. No stereotype himself, we see him kill over a dozen soldiers in battle, while still trying to see God in the midst of the chaos. And what a powerful scene at his life's end, fulfilling his own striving for self-sacrifice, and recognizing in a moment of epiphany where his own immortality lie.  Those who couldn't find a plot line in the film must have missed the first ten minutes...Maybe it's because of my own experience in life that I respond to this film so strongly.  I endured and survived ten years of intense, inescapable unrelenting abuse as a child.  I remember even as a small child trying to make sense of it all -- looking for the good, the reasons, God's plan, my purpose.  Others who've survived trauma (in the Holocaust camps, on the cancer wards) often describe how such experiences focussed their attention on things that matter, beyond the physical realities they could not control. Ever since my childhood I've moved through life with a second awareness -- that examination and self-examination while real time goes on.That's what Malick portrayed, for me, in this film.

I endured and survived ten years of intense, inescapable unrelenting abuse as a child.  I remember even as a small child trying to make sense of it all -- looking for the good, the reasons, God's plan, my purpose.  Others who've survived trauma (in the Holocaust camps, on the cancer wards) often describe how such experiences focussed their attention on things that matter, beyond the physical realities they could not control. Ever since my childhood I've moved through life with a second awareness -- that examination and self-examination while real time goes on.That's what Malick portrayed, for me, in this film.  Maybe you think that's sophomoric or pretentious.  It may not seem so when you're in the midst of a struggle, or on your death bed...DGHP. S.  I organized a special screening of this film locally for a few friends -- 400 others paid to come, by word of mouth. Over a hundred sat spell-bound as the credits scrolled by -- hushed and not wanting to leave. Fellow wounded souls, some of them, I'll bet.

Blair Witch is the only honestly touch-your-soul frightening movie I've ever seen. No one moved through the entire last half of the movie.  No one spoke, no one even breathed.

I compare the movie to a fine wine--it gets better with age.When I first saw Empire of the Sun after it was released, I had mixed emotions leaving the theater.  To me, the story seemed to flow flawlessly until the release of the prisoners from the prison camp.  Then the story seemed to get muddled and confused, not knowing at the time that this is what Steven Spielberg was wanting to accomplish.  For many years, I had a love-hate relationship with the movie; there were so many things I liked, but so many things I would have liked to have seen differently.But Empire of the Sun is one of those movies that does get better with age. When I first saw the movie, I still pictured Spielberg's movies in a common theme--action-adventure (Jaws, Close Encounters, E.T., and the Indiana Jones movies).  I kept this love-hate relationship with this movie until Spielberg started producing his more serious work (Schindler's List, Amistad and Saving Private Ryan).  I now realize the genius that was Empire of the Sun, and I bet if the movie critics had a second look at this movie now, they would realize that this movie belongs on the short list of Spielberg's best movies.  I am now proud to call it one of my favorite movies.It is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I have ever seen.  Perhaps the reason this is Spielberg's most misunderstood movies is that the master storyteller lets the film and the music tell the story, and not necessarily by use of dialogue.  While John Williams will be remembered for the musical scores of other Spielberg films (Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, even Schindler's List), this is truly John William's masterpiece that, in my opinion, even he has yet to top.  Its as if Spielberg commissioned the music first, then filmed around the music.  What is not said in the film is just as important as what is said.Christian Bale gives the performance of a lifetime as Jim, the young boy who is separated from his parents after the Japanese take Shanghai during World War II, and the stories of his struggle for survival in a prison camp until the end of the war.  To this day, I am still shocked that a 13-year-old could give such a commanding performance, acting toe-to-toe with the likes of John Malkovich, Nigel Havers and Miranda Richardson.The story intentionally gets muddled about two-thirds of the way through the movie.  But as the allied forces slowly inch their way to China, things are naturally going to get confusing, when the only goal of the characters is survival.  This is one of those movies that you learn from each time you see it, until finally you learn enough to understand that this is exactly what Spielberg had in mind when he made this movie.If you have not seen the film, or if you haven't seen it in a long time, I encourage you to rent the movie and enjoy it all over again.

There really is no other film like it.  The first words uttered in the film are All that we see or seem, are but a dream, a dream within a dream....  That is what Weir has created with this film - something that is as beautiful and as surreal as a dream.The factuality of the events depicted here are stressed at the beginning and the end but the film is actually directly based on the novel which is of debatable authenticity.  There certainly isn't any real evidence backing up this story.  In fact, many people now think it is a work of fiction since there is supposed to be a final chapter which was cut which resolved the girls disappearance in a sort of 'through the looking glass' way.  There are many theories to what happened to the girls ranging from plain old murder (Irma going psycho is my favourite) to the paranormal (timeslip\/parallel universe\/alien abduction) but in the end, in the context of the film, they don't really matter.  I guess Weir wanted to stress the factuality of the events to heighten the dream-like quality of his film.  After all, a dream without a reality is just another reality.The film is pure atmosphere, its locations switching between the Victorian boarding school with its oppressive gothic overtones and tyranical principal and the alluring, but terrifying Hanging Rock.  The movie in many ways is a horror movie - the school representing a more natural horror and the rock the supernatural horror, the two combined in quite splendid fashion.
