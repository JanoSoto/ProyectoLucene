[{"date":"19 June 2015","score":"","review":" Who says that a film about a disgraced American soldier fighting off a vicious cannibalistic serial killer in the chilly Pacific Northwest mountains couldn't be fun? Rave out is an incredibly unique film, unlike any other because of its buoyantly jovial, tongue in cheek attitude in the face of such grim subject matter. I won't even bother giving my usual rant about it being underrated because honestly, it's a hard sell. The casual moviegoer would be hard pressed to grab it off the shelf and think they're in for a fun Friday night. But they would be. It boasts a wickedly funny, extremely gory horror comedy vibe that's just unbeatable. Guy Pearce is excellent as a soldier who survived and triumphed in the Mexican American war by playing dead and infiltrating his enemies quarters as a corpse. Labelled a coward by his bear of a superior (John Spencer) he finds himself exiled to a snowy mountain outpost, presided over by an unruly band of misfits. It's not long before a mysterious stranger (Robert Carlyle) stumbles out of the night with a horrifying tale of brutal murder and cannibalism, leaving him the sole survivor. The outpost leader organizes a search party to the alleged cave where this takes place, and from there the film takes a gloriously demented detour into a supremely weird, devilishly entertaining fight for survival. The musical score is completely opposite of what the synopsis suggests, a haunting jangly tune that suggest nothing of the outright atrocities to come, making the film all the more memorable. Carlyle is a slippery fiend, nailing a role that's tricky to pull off, with glee and malice at every turn. The always welcome Jeffrey Jones steals the show as the outpost leader, a chatterbox good ol boy who brightens every scene he's in, and old pro Jones takes the wicked funny script and dances circles with it. David Arquette randomly shows up as a peyote loving mountain man, and Jeremy Davies and Neal McDonough have a nice bits too. Whatever problems the director had with the studio is none of my business. I just know I've never seen anything like this delightful flick, and they should be proud no end of how it turned out.

All of those elements make Friday The 13The Final Chapter a memorable Horror movie and one of the best in the series.Taking place after the events in Part III,the final chapter finds Jason Voorhees(Ted White)escaping from a hospital this time stalking the Jarvis family and a group of teenagers unprepared for the wrath of Jason.Friday The 13thThe Final Chapter is a brilliant Horror movie and is easily one of the best films in the Friday The 13th franchise and one of the finest Slasher movies ever made because it pretty much has everything you would have in a Friday The 13th movie and Slasher filmcharacters who are dead meat from the start,blood and gore and of course Jason Voorhees. It's also the film that introduced protagonist Tommy Jarvis who would be an important character in the Friday The 13th franchise against Jason. Final Chapter is an absolute roller coaster ride from beginning to end that is thrilling and suspenseful and also came out at the peak of the Slasher genre during the late 1970s to the early 1980s and The Final Chapter(or Part IV)came out at the right time. The the suspense and tension in the film is fantastic with a slow build-up that takes it's time and when the suspense stops the movie explodes with intensity. Also,the movie is great because it combines two genres that were successful during the early part of the 1980sthe Slasher genre and the Teenage Sex Comedy mixing together blood and gore of a Slasher movie and the Humor of the Teen sex Comedy bringing together the best of both worlds with some laughs and terror. The characters are some of most fun and memorable in the entire series whether it's the Jarvis family or the teenagers every main character is interesting. Despite having some laughs The Final Chapter is probably the darkest,nastiest and most nihilistic film of the series thanks to the atmosphere which is bleak and grim with rain,fog and dark lighting that is used to great effect where you feel like no one is safe. The movie also has a tough and vicious mean streak with the blood,gore and kills which are not well-done and horrific but cringe worthy and painful that when you watch Final Chapter you will feel like turning away. As for Jason Voorhees the character is at his very best here,sneaking up on his victims like the silent killer that he is taking his time and waiting to strike at his prey and at times Jason does it in a very surprising way. The Final Chapter is also Jason at his angriest and most vicious I mean in here he pulls no punches and takes no prisoners with the people he kills in this movie and it seems like the more he kills and chases someone the more angry he gets. I think that the only other film in the series in my opinion that can match the brutality and anger in terms of the Jason character and kills would be Jason Lives although the tone of that movie is much lighter compared to this film. This would also be the last time Jason would be hiding in the shadows and darkness because in the later films he's the star and out in full light. The ending of Friday The 13thThe Final Chapter is a terrific ending and one of the best finales in the series with twists and plenty of surprises you won't see coming and one of the finest chase scenes in the franchise that is exciting and frightening. A fantastic ending. The cast is good. Ted White is excellent as Jason,with White being menacing,angry and intense. Kimberly Beck is wonderful as Trish Jarvis,the heroine of the film. Corey Feldman is terrific as Tommy Jarvis,Trish's little brother. Crispin Glover and Laurence Monsoon are hilarious and memorable as Jimmy and Ted,two teenage buddies. Erich Anderson is great as Rob,a man Trish meets. Joan Freeman does a good job as Mrs. Jarvis,Trish and Tommy's Mother. Judie Aronson(Samantha),Barbara Howard(Sara),Camlla More(Tina),Carey More(Terri),Peter Barton(Doug),Clyde Harris(Paul),Bruce Mahler(Axel),Lisa Freeman(Nurse Debbie Morgan)and Bonnie Hellman(Hitchhiker)give good performances as well.The direction by Joseph Zito is outstanding,with Zito bringing and creepy and intense atmosphere to the film and occasionally moving the camera giving the movie a nice pace. Great direction,Zito.The score by Harry Manfredini is another impressive score and adds to the tone of the movie. Wonderful score,Manfredini.The Special and Practical Make-Up Effects by Tom Savini is amazing,gory and some of the best work Savini has ever done.

A teenage girl's relationship with a young man from the wrong side of the tracks soon sparks off numerous problems that are down to her father's over-protective instincts and the girl's natural rebelliousness but the dramatic possibilities are then heightened even further due to the specific dynamics that exist within the girl's reconstituted family.Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) is the naïve 16-year-old who, after previously living with her mother, moves into her father's suburban home in Seattle. Steven's (William Petersen) an overworked architect who lives with his second wife Laura (Amy Brenneman) and her young son Toby (Christopher Gray). When Nicole and her high school classmate Margo Masse (Alyssa Milano) go to a local rave, Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg) and is instantly attracted to him. He's exceptionally polite, softly spoken and seems very gentle and considerate. David instantly makes a positive impression on Laura and Toby when he visits their home but Steven instinctively takes a dislike to him. This naturally creates a rift between him and Nicole and makes her even more determined to continue the relationship.Things suddenly change one day when David sees Nicole hugging her school friend Gary (Todd Caldecott) and is overcome with jealousy and rage. In a sudden and violent outburst, he brutally attacks Gary and roughly pushes Nicole to the ground. After the attack, Nicole is left with a black eye and immediately stops seeing David. This incident reinforces Steven's negative feelings towards David but it isn't long before Nicole surprisingly rekindles the relationship. Steven is incensed and angrily forbids David from seeing his daughter again. David, however, is totally obsessed with Nicole and as his fury grows, the revenge he takes on the Walker family becomes progressively more violent until his actions eventually lead to a terrifying conclusion.The ways in which conflict grows between the generations is shown very effectively in this drama because, whilst it's natural for parents to want to protect their children from pain, exploitation or bad experiences, it's also entirely natural for teenagers to want to explore life in the way that their instincts dictate and not be given advice which they just regard as being interfering by parents who want to spoil their fun. The tensions in the Walker family are also complicated by the step-parents' desire to be accepted by their adopted children and also the uncertainty that children can feel about a parent's new spouse.Reese Witherspoon does a great job of portraying the mixture of naivety and growing maturity that's typical of a 16-year-old and Mark Wahlberg is particularly good in the scenes that require him to express his anger. William Petersen provides the other standout performance as the father who's left frazzled by being overworked, having to contend with his concerns about his daughter and trying to cope with his wife's unreasonable attitude to his work commitments. Overall, this is a movie which provides some pertinent observations on family life in the 1990s in a story that's perfectly paced and delivered in a style that's never dull.

Seven astronauts undergo a mission in space and come across pods. John Hurt is found unconscious with a strange creature entwined on his face. Examination indicates that its blood is a burning acid. Hurt regains consciousness leading to the famous scene where a slender creature bursts out through his chest.

I had watched it for the first time about 4 or 5 years ago. My eyes weren't as polished and my mind wasn't as perceptive back then as it is now from a cinematic standpoint. So when I watched it back then, I remember being impressed by the whole concept of the same incident being narrated by people in completely different manners in an attempt to manipulate others. But I had certainly not grasped everything else that enriches this absolutely masterful piece of work. Now on my second viewing, I noticed the multiple layers, the themes, and the meaning behind the film.The film as I have mentioned before deals with different versions of the same incident. The film starts out with a woodcutter and a priest sitting beneath the Rashōmon city gate to stay away from the heavy rainfall. Suddenly a stranger comes along and becomes suspicious of these two quiet men. Then the woodcutter and the priest decide to tell him what has made them so very depressed and the film's main plot proceeds. The main story is about a murder that takes place. The persons involved in the murder come back to get interrogated about it. Each of them narrate the incident differently. Interestingly we never see the interrogator and hence it seems as if the characters are answering questions and narrating the incident directly to the viewer. This was a thematic break of the 4th wall. Each version paints a good and desired impression of the narrator in the viewer's mind, but a neutral account of the incident might make the viewer question the morality of every character involved. One of the main aspects of this film that is so impressive is the cinematography. The camera effortlessly follows the characters while they walk through the forest in the most serene way possible. Kurosawa succeeds in conveying so much with the most subtle things. The shadow of the leaves fluttering gently on the face of Mifune, the sun desperately trying to make its way through the bushy trees, but failing to do so signifying the truth not being allowed to come to the forefront by the characters, the half damaged city gate, the relentless rain signifying the relentless nature of disasters and calamities,etc.The film is much more endearing and important from a broader perspective. One has to consider the fact that Rashōmon got released in 1950, so just a few years after the devastating World War II. After the disastrous consequences of that war, Japan and the Japanese society was going through an indefinite spell of misery and hopelessness. This film deals with that hopelessness in the most humanist manner possible. Rashōmon really is about existentialism beneath the seemingly simple outer surface. The film deals with the question-whether we should lose all hope and faith in humanity or not after considering and even witnessing all the heinous crimes and immoral deeds that human beings are capable of. The priest and the woodcutter seriously consider losing faith in the human soul after listening to the incident of the murder and everything that followed with the interrogations. But even in the midst of this hopelessness, Kurosawa manages to end the film in the most heart-wrenching and optimistic manner to give hope and a reason to start believing again to not only the Japanese people, but also to the viewers from the rest of the world. Rashōmon is just an essential, transcendental film in the history of cinema that needs to be watched by everyone who is interested in film as an art form.

How about the shower scene? Her acting sucks badly. That brain dead monotone like she is balancing her checkbook? In the MATRIX, they poured her into that outfit for a reason, Carrie Anne stunningly beautiful and commensurately devoid of acting ability. She sounds so insouciant she could be Spock's wife. When Kilmer is biting it, and he is signing off she sounds like her misandrist daily magazine just went bi weekly. Please, who was the casting wizard who made her lead actor in the movie. Put Kilmer in front, idiots, even Sizemore towers over this Matrix midget. If you are looking for the number one reason the movie went down the crapper take a good look; Carrie Anne never was lead actor of another movie ever again.

This boredom is not lightened by singing a crappy Stones song, or showing us urinating in lower gravity. Thanks, that is too much information.

If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels, please be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk about The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry together, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest of the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden, but I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been isolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate surrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more about what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter and over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is able to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about how Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II. The movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI, etc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced culture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create. Now, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I think the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that doesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be slow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as well. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through Courscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are slow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really fun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's weapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't take that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a stick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough with the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of sophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing to seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope. Jango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is just over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden Christensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a relate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The action is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great start to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The finale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full scale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story, thought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be honest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and action). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I wanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started reviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!

The Tyrell Corporation's motto, more human than human, serves as the basis for exploring this experience through true humans and created humans, or Replicants. Symbolism of the meaning of humanity in contrast with otherness are woven throughout the film, relying largely on biblical metaphors. The movie presents us with types of angels, demons, Heaven and God as the creator as well as illusions to Christ, much like the theme and symbolisms use in the film The Life of Pi.The replicants represent the fallen angels in the Bible, or demons. Numerous passages relate the angels as servants to the followers of God, but these angels\/replicants fell from grace when they mutinied against their creators. Likewise, the demons of the Bible are angels that fell from God's grace and were cast out of Heaven when they rebelled against God's authority. A powerful symbol that recurs throughout the movie is that of the eye. The Bible uses the illustration of the eyes many times to show its importance as a gate to the soul. Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew, The light of the body is the eye. Retired cop, Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is forced out of retirement to resume his position as a Blade Runner. His mission is to retire or eliminate the four Replicants that have escaped from off-world colonies and have made their way to earth to meet the man who created them and to find the answer to every lasting life. The Replicants or skin-jobs are androids\/humanoids were banned from earth and used as slave labor on earth colonies. Due to their intelligence, they are programed to breakdown or die after four years to prevent them from developing human emotions or feelings.Deckard must battle and destroy the four replicants Leon Kolwalski (Brion James); Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) the snake lady; Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) and Roy's girlfriend, Pris (Daryl Hannah). Eldon Tyrell, the creator of the Replicants, asks Deckard to demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine that is used to identify if someone is a replicant or a human. He is asked to perform the test on Tyrell's employee, Rachel. It takes 100 questions before Deckard determines that she is indeed a replicant. She plays a major role in saving Deckard's life during an altercation with Leon Kolwalski. The special effects in Blade Runner are paramount, since they were created by camera and not computer-generated images. The lighting throughout the film, along with the voice-over narration by Deckard, and the shapely, form fitted dresses worn by Rachel, gives us the impression of a dark futuristic film that is reminiscent of a 1940s black and white movie. This effect is well played and lends a bit of mystique to the picture. The opening scene of the Los Angeles skyline reflecting off the iris of an eye is breathing taking and symbolic of God's view of his earthly creation.

Likewise, the demons of the Bible are angels that fell from God's grace and were cast out of Heaven when they rebelled against God's authority. A powerful symbol that recurs throughout the movie is that of the eye. The Bible uses the illustration of the eyes many times to show its importance as a gate to the soul. Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew, The light of the body is the eye. Retired cop, Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is forced out of retirement to resume his position as a Blade Runner. His mission is to retire or eliminate the four Replicants that have escaped from off-world colonies and have made their way to earth to meet the man who created them and to find the answer to every lasting life. The Replicants or skin-jobs are androids\/humanoids were banned from earth and used as slave labor on earth colonies. Due to their intelligence, they are programed to breakdown or die after four years to prevent them from developing human emotions or feelings.Deckard must battle and destroy the four replicants Leon Kolwalski (Brion James); Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) the snake lady; Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) and Roy's girlfriend, Pris (Daryl Hannah). Eldon Tyrell, the creator of the Replicants, asks Deckard to demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine that is used to identify if someone is a replicant or a human. He is asked to perform the test on Tyrell's employee, Rachel. It takes 100 questions before Deckard determines that she is indeed a replicant. She plays a major role in saving Deckard's life during an altercation with Leon Kolwalski. The special effects in Blade Runner are paramount, since they were created by camera and not computer-generated images. The lighting throughout the film, along with the voice-over narration by Deckard, and the shapely, form fitted dresses worn by Rachel, gives us the impression of a dark futuristic film that is reminiscent of a 1940s black and white movie. This effect is well played and lends a bit of mystique to the picture. The opening scene of the Los Angeles skyline reflecting off the iris of an eye is breathing taking and symbolic of God's view of his earthly creation.

The Tyrell Corporation's motto, more human than human, serves as the basis for exploring this experience through true humans and created humans, or Replicants.

It is a direct spoof of James Bond films with lashes at other films particularly Die Hard. Nielsen stars as secret agent WD-40 better known as Dick Steele who is called upon to rescue Barbara Dahl from a past villain. Dahl is the daughter of a past deceased girlfriend. Premise wears thin and jokes become forced. Director Rick Friedberg has fun with the parodies with effective setups to other films, but too much is familiar. Nielsen seems in on the joke here and is never as funny as his Frank Drebin role from The Naked Gun films. Andy Griffith is also distant as the villain with artificial arms. Nicolette Sheridan is wasted as a Bond bombshell whose seduction is no match for any Bond girls. Charles Durning as Steele's boss inspires some comic wit with his constant hideouts but the role is otherwise standard. Marcia Gay Harden also has the comic chops but in the wrong movie for it. It is indeed a spoof of James Bond films with a few funny moments but Nielsen is far better in The Naked Gun films where characters seem broader.

Government agents are in search of alien activity but E.T. must get home before he dies. Steven Spielberg touches all of the bases in delivering a film that should appeal to everyone. This would seem like a family oriented counter part to his Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Visual effects are convincing allowing Spielberg to create a creature that children will adore. Henry Thomas is superb as Elliott who will grow responsible when friendship becomes top priority. Drew Barrymore as his younger sister will be highlighted in that key images of her kissing E.T's nose. Dee Wallace Stone plays their mother whom we learn is still in grief after her husband left. Robert MacNaughton plays Elliott's older brother who plays football but ultimately must take charge when Elliott and E.T are in danger. Peter Coyote plays a mysterious scientist who goes by the name Keys, and who has different intentions. Aliens are usually brought to the screen for invasion. E.T. exists for a kinder purpose.

The film exposes numerous factors that contribute to this wall. Bob Geldof plays a cynical rock star found overdosed on drugs in his trashed hotel room. Flashbacks indicate his lonely childhood, mockery at school, an overbearing mother, his failed marriage, and his father's death in the war. His rage takes full effect as a groupie hovers in a corner as he trashes the room and sends a TV crashing to the ground below. Pink Floyd's title track brings conviction as a classroom becomes a slaughterhouse to faceless students marching in matching uniforms. Tremendous direction by Alan Parker aided by Pink Floyd whose lyrics fuel the story. It is also highlighted with exquisite animated segments. Geldof is ideal and dead to the world as his mind conjures up images of death, destruction and a possible ray of hope in the final scene. Christine Hargreaves plays his mother who neglects him. Jenny Wright plays a groupie who gets more than she bargained for in her attempt to seduce. Eleanor David plays his wife who answers neglect with an affair.
