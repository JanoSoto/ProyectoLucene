The sets are as stagey as you'd expect from someone who's trodden the boards as often as KB, but what I didn't expect was the overwrought acting and frankly awful scripting from Frank Darabont (of Shawshank Redemption).Take the creation scene - surely a set-piece of the movie and pivotal in that we should see Victor move from triumph at his successful experiment to horror in what he's created. It goes like this... Victor breaks open the creation chamber, frees the monster and the two of them spend a good minute slipping and falling over in amniotic goop like Stan and Ollie after a pie-fight. Then (somehow) the monster gets tangled up in the washing line (or something) and is hoist to the ceiling.

The monster doesn't kill anyone, he doesn't smash anything, he's no uglier than when Victor stitched him together - why does Frankenstein suddenly turn against his creation?

Taking place shortly after World War I, Van Damme plays Chris Dubois, a humble indentured servant figure with Rocky-like ambitions to become a big fighting champion. Dubois has set his sights on some very elite and secret tournament in some mystical forbidden city, to which only the best fighter in every country of the world gets an invitation.To get into the tournament, Dubois enlists the help of a mischievous figure, Lord Dobbs. In one of the many parts of the plot I was unable to follow, Lord Dobbs owes him some unknown favor so he buys his freedom and makes arrangements to get the kid to Beijing, with the aide of an attractive blonde newspaper editor, Carrie Newton (Gunn).Dobbs is played by seven-time James Bond alumni Roger Moore, who I'm so used to seeing as Bond that I half-expected him to, at a crucial point in the movie, bag the attractive news lady, beat someone up, or use some cool gadget. Sadly, Moore only accomplishes one of these three things (uses a cool gadget) and fails miserably at it. However, Moore does carry one James Bond-like trait to this part which is being a smooth talker which gets Dubois in trouble in the first place. Apparently, Dubois was never really entered into the tournament, so he must win over the guy who's slated to fight for the U.S. and get his invitation, which raises the question, isn't Dubois French?Anyway, there's no reason to fret over little things like that, because considering the plot is secondary to the action, it's pretty well-thought out, and besides the action doesn't disappoint.The tournament where most of the actions scenes come from is probably my favorite thing about the movie because the single elimination bracketed format has the same thrill as watching something like NCAA's March Madness. The only difference is that except for rooting for your favorite colleges, you root for Industrial Era superpowers. The other plus of this was that the clashing of such a diverse array of fighting styles (sumo wrestling, Scottish fist fighting, Brazillian street fighting, and the like) led to some great action scenes.My main complaint about the action is that Van Damme's fight scenes attempt to create suspense by him being knocked down and then supposedly against our expectations, getting back up and winning. This just becomes predictable, and besides, because the Master of Ceremonies usually hits the gong after a guy gets knocked down, Dubois would have realistically been out in the second round after getting the crap beat out of him by the Spaniard. Even if he did get back up, he wouldn't have been able to overpower the other guy after having taken so many hits. If he is such a skillful fighter, why doesn't he just win the fight efficiently without all the drama? He reminds me of the present-day LA Lakers who slack off the entire regular season, knowing that they only really have to work during the playoffs.This gag would have been an effective if it was restricted to only happening in the film's climatic finale. Instead, to top the earlier fights, the tournament's final match really got to be a disappointment. The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.Anyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.

Meanwhile John & the Terminator infiltrate the facility that Sarah is being held in in an effort to save her from the murderous advances of the T-1000 whom she has no idea about in an effort to prevent Skynet from taking place by finding Miles Deisen who is heading up the very project that will spell the doom of mankind.

The action & specials effects set pieces are well shot & caught at all the right angles & due to the films $100,000,000 dollar budget (which almost ruined the studio) everything has been upped here, the special effects are far superior in almost every way, the action is conducted on a much large scale.

ROBERT PATRICK was such a good choice to play the merciless robot, he's so good in fact that despite the fact the special effects are outstanding & the action set pieces very impressive & the story very engaging, I highly doubt the film would have been even half as good without his performance. The special effects seen here despite the fact that the advancement in CGI has grown by leaps & bounds since then are still very impressive, best of all the CGI effects work! they actually serve the story, something that 98% of the Hollywood films that use CGI don't & the action set pieces still put the vast majority of the action movies made these days to shame. The story is very engaging & easy to get hooked into & there's tons more suspense & tension & yet surprisingly the film also shares many touching moments especially the ending where we see the tearful goodbye between John & The Terminator & him & the Terminator bonding while on the road.

ASH encounters some unexpected guests and now everyone must fight for the lives, or become the evil that hunts them.Sam Raimi does an excellent job of keeping us scared in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, with the dead surrounding us. When ASH is alone in the cabin, we are alone in the cabin and every creaking sound we hear feels like it's right beside us. The eery feeling is not as terrifying as the original, because the original was a punch in the face of terror. This one is more of a drench you in the face with blood, instead of a punch. The touch of dark comedy is great. ASH versus his hand is some comic gold and is a great way to give you some breathing room when you're not terrified of what might happen next.The script of course is just one guy in a cabin against the dead, but what makes it different is the great one-liners Swallow This, Groovy. The movie showcases other characters that hold no emotional value to the viewer what so ever. You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed, slammed by the door, kicked, yelled at, while still being stabbed mind you, dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar, but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.The ending to this film sets up the third installment ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is a total turn around from the first two. The cameo of FREDDY'S glove is a classic nod to Craven's work...or a diss, however you look at it. The whole idea of an evil unknown force underneath you in a cellar is scary enough, not to mention the fact that we have to go down there with our hero, who's armed with trademark boomstick and chainsaw.This film holds one of my all time favourite scenes. Can you guess it, it's when Ash saws off his own hand with a psycho laugh, while blood splatters across his face and his laugh slowly grows into agony and screaming.

The story starts in a crowded hovel in New York where an ex-pat Irish family called McCourt live . I'm probably misleading you if I use the word  live  because if that's living I sure don't want to find out what dying must be like . things are so bad that they move back to County Limerick in Ireland . You know that phrase  out of the frying pan into the fire  ? well this happens to the McCourt family , just when you think things can't get any worse they get worse - This happens in every single scene . Some people have criticised Alan Parker's interpretation of THE WALL as being so depressing as to be unwatchable , but compared to this Pink Floyd's rock opera is a musical comedy This doesn't mean that ANGELA'S ASHES should be viewed as being a bad film . Far from it since it's the best movie Parker had made for many years and much of it is down to casting two of Britain's most consistent thespians from that era namely Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle . Carlyle especially gives a great and understated performance as Malachy McCourt one of the most hateful and despicable characters he's ever played . He's by no means the raving psychopath that he played in TRAINSPOTTING but you will hate him none the less . But despite the talent behind and in front of the camera and the attempts at humour which the Celtic race are renowned for you'll probably only want to watch this movie once due to the depressing subject matter .

That isn't to say that it's a good film &#150; it isn't. In fact it fails on nearly all counts. But it still isn't the absolute disaster so many people seem to hysterically claim. That it would fail was an absolute certainty. A cruise liner travelling on an open ocean at around 20mph just isn't going to push the thrill button the way a runaway bus careening around the streets of America at never less than 50mph does it's like staging Die Hard 2 in a one-bedroom flat. And having Sandra Bullock reprise her role as the borderline dippy Annie Potter merely serves as a reminder of the gulf between Speed and Speed 2.When we meet Annie she has dumped Jack Traven because he lives life too much on the edge for her comfort, and taken up with Alex Shaw who, to her surprise, turns out to be as much of a life-edge liver as the hunk she's just dumped. The couple decide on a romantic cruise together to overcome the shock to Annie's system but, this being a sequel, lightning is about to strike twice as they have chosen the exact same cruise on which bonkers John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) has set his sights. Geiger worked for the company that designed the liner's on-board computer system, but was sacked when they discovered he had a weird leech fetish and a violent golf game. Outraged by this injustice, Geiger plans to hijack the liner and ram it into an oil tanker after first relieving it of a load of jewels.The main problem with Speed 2 is that it is almost totally lacking in tension. Only for a period of about thirty-seven seconds as Shaw and the ship's photographer (don't ask) repeatedly dive underwater to do something clever with a wheel to divert the liner from running into the oil tanker is any kind of suspense generated. Willem Dafoe certainly appears to be enjoying himself, but director de Bont really should have asked him to tone his performance down a bit &#150; he flashes those huge gnashers and rolls his eyes like a complete loon which just makes him look ridiculous rather than menacing. He has also written one of those computer programmes that present the kind of screen that only ever appears on Hollywood movies. When I punch the wrong access code into my computer, I get a little grey box about two inches square saying incorrect user password &#150; Hollywood computers get flashing messages in size 24 font dramatically announcing that access is denied. Bullock is relegated to comic relief for much of the film, and is merely another helpless female for the rest &#150; she's also pretty annoying much of the time. Speed was the film that catapulted her onto the A-list and we can only assume there was a clause written into her contract stipulating that she star in any sequel &#150; either that or they offered her a shed-load of cash for which she was prepared to risk her career.Bottom line go into this expecting an average run-of-the-mill action adventure flick and you will probably only be mildly disappointed.

She surprises everyone at first as it's clear she has all her old memories back & is capable of talking. The good news is Ripley has another chance at life. The bad news is so does the Alien beasties that have made her life miserable for the past three instalments. Ripley quickly learns that the aliens are being bred as a possible use to the military. When the creatures get loose, Ripley teams up with the remaining survivors of the ship, as well as those of the ship called Betty that has arrived at the Auriga to escape the ship & head to earth. As the body count quickly mounts, Ripley discovers she has not only some alien DNA in her blood, but also has a psychic connection to the Queen Alien that is hiding in safe seclusion on the ship. To make matters worse the Aliens are much smarter, much more tougher than ever before & not everyone on that ship is who they appear to be either.ALIEN RESURRECTION is a really fun film for fans of the series & is a much better made film than ALIEN 3. The film for the most part in generally well acted, boasts an amazing set design, fun characters, a fun plot, & the direction by JEAN-PIERRE JEUNET is really good too. The alien monster suits are so very well designed & unlike in the previous three films, you don't have to wait to long to see them, in fact we get to see more of the aliens on camera wrecking carnage all over the place fairly early on in the movie, the plot is very interesting for the most part & manages to keep you hooked from beginning to end, with plenty of impressive action set pieces, an amazing & tight knit suspense scene involving the remaining survivors of the ship trying to save themselves by having to go under a submerged part of the ship with two aliens in hot pursuit of them. The film also displays some knowing nods to the original film, there's a couple of musical cues that are similar to The original films & the main ships computer programs name is Father wherein the name of the ships computer was called Mother. The script by JOSS WHEDON is very interesting indeed as he offers up many interesting ideas such as the aliens possibly being used for the good of mankind by taking these deadly predators & using them to fight their enemies, making the aliens smarter & the cloning of humans, androids pretending to be human & used as spies, human\/alien embryo's & the suspense & tension which the series is best known for is all here, as well as the usual alien chest bursting scenes & the film has a pretty neat comic book style look.Not surprisingly like pretty much all films made, ALIEN RESURRECTION does ask one to accept a lot at times, the very fact that the scientist who clone Ripley would not be aware she has alien DNA in her veins resulting in her having acid blood is questionable. The idea of aliens being trained by the scientists to become smarter is fine indeed, but the realistic precaution for everyones safety is somewhat humorously overlooked. We are also never given any true valid reason why an android spy would be on the ship in the first place & the climax which sees an alien sucked into outer space through a small hole in the ship is somewhat hard to accept, given the fact the hole is not big enough to literally pull the creature to pieces, but merely be enough to patch the hole in the ship since the alien is far to big. The film is also very colourful in terms of set design & lighting, but I also felt this took away from the dark, gloomy, grungy look of the previous films & although BRAD DOURIF is great in the role of the head scientist, the sequence of him being wrapped in a cocoon & talking sweetly & dreamily to the half human\/half alien offspring before it chews the top of his head off was silly & seemingly out of place.All in all, despite a few silly shortcomings, I highly recommend ALIEN RESURRECTION! it's a real fun film that although may not be as dark or as good as the first two films are, it's still a pretty impressive effort!

No not that type of voyeurism you dirty lot , I was simply curious to see what someone has to do to break into the world of pornography . You might like to know that an infamous British tabloid used to advertise for what's euphemistically known as  Video models  in its classified column . I had a rough idea what this involved but there was no way I was going to apply but that didn't stop me from wondering why anyone would want to get caught up in this business and after seeing BOOGIE NIGHTS I now know that it's for sad unhappy people desperate to make money This is a sad , haunting , compelling film . Eddie Adams a hustler of sorts works as a dish washer where he has a chance meeting with porn director Jack Horner who eventually makes him a porn star and the film charts the rise and fall of Horner's porn company from the late 70s to early 80s . It's character driven so Anderson has to make his characters sympathetic and memorable . We see the weak willed Little Bill who wife taunts him by having sex with strangers , Buck Swope whose main ambition in life is to open his own hi fi store , Amber Waves who has a drug problem and trouble getting access to her children etc . You certainly may dislike what these characters do but you'll find them gaining your sympathy rather than your hatred due to their sad damaged lives . Being a porn star might sound attractive on the surface , especially before AIDS came along , but it's a career that leads to self destruction Anderson has written a very good script but that's not much use if he can't get the best out of his cast but he succeeds . He has cast very reliable character actors like Julianne Moore , William H Macy , Luis Guzman and John C Reilly who as you can imagine do their best with the script but casting Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds as the two key characters Eddie and Jack seems like professional suicide and amazingly they're both outstanding . I don't think I've seen Reynolds ever give a better performance than the one here and if you just know him via crap like STRIPTEASE prepare to be blown away Obviously this isn't a film to watch with your parents or even with a bunch of friends on a night in . It's not often that Hollywood produces such an intelligent film and it's a pity that BOOGIE NIGHTS seems to have been a victim of poor timing where it was released in between LA CONFIDENTIAL and TITANIC ensuring that it missed out on more critical acclaim and awards . It did pick up three Oscar nominations but it deserved so much more . Perhaps the Academy didn't want to spoil the 27 year old Anderson with too many nominations at such a tender age ?
