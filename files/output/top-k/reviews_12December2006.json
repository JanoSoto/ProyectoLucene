[{"date":"12 December 2006","score":"","review":" SOILERSI was really impressed by Shrek. I was expecting a corny computer-animated film like all the others out there, but I really like this film. It had really good jokes and a good story. It also had some big stars, like Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz. It had very good computer-animation in it. I also like all the fairy tale creatures in it.An ogre named Shrek lives in a swamp. He meets a donkey named Donkey. One day every fairy tale creature is living in his swamp. They came for they were banished by Lord Farquaad;. Shrek and Donkey go to the Kingdom to tell Farquaad that they want the creatures out of Shrek's swamp. He tells them if they can save Princess Fiona from a dragon, the creatures will go. They go on a journey to rescue her. They do. The dragon falls in love with Donkey on the way. They head back to the Kingdom. Donkey then finds out that Fiona turns into an Ogre everyday at sunset. They get back to the Kingdom. Farquaad tries to marry Fiona at sunset. Shrek and Donkey come at sunset. Fiona turns into an Ogre. Farquaad doesn't want to marry her. Shrek and Fiona kiss, and she turns into an Ogre forever. The dragon eats Farquaad.Overall, this is a fantastic computer-animated film. It has great voice-acting and a great twist on a fairy-tale. I also like the music video at the end. The only problem that I had was it got a little boring every now and then and Robin Hood was incredibly annoying. Even Donkey was painfully annoying at times. Anyway, this is a excellent film that everyone will like.8\/10Recommended Films Shrek Two. ","genre":null},{"date":"12 December 2006","score":"","review":" SOILERSI was really impressed by Shrek.
