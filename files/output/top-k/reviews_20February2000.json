I didn't necessarily buy it as the definitive Gen-X movie or anything, but it still offered up a feast of pleasures Wynona Ryder (who I don't normally like) at her sexiest and most appealing, a quirky and irreverent script, a *great* soundtrack, and the projection of a real lived-in feel amongst the main group of friends. Their hanging-out and their conversations with each other felt very genuine and unforced, and reminded me of times I'd spent with my own friends. People who criticize the film for just showing young people sitting around forget not only how much of life (even the enjoyable parts) is spent doing nothing particularly momentous, but equally how difficult it is to capture that elusive, just-sitting-around quality on film. Heck, I even thought Ethan Hawke was terrific (although this was due more to my inability to get over the fact that it was the same actor who played the nervous, uptight kid in Dead Poet's Society).Looking at it today, though. . . . well, I still like it, but I can see more clearly a lot of its flaws and why many people (particularly those of my age group, i.e. the Gen-Xers) didn't like it. It is a bit too self-important, and many of its moments feel forced. The romantic triangle aspect of the movie seems more like a gimmick to propel the action than as an idea anyone could seriously get behind. I'm still totally captivated by Ryder in this movie (weird, because I almost never care for her otherwise), but it feels wrong that she should end up with *either* of these two guys. Hawke and she have a believable and appealing chemistry, but he's really too much of a poster boy for Slacker-hood to be taken seriously as a romantic prospect. And Ben Stiller as the corporate yuppie is just too dweeby and annoying. His performance is the big weak link in the movie; he takes what could have been (and seems written as) an interesting, double-edged character of personal charm but deep insecurity, and turns him into a one-dimensional nerd whose tics and mannerisms grow increasingly more grating.And yet, there's just too many good things in this movie to write it off. The scenes with John Mahoney as the daytime talk show host - hilarious! Ryder's conferences with her clueless parents (I love when her mother, played as a perfect ditz by Swoosie Kurtz, lovingly calls her daughter sugar booger); any scene with Janeane Garofalo or Steven Zahn in it (this movie introduced me to both these actors, and I've enjoyed them more and more ever since); and, most memorably, the hilarious butchering that Ryder's student film receives at the hands of MTV. That scene makes me laugh uncontrollably every time I see it. It demonstrates Ben Stiller's greatest ability as a director a profound media savvy and an ability to satirize not only television, but any form of pre-fabricated culture. His jaundiced yet playful eye takes in everything from Melrose Place to psychic hot-lines, Gap outlet stores and 7-11 Big Gulps and posits them as the type of cultural detritus that, for good or bad, a generation has come to view the world through. Nothing as coherent as a statement comes out of all this, but the film does provide an enjoyable fun-house mirror through which a certain segment of the population can find itself reflected, if perhaps imperfectly.So, yeah, not the film to end all films (and the worse for sometimes looking like that's what it's trying for), but certainly good for a few self-referential chuckles, and an appealing (if a bit slovenly) cast of characters to spend the evening with.

In that sense it is a scathing social commentary. The style is big, bold and very intense, making it the perfect representative of 1990's cinema.The plot, which at times resembles a wild bucking horse, is driven forwards by the two lead characters, Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), as they blaze across the desert of southern USA (on 'Highway 666') leaving a trail of bodies behind them. Their motivation is never fully explored, though it is revealed that both were traumatically abused by their parents as children. Perhaps they are seeking revenge against a world that has long tortured them, or maybe the demons which were created within them are merely being released. Whatever the motivation, the result is 50 dead ('52, but I'm not counting').The tale of Micky and Mallory Knox is adopted and hyped into a frenzy by the media, primarily narcissistic TV presenter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jnr), star of American Maniacs, itself a sick parody of the plague of television series' that cash in on the 'morbidity\/human suffering factor'. It is here that Stone lays the weight of his message, that the media brought the exploits of the Knox couple to national attention and to an extent made their actions allowable. Public response to the Knox's polarises into those that want Mickey and Mallory fried and those that want to actually BE the killers. Eventually the couple are captured by police in one of the most spectacular scenes I have ever seen, climaxing in a dramatic parallel to the King beating.As the story continues Stone expounds upon a further theme during the live interview between Wayne and Mickey, that of 'pre-destination' (for want of a better word), though Mickey does not elaborate upon this. To do so would slow the pace down too greatly. Stone does return to this second theme throughout the prison riot chapter but the lightening pace of things leaves the audience with little time to fully comprehend it.Watching 'NBK' is a audio-visual treat, simply like none other I have ever seen (though 'Wild At Heart' would come the closest). Stone uses pretty well all possible types of film stock available from 35mm through to Camcorder and even animated comics. It was a dangerous gamble, but the 11 month period it took to edit the footage has resulted in a flawless visual and audio masterpiece. There is not one cut that I would change at all in 'NBK', from the menacing opening titles to the closing rolling credits. On top of the visual eyecandy (filters, digital effects, etc) are the credited 50-or-so song audio soundtrack. Music constantly accompanies the visuals, flicking from song to song as the pace demands. The two minute intro credit scene alone contains about a dozen song tracks. Many have described 'NBK' as boring and tedious. I am a little unsure what to make of these criticisms as I barely blinked in the first hour (and I KNOW I didn't blink at all in the second). The pace is rollercoaster fast and the visuals kept my eyes glued to the screen at all times. If people got nothing from the message the least 'NBK' gave them was one hell of a ride. In short, the visuals are impeccable, the shots never held for more than a few seconds (in fact, come the live interview, shots that are held for a line seem eternal), and the music brilliantly accompanies the action and pace.I feel it necessary to comment on the violence in the movie, as there have been many comments directed to the excessive amount of it. I beg to differ. There is very little gore in 'NBK' (well, the standard release anyway). There is violence ever-present throughout the movie, though usually it involves one of the characters shooting a victim off-screen. Occasionally there are flickers of gore, for example as Mickey and Mallory drive past a barn a photo of a badly damaged head is superimposed over the barn wall for perhaps a second. Yes, this is quite disturbing and I sure would rather not see it, but it has to be said that there are a plethora commercially released movies with more graphic on-screen violence, such as the face-transplant scene in 'Face\/Off'. Maybe one of the reasons why 'NBK' caused so much stir over the violent content (despite the R rating) was that it didn't glorify violence. For example in 'NBK' a dead human was not a symbol of freedom ('Braveheart', 'Saving Private Ryan') or someone who suffered a slapstick death ('Commando', even complete with comedy line 'let off some steam'), instead a dead human was merely that a carcass, devoid of life or emotion. We are so used to seeing violence portrayed in a humorous (ie. 'Home Alone 1, 2 & 3', 'Denace the Menace') or vengenceful (ie. 'The Rock', 'Falling Down') manner that a movie that portrays violence with truth is found shocking and controversial. The violence in 'NBK' is a commentary of the state of modern USA, not a cheap attraction to win over audiences (which is far more noble than most other movies can boast).I personally think it all works. At the end of the movie I was left stunned at what I had seen. I showed the movie to my father and we sat and talked about it for some time. 'NBK' is not a satire, comedy, thriller, action or a piece of trash, it is a social commentary. It is a critical observation of modern American society.

In that sense it is a scathing social commentary. The style is big, bold and very intense, making it the perfect representative of 1990's cinema.The plot, which at times resembles a wild bucking horse, is driven forwards by the two lead characters, Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis), as they blaze across the desert of southern USA (on 'Highway 666') leaving a trail of bodies behind them. Their motivation is never fully explored, though it is revealed that both were traumatically abused by their parents as children. Perhaps they are seeking revenge against a world that has long tortured them, or maybe the demons which were created within them are merely being released. Whatever the motivation, the result is 50 dead ('52, but I'm not counting').The tale of Micky and Mallory Knox is adopted and hyped into a frenzy by the media, primarily narcissistic TV presenter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jnr), star of American Maniacs, itself a sick parody of the plague of television series' that cash in on the 'morbidity\/human suffering factor'. It is here that Stone lays the weight of his message, that the media brought the exploits of the Knox couple to national attention and to an extent made their actions allowable. Public response to the Knox's polarises into those that want Mickey and Mallory fried and those that want to actually BE the killers. Eventually the couple are captured by police in one of the most spectacular scenes I have ever seen, climaxing in a dramatic parallel to the King beating.As the story continues Stone expounds upon a further theme during the live interview between Wayne and Mickey, that of 'pre-destination' (for want of a better word), though Mickey does not elaborate upon this. To do so would slow the pace down too greatly. Stone does return to this second theme throughout the prison riot chapter but the lightening pace of things leaves the audience with little time to fully comprehend it.Watching 'NBK' is a audio-visual treat, simply like none other I have ever seen (though 'Wild At Heart' would come the closest). Stone uses pretty well all possible types of film stock available from 35mm through to Camcorder and even animated comics. It was a dangerous gamble, but the 11 month period it took to edit the footage has resulted in a flawless visual and audio masterpiece. There is not one cut that I would change at all in 'NBK', from the menacing opening titles to the closing rolling credits. On top of the visual eyecandy (filters, digital effects, etc) are the credited 50-or-so song audio soundtrack. Music constantly accompanies the visuals, flicking from song to song as the pace demands. The two minute intro credit scene alone contains about a dozen song tracks. Many have described 'NBK' as boring and tedious. I am a little unsure what to make of these criticisms as I barely blinked in the first hour (and I KNOW I didn't blink at all in the second). The pace is rollercoaster fast and the visuals kept my eyes glued to the screen at all times. If people got nothing from the message the least 'NBK' gave them was one hell of a ride. In short, the visuals are impeccable, the shots never held for more than a few seconds (in fact, come the live interview, shots that are held for a line seem eternal), and the music brilliantly accompanies the action and pace.I feel it necessary to comment on the violence in the movie, as there have been many comments directed to the excessive amount of it. I beg to differ. There is very little gore in 'NBK' (well, the standard release anyway). There is violence ever-present throughout the movie, though usually it involves one of the characters shooting a victim off-screen. Occasionally there are flickers of gore, for example as Mickey and Mallory drive past a barn a photo of a badly damaged head is superimposed over the barn wall for perhaps a second. Yes, this is quite disturbing and I sure would rather not see it, but it has to be said that there are a plethora commercially released movies with more graphic on-screen violence, such as the face-transplant scene in 'Face\/Off'. Maybe one of the reasons why 'NBK' caused so much stir over the violent content (despite the R rating) was that it didn't glorify violence. For example in 'NBK' a dead human was not a symbol of freedom ('Braveheart', 'Saving Private Ryan') or someone who suffered a slapstick death ('Commando', even complete with comedy line 'let off some steam'), instead a dead human was merely that a carcass, devoid of life or emotion. We are so used to seeing violence portrayed in a humorous (ie. 'Home Alone 1, 2 & 3', 'Denace the Menace') or vengenceful (ie. 'The Rock', 'Falling Down') manner that a movie that portrays violence with truth is found shocking and controversial. The violence in 'NBK' is a commentary of the state of modern USA, not a cheap attraction to win over audiences (which is far more noble than most other movies can boast).I personally think it all works. At the end of the movie I was left stunned at what I had seen. I showed the movie to my father and we sat and talked about it for some time. 'NBK' is not a satire, comedy, thriller, action or a piece of trash, it is a social commentary. It is a critical observation of modern American society.

Trainspotting, Figment's finest work, was also an adaptation of a cult novel, so I felt convinced that John Hodge (screenplay writer) would do a great job.  And I also felt that Leonardo was right for the role of Richard; and let's not forget, a great actor.  The trailers were wonderful the cinematography appeared stunning, and the soundtrack sounded awesome.So, on the opening night, there I was, expecting something wonderful.  And sadly, I was disappointed.  The film starts well, there's no denying it. For the first ten minutes or so I thought I was safe.  But after that, it just went downhill.  Yes, the cinematography, and indeed the cast, were as beautiful as the trailer promised.  And yes, the soundtrack was superb - Porcelain, noteably.  However, all the subtleties of character and complicated group dynamics which rendered the book so fascinating were totally removed.  Rather than opting for an intelligent adaptation of the book, Figment had gone for a grossly over-simplistic sex-on-the-beach story.I don't blame Danny Boyle (director).  He does a fairly good job, and there are moments in the film which undeniably capture the spirit of the novel. I blame John Hodge, who I know is capable of so much more.  But Trainspotting was written for a British audience for reasons of artistic merit.  The Beach was written to keep Fox and Leonardo DiCaprio happy.  Their target audience was not cynical British fans of the book, such as myself, but for a worldwide market, and Leo's fans.  But I still feel they should have struck more of a balance.Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film.  From the interviews with Leo that I read, he seemed to understand his character in the book very well.  And the first and last handful of scenes are just right.  Maybe I was wrong to expect Figment to be able to condense everything in the book into a film that wouldn't last about two and a half hours, with rambling voiceovers and the like, but I think if Figment were still making films for a small audience, and not trying to please the masses, this is what they would have done.  But having said that, if they were doing that, it's unlikely they could have afforded to do what they have.  So it's a no-win situation.

All I wanted was a few slightly suspenseful scenes, a decent line or two and some great visuals. I didn't even get that.The main problem with the film (and it really is hard to pick out a 'main' one) was this - sharks are scary for 2 reasons(a)  they're big, dumb, killing machines; and(b) they live in the ocean &#150; a place that they are well adapted to, and that we are not.Deep Blue Sea did its very best to destroy these principles.  For a start, the sharks were &#145;smart.'  Maybe it's just me, but the idea of a clever, scheming shark, carefully plotting my downfall, doesn't scare me &#150; it makes me giggle.  A lot of this stems from the fact that they don't have HANDS. Every time they do something clever, they have to execute it with their noses &#150; eg butting open doors, ramming into cameras etc &#150; it's not terrifying, it's comical.Secondly, the sharks are taken out of their element and placed inside a flooded building.  There is NOTHING scary about watching a fin hoon up and down a corridor and jump out from behind doors etc.  It's just silly.The other significant problem was that the script was aimed at ten year olds.  Let me give you some examples (without giving away any of the 'plot') -(1) We are told (in one particularly memorable scene) that the sharks' brains contained a substance that could help cure Altzheimers disease.  To get more of the substance, the team spends millions of dollars genetically altering the sharks to increase the size of their brains (of course, it would have been much easier just to breed LOTS of the sharks, but what the hell - lets concentrate on making 5 or 6 of them huge).Anyway, the team is 'shocked' to discover that a side effect of increasing the sharks' brains is that they become more intelligent.  Side effect???? Side effect????  Surely this is a DIRECT effect?  You're telling me they didn't even SUSPECT something like that might happen?  Just where did these 'scientists' get their degrees?(2) At the start of the film, the scientists demonstrate how the 'substance' cures Altzheimers.  Now, you'd expect the use of some sophisticated technology here.  The substance would need to be extracted, modified, purified, mixed with other substances, bombarded with radiation or heat maybe, and finally administered to a patient.Or at least, you'd THINK so wouldn't you?   But no.  In this film, they just stick a syringe into a live shark's head, extract some goo and then squeeze it onto a diseased piece of brain.  I mean, for God's sake!  Even an IMBECILE must know that cures for diseases are rarely just sucked out of an animal and then 'sprayed' onto the sick and dying.I KNOW this isn't meant to be an intelligent film and I'm just meant to appreciate it for the action and the effects, but did it have to be THIS dumb.(3)   Probably the single dumbest aspect of the script (an award which was fiercely contested) was the way in which sharks were caught early in the film.  5 sharks are kept in a big underwater cage.  Every now and then they need to catch one and drain the goo from their brain.  Now, this is a multi-million dollar facility and some of the world's finest minds have supposedly had a part in planning it.  So how do they go about catching a one?  A guy swims in with the killer sharks (and we're not talking about a one off here, this is &#145;standard procedure'), narrowly avoids getting killed and at the last moment pokes a tranquilising dart into them.  Come on!  Who thought of that?!?!?  At one point they even &#145;show off' this technique to investors in the project.  They all sit around nervously twiddling their thumbs and watching the 50\/50 outcome &#150;`and&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.he made it!  Woo hoo!  That Sir, is the way we go about catching the sharks.  We lose a guy every couple of weeks, but it's the best method we've come up with.  So, do you want to invest in our project?'Some other, more specific comments - the effects weren't bad, but weren't nearly good enough to compensate for the abysmal script- the film is never, ever scary or suspensful- LL Cool J (who played &#145;Comic Relief') cannot act AT ALL.- Saffron Burrows (who plays the standard &#145;stunningly gorgeous marine biologist who, when the going gets tough, gets her gear off) obviously learnt everything she knows about acting from LL Cool J- Jacqueline McKenzie's character was DREADFUL.  I've never wanted to see someone get eaten more than her (and she was playing a &#145;good guy').- even Samuel Jackson couldn't rise above the rubbish that was written for him.All in all, this film is a disgrace.  If you haven't seen it, please DON'T. It's time people (myself included) stopped ponying up the dough on films like this and FORCED film makers to come up with better scripts.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"20 February 2000","score":"","review":"  If you'd like to know whether you'd enjoy this film, just ask yourself the following question -Do you find the idea of genetically engineered 'super sharks' that can read maps, make plans, analyse architectural data, disable security systems, and YET (when convenient) fail to distinguish between a human being and a fire extinguisher, frightening or just plain stupid?I opted for the latter.I certainly didn't expect much from this film.  All I wanted was a few slightly suspenseful scenes, a decent line or two and some great visuals. I didn't even get that.The main problem with the film (and it really is hard to pick out a 'main' one) was this - sharks are scary for 2 reasons(a)  they're big, dumb, killing machines; and(b) they live in the ocean &#150; a place that they are well adapted to, and that we are not.Deep Blue Sea did its very best to destroy these principles.  For a start, the sharks were &#145;smart.'  Maybe it's just me, but the idea of a clever, scheming shark, carefully plotting my downfall, doesn't scare me &#150; it makes me giggle.  A lot of this stems from the fact that they don't have HANDS. Every time they do something clever, they have to execute it with their noses &#150; eg butting open doors, ramming into cameras etc &#150; it's not terrifying, it's comical.Secondly, the sharks are taken out of their element and placed inside a flooded building.  There is NOTHING scary about watching a fin hoon up and down a corridor and jump out from behind doors etc.  It's just silly.The other significant problem was that the script was aimed at ten year olds.  Let me give you some examples (without giving away any of the 'plot') -(1) We are told (in one particularly memorable scene) that the sharks' brains contained a substance that could help cure Altzheimers disease.  To get more of the substance, the team spends millions of dollars genetically altering the sharks to increase the size of their brains (of course, it would have been much easier just to breed LOTS of the sharks, but what the hell - lets concentrate on making 5 or 6 of them huge).Anyway, the team is 'shocked' to discover that a side effect of increasing the sharks' brains is that they become more intelligent.  Side effect???? Side effect????  Surely this is a DIRECT effect?  You're telling me they didn't even SUSPECT something like that might happen?  Just where did these 'scientists' get their degrees?(2) At the start of the film, the scientists demonstrate how the 'substance' cures Altzheimers.  Now, you'd expect the use of some sophisticated technology here.  The substance would need to be extracted, modified, purified, mixed with other substances, bombarded with radiation or heat maybe, and finally administered to a patient.Or at least, you'd THINK so wouldn't you?

His marriage with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) has gradually turned lifeless, and he has a difficult parental relationship with his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). All that occupies his dull daily thoughts are his fantasies about Jane's best friend, the sexual predator, Angela (Mena Suvari).

The strangely obsessive Ricky and the repressed Jane; Carolyn and her real estate rival, the King; and our hero Lester, with Angela.But this is only the most basic of plot descriptions.

So I bet your saying seen one, seen 'em all. Well don't be quick to judge this movie. There are a lot of different elements that come into play that I think work well to keep you on edge and guessing.You probably already know the plot so I'll skip that part. The opening crash landing of the Hunter-Gratzner is well done. All the characters come together to take stock in their situation. Right at this point, their biggest concerns are finding water and the escaped criminal Riddick. Very soon it becomes apparent that Riddick is the least of their worries.I 'm not going to disclose anymore story details because I think that anything else would take away the question of what do they do now?I liked the characters and appreciated the little twists of appearances can be deceiving atmosphere that slowly developes. Even Vin Diesel's character of Riddick could easily be played over the top in so many different ways - to the point of annoying distraction - but that doesn't happen. You'll end up liking him without a doubt.The SFX is about what you would expect for a movie of this type. The planet's indigenous life forms are mostly CGI rendered and I think were designed by Patrick Tatapolous - of GODZILLA fame. They are nasty creatures and with the addition of lightning fast speed, they have voracious appetites for crash survivors. My only complaint about the movie isSPOILER ALERTThere are thousands of these creatures out roaming the planet during the eclipse.

I preferably like to see just about anything with Bruce Willis, some are a huge hit (The Sixth Sense, Die Hard) while some are a huge miss (Striking Distance).  This turned out to play a lot different than I expected.  I was happy to walk out of the theatre liking it a lot, but it wasn't Bruce Willis that stole the show.The two that will stick in your mind after viewing this film are Matthew Perry and Amanda Peet.  Michael Clark Duncan and Bruce Willis (also not to forget Kevin Polluck in a small role) do a great job but every scene that Matthew Perry and Amanda Peet are in they steel the show.  Both are very different, Matthew Perry is the more goofy sense of humor played with perfection while Amanda Peet just does so much with her character from being a complete bimbo to being incredibly charming.  You just have to see her role played to understand how great her performance is, especially with some of those dumb little smiles she makes.The story is relatively simple and complex at the same time.  A hit man moves next door, neighbor wants other hit men to hit him - while his wife wants to hire the hit man next door or just about any hit man to kill her husband - while the hit man next door has a friend hit man to keep an eye all of them.  See what I mean?  There's a lot going on but it's just a film where you are more happy to just lay back and watch the fun instead of taking note.  There are just so many scenes in the film that everyone will find funny that it will require a few extra viewings to pick up on everything.To explain the film in a sentence - think of Grosse Pointe Blank without John Cusack (meaning not nearly as fast with jokes) filled to the top with different styles of humor while combining it with a little bit of action.  It's a film entirely about it's cast, if someone else played Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, or Amanda Peet it would not nearly be the same.

Similarly,  Stigmata created villains within the Church hierarchy with relative ease.  The hard part is making some sense of what motivates priests and nuns to carry on in spite of this undeserved negativism.  That's what makes The Third Miracle a joy to watch - a film that goes beyond stereotypes and biases to try to find answers.  There is something in this film that believers and non-believers can take away from even though The Third Miracle has decidedly taken a strong stand about matters of faith.  The linking of a wayward postulator, Father Frank, searching to legitimize a common woman for sainthood, with his own personal search for God is very effective.  Equally so is how the film shows the powerful role of secularism in the lives of men we call 'holy' (can it be any more obvious than the Bishop's mud bath?).  A stroke of trickery at the end doesn't spoil the way this film invites us to consider faith as truly an all-or-nothing proposition.  Certainly for Father Frank, the invitation to faith and to his own priesthood was based on a shaky bargain with God to spare the life of his father. For Roxane, the daughter of Helen O'Reagan, the decision to exclude God was equally as capricious - that God would take her mother away from her just because she had to do God's work.  For Archbishop Werner, the God he defends and the God he internalizes are two different beings - one who is all knowing and all powerful, the other who cannot see beyond things black and white.  The Third Miracle, then, is not just about canonizing a dead woman, a holy housewife, but about how these three living players interact and struggle with each other to arrive at their own faith.  This interaction is played out so well due to brilliant performances by Anne Heche, Ed Harris, and Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Miracles strengthen one's faith but the visible miracles are more likely to move those who need a sign to believe.  The irony of Father Frank is that he was instructed to disprove the very extraordinary acts of faith which he desperately needed to save his own spiritual life.  It took him two hours, the length of this film, to find his miracle.  The Third Miracle leaves us with a similar challenge, how long will it take for us to find that same miracle, that same faith.

And I know I won't give too much away when I say it has what I consider a happy ending (for me that means like...satisfactory closure). This, an original american tale by english director Sam Mendes. Watching the first 20 minutes the story seemed to follow a formulaic line regarding dysfunctional families, etc etc. I kept waiting for the inevitable plot developments to kick in except the formula didnt follow its usual route much to my surprise and the rest of the audience too I suspect. There are worthy performances all round here and both Spacey & Benning have recieved worthy mention.

Maybe that's why, as a non-American, I like this one so much, for the focus of the film is not Wayne's rugged cowboy, but James Stewart's liberal, modern, lawyer. Much of the ground covered in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance had been considered before. The history of the homesetters and the legitimacy of their claims against the men who had originally tamed the area was covered in Shane, while the arrival of an Eastern softie in the wildman's West was already a well-trodden path (eg Dallas), but by trading grand cinematic shot-making for characterisation and personal detail, John Ford went a step beyond those films in terms of even-handedness and depth of understanding. A film like Shane provided only clues as to how the West was turned into proper mass-settlement, the message effectively being by a combination of honest toil and honourable violence. On the face of it, Liberty Valance had the same combination, but with a new and much more revealing emphasis on the role of legal and political institutions, and, most importantly of all, of railroads. What takes Liberty Valance a level beyond, however, is its sense of ambiguity. Which is the more sympathetic - Stewart's noble but naive humanity or Wayne's equally noble (but beautifully unglamourised) hard cynicism? So many aspects of the film represent its uncertainty on this one key point, and almost all resurface in the final scene. If the film has two main aspects in its double-header between Stewart and Wayne, the first concerns their values and the second their relationship with Hallie. In the final scene we see both. We see Stewart's two-fold sense of guilt at having compromised his beliefs and then taken the credit not only for someone else's deed, but for an act to which he is naturally opposed, and we see the sadness and remaining uncertainty in Hallie. The impression remains that she might have made the wrong choice, emphasised by the resignation in Stewart when he asks her about the cactus rose. Throughout the film, although we sympathise with Wayne, it is natural to support Stewart's inadvertent romance - he is more youthful, and can open her eyes in ways which the old cowboy cannot. Yet, at the end, the question remains, was she any happier? Does an honest, real working life, living by the tenets of common sense, offer more than intellectual fulfillment, expanded horizons and being true to abstracts of right and wrong? Did any of the three main characters get it right? All of them end the film less certain, and probably less happy than they were at the outset, but was there anyway for them to have avoided making the choice? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance gives no definitive answers, but it asks the questions in comprehensive style.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"20 February 2000","score":"","review":"  The first thing I have to say is that I haven't read Alex Garland's cult novel of the same name.  The second thing to say is that, on the film's merit alone, this is an entertaining movie. Much was expected of this movie, based upon the popularity of the novel, the talent of director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) and the adverse publicity attracted about the supposed destruction of  Thailand's natural habitat.  The movie starts off as a travel story - the wide-eyed and idealistic backpacker Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) discovering the wild and untamed Thailand.  Practically as soon as he arrives, he is confronted by the drugged-out Daffy (Robert Carlyle) - who we soon learn was one of the founder members of the Beach.  He gives Richard a map to this isolated paradise island, which he duly follows - apparently unperturbed by Daffy's violent suicide. Richard manages to rope in a lusted-after, pretty French girl (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend (Guillaume Canet) to accompany him on his adventure.  But after making the obligatory treacherous journey, they find that the paradise they arrive to is very different to what they imagined. From the start, there is a hint of imperfection.  Soon this escalates, as they notice that the island's leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton), has a rather dictatorial rule over them. However, the plot isn't much to write home about, and from what I've heard, not a patch on the book either.  For instance, the chapter when Richard descends into madness is poorly scripted and gives the impression that Boyle is trying to be too surreal for his own good.  DiCaprio's narrative is also uninspired and therefore rather ineffective. However, this is not what I gave the film 8\/10 for.  As a 'rehash' of a very cliched story - a false perfection - The Beach tells it quite well. The setting and scenery is beautiful, including one of the best long zoom-out shot I have ever seen.  I was disappointed to see that the film did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.  Leonardo DiCaprio also acts very well in this movie, proving that he is not just there to satisfy the hormonal rages of adolescent girls.  In my opinion, DiCaprio is probably one of the most talented actors of his generation around today. He is also well supported by the French duo, previously practically unheard of in the UK. This film is also very funny - although some jokes tend to be too obviously for comic relief - if not witty.  The Beach gives good entertainment value for money, despite being a bit too slow paced, and the image of the paradise shown will linger on in your minds.  Boyle's direction, as for so many of his films, is style over substance - and this time, it just about succeeds.
