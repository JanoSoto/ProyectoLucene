His crew is made up of a studio lot flunky (Kennedy), four illegal Mexican immigrants, a not-so-innocent young starlet, and several other hangers on. Kennedy is the only one of the crew initially in on the fact that Murphy's character will not know he's the star of the film they are shooting. In a stroke of luck, they find Murphy's nerdy brother (also played perfectly by Murphy) to use in scenes where a close up of his face will not be needed.Obviously, this idea is ridiculous, but the film is so well directed, that you almost for a second believe it might be able to work for a while. Martin, who wrote the script, knows all too well that Hollywood is an institution always ripe for satire.

The $40 million boondoggle has drawn the ire of critics ever since it sent United Artists into the red, and most of the criticism appears warranted.Michael Cimino rose to fame with his Vietnam war film The Deer Hunter. Although I found that film grossly overrated, it still stands as a good film. You could see some of the excesses of Heaven's Gate festering in the Deer Hunter, though. A wedding scene early in that film drags on and on, for example. Nearly all of Heaven's Gate is like that scene. But not only is it too long and poorly-filmed, you also have to strain to hear most of the dialog. Heaven's Gate becomes an endurance test as the three and a half hour epic staggers on to one hopeless scene after another. Cimino hasn't done much since, and after viewing this film, it isn't hard to see why.Much of the story deals with a principled lawman played by Kris Kristofferson and his attempts to protect a slew of new immigrants from ruthless cattle barons in 1890 Johnson County, Wyoming. Some of the film is loosely based on actual historical events, but that's hardly a reason to sit through it. The plot is needlessly bogged down by a love triangle between Kristofferson, a local madame, and Christopher Walken who is mostly aligned with the cattlemen. Taking out the love story would have been the most logical way to improve the film, but there are plenty of other things that doom this one.First of all, the film is poorly photographed. Everything is too darkish-yellow and under-lit. Perhaps they were going for the look of an old-fashioned photograph. The last person I'd probably blame was the cinematographer. He's a legend in the business, and most of his other films look very good. Clouds of dust and smoke obscure many of the scenes. Even a wisp of smoke from a tiny chimney seems to get in the way of the action in some shots. A battle scene at the end that almost seemed compelling is lost in what appears to be a biblical sandstorm. Another problem this film has is with sound. A fair estimate would put 30% of the dialog as being nearly impossible to hear. Did they not think of using voice-overs in post production? What happened? Characters appear and disappear for long periods of time. John Hurt is always appreciated, but he's never on screen long enough for the audience to really grasp who his character even is, for example. Some scenes drag on too long, and others look like they wandered in from different movies. What on Earth was up with that huge rollerskating scene? I didn't even know they were invented back then. Maybe the scene is actually an outtake from Roller Boogie, Skatetown USA, or Xanadu. Did Cimino need to include rollerskating just because it was so popular in 1980?? About the only good things this film has going for it is decent music, and some good shoot-outs. That's about it. The film tries to champion the rights of immigrants, but ends up doing nothing more than condescending to them. Any real message in the film is lost in its technical incompetence, and poor pacing. A Western is not a good genre for a film that takes itself so seriously. What a waste of talent! 3 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Few films have the ability to grab your attention quite like this one. No matter what age you were when you first saw it, the film most likely changed the way you look at cinema. I would still give a slight edge to 2001 as far as which is Kubrick's best, but it's a photo finish.Our story centers around a mischievous young gang leader and the attempt by society to change him into a model citizen through the means of chemically squelching his violent or lusty desires. The first act shows how ruthless the young man named Alex and his droogs are, and some of the trouble they get into. We see how disrespectful he is toward his parents, and society in general. After a dispute over control of his gang, he finds himself solely responsible for the death of a woman. Alex is sentenced to a considerable length of time in jail, and soon he volunteers to participate in a new experiment designed to curb people's lust for sex and violence. We are never quite sure if he really wants to be good as he claims, or if he just wants out of jail. After two years as a model prisoner and some considerable sucking up to the prison Chaplain, Alex is cleared for the treatment. Little does he or anyone else seem to realize (except maybe the Chaplain) just how helpless the treatment will make him back in the outside world.The film, though made with a paltry budget, is a technical wonder. Kubrick once again mixes sight and sound like the master he was. The futuristic world these characters live in looks like a fully amplified version of 1971. Tacky, but kind of beautiful. The stylized dialect these characters talk with will be ringing in your ears well after the film is over. The film contains numerous rape and assault scenes that can still be somewhat off-putting even if you've seen the film a dozen times. It's easy to see why this film was pulled from distribution in England for so many years. Even by today's standards, the violent acts may seem graphic.The most amazing thing about the film is Malcolm McDowell. As Kubrick himself has stated, this film really couldn't have been made without him. His performance as Alex is on par with some of the best acting even done in movies. What's most amazing is how he can create such a lecherous character and then make him almost sympathetic in some scenes. Especially as he refers to the audience as his only friends once he's sent to prison. You almost feel sorry for him even though he probably deserves a much more severe punishment. Once he has been brainwashed of all his violent and sexual tendencies, Alex invokes nothing but pity. He cannot even fight off an elderly mugging victim who remembers him from years earlier. To top things off, two of his former gang members have become cops and now take pleasure in beating him up and leaving him for dead in the country. His parents don't seem to want him back, either.After all is said and done, we learn that people just cannot live without their animal instincts and free will. The treatment was most-likely scrapped after what happened to Alex, and hopefully society was able to find a more successful way to deal with their crime problem.The film is amazing in any way a film can be. No DVD collection is complete without it! If you haven't seen it, then for goodness sakes get to your local video store and see what you've been missing!!!! 10 of 10 stars from the Hound.

This film is not only Stanley Kubrick's first acclaimed film, but it is also credited with inventing the concept of non-linear story telling for the film industry. Some recent films that have used this technique are Reservior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Go, Wonderland and The Usual Suspects.The story deals with a motley crew of assorted criminals, inside men, and average joes just looking to get their hands on a large sum of money by stealing it from a racetrack. Sterling Hayden plays Johnny Clay, a hardened criminal who just finished serving a five-year prison sentence. He is the ringleader of the bunch who is determined to only go for the big heists from now on. He figures they can put you away for stealing ten dollars as easily as ten million, so what have you got to lose? The rest of the crew are mostly average people with average problems, as Clay explains early on. Some of them work at the track. One is a crooked cop. Two are hardened criminals added at the last minute to cause diversions. Everything has been timed and planned out to the letter. Of course in a film like this, things never go as planned. It wouldn't be entertaining if they did.The killing was made on a budget of well below half a million dollars, and it shows. The film looks cheap at times, but the story is more than enough to make you forgive its financial shortcomings. The acting is nothing too special. Hayden is strong and resourceful as Johnny Clay, but he's pretty wooden. Elisha Cook Jr. is pretty good as a hen-pecked husband who is taking part in the scheme to impress his high-maintenance wife. If this film were re-cast today, you'd have to think of William H. Macy to play this character. Timothy Carey is always memorable, even with such a small part like the one he has here. Such a strange-looking guy! He gets the most interesting assignment of all the people in on the heist.You can really tell this was made fifty years ago. Even though there are hardened criminals and low-lifes in nearly every scene, nobody ever says the F-word! There is, however, a fairly gory shootout in one scene which you normally didn't find in films back then. The killing was ahead of its time in more ways than one, I guess.

Warren Beatty spent many years of his life putting this project together, and the result is a fine film that will stand the test of time. The plot, at its core, is simple enough. It's just a great big love story. Beatty plays John Reed, a left-leaning American journalist who finds himself caught up in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. At the same time, he finds himself deeply in love with a compelling woman and trying to come to terms with their relationship over several years. Diane Keaton plays the lady in question named Louise Bryant. At first we see her as nothing more than a groupie of Reed's, but at the film progresses, we see her develop into an independent and resourceful journalist in her own right. Like most journalists, Reed eventually becomes one with his story, and ultimately finds himself helping the new Marxist government in Russia get started. Reed is still the only American buried within the Kremlin walls. For the most part, the people we meet in this film are true radicals. Not like the hypocritical jet-set would-be leftists of today. (Al Gore) There are surprisingly little politics in the film until Reed and Bryant make their first trip to Russia and witness the actual revolution take place between love-making sessions. There is quite a bit of time devoted to the couple and their bohemian friends from Greenwich Village. They all basically hang out and talk leftist politics. For a time, they even move out to a beach house and put on a bunch of small plays. It is at this time when their love affair becomes kind of a triangle with playwright Eugene O'Neill moving in on Bryant while Reed is away covering a convention. Jack Nicholson plays the scoundrel quite well, showing him as an opportunist, and not the radical that the others in the group are.The film takes on a grander scale with each passing moment. Eventually we see both Reed and Bryant trapped inside of Russia after years of searching the frozen wilderness for each other. There is even some political violence along the way. But above all else, this film is a love story. A great big love story.The film has many strengths. The acting is uniformly excellent, and there are several bit parts contributed by well known actors at every turn. The film looks very beautiful, even when what we're looking at is supposed to be dingy and bleak. The use of shadows is top notch in this film. Shadows are used so well, that they nearly add an extra dimension to the project in some scenes. Beatty is obviously very inspired by John Reed, yet this film never gets truly bogged down in idealism. Though Reed stubbornly believes in global Marxism, other main characters correctly point out to him that it could never work in a place like America.There are flaws here, as well. Is this film too long?, you might ask. The answer is yes. It is a good twenty minutes longer than it needs to be. One solution I have would be to dump the parts with the old timers narrating things. Though they were presumably there when all this stuff happened, they don't really add much more than we the audience can already figure out for ourselves. Apparently Beatty spent years gathering these interviews before filming anything else. I guess it was important to him, anyway.Beatty has not done anything this significant since, and likely will never try to in the future. If this is the film he is most remembered for, then more power to him. Reds is truly a substantial work, and a good way to kill a rainy Saturday afternoon.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Superior cinematography, lots of historical references (which, although not always completely accurate, give a good sense of what the holocaust was like for the Jews), brilliant actors, brilliant score, amazing screenplay.People have criticized it for being too sentimental, and I can understand their problems with that, but I can't agree with them. The subject matter is still one of the darkest periods in living history.Now we have a film like Der Untergang which shows the story from inside the Nazi high command at the end of the war, and that movie is even more haunting than this one. It doesn't focus however on the victimization of the entire Jewish community, and therefore does not have to deal with the emotional burdens of the people who had to live through these conditions.Another point is that if you want to show the holocaust in a drama film, you have to think of your audience as well. Although many people still know what it was like, there are also large groups of people who haven't got a clue about the war. They heard the figure, 6 million Jews killed in concentration camps, but know nothing about the ghettos, the slave labour, the slow descent from being deprived of the right to have certain jobs, to being murdered just because you are a Jew.Schindler's list makes this history accessible to the masses. Spielberg does this expertly, by balancing the sentimental with the downright cynical and horrific.Where a film like Der Untergang focuses more on the human weaknesses of the Nazis, this film poses the Nazis outright as the pure evil that Jews had to deal with in the war. This is a very different approach, that can be classed as a more conventional narrative. Good versus Evil. Oskar Schindler stands alone as the good German. In reality there were others like him of course, but in the reality the protagonists of this movie faced, those others played no part, so it is not necessary for the movie to work to emphasize this.What more can be said? Well a criticism has also been that the Jews are being portrayed as little more than meek victims, and that no heroism from them is shown. Unfortunately the war didn't offer many heroic opportunities for the Jewish people. There are exceptions to this rule, but most of them suffered without hope, without a chance to fight back. You can look for the exceptions, and criticize Spielberg for not showing that side. Would that be fair on history? Maybe, but let's face it, the exceptions were far and few between, through no fault of the Jews themselves, but because the Nazis had such a firm grip on the Third Reich that a deed of defiance by one hero, could cost the lives of many bystanders who had nothing to do with it. Most Jews simply had to bear every degrading action undertaken against them, and there was nothing they could do about it. All in all you have to be quite cynical not to be impressed by this movie. It is just too powerful for that. Yes, in the end much is made of making Schindler into a true hero, especially the scene before he flees, where he cries that he could have saved more. Some people hate this scene, and think it schmaltzy, over-sentimental, sanctimoneous crap. I think that it is a great scene, although this scene is very Hollywood, and most probably not an accurate portrayal of the way Schindler fled the factory. But it ends the development of his character, as he finally realises the mistakes he made. He therefore goes from being a cynical crook at the start of the movie, to a man who reluctantly saved people, to a man who enjoys his role as saviour, to finally coming to terms with what he did, and what more he could have done, if he hadn't been busy showing off.This movie is a true classic.

I found the material to be rather lame and I thought the majority of the action scenes were fairly boring and never jumped off the screen. Moore seemed to be bored in the part as there wasn't any energy or charm but perhaps the weak supporting cast was just holding him down. Heck, I really didn't like the title song, the opening credits or the music score. So, what did I like here? I thought the opening sequence with the helicopter was well done and the pay-off was pretty funny as well. I also thought the cinematography was top notch and there's no question that the scenery was nice. With that said, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY ranks towards the bottom of the series.

I have yet to see the original but on the strength of the recommendation I decided to watch this again.The story follows Jesse Lujack from the time he steals a Porsche in Las Vegas with the intention of driving to Los Angeles. Things start to go wrong for him when he finds a gun in the car's glove compartment then crashes after being pulled over by the police. He picks up the gun and accidentally fires leaving the cop mortally wounded. Somehow he gets to LA and goes to see a contact to get his money; he is only given a cheque though; he will have to hang around in LA for a couple of days to get cash. He then meets up with Monica, a French student, who he had a brief fling with when she visited Vegas. The rest of the film is spent with him trying to get his hands on some money, trying to persuade Monica to come with him to Mexico and avoiding getting arrested for the killing of the Highway Patrol officer.Richard Gere does a fine job as Jesse; a small time criminal with a passion for the comic book character The Silver Surfer and the music of Jerry Lee Lewis; both of which feature heavily in the film. The character is essentially immature and self-centred but Gere manages to make him likable which is needed if we are to believe that Monica would consider giving up a potentially successful career as an architect to go to Mexico with Jesse. Valérie Kaprisky is charming as Monica although at times I was uncertain whether she was being a bit wooden or doing a good job playing a character who was conversing in her second language; either way she looked lovely; I can see why Jesse wanted her to come with him when he fled to Mexico.Director Jim McBride did a great job bringing the story to the screen; I loved the slightly unreal comic book look to the colours in some scenes and the obvious back projection in many of the driving scenes.

The main concept might even sound a bit ridicules and just far from likely. I mean, a car with an own mind, that kills off people? That does not sound like anything too convincing of course. But it does work out well in the movie and its story, probably also because it does not ever over-explain anything. The car is evil, as simple as that. There is no reason for it given and the characters in the movie also don't try to find out how and why the car has a true mind of her own. I guess that by trying to give an explanation for all of it, the movie would had truly become a ridicules and far fetched one to watch, so it in my opinion was the right choice to simply step over it and just take things for granted. It also kept the movie at all times simple and pleasant to watch and also adds to the movie its mystery and tension as well.It's definitely true that all of the movie its 'fun' starts in its last hour. Before that point, the movie is really taking its time, by setting up certain story lines and characters. Not that it's bad or boring to watch all but once the fun kicks in and the final hour starts you are still nevertheless wondering to yourself if the movie couldn't had picked up its pace earlier on already and started off a bit sooner with its horror elements.It are little storytelling elements like this that prevent the movie from being a true great one. But all of this can be brought back to the fact that it's based on a novel, which often features and also requires a totally different way of storytelling of course. It's also the main reason why some characters work out awkwardly in this movie and too often get pushed to the background. It doesn't always feels like a well balanced movie with its storytelling and characters.Also some of its themes could had been handled better and more effective, in the movie. Such as for instance the whole way the car chances its owner's personality could had been done far more subtle and interestingly. It could had also given the movie some more depth but this is just not the type of movie that ever wants to delve too deep into things. It's clearly made as foremost a genre movie and to entertaining and bring some thrills to its audience.And it does not really fail as a genre movie. The car pretty much becomes a real character for the movie and it's being a pretty effective 'villain', mostly thanks to the way the movie got shot by genre expert John Carpenter, who directed the movie.Depite all of its flaws and weaknesses, I'm still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and call this a semi-classic because of its original concept and the way it got shot by John Carpenter.

Because of its unique story it still remains a very special and unique one, that besides works out really well, for most part.Thing that this movie really has going for it is its originality. The main concept might even sound a bit ridicules and just far from likely. I mean, a car with an own mind, that kills off people? That does not sound like anything too convincing of course. But it does work out well in the movie and its story, probably also because it does not ever over-explain anything. The car is evil, as simple as that. There is no reason for it given and the characters in the movie also don't try to find out how and why the car has a true mind of her own. I guess that by trying to give an explanation for all of it, the movie would had truly become a ridicules and far fetched one to watch, so it in my opinion was the right choice to simply step over it and just take things for granted. It also kept the movie at all times simple and pleasant to watch and also adds to the movie its mystery and tension as well.It's definitely true that all of the movie its 'fun' starts in its last hour. Before that point, the movie is really taking its time, by setting up certain story lines and characters. Not that it's bad or boring to watch all but once the fun kicks in and the final hour starts you are still nevertheless wondering to yourself if the movie couldn't had picked up its pace earlier on already and started off a bit sooner with its horror elements.It are little storytelling elements like this that prevent the movie from being a true great one. But all of this can be brought back to the fact that it's based on a novel, which often features and also requires a totally different way of storytelling of course. It's also the main reason why some characters work out awkwardly in this movie and too often get pushed to the background. It doesn't always feels like a well balanced movie with its storytelling and characters.Also some of its themes could had been handled better and more effective, in the movie. Such as for instance the whole way the car chances its owner's personality could had been done far more subtle and interestingly. It could had also given the movie some more depth but this is just not the type of movie that ever wants to delve too deep into things. It's clearly made as foremost a genre movie and to entertaining and bring some thrills to its audience.And it does not really fail as a genre movie.

The song is much more well known than the film it came from, and that's probably because Chariots of Fire is not a memorable film aside from that empowering soundtrack.

That's it as far as synopsis. Certain ships, like two Klingon cruisers (one Imperial) and a massive Federation vessel, Epsilon IX, are both absorbed (electric bolts from a circular burst of plasma energy appear from an enormous cloud and when this hits ships it looks as if they are totally vaporized) and V'Ger is headed for Earth. The newly constructed Enterprise, refit and remodeled from the old ship Kirk used to captain for five years, 2 ½ years absent from the center chair (and obsessively desiring to captain the new one, given his position back after some intense needling of Starfleet, using Earth's current predicament as a means to do so), will intercept V'Ger and try to stop it from destroying Earth, its next stop, on a course for the planet. Kirk has an uneasy relationship with Enterprise Captain Dekker, because he basically robbed the young man of his command. This tension lasts throughout the movie, and rightfully so. All the cast members return. Bones, drafted against his will back to Starfleet because of Kirk's influence. Spock, not accepting the Vulcan ritual Kolhinar, because the consciousness of V'Ger was calling to him, rejoins the Enterprise while both are on route to meet the cloud. V'Ger takes a member of Kirk's crew, Ilia (Persis Khambata), using her human features as a probe, collecting Data, but she has been duplicated too perfect and even though she's essentially a machine, memories and feelings remain deeply buried but there. So Dekker, who had a romance with Ilia on her home planet, at Kirk's urging, will attempt to convince V'Ger not to destroy carbon-based units (the Enterprise crew and those living on Earth), while Spock has designs on traveling further inside the cloud (this is after the Enterprise is tractor-beamed into the cloud's center control, soon released and resting at a complete stop until they learn more), actually mind melding with its central power to try and get answers. What is V'Ger looking for?Well, like many Star Trek fans, I have the same basic likes and dislikes as others, similar to the typical critiques. I hate the uniforms (the untucked shirts), but love the sets. The new Enterprise is my favorite the white exterior and the look when dark or in full light is just beautiful to me. Kirk's method of regaining command is interesting because it was done in a rather secretive way, back-stabbing the capable Dekker character. The Dekker-Ilia romance does nothing for me, but it is important to the screenplay for the new birth of a lifeform metaphysical conclusion (the Enterprise emerging from an explosion of blue light in the black starry space gives me a hard-on). The plot, long-winded and rather mediocre, just doesn't cut the mustard for me personally, but it does service us with lots of Douglas Trumball visual magic, as we go inside the cloud and witness all sorts of unique imagery, stylistically colored, with fascinating patterns, most of which looks as if we were inside a computer. Spock's initial boarding of the Enterprise, his cold reception of a delighted crew funny to me, but awkward when you see the disappointment and bewilderment in the expressions of everyone after the Vulcan turns his attentions to the task at hand&#x85;learning what V'Ger is\/wants. Director Wise allows some scenes to drag on, because he seems to care more for the visual effects than a tighter story (the shuttle trip with Scotty and Kirk travelling to the Enterprise; The Enterprise tractor beaming into V'Ger's cloud), but, as irony would have it, the look and technological aspects are the movie's strengths. Like a lot of fans, I was happy when the second film changed its method of execution, because The Motion Picture has the pacing issues and a story that lacks oomph even if it jump starts the franchise. The wormhole sequence, the Enterprise leaving space dock (and the busy chaos of its repairs prior to release), the transporter malfunction killing two officers, and Spock's trip into V'Ger's main ship are definite highlights that add dramatic highs despite the number of lows. Overall, a failure with high spots here and there.

That's it as far as synopsis. Certain ships, like two Klingon cruisers (one Imperial) and a massive Federation vessel, Epsilon IX, are both absorbed (electric bolts from a circular burst of plasma energy appear from an enormous cloud and when this hits ships it looks as if they are totally vaporized) and V'Ger is headed for Earth. The newly constructed Enterprise, refit and remodeled from the old ship Kirk used to captain for five years, 2 ½ years absent from the center chair (and obsessively desiring to captain the new one, given his position back after some intense needling of Starfleet, using Earth's current predicament as a means to do so), will intercept V'Ger and try to stop it from destroying Earth, its next stop, on a course for the planet. Kirk has an uneasy relationship with Enterprise Captain Dekker, because he basically robbed the young man of his command. This tension lasts throughout the movie, and rightfully so. All the cast members return. Bones, drafted against his will back to Starfleet because of Kirk's influence. Spock, not accepting the Vulcan ritual Kolhinar, because the consciousness of V'Ger was calling to him, rejoins the Enterprise while both are on route to meet the cloud. V'Ger takes a member of Kirk's crew, Ilia (Persis Khambata), using her human features as a probe, collecting Data, but she has been duplicated too perfect and even though she's essentially a machine, memories and feelings remain deeply buried but there. So Dekker, who had a romance with Ilia on her home planet, at Kirk's urging, will attempt to convince V'Ger not to destroy carbon-based units (the Enterprise crew and those living on Earth), while Spock has designs on traveling further inside the cloud (this is after the Enterprise is tractor-beamed into the cloud's center control, soon released and resting at a complete stop until they learn more), actually mind melding with its central power to try and get answers. What is V'Ger looking for?Well, like many Star Trek fans, I have the same basic likes and dislikes as others, similar to the typical critiques. I hate the uniforms (the untucked shirts), but love the sets. The new Enterprise is my favorite the white exterior and the look when dark or in full light is just beautiful to me. Kirk's method of regaining command is interesting because it was done in a rather secretive way, back-stabbing the capable Dekker character.

DeMented (2000)* 1\/2 (out of 4) John Waters has a very clear message here but it's the perfect example of a director having something to say but not a good way of saying it. In the film, the twisted, underground director Cecil B. DeMented (Stephen Dorff) and he teenage filmmakers kidnap A-list actress Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith) and force her to appear in their film. What's the subject of their film? That Hollywood is pure evil and the only good cinema is the independent movie. If Waters' wanted to give people a message that independent cinema is better than Hollywood then he really should have came up with a better screenplay because as it stands there really aren't too many Hollywood comedies that are worse than this low-budget movie. Again, I understand what Waters was going for but the film is a complete disaster that doesn't have a single laugh in it. There are a couple good things with one of them being Griffith who gives it her all even when the screenplay isn't giving her much to do. The second thing the film has going for it is the fact that it never really gets boring no matter how unfunny it is. With that said, for the most part the film is a complete misfire with one unfunny sequence after another. This terrorist group basically go out and film themselves mistreating those things they most object to. This includes malls that show movies, family friendly groups and of course the evil big-budget sequels. Again, the message is clear but the way it's presented is just so poorly done that you can't help but roll your eyes at everything being done. Even worse is the fact that I never could understand why these anti-Hollywood people would want an A-list actress in their film. Waters clearly has a talent but it's certainly not on display here.
