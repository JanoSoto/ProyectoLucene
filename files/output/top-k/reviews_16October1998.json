Can't you be a little more precise ? What do you mind ? That the idea was born when Luc was 16 or that the plot is stupid. It bet it's simply the former which is not a reason but a prejudice ! The idea behind it is to reduce the oldest of all story ideas to its simple pattern, its elements Good versa evil. Or better THE good versa THE evil. And you shouldn't take plots that run like this so seriously ! Besides, it was not only very fantasyful but also funny ! (When Oldman leaves the dream boat, opens the box ... It's empty !) I can not understand how you can not like this movie. The first diversive plot in years and you complain about it ! I mean, the soundtrack, the effects, the ideas in it, Moebius himself designed the city, Jean-Paul Gaultier designed the costumes ... I simply fail to understand you ! And the movie's depth of detail. The guy that tries to rob Bruce with the picture on his hat, so that he cannot be seen through the door spy. The flying shushie boat. The cigarettes with more filter than tobacco. It is simply wonderful.  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 1998","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  What ?

The casting is brilliant.  Oprah Winfrey does a great job as Sethe, a former slave.  You feel her pain and strength.  Danny Glover, as always, is a wonderful actor.  The supporting cast (Kimberly Elise and Thandie Newton) are good actors and I think are new comers that have a bright future. This is a movie that you MUST see the opening scene.  Without going into detail, this scene is pivotal to understanding the rest of the movie. Through flashbacks, we are told Sethe's story to understand where she is now and why.  I enjoyed seeing Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover acting together as much as I did in The Color Purple.
