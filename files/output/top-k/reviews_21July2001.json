It was a rather late screening, but the viewers were glued to their seats. It's a very gripping movie and extremely subversive in themes, language and visuals. It's very anti current-day Colombia, and no wonder the production didn't go very smoothly. Still I admire the support the film got from `official' institutions in Medellion. It's subversive in themes, because we basically have a gay couple, an older man (about 40-50) who indulges in having sex with minor boys (who do this willingly, and yet, it's rather shocking to the average viewer) in return for financial support, or rather indulging the boys in whatever they want to do.

If I were to, God forbid, watch an Anime, I wouldn't be expecting absolute realism in terms of voice acting. Cartoons, no matter how serious or &#145;adult' doesn't have realistic voices. Final Fantasy did, and for half the movie I was left with a rather unsettling experience. Granted&#133;. the graphics are fantastic. But they are not visionary, they are not revolutionary, anyone with $140 million dollars could design those graphics. You can almost always tell it isn't real. But I was even stumped in the few space scenes.Video game crossovers haven't been successful. Mortal Kombat was probably the &#145;best'. And that's not saying much. Final Fantasy follows the obligatory line of bad dialogue and lousy plot-development. The movie has the token &#145;tough-girl' the token &#145;star-crossed lovers', the token &#145;smart-alecky weasel' (who's not funny, I might add), the token &#145;tough black dude', the token &#145;bad guy who they try to make you feel sorry for'&#133;. his family died, so that gives him an excuse to kill the spirits. The token &#145;Nooooooooo!' scene(s)? And the token rip-off from `Aliens', as Gray makes a last stand as the drop ship (that looks right out of `Aliens') disappears&#133;. only for it to make a last second comeback. In fact, the only slightly interesting character was General Hein, and the only decent dialogue was when he explained exactly why he hated the Spirits. The action is clumsy and poor. Instead of fast-paced blaster fights, we have men in clumsy suits waddling around wreckage spraying insecticide (or particle beams, whatever kills invisible ghost bugs) down ruined streets.The plot isn't better. An alien planet destroyed by a civil war has hurtled a chunk at Earth. The asteroid has practically wiped out Earth except for last bastions of humanity residing in large shielded cities. The &#145;Spirits' have come with it&#133;. residual psychic energy or something&#133;. it doesn't matter&#133;. no one else was paying attention either. &#145;Spirits' are alien ghosts (I know! Original name!) that painfully rip human &#145;Spirits' from their bodies, and then get repeatedly shot to pieces by laser guns (think `Ghostbusters'). It's up to a human scientist, a computer animated babe that puts Lara Croft to shame, Aki, to save the world.The Spirits are dumb aliens. They have no intelligence&#133;. they have no culture, nor language. They are pop-up bad guys, think &#145;Bugs' in `Starship Troopers'. They wipe their planet out and, not surprisingly, come here looking for a home (the only common trait with humans). What is their lifestyle like? How do they live? What do they breathe? Eat? Reproduce? Why'd they pick Earth? The film is short.... there is plenty of room for an inside look on the Alien Spirit civilization.Final Fantasy is not exhilarating, innovating, or even exciting. Granted, all my Final Fantasy friends loved the movie. I thought it was a boring action &#133;. no, anime&#133;movie, one without any excitement  with &#145;literally' breathtaking special effects. Did that save the movie? No. ","genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure"},{"date":"21 July 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I mean, cmon!

So, in that respect because the movie is bizarre, it's to be admired as a success.The action is set in the context of a race against time. The killer (played by Vince D'Onofrio) had kidnapped one last victim, but then due to illness was found lapsed into a coma. The police have to find the victim before she dies in a contraption set up to drown her in 40 hours (just as an aside, I have to confess that this kind of reminded me of the old Batman TV series; I always used to wonder why the Joker didn't just shoot Batman instead of trying to turn him into a giant milkshake or whatever. But I digress.) Their only hope is to use a device that would allow a psychologist (psychiatrist? social worker? just plain cutie that we can feel protective of? I was never entirely sure on that) to enter the killer's mind and establish communication with him. This role is played by Jennifer Lopez in what has to be one of the more bizarre - there's that word again - casting decisions ever made. There's nothing about Lopez that I can take seriously in this role. My wife said it best does that look like how a professional engaged in serious work would dress? (and this was a real-life scene, and not while she was in the killer's mind!)I say it all again this is BIZARRE! But at the same time, if you can get past Lopez's non-performance, it's good fun, while at the same time totally unbelievable. I can give it a 6\/10, and it probably would have been a bit higher if they had found someone more credible than Lopez to play the starring role.

It proves when filmmaker's examine feasible situations of horror, the product grabs us by the throat and pulls us in. Breakdown, the high-octane suspense masterpiece of 1997, worked remarkably well because its concept and characters felt authentic and real. Judgment Night finds terror in another circumstance that feels real-we empathize with the characters and believe the environment because what happens to them could actually happen to such people in real life.The main character is Frank (Emilio Estevez), a family man who's ready for a night out presumably after months of caring for his pregnant wife. He is going to a boxing match with his two good buddies, Mike (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and Ray (Jeremy Piven), and his little brother, John (Stephen Dorff). They're traveling in style; Ray, an excellent negotiator, sweet talked his way into borrowing a luxurious motor home for the evening.As the four big kids travel to their destination through Chicago, a big traffic jam halts their progress. Ray decides to take a shortcut through the city's gang territory. They accidentally hit a man crossing the road, check to see if he is badly injured, and things go down hill from there.Initially, Ray doesn't call the police because he's had a lot to drink and doesn't want to spend time in jail for involuntary manslaughter. The person he hit turns out to be a young gangster running from his boss, with a coat full of cash he's stolen. The boss (Denis Leary) eventually catches up and punishes the kid by shooting him in the head. Ray, John, Mike, and Frank witness the murder, and the boss does not want any witnesses.The rest of the movie places the four characters in one terrifying situation after another. They find cover in a freight train full of greedy homeless people, an apartment where nobody will lend a helping hand, the rooftop of a high building, the sewers, the streets of the windy city, as well as other buildings and a shopping center. The villains always find the foursome, no matter where they hide. When you are in the gritty parts of Chicago, life is cheap. Many people reveal their cover for just a few dollars.The screenplay flows unusually smooth. The film does not involve any unneeded subplots or distractions-every character and event plays an important part in moving the story forward. Judgment Night is very focused, lean, and suspenseful. So many thrillers these days forget that action and violence provides relief from tension; fist fights and shoot-outs alone do not captivate viewers. Judgment Nights really knows how to build tension and then relieve it with some startling violent sequences.Many reviews have mentioned the film's obvious areas of stupidity. I agree that the villains might have not revealed their identities to so many side characters. Otherwise, all of these characters are very believable. Frank, Mike, John, and Ray are real people who are in real danger. The villains kill one of the four early, and for once he's not the black guy. This establishes the merciless threat of these bad guys and that any of the characters is equally vulnerable to death. I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the movie.Stephen Hopkins directs Judgment Night. This is his best work yet. He never puts the movie on auto pilot like many thrillers do. This plot is character driven all the way through. Yes, it's just another cat-and-mouse chase film-it does not offer any deep satisfaction, nor does it examine deep, thought-provoking issues-but this genre is seldom as effective. After watching Judgment Night you will think twice before taking a shortcut.

It's incredibly strange and surreal, and some people like that, but even if one does, I can't imagine how one would not be bored out of one's skull by this intellect-impoverished movie.The story starts out with a struggling puppeteer, who gets an office job. But the office is located on floor 7 1\/2, which is between floors 7 and 8 in an office building. Although there is a bit in the movie that gives a pseudo-explanation for it, the characters don't really believe what they are told, and neither did I. We never find out where floor 7 1\/2 came from, which I might have found mildly annoying, if I were interested enough to care (which I wasn't).While working, the puppeteer finds a small doorway, that leads him into John Malkovich's brain. The story, if it weren't strange already, just gets stranger from there. They charge people money to be John Malkovich for 15 minutes, and when you're done, you end up on the New Jersey Turnpike (how you get there, is never explained). I don't mind a bit of the surreal in a film, but to have the whole entire movie be stranger than your oddest dreams, is just unpleasant.But it's not just the weird goings-on in the movie that made me dislike it. The movie was utterly boring. I did not care a fig about any of the characters in it.

Despite all the comments about his lack of acting ability, I really don't think he's that bad.  It would be interesting to see him take on a very different role, particularly if he played a villain; I always thought he'd be perfect in a James Bond movie as the Obligatory Super-Strong Henchman (like Jaws or Oddjob) that 007 takes on at the end.I suppose the biggest shortcoming in his movies is the fight sequences, but it's not really his fault; His Aikido is marvelous, but pure Aikido simply doesn't translate to the screen as well as many other martial art forms. Aikido is a strictly defensive style, which means that there are no attacks, kicks, punches, etc.  The only actions are in  response to someone else's attacks; this is why Seagal's opponents are always so absurdly persistent; would YOU keep getting up and trying to hit him if he threw you halfway across the room every time you moved?  Unfortunately, perhaps to compensate for Aikido's cinematic shortcomings (for lack of a better word), the violence is always amplified beyond any reason; I studied Aikido for several years, and we never learned to break a guy's arm like a Twix bar or gouge someone's eyes out with our thumbs.I have a strong feeling that Sensei Morehei Uchiba (the founder of Aikido, who can be seen in the old documentary footage that opens Above the Law) would strongly disapprove of these tactics, and I wonder if Seagal, being an acknowledged Aikido master, worries that he's giving his form an undeserved reputation for sadistic brutality.  But back to this movie...It's actually not bad by Seagal standards.  He's playing his usual Zen-supercop character, gruesomely dispatching anyone who messes with him, then going back home to bond with old friends and family, perhaps to prove that underneath the anger and violence, he's really just a nice guy.  He runs afoul of some wacked-out Jamaican crackheads who have him, well, Marked for Death.  They're led by Screwface, a scary Rastaman who has magical voodoo powers and is one of Seagal's more worthy adversaries.  Much mayhem ensues, including a goofy excursion to Jamaica that makes some weak attempts at social commentary about something or other; this is sandwiched between two fight scenes that showcase Steve's arm-breaking, vasectomizing, and decapitating skills.  There's also a silly twist ending that only occurs so that we can see Screwface suffer two hideous deaths instead of only one. The climactic battle is actually one of the more successful fight scenes in the Seagal ouevre, in that Screwface knows how to use a sword, and actually gets a few minor shots in, before Seagal beats him by utilizing THE dirtiest move I've ever seen in ANY martial-arts movie.  Again, a major shortcoming of this movie, and all of Seagal's movies, is that there is never a single moment when he appears to be in any danger.  I mean, even Bruce Lee got kicked around a bit in his movies.  When Seagal's unarmed and facing half a dozen guys armed with machine guns, you just know that he's going to walk away without a scratch, and the only question is which opponent will be dispatched in the cruelest way.  This is no way to build tension, and it makes for a boring fight sequence when it's so one-sided.  Unfortunately, this is a problem that occurs in every movie he's ever made.
