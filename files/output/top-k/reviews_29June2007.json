The Matrix is a movie based on computer programs, viruses and Artificial Intelligence &#150; after watching this movie I did a little jig of my own &#150; WYBIWYA &#150; What You Believe Is What You Are. In Latin (and Greek, perhaps??) &#150; Cogito, ergo sum (I think, therefore I am).The Matrix has the perfect blend of everything &#150; action, mystery, suspense and a little romance of sorts thrown in at the end. And there are various versions of thrilling moments in the movie &#150; in the beginning where you are not supposed to understand anything; the middle where you are supposed to begin understanding the turn of events but your mind refuses to believe what you see; and finally the end where you can't understand the reality but like it anyway. One thing holds you to your seat - the adrenaline never stops pumping.The moments of truth hit you hard as you progress from one scene to another and sooner or later, you realize you are looking at a philosophy strongly etched in principles of fate, Good vs Evil and the eternal search and battle for belief, faith, freedom and justice.Keanu Reaves as Neo is too good &#150; the bewildered look on his face match ours as nothing really materializes in his head and his emotions on screen look very real even though it's supposed to be virtual (get it?). Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is the coolest dude around and the way he carries himself in the movie makes it come alive. Andy and Larry Wachowski have outdone themselves in the Direction of this movie (duh) &#150; easily their best work and the one which skyrocketed them to the Hollywood walk of fame.Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity has a glossy look on her face as though she has been transformed into some machine, but redeems herself in the action scenes where she looks stunning. If looks could kill (and looks do kill) &#150; she would be the perfect hostess for that idiom for this movie. And what can I say about the Agent! If all villains could look this smart, I would cheer for them any-day &#150; but yes, the last hurrah is always for the hero in any movie, and so I give in.Action-oriented, adventurous, eye-catching stunts, visually stimulating camera-work (especially the scenes in the rain) mind-boggling fight scenes and awesome display of dialogue delivery make the Matrix easily one of the best movies of the century. It most certainly features in my best movies for all time to come.
