And that's quite an accomplishment.Where to begin?Let's start with the ludicrous plot. Kurt Russell is a highly trained, effective soldier who finds himself phased out by a genetically supreme race of soldiers in the early 21st century.  He is beaten up in a grudge match and, left for dead, is shipped off to Arcadia, a garbage planet far, far away.  But wait, he's not dead!  He befriends the planet's inhabitants, who, conveniently enough, speak English, celebrate Christmas, and dance to Irish jigs. Oh, and there are these killer snakes which are tiny, but the women and children of the planet aren't strong enough to kill them.  They show up whenever the film starts lagging and needs some false drama.  Soldier befriends a family, he becomes attracted to the woman (although he can't really express emotion, so we just know because we're shown a starting to feel emotion montage), and teaches the son how to kill snakes with his boot.  The townspeople kick him out in a cliched trial scene on the grounds that he's too aggressive for their colony.  But they invite him back (with an overwrought we were wrong!! speech) to help kill invaders who, coincidentally, are the same fleet that made him obsolete.The only redeeming thing about seeing this film in the theaters is seeing how quickly people flee once the first end credit appears on screen. Where I saw it, the theater was cleared in about 20-30 seconds.  You'd think someone phoned in a bomb threat.Movies often transport us to fantastical worlds, far removed from the humdrum of everyday life.
