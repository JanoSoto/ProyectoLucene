Basically Billy Brown (Gallo) has been released from prison after serving five years for a crime he did not commit, he has a dilemma though as he has told his parents, father Jimmy (Ben Gazzara) and mother Jan (Anjelica Huston), that he is married with a successful career. The first thing he is trying to do is find a place to pee, being very desperate, and he finally finds that running into a dance studio during a tap dancing lesson. With what he has told his parents in mind, he winds up kidnapping young tap dance student Layla (Christina Ricci), forcing her of course to drive him where he wants to go, change her name and of course pretend to be his wife. Billy's only instructions are to make him look in front of the parents, and she allows herself to go with everything he says, and Jimmy and Jan enjoy their dinner with their son and his pretend wife. But is apparent she is not just helping him out however she can, this also includes later having some photos taken together, but Layla may in fact truly find some attraction towards Billy, even with his objections not to touch him intimately. The subplot of the story, seen in some flashbacks, is that Billy went to jail because he lost a large cash bet on the Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo Bills against the New York Giants, in 1991, and he wants revenge on the man indirectly responsible, Scott Woods (Bob Wahl). Billy is struggling against these demons, chronic loneliness and his severe depression, but eventually he does slowly open up and give in to his feelings with Layla, in the end there is some form of resolution. Also starring Mickey Rourke as The Bookie, Rosanna Arquette as Wendy Balsam, Jan-Michael Vincent as Sonny, Kevin Pollak as TV Sportscaster, Alex Karras as TV Sportscaster and Kevin Corrigan as Rocky the Goon. Gallo has created an inventive and intriguing story, and directs the film is very stylistic fashion, but of course it is his on screen presence that is best, being an unlikeable but sympathetic character, as well as the beautiful Ricci being just as compelling as the one who is falling for him, a dark and unusual drama. Very good!

This review, will be similar to my review for 'Halloween III', as I will have MANY negative things to say about this sequel. So, without further a poo! Let's go! PROS To start things off, I really liked the idea of how Michael escaped his death, it was really creative and inventive. And having him looked after by a hermit for a full year was very original and in some way creepy at the same time! Danielle Harris played her character of Jamie Lloyd even better than she did in Halloween 4, it might have been her or how the script was written, but the way she shows she can't speak properly was very good acting for a 9 year old. Donald Pleasance is great again as the tenacious Dr. Loomis, but is down graded to me as the writers decided to mix his caring side with a crazy bastard side. But again, we are shown that he is not afraid to confront Michael, and we actually SEE him try to reason with him, and Michael listens. The scene towards the very end when Michael takes off his mask and cries in front of his niece was genius to me, because it's scenes like this that shows that even pure evil can have emotion, and it shows humanity, and it shows that Michael probably does not want to kill his family, but has no choice. I also liked the 'angry eyes', they were cool and disturbing at the same time. It goes to show that you don't mess with the Shape! CONS Here we go, the bad stuff. The mask sucked, it was probably the worst in the series. It just looked rushed, and it looked like the costume designer (Simon Tuke) didn't care about what Michael looks like. There were also a lot of douche bags in this film, mainly the stupid greaser boyfriend and the little pirate boy who thought he could help people by holding their heads and showing his over- sized kid teeth. The suspense, I usually keep in the Pros, but this film had the worst suspense of all the 'Halloween' films so far. It just took too long, and every time you thought it was Michael, it turned out to be some idiot pretending to be him. But the biggest, worst and most idiotic part of the film is the dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, DUMB bumbling police officers! They were NOT funny, they were ANNOYING! And they had their own comedic music that we hear in EVERY SINGLE SCENE they're in! It may be the silliest in the series (so far) but it's still enjoyable, and I would recommend it!

Welcome to number 4 of my 'Retrospective' film reviews for John Carpenter's 'HALLOWEEN' series. This installment in the franchise brings back the iconic Myers storyline and introduces a new victim for Michael to hunt for... his Niece, Jamie Lloyd (Played by the NOW sexy, Danielle Harris). I don't want to waste any more of your time, so, without further a douche, let's begin with the Pros of the film.PROS Obviously, the biggest positive of the film is returning to the original storyline of Michael Myers going after a young girl to kill, only this time she is even younger. As she is the daughter of the former heroine, Laurie Strode. Danielle Harris is great in this role and she really depicts fear clearly and well, you actually see how terrified she is that this crazy man is after her. If I'm speaking about the cast in this review I can't leave out Donald Pleasance as Loomis; in this film, Loomis is very confident about confronting Michael and isn't afraid to go up to him and try to reason with him, even if he does have a walking stick. Pleasance and Harris have the best performances in the movie, but that doesn't mean that the other actors were bad. I just didn't think they were as good as Donald Pleasance. I really enjoyed the psychological aspect of the film, where it switches from as scene with Jamie and replaces her character with young Michael Myers, it really shows the similarities that the 2 characters have and that their connection is really important to the film and further sequels. The suspense, as always is cool and it made me scared, just like the previous films. That's what I like about these films, they NEVER fail to include that eery feel. The writers and directors of the Carpenter- less sequels are doing John Carpenter proud! Another thing that I REALLY love about this film is the climax, they make it as if it's a psychological horror\/action thriller. They also manage to add in a tiny bit of drama, as we see Dr. Loomis break down and cry.CONS I don't remember much of the film, but I guess the bad stuff about the film is the little stuff, like Michael having shoulder pads. With Michael looking like that, it's as if they got Mike Myers to play the part, you know, when he's doing his 'Austin Powers' moves. But, apart from that, it's a well executed sequel.See it!

Every single one of them has been entirely deserved. But those insults should be softened with just a little praise for making a bold urban nightmare like this film.Falling Down is the story of a man who is stuck in traffic one day when his tolerance for the world is finally used up. Identified only by his license plate D-Fens, the man (Michael Douglas) abandons his car and starts walking. He says he's going home, but where he's going isn't his home anymore. His ex-wife Beth and daughter Adele (Barbara Hershey and Joey Hope Singer) now live there and Beth has a restraining order against D-Fens. As he walks his way across Los Angeles, D-Fens has a series of violent encounters, first with the everyday aggravations of life in the big city. From busting up the shop of a immigrant merchant who speaks broken English to confronting some gang bangers to a gun point rant against the unctuous martinets at a fast food restaurant, D-Fens eventually graduates to more brutal acts against more existential frustrations like neo-Nazi gun nuts, pointless road construction and the vicious sense of entitlement among the wealthy. All the while, getting every closer to Beth and Adele.As reports of D-Fens' slow moving rampage come in, the only one to figure out what's going on is a cop spending his last day on the job. Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is retiring early, an taking a reduced pension, to satisfy the demands of his insecure, needy and somewhat unstable wife. Aided by the only cop he's friends with (Rachel Ticotin), Prendergast sets out to stop D-Fens before this day turns out to be the last day in the life of a lot of people.Falling Down is a smart film that takes on two cultural phenomena of the early 1990s. One is the concept of going postal, where relatively normal men started going into their workplaces and shooting people. The other is the sense of economic disenfranchisement that came out of the recession that bridges the first Bush and Clinton Administrations. Now granted, as befitting a Joel Schumacher picture, this movie doesn't take those subjects on with any subtlety. But it does address them thoroughly with both empathy and honesty.Schumacher, Michael Douglas and screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith combine to make D-Fens a character who defies easy definition. He's neither the righteous vigilante of right wing fantasies nor a liberal's easily dismissed symbol of white male intolerance. He's a man who can legitimately claim he's been victimized by society, yet he's also a man whose seething rage terrifies the ones closest to him. Most of the carnage he creates is accidental or without malice, yet his ultimate goal is the darkest sort of evil. D-Fens is someone you cannot completely embrace or reject. You can only wonder how much of yourself is reflected in him.The whole film is somewhat like that. Most of the characters, even minor ones, are given depth and personalities like they're real human beings and not just constructs serving the script. They experience genuine humor and friendship and anguish and fear in a way this sort of high-concept movie usually doesn't provide.The contrast between D-Fens and Prendergast that runs through the story is a great example of that kind of complexity. They're both guys whose lives aren't working out like they wanted. One has a failed marriage and a lost career, the other a dead daughter and a crazy wife he feels responsible for. The ways they deal with those challenges are quite different. D-Fens is an idealist who cares about the way he thinks things should be, at the expense of the other people in the world with him. Prendergast is a pragmatist who takes the world as it is and does what he has to do to get by, without even thinking it could be any other way.I suspect that Falling Down has not gotten the acclaim it deserves because it's a mainstream work of entertainment that won't fit neatly into a particular box. It looks and sounds like a white male power trip, but it feels much more introspective and melancholy and despairing. I find it to be a compelling story with some great acting and I think you should give it a look.

Every single one of them has been entirely deserved. But those insults should be softened with just a little praise for making a bold urban nightmare like this film.Falling Down is the story of a man who is stuck in traffic one day when his tolerance for the world is finally used up. Identified only by his license plate D-Fens, the man (Michael Douglas) abandons his car and starts walking. He says he's going home, but where he's going isn't his home anymore. His ex-wife Beth and daughter Adele (Barbara Hershey and Joey Hope Singer) now live there and Beth has a restraining order against D-Fens. As he walks his way across Los Angeles, D-Fens has a series of violent encounters, first with the everyday aggravations of life in the big city. From busting up the shop of a immigrant merchant who speaks broken English to confronting some gang bangers to a gun point rant against the unctuous martinets at a fast food restaurant, D-Fens eventually graduates to more brutal acts against more existential frustrations like neo-Nazi gun nuts, pointless road construction and the vicious sense of entitlement among the wealthy. All the while, getting every closer to Beth and Adele.As reports of D-Fens' slow moving rampage come in, the only one to figure out what's going on is a cop spending his last day on the job. Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is retiring early, an taking a reduced pension, to satisfy the demands of his insecure, needy and somewhat unstable wife. Aided by the only cop he's friends with (Rachel Ticotin), Prendergast sets out to stop D-Fens before this day turns out to be the last day in the life of a lot of people.Falling Down is a smart film that takes on two cultural phenomena of the early 1990s. One is the concept of going postal, where relatively normal men started going into their workplaces and shooting people. The other is the sense of economic disenfranchisement that came out of the recession that bridges the first Bush and Clinton Administrations. Now granted, as befitting a Joel Schumacher picture, this movie doesn't take those subjects on with any subtlety. But it does address them thoroughly with both empathy and honesty.Schumacher, Michael Douglas and screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith combine to make D-Fens a character who defies easy definition. He's neither the righteous vigilante of right wing fantasies nor a liberal's easily dismissed symbol of white male intolerance. He's a man who can legitimately claim he's been victimized by society, yet he's also a man whose seething rage terrifies the ones closest to him. Most of the carnage he creates is accidental or without malice, yet his ultimate goal is the darkest sort of evil. D-Fens is someone you cannot completely embrace or reject. You can only wonder how much of yourself is reflected in him.The whole film is somewhat like that.

This set of films was important for it established the basis of 2 interesting and important careers (Hodge in the meanwhile seems to have deviated from interesting stuff, let's hope he comes back). What they did was what one might call experimentalism, or even theoretical experiments leaked onto practical products. Of the 3 films, this is probably the less interesting. It's not especially entertaining, and even as an experiment it's not especially interesting. The point was to pick up a specific genre, romantic comedy in this case, and twist it or at least give it a new edge. The result falls a lot behind what, say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty. Still, McGregor would become a powerful actor, one of the best, and Boyle is always worthwhile no matter what he does, and he's done some impressive stuff since. So, this film becomes a sort of an historical artifact if you want to do archaeological research of their careers.What you learn here is that from the beginning Boyle trusts his intuition, and that vein prevails over how he rationalizes his film conceptions.

Because he's possessed an adult's (somewhat pessimistic) awareness since birth, Oskar begins to develop a deep hatred of humanity. Oskar thus decides to not advance beyond the age of three. He will not grow up in this world, and instead spends his days banging loudly on a tin drum as a show of protest.Oskar is initially painted as history's moral objector. He sees what others don't and protests what others keenly follow. Quickly, however, Oskar's drumming becomes Schlondorff's blunt metaphor for ineffectual artisans. Oskar drums and screams, but no one listens. Nazisim gathers steam, Poland is invaded, Germany's economic miracle occurs, and he becomes a witness to much adultery, cruelty and horror.Oskar himself becomes increasingly amoral. His body may preserve an outward innocence, but inside he grows self absorbed and cruel. And so though Oskar interrupts Nazy rallies and sympathises with the Jewish man who sold him a tin drum (and who is later killed during Kristallnacht, the Night of the Broken Glass, upon which the Nazis destroyed Jewish stores and synagogues), he is nevertheless quick to don a Nazi uniform and play his drum for Nazi officials.By the film's end, Oskar epitomises every man infantalized by, or made an obedient child to, the tides of history. I prefer to be a spectator, not an artist, Oskar says. He's adopted a tone of total futility, and comes to believe that imagination, action and conviction are all inadequate in the fight against place, time and political currents.

In one of his more successful protests, an entire Nazi band is led into confusion by his boisterous percussion.Like the works of Wojciech Has, Schlondorff's tone here is a strange blend of surrealism, fantasy, farce, tragedy and much queasy imagery. Oskar himself has the face of a gnome, and his antics are frequently nauseating. The film also makes heavy use of symbolism, many of its major points conveyed obliquely. For example, Oskar is shown to be born in 1924, the year when Germany's economy began its post WW1 climb. On Oskar's third birthday the country's economic stability is then aligned with the child's own refusal to progress, a stagnation which echoes Germany's suspension of democratic and liberal freedoms. Oskar's drum is even shown to be threatened with a silencing on his sixth birthday, which occurs in 1933, the year the Nazis came into power, symbolising Nazism's quest to silence all dissenters.Other issues are raised almost imperceptibly. A throwaway line, in which one character states that he was not present for Kristallnacht, highlights a stance which was common in Germany after the war it happened but I was not there; I did not participate. Meanwhile, Oskar's own uncle is quick to replace a picture of Beethoven with Hitler when the Nazi Party comes into power, and replaces it just as quickly when the Nazi's are defeated. He is the everyday Nazi, his allegiances blowing with the winds of change.One of the most disturbing passages in the film revolves around fishermen plucking eels from a dead horse's head, a sequence which mirrors the eating habits of other characters in the film, all of whom are shown to be always munching on seafood.

Why are the questions in the Voigt- Kampff test about hurting animals? Where did the androids come from, why were they created? Why are they only available on Mars? Why are androids on Earth, in general, hunted? Why did humans go to Mars, and yet why are there a lot of them still on Earth? These, and a lot, lot more are important parts of the story that aren't explained in depth enough (or aren't present at all) to make the movie interesting. All of those elements are connected, they don't float around in this futuristic world by their own, like the movie presents itself.And even if the movie wasn't based on a book, it is still pretty bad. There is no chemistry between the actors, the characters are boring. The plot, the storyline is also boring some androids (creation) escape slavery to meet their maker, in order to live longer (to make their lives better)... really original, I couldn't think of another movie like that. The only good thing about this movie were the visuals.What a disappointment.

Too bad a lot of viewers don't have a clue what's going on.

So if you could instantly travel 50 light years from Earth you could, theoretically, pick up radio waves that were transmitted 50 years before. And electromagnetic radio waves also are used to transmit television, which we hear but don't see as the image moves farther from Earth. That's why we hear President Franklin Delano Roosevelt give his famous Pearl Harbor speech and why we hear Hitler. This is the image of humanity the Earth is sending out into space, and it's not a pretty picture that any alien civilizations might and could hear. But conversely, we should be able to pick up radio waves from other planets, too, with a strong enough antenna. That's what the movie is about.That's the basic science. But many viewers probably are clueless when it comes to the technological time line of the 20th century; this includes young Americans, but is especially true of viewers outside the West. Electronic television was first demonstrated in 1927 by Philo Farnsworth, but was delayed in America by patent lawsuits by RCA. So Germany in 1936 and England in 1937 were the first to begin regular broadcasting. The U.S. had only experimental stations until 1939, but WWII then froze TV station construction until 1948. Some Asian countries didn't get television until the 1960s or 70s. What you hear in the opening is primarily American broadcasting (hey, this is an American movie), until the shocker Hitler. Germany used primarily American and British technology to try to claim Nazi superiority by being the first to broadcast television live, sort of. Their television cameras were not sensitive enough, so they filmed events, ran the film through a very fast developer in a truck and then scanned the film for broadcast of Olympic events. You can see some of this film of Nazi TV footage on Youtube! Meanwhile, mein Fuhrer starts showing up on astronomers' television sets on Vega 27 years later, and they send a message back to Earth, which is received after another 27 years. Get it? And 40 years later, those Vegans start developing an irresistible craving for Big Macs. Great opening. Now the film changes gears, and we see the birth of a young radio astronomer as a ham radio operator, metaphorically. But after that we get a lot of philosophizing. Some people seem to consider philosophizing propaganda, but we are seeing a variety of viewpoints espoused. This is in the grand old tradition of science fiction going back to Robert Heinlein, where the story is not about technology so much as speculation about the spiritual potential of human beings. Oddly, the religious mouthpieces in the movie don't seem to get this; spirituality for them is a theological hierarchy with God at the top. But science, and here the contact with an alien species, is about potential for human progress, which is ultimately spiritual progress and understanding. The movie could have made this clearer, but Ellie gets tongue tied in her testimony. The truth is, no one can really imagine what contact would mean.Instead, we witness this through Ellie in her travels through the worm hole and her vision of swirling galaxies, when she is at a loss for words to describe what she is seeing. We get a small taste of the enormity of the universe. And when she returns to Earth we see how puny human squabbling is in comparison, and how far our species must yet travel to reach our potential as human beings. That is the key vision Contact seeks to convey. Why, if there are so many solar systems and galaxies, have we not yet made contact? For one, more advanced civilizations may have long abandoned radio wave communication for some other medium unknown to us. More likely, they are waiting to see if we self-destruct.

The truth is, no one can really imagine what contact would mean.Instead, we witness this through Ellie in her travels through the worm hole and her vision of swirling galaxies, when she is at a loss for words to describe what she is seeing. We get a small taste of the enormity of the universe. And when she returns to Earth we see how puny human squabbling is in comparison, and how far our species must yet travel to reach our potential as human beings. That is the key vision Contact seeks to convey. Why, if there are so many solar systems and galaxies, have we not yet made contact? For one, more advanced civilizations may have long abandoned radio wave communication for some other medium unknown to us. More likely, they are waiting to see if we self-destruct. They don't need a Gort and Klaatu to threaten Earth if we don't behave; they probably realize planets have a self-destruct mechanism to test global cooperation we know as global warming. (Or maybe they are waiting for us to self-destruct so they can colonize the beautiful Earth.) The aliens aren't talking because it is up to us to solve our own problems without outside help, which would be a form of galactic cheating. If we're still around in 100 or 1,000 years, then we'll talk. When that time comes, what will it be like?On the other hand, there are those who say we are already talking.

Take a solid screenplay by William Goldman, put in a great director like George Roy Hill, and pair Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the two titular characters, and the end result is a hugely entertaining and witty adventure that takes us from the high plains of the West to the out-of-the-way jungles of Bolivia.Admittedly the details about the real-life late 19th century outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and their Hole-In-The-Wall gang are softened for purposes of entertainment (the real-life participants were among the most notorious badmen in the history of the Old West), but it is quite a thing to see Newman and Redford get away with so much because we can't help but like them. And when the Union Pacific railroad sends a posse after them following the blowing up of a payroll train, we fear for their lives (as they keep asking themselves Who ARE those guys?!). The two men and their schoolteacher love interest Etta Place (Katharine Ross) hightail it down to Bolivia to continue their outlaw ways; but soon, they become wanted men again as Bandidos Yanquis. Attempts by Newman and Redford to go straight by getting into the employ of an eccentric payroll master (the always-colorful Strother Martin) don't go as planned; and then it all comes down to a standoff in a small Bolivian town.BUTCH CASSIDY was released in the same year (1969) as three other radically different Westerns the more traditional John Wayne-led, Henry Hathaway-directed TRUE GRIT; Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH; and Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Although not anywhere near as violent as Peckinpah's, nor as surreal as Leone's, this film is still much more cynical than TRUE GRIT, since, like Peckinpah's film, it mourns the loss of the Old West, as progress and road agents are now strangling a once-limitless frontier and forcing outlaws and renegades south. And like Leone, it also shows even the railroad becoming more corporatized as the 20th century dawns. All of this is happening, even as Burt Bacharach's score (complete with Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head) plays on, and we see Butch and Sundance getting away with a whole lot of money and a whole lot of schemes. At the same time, however, after being told by an ornery sheriff (Jeff Corey), Your times is over! Don't you get it?!, they realize that they are probably not going to live much longer.As a result, BUTCH CASSIDY, for all the fun it shows us, is every bit as fatalistic as Leone's and Peckinpah's radical restructurings of the Western myths. And yet it is this dichotomy that makes the film such an enduring film of its genre, with Newman and Redford perfectly matched (as they would be again, and with Hill directing, in 1973 for THE STING), and superb cinematography by Conrad Hall.
