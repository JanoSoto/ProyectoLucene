A movie is general, generic, but what Kubrick did was art, but in his own right it was film, he made film.  He exposed it, he framed it, he thought about it, he pondered it, he took it over and over and over again until it reached the level of being exhaustive....but when it was bathed in its chemical bath, that is when the celluloid turned into film, when it turned into a relative state of art.Now I must admit, when I first heard that this piece was coming out, I could not believe it.

If anyone else would have attempted to make it, I would disagree, but, there are touches that he (Kubrick) had made throughout his career, that were evident on the piece.

There's always another mindless pit with guns and action that says NOTHING new nor presents nothing truly close to the human heart. Go to see Tomb Raider instead.  You will be enriched to your shallow heart's and mind's content.Here we have another shockingly beautiful performance by Haley Joel Osment, gorgeous artistic direction, and technical marvels to keep you thinking long after the movie has ended.Of course, this was Stanley Kubrick's project.  We will never know what he would have done with it.  Suffice it to say that Speilberg managed it with virtuosity, grace and aplomb.  I am sure Stanley would have loved it.The visuals, sets and matte artistry were awe-inspiring and lent themselves intimately to the story.The John Williams musical score was prodigious in it's non-intrusive nature and lovely beyond words.

The Oscar should stand for an individual performance, not for slack in the rope that needed to be tightened for past efforts.

And in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, he gives us another man's view of the war, like Stone a soldier who had become disenfranchised by the war.The man at the center of this true-life story is Ron Kovic, a Marine who believed in the myths of American might, the honor of serving one's country, John Wayne, and the threat that communism posed.  But in a firefight on a Vietnamese beach during Tet, Kovic was shot by a VC bullet and paralysed from the waist down.  As a result, he would never be able to walk again and would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  Even worse, when he returned from Vietnam, his rehabilitation was painful, and so was his coming to terms with the fact that many of his friends in his hometown of Massapequa, New York had grown either indifferent or hostile to him.  Once a love-it-or-leave-it patriot, Kovic came to realize he could be a force for Good by protesting what the Vietnam war had done, not only to his fellow servicemen but to America.This is what is at the heart of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and Stone (with help from Kovic, who collaborated with the director on the screenplay, which was based on his 1976 memoir) brings all the memories back of those traumatic years in American history.  Tom Cruise gives a fine performance as Kovic.Even more so, Stone does the right thing by debunking a lot of dangerous myths about America's anti-communist paranoia and our worshipping of John Wayne.  Unlike a previous reviewer of this film, I am of the belief that America never fully understood communism as anything more than a threat to itself, and our inability to see beyond that surface to its inherent weaknesses is what led us to the utter tragedy of Vietnam.  Furthermore, basing our patriotism on an actor like John Wayne, who NEVER served his country in reality, also turned out to be part of the recipe for disaster.BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, in my opinion, is NOT an Anti-American film but a film fundamentally about the loss of human innocence.

Being the business man that he is though, he walks around and pickes up the fed ex packages that washed ashore(there are only a few). Later in the movie he opens them, and uses a pair of ice skates to open coconuts, a dress I think to use as mocasins, and Wilson the volleyball as a friend. It's a very realistic movie, of what would happen to you and your life being on an island for four years, and how much your life would of changed back home. And for those who have seen this movie, the Wilson's death scene, for some reason makes you sad, because you realize at that point, that that is what kept him going the whole time. Or else he would of gone insane. You realize, what it would be like to be with some ball 24\/7\/365 four years, and then have it just float away. It's like losing a family member. I think anyone who's seen this movie can admit that. I really enjoyed this movie and it's definitely in my top 50 favorite movies(although it would be about half way, no farther) I for some reason just really like this movie. I have a poster in my room, next to terminator and 6th day posters...see how weird it is? This movie just grows on you. I give it 4 out of 5 stars, for being a very realistic, truthful movie.

What makes this better is that Will was about math genius and never showed an understanding of the magic and pain that accompanies that world. Here it is a slightly different type of genius, softer but more obsessive. Although `Oscar and Lucinda' did a deeper job, we do get a feel for what is involved and how obsession necessarily follows, and this is no `Grifters.'In Will, we had three men who interact with Will to braid the story a long-time childhood friend, a highlevel professor and an advisor who triggers the story. One tempts the hero into an unhealthy expression of his gift, one prompts him to `follow his heart' by giving a very personal and tragic story, and one provides nearly unqualified and admiring support. In this film, we have the same three types with the roles shifted. The writer's simple musical chairs.`Will Hunting' was an excrescence. This is better because of the talent of those three actors and because the director wisely targets the tragic dark pull of the obsession. But the film doesn't deliver.

The original film was scary and full of suspense, with a great cast as well. This remake, however, is pure garbage and shows how low film making has sunk. This remake is worse than Psycho III!My major complaint is the same so many others have. This movie is shot for shot the same as the original. That's not an honor despite what some would say. It's more of an insult and a rip off. This remake just shows the director and those involved with production have no creativity what so ever. They just ripped off what Hitchcock did. Other remade movies (whether good or bad) have demonstrated some originality, some creativity. This one, obviously doesn't. I don't even see the point of why this movie was made. Why bother go to the theater to see this movie when you could go rent the original or see it on cable?Next is the cast. While I agree that this cast has talent, you can't really seem to find it in this movie. Only Vince Vaughn is any good. He can't come close to Anthony Perkins as Norman, but he is good. His performance was somewhat original and he wasn't trying to copy Anthony.This movie has not been unfairly treated by me or anyone else who did not like it. This remake is a rip off in the truest sense of the term. In closing I'll say this I would have loved to see the MST gang take a shot at this movie. It would have made for a classic episode of the series.
