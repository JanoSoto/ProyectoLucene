She is betrayed by Lord Dudley and humiliated by an effeminate Duke of Anjou.  What a load of manure, although it is interesting to see that the British can butcher their history almost as badly as we Americans do ours (and theirs, too, for that matter).In reality, Elizabeth's true story is more compelling, in that she suffered no one to pull strings except her, unless it became mortally dangerous to do so.  Elizabeth had a marvelous political instinct, one borne out of sheer necessity, and one her sister never had.  She carefully acquired estates during both her brother's and sister's reigns, leveraging them to cement loyal support from powerful families.  She played a highly dangerous game with her sister, keeping her mollified just enough with showy attendance at Chapel Royal Mass and parrying Mary's attempt to marry her off later in Mary's reign to a Habsburg.  On the verge of losing her head for treason more than once, she showed a remarkable talent for prevarication and obfuscation, all the while preparing in real terms for her own rule as Queen.From the historical record, we know that Robert Dudley had been a serious suitor for Elizabeth, who at one point -- well after she was Queen -- had made it clear that she intended to marry him.  As shown in the movie, this scandalized the nobility, not because of some treason on Dudley's part, but just because there were already many rumors about their (supposedly) disreputable behavior together.  For political reasons, she scotched the courtship, but Dudley remained a close confidant at court.  Her romance with the Duke of Anjou came much later, when Elizabeth was in her late thirties or early forties, and she was as determined to marry Anjou as she once was to marry Dudley.  However, her Council was violently torn on the question, which infuriated Elizabeth, but as always she bowed to political reality and sent Anjou home with some lovely parting gifts.

Cecil was her life-long partner in ruling England, and while I'm sure their relationship had its ups and downs, there is no doubt that he was not only devoted to her, he was one of Elizabeth's main props for power.Anyway, apart from a few other minor issues, such as Mary Tudor's portrayal (think Snidely Whiplash, no subtlety whatsoever), the movie is pretty entertaining, a good costume drama.  It's just annoying that the film industry can't do research when they want to make historical movies.  Is there no responsibility for at least attempting some accuracy?

The friend's reaction?  Yuck.Exactly.Long review coming -- so sit, already!When this movie's trailers came out in 1999, I cringed, avoided the film, walked past its posters with my eyes averted.  I had divorced the year before, within the years of my marriage had unfortunately been a deceived wife, and had no desire to re-visit that pain.  Fast-forward to 2003 Having grown a great deal, I decided to rent what I had avoided.  I'm so glad I did.  A Walk on the Moon is a lovely, authentic film with a light-seeming yet solid screenplay, great direction, and fabulous acting by a talented cast.  (Watch the expressions of Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen, which subtly change to portray rainbows of emotions within a few seconds.)The Kantrowitzes (culturally though not particularly religiously Jewish) have rented for the umpteenth summer one of many tiny lakeside cottages owned by a Dr. Fogler in the Catskills.  Friends they've met over the years there also rent near them.  Their children (Alison, 14 -- Anna Paquin in a totally believable performance -- and Danny, 6) stay there during the week while their father Marty (Liev Schreiber) drives back and forth from NYC and his job as a TV repairman.  Caring for the children is their paternal grandmother, Lilian (Tovah Feldshuh -- wonderful!), and their mother Pearl (Diane Lane).  Pearl is 32, we learn, and Marty perhaps a year or two older. It is the summer of 1969 -- culture, music, mores are changing, and the whole family is caught up in a loss of innocence.Into their enclave of mah-jongg and Sinatra comes hippie-ish Walker Jerome (Viggo Mortensen), the new Blouse Man -- a relaxed-attitude businessman, he's bought the bus from the former blouse-man, and drives a circuit, making unscheduled stops at Dr. Fogler's to sell blouses and scarves, and later, at Pearl's suggestion (clearly she knows something about retailing, perhaps from her family-of-origin), sunglasses and jewelry.  We learn very little about Walker -- who possesses the mannerly, shy diffidence and that's cool attitude which characterized some people of the late-1960s but was often used to disguise inner struggle and pain -- although he lives alone nearby, has a vegetable garden, and reads the book A Place in the Woods (still in print, this 1969 account by Helen Hoover details how she and her husband left their jobs in Chicago to pioneer back-to-the-land in northwoods Minnesota).  We also learn that Walker's soldier-or-spook kid brother has been missing in Southeast Asia for four years.Some reviewers below mention that Pearl leads a content, middle- (or even upper-middle-) class life.  Not true.  The Kantrowitzes do not have much money (why else would Pearl's mother-in-law live with them in what, judging from the neighborhood -- first minutes of the movie -- is an apartment? And did you see the car's interior on the drive up to Fogler's?  The reason Pearl walks quite a way to the kosher butcher, getting caught in rain, is that Marty's taken their one car back to NYC.).  Marty repairs TVs, but doesn't even own the business.The back story, mentioned in passing by the grandmother and Pearl, is that one summer as a teen, Pearl visited one of the posh Catskills resorts with her family (recall the lakeside resort of Dirty Dancing or the even posher Grossinger's).  Marty worked there that summer as a waiter, earning salary and tips to attend college, then perhaps med school.  Marty spotted Pearl, was enthralled, they began to see each other over the weeks, she'd never had a boyfriend before, they made love, she got pregnant the first time.  At 17. In getting pregnant then (remember how illegal and dangerous abortion was in the summer of 1954 -- when Alison would have been conceived, if she's now 14 in the summer of 1969), in deciding to marry a young man at whom her parents were probably appalled, given their hopes for the lovely young Pearl, in becoming a wife and mother so very early, Pearl has missed out on a great deal of life.  (As has, of course, Marty, who gave up his educational plans to support wife and daughter.)Now, this summer, Pearl's daughter has her first period.  This is a major moment for a mom, as well.  Put anthropologically, Pearl is no longer the only female of reproductive age in the house.  Therefore, as happy as she is about her daughter's growth, she also feels older.  (At a mere 32, an age when many women nowadays are just marrying.)Having personally experienced what infidelity does to a family and to the betrayed spouse from a vantage point similar to Marty's, I'll say right now that the decision to be unfaithful is a poor one.  (Cliche but true  You can't solve problems within a marriage by going outside it.)  It's clear, however, that Pearl has been trying to let Marty know that there IS a problem.  It's just that she doesn't know how to bang him over the head with it, and, like most wives, wants to preserve peace.  (What's the price of peace?  Oh, yes, eternal vigilance.)Several reviewers below (male, I think) sound puzzled what makes Walker seem so attractive to Pearl?  Okay, guys, here's a partial list Walker Jerome is  handsome and Aryan-looking (in the 1960s, Jewish girls were still taught that sex was the only thing Christian boys wanted); blond, long-haired and semi-bearded, therefore exotic to Pearl; soft-spoken; polite; gracious; good-humored and smiles easily; listens to Pearl; clearly admires her physically; takes her suggestions and thanks her for them; more relaxed than Marty; a man who seems to genuinely like women; courtly; sensual (watch his hands, and his intensity when he and Pearl finally make love); kind to others (e.g., his resolution of the blouse argument between Lilian and Selma), including kids; helpful (as with Danny's wasp stings -- the irony here! since Walker Jerome is an incredibly WASPy name, and he's certainly stung Pearl).  Even Lilian, Marty's mother, displays a certain amount of respect and gratitude toward Walker when his wasp-sting techniques turn out to be better than hers.  In fact, Walker really does embody many Boy Scout virtues.  (No one in this film is obviously given to evil -- though good people can certainly do unhealthy things.)Walker wants Pearl, but she has to make the first move.  As he gets to know her, his feelings for her grow -- they're mainly visible through his eyes and mouth.  He can't offer her marriage, nor children -- she has the one, and would clearly prefer not to have more kids.  He does offer something new making love outside, sleeping under the stars, a bodily connection and sensuality she's never known.  But he knows it's Pearl's decision.  Will she remain in her marriage, or not?  If she does, will it be from love -- or from obligation?  If she doesn't, will she come with him out West?  (When he suggests that they take her kids, too, she looks close to melting.)Although Pearl feels attracted to Walker from the first time their eyes meet, she does not act on that by phoning to meet him until AFTER--  She asks her husband Marty to request more time off from his boss, so she can be with Marty more this summer at the lake, but Marty refuses even to ask;--  She suggests to Marty that they experiment a little in their lovemaking, but instead of rejoicing in a sexually-interested wife, he asks what's wrong with the way we've been doing it, and then, childlike, dresses up in their son Danny's cowboy hat and pistols;--  Alison reveals that her first menstrual period has begun, and then that she has her first date;--  Marty calls from New York to say that he can't come up this weekend, he'll be fixing TVs for people who want to watch the Apollo moon walk;--  Pearl experiences the really yucky part of being a mom (Alison, told she's not permitted to camp out at Woodstock, screams, I hate you!), and naturally wants to be perceived as lovable.As Marty asks later, was Pearl thinking when she began with Walker?  Was she thinking of anyone but herself?  Probably not.  Yet for her, infidelity is so big, so cataclysmic, that it's the accumulation of little hurts that finally turns her toward Walker.Marty finds out from his mother, and the earlier confrontation between Pearl and her mother-in-law is fascinating.  Picking blueberries together, Lilian says to Pearl, You're shtupping someone....the blouse man.  Yet she doesn't try to dissuade Pearl so much on the simple basis of betrayal, her son Marty's prospective hurt feelings, how could you do this to us?. Instead, she challenges her to act ethically, to be a mensch.  Lilian tells Pearl about Marty's dreams, too, so that Pearl will know she hasn't been alone in setting aside her own desires for Alison and Danny.  It's a wonderful scene, very mature.Whether you prefer typical American film conclusions (up) or typical European endings (down), this ending is so bittersweet that, really, you can have it both ways.  Pearl and Marty have passed the crossroads.  Perhaps they're on a new footing, perhaps they'll learn to be more open with each other.  Perhaps not.  But they've begun to recognize the truth of their marriage, and how staying stuck in each of their roles has meant the marriage hasn't grown for a while.Ten years from now, in 1979, perhaps they'll regard this summer as a terribly painful time -- that led them to rekindle their love and attention to each other.Love doesn't just sit there like a stone; it has to be made like bread, re-made all the time, made new. -- Ursula LeGuin.

(At a mere 32, an age when many women nowadays are just marrying.)Having personally experienced what infidelity does to a family and to the betrayed spouse from a vantage point similar to Marty's, I'll say right now that the decision to be unfaithful is a poor one.  (Cliche but true  You can't solve problems within a marriage by going outside it.)  It's clear, however, that Pearl has been trying to let Marty know that there IS a problem.  It's just that she doesn't know how to bang him over the head with it, and, like most wives, wants to preserve peace.  (What's the price of peace?  Oh, yes, eternal vigilance.)Several reviewers below (male, I think) sound puzzled what makes Walker seem so attractive to Pearl?  Okay, guys, here's a partial list Walker Jerome is  handsome and Aryan-looking (in the 1960s, Jewish girls were still taught that sex was the only thing Christian boys wanted); blond, long-haired and semi-bearded, therefore exotic to Pearl; soft-spoken; polite; gracious; good-humored and smiles easily; listens to Pearl; clearly admires her physically; takes her suggestions and thanks her for them; more relaxed than Marty; a man who seems to genuinely like women; courtly; sensual (watch his hands, and his intensity when he and Pearl finally make love); kind to others (e.g., his resolution of the blouse argument between Lilian and Selma), including kids; helpful (as with Danny's wasp stings -- the irony here! since Walker Jerome is an incredibly WASPy name, and he's certainly stung Pearl).  Even Lilian, Marty's mother, displays a certain amount of respect and gratitude toward Walker when his wasp-sting techniques turn out to be better than hers.  In fact, Walker really does embody many Boy Scout virtues.  (No one in this film is obviously given to evil -- though good people can certainly do unhealthy things.)Walker wants Pearl, but she has to make the first move.  As he gets to know her, his feelings for her grow -- they're mainly visible through his eyes and mouth.  He can't offer her marriage, nor children -- she has the one, and would clearly prefer not to have more kids.  He does offer something new making love outside, sleeping under the stars, a bodily connection and sensuality she's never known.  But he knows it's Pearl's decision.  Will she remain in her marriage, or not?  If she does, will it be from love -- or from obligation?  If she doesn't, will she come with him out West?  (When he suggests that they take her kids, too, she looks close to melting.)Although Pearl feels attracted to Walker from the first time their eyes meet, she does not act on that by phoning to meet him until AFTER--  She asks her husband Marty to request more time off from his boss, so she can be with Marty more this summer at the lake, but Marty refuses even to ask;--  She suggests to Marty that they experiment a little in their lovemaking, but instead of rejoicing in a sexually-interested wife, he asks what's wrong with the way we've been doing it, and then, childlike, dresses up in their son Danny's cowboy hat and pistols;--  Alison reveals that her first menstrual period has begun, and then that she has her first date;--  Marty calls from New York to say that he can't come up this weekend, he'll be fixing TVs for people who want to watch the Apollo moon walk;--  Pearl experiences the really yucky part of being a mom (Alison, told she's not permitted to camp out at Woodstock, screams, I hate you!), and naturally wants to be perceived as lovable.As Marty asks later, was Pearl thinking when she began with Walker?  Was she thinking of anyone but herself?  Probably not.  Yet for her, infidelity is so big, so cataclysmic, that it's the accumulation of little hurts that finally turns her toward Walker.Marty finds out from his mother, and the earlier confrontation between Pearl and her mother-in-law is fascinating.  Picking blueberries together, Lilian says to Pearl, You're shtupping someone....the blouse man.  Yet she doesn't try to dissuade Pearl so much on the simple basis of betrayal, her son Marty's prospective hurt feelings, how could you do this to us?. Instead, she challenges her to act ethically, to be a mensch.  Lilian tells Pearl about Marty's dreams, too, so that Pearl will know she hasn't been alone in setting aside her own desires for Alison and Danny.  It's a wonderful scene, very mature.Whether you prefer typical American film conclusions (up) or typical European endings (down), this ending is so bittersweet that, really, you can have it both ways.  Pearl and Marty have passed the crossroads.  Perhaps they're on a new footing, perhaps they'll learn to be more open with each other.  Perhaps not.  But they've begun to recognize the truth of their marriage, and how staying stuck in each of their roles has meant the marriage hasn't grown for a while.Ten years from now, in 1979, perhaps they'll regard this summer as a terribly painful time -- that led them to rekindle their love and attention to each other.Love doesn't just sit there like a stone; it has to be made like bread, re-made all the time, made new. -- Ursula LeGuin.

However, when we piece everything together, maybe it wasn't an accident at all, maybe he knew exactly where she would be that day. You see, he claims to be from the year 2470, Iowa on the Atlantic coast, where they have learned the art of back traveling.some SPOILERS -- Like K-Pax the viewer has to decide whether the main character actually was what he claimed to be, or just crazy. As the events unfold most of us decide that he really is a back traveler, for several reasons. First, he appears to know that she will die on a certain day, at a certain intersection in NYC, run over by a taxi driver. Second, he meets up with someone he claims he recognizes from 2469, who must have back traveled a year earlier. And third, it appears near the end of the film that Tomei's shrink is also a back traveler. more SPOILERS - A side-effect of back traveling almost 500 years is that you have some residual oscillations which occasionally make things continue go backwards for short periods. The film actually begins with people and traffic in the street moving in reverse, then forward, as he watches from a window. Later, he gets nauseated during a dinner with her parents when he is watching food come out of the mother's mouth, re-assemble itself on the fork, then move onto her plate, not yet eaten. This ultimately works to his advantage when, in spite of his warnings, she leaves the apartment and is about to cross the street at the fatal intersection. He gets there and, as the speeding car is about 6 inches from mowing her down, he is able to back travel for a few seconds, just long enough to clear the path and save her.D'Onofrio and Tomei are two of my very favorite actors and both are fine in this film. The story is captivating and very believable, within the context of a science fiction film. One of the better ones I have seen lately, a good break from the great mediocrity of films put out in recent years.

Michelle Pfeiffer played the change in Rita's character throughout the film very well too and she continues to look fantastic.But the star of this film has to be the amazingly talented and beautiful Dakota Fanning as Lucy.  Her acting is so natural, with body language and facial expressions true for every emotion and situation.  She was there to be loved and carried it off superbly.  Not once did she look lost amongst this celebrated company, incredible considering they were all producing near career best performances themselves.*** Possible spoilers ***Sure, there were unbelievable elements to the story, the most serious of which was the reason for Sam's arrest.  And, after Lucy had her first night time 'escape' to visit her father, endangering herself by crossing roads and climbing ladders, are we really to believe she was allowed to repeat the exercise many more times!  However, many of the events causing criticism I consider to have been misunderstood by the critics.  The film is often ambiguous about certain situations or simply lacking in information.  How was Sam able to cope with Lucy during her first seven years?  The film makes no statement that he did it on his own so why should the viewer believe this to be the case.  Many critics appear to believe that the final uplifting scene of the film is also unrealistic.  There would be no way in reality that Sam would regain full custody of Lucy, however much we would wish it to happen.  But where in that scene does it suggest that he has?  Around the football field we see all the major players of a wonderful support network for Sam and Lucy.  Any one of them might have day to day care of Lucy, perhaps allowing Sam unlimited access.  We don't know, and I think it is to the film's credit that it allows the viewer to imagine their own ending.*** End of spoilers ***The superb music is very appropriate with individual songs chosen carefully to complement the screen action. There are two soundtrack albums available, one with all the Beatles cover songs and the other with John Powell's incidental music.  Both are very worthwhile and recommended.In conclusion, a remarkable film, worth watching even if only to see and admire the true art of acting.

The basic macho American mantra `Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone; push me too far and I'll fight' is ever-present, as well as the theme of progress and order-although the coming of that progress, order and eventual civilization, of course, will spell the end of the very lifestyle these characters fight for.A huge comeback for Alan Ladd, Shane is also a very good portrayal of very real people, facing very real challenges. It is magnificently crafted, exquisitely filmed and wonderfully acted. Shane has to stand among the genre's greatest films.SPOILERS AHEADLadd revives a sagging career with a tremendous performance as the withdrawn, unobtrusive, yet proud and gutsy Shane. A mysterious character-we don't even know if Shane is his first or last name, Shane happens by the Joe Starrett farm and winds up staying for a spell. Starrett (Van Heflin) is the leader of a pack of homesteading farmers being harassed and threatened by an unscrupulous cattle baron, Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer). Although one can predict how the movie will end long before the climactic scene arrives, the build-up toward the climax is nevertheless rivoting.Aside from the traditional machismo, yet honorable male code of ethics, the film also displays a less often seen angle. As in The Searchers, the happily married wife (Jean Arthur) is obviously attracted to Shane. Although nothing inappropriate is done or said, the mutual attraction becomes obvious to Starrett-capped, of course, with the deliciously ironic line by young Joey Starrett (Brandon de Wilde) at the end, `&#133;and my mother wants you, Shane! I KNOW she does!'Another thing that lifts Shane above the normal genre fare is the deep characterization. These are not one or two-dimensional characters. The villains are no more cardboardish than the protagonists. When the bearded Ryker gives an impassioned speech to the Starrett family about how the old-time ranchers worked and bled and fought to make the area what it is, only to be fenced out of their water, etc., it may not swing many viewers to his side-yet it does show us that Ryker HAS a point of view. In the end, both Ryker AND Starrett proclaim that they are willing to kill the other to hang onto what they feel rightly belongs to them. While our loyalty stays with Starrett and Shane, the enemy is no mere sadistic cardboard bad guy. Even the delightfully sardonic gunslinger Jack Wilson (played wonderfully by Jack Palance) has some humanity. While he seems to truly enjoy his work (and his grin is as chilling as it would be playing Dracula 20 years later!), he does make an effort to avoid fighting Shane-someone other than the man whom he has been hired to kill.The other farmers are a fascinating collection, with pint-sized Confederate fireball Frank `Stonewall' Torrey (Elisha Cook, Jr.), lanky, cautious Swede Axel Shipstead (Douglas Spencer) and garrulous old fart Fred Lewis (the beloved Edgar Buchanan) and their families. I get a lump in my throat seeing Stonewall's faithful hound whine and paw sadly at his master's coffin as it is lowered into its grave. The entire cast is strong.Of course Arthur, as Marion Starrett, deservedly gets second billing behind Ladd. A sweet-natured beauty, she is obviously happy with her husband and son. Yet her eyes do roam onto the mysterious stranger in their midst. Little Joey is probably right; his mother probably DOES want Shane. Yet, as in A Tale of Two Cities, Shane does the `far, far better thing' and meets the gunman in Starrett's place-albeit very much against Joe's will.Overall, this is a very satisfying movie. Other than the music being a tad overbearing at times (such as Shane's fateful ride into town to face Ryker and Wilson), it is one that seems to be without any real flaws.

Early in the film, Isak has an apparition within a dream and the small events leading up to it, within the dream, are quite brilliant. Throughout the rest of the film there are dreams and recollections; newly discovered secrets of the past that Isak sees for the first time. As he says in the film, Dreams, as if I must tell myself something I won't listen to when I'm awake.How Bergman shows us the characters is terrific. It's a like a relaxed puzzle that doesn't emphasize any sort of urgency to figure things out. The story unfolds beautifully as we get a deeper sense of Isak, who I assume is an alter ago of Ingmar Bergman at that stage of his life (he was thirty-nine when the film was released).It pains me to know that the majority of people my age would rather watch an Adam Sandler movie or The Rock than something like this. Hey, I liked Big Daddy and I love Nicolas Cage, but Wild Strawberries is one of the few films I've seen that could possibly change the way I live my life. I'm always interested in listening to what aged people have to say about their own life because, well, it can only give me tips about my own, and that's what this film does in a way.There is one sequence in the film that is frightening and arty, and I don't completely grasp what it means beyond Isak's deterioration and his realization of how people actually feel towards him (he's told earlier in the film as well, but he seems to accept this verdict more readily), but it doesn't take away from the film; rather, it's an interesting addition to an otherwise satisfying experience. In fact, it's probably the most vital part of the movie -- Isak may not like it, bbut once he gets past it, he has the option to develop.I don't know if the film is a masterpiece -- it's my introduction to Bergman, so once I see Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, Persona and The Seventh Seal (if I can get through it, this time) I'll come back to this film with a new perspective, or at least see it as a part of Bergman's whole.

I've had the habit of deriding this film many times with friends on late-night movie binges. Sure, it's an easy enough film to laugh at; from the hilariously out-of-place folk music at the begging of the film, to the wanton Tits-and-Ass segments which sprinkle the mise en scene in a pathetically-transparent-yet-trademarkingly-70's attempt to keep our attention focused to the story, to the absurd nude dancing sequence in which a trope blonde shimmies against a bedroom wall, this movie has all the right ingredients for a cinematic train wreck. However, unlike countless other films which deserve their place in the annals of B-moviedom for whatever ironic, cheesy, or perhaps politically dated elements that can be found under the lens of couch-potato analysis, there exists some primal element about The Wicker Man which fascinates me, and subsequently begs me to come back for viewing after viewing. I remain baffled each and every time I finish watching this film, unable to put my finger on exactly what it is about this movie that makes it so compelling. Finally, I think that I have a vague idea as to why. \t \tFirst, there is the notion that this film evades any form of categorical summation. The Wicker Man is not a horror film - or if it is, it certainly isn't done in the traditional vain of the genre. The film's climax is certainly horror-like, it is the unveiling of an underling 'horror' that has been hidden all along. The film's ending aside, not a single person dies throughout the unfolding of the plot. The Wicker Man is also not a comedy, although the purposefully silly dialogue at times (NO, I DOES NOT REFRESH ME!!) coupled with a hilarious classroom discussion of the use of phallic symbols in western culture is both smart and well-crafted satire. The Wicker Man is not a romance, although Sergeant Howie's subliminal want to disregard his religious faith and submit to his desires for Miss Rose becomes a pivotal element to the plot. The Wicker Man is not a musical, while the first bar room scene (The innkeeper's daughter?!), the aforementioned bedroom fantasy scene, and the May Day scenes would hint otherwise. In essence, The Wicker Man has all these things, but its totality is not an exemplification of any single part. It is the confluence and the concatenation of many individual themes and elements, making it a movie in a league of its own.  \t \tThe Wicker Man is a story of what it means to lose one's identity. It is an extremely postmodern film in that 1) as stated earlier, it evades a cinematic category, but is more a grouping of all those things, and 2) The film itself is a comment on how we as people are the collection of ideas and information that creates our cultures. The Wicker Man is the story of a man who is forced to question, and essentially abandon, both faith in culture and faith in a Christian God. Many would argue (yes, especially the post moderns) that they are one in the same.  \t \tSergeant Howie arrives at the island looking for Rowan Morrison, a missing girl who he believes to have been murdered. Throughout his search, he is fooled, lied to, and manipulated by the townsfolk in an attempt to dissuade him from furthering the investigation. Howie is disgusted by the island's Pagan leanings, and uses his Christian faith as a means of looking down upon them and reassuring himself of his superiority, all while using his status as a policeman to intimidate them into submission. Howie believes that Morrison is dead at this point, yet he remains tenacious as his search progresses, looking for a body and a motive behind her murder. At this point, we notice that Howie begins to eulogize the missing girl. He makes a wooden cross out of sticks when looking for her body in the graveyard, he scolds the girl's mother and teacher for their lack of Christian teachings, and her carries her photograph in his breast pocket at all times. In essence, Rowan Morrison becomes an extension of the Virgin Mary. She has been transformed into the Christian model of femininity Purity, chastity, and innocence. Rowan Morrison is now a legend, a myth, and a metaphor in Howe's mind.  He seeks to find her because it is his duty to defend the myth and the root of his beliefs. \t \tIn the end, Howie discovers that Morrison was alive the entire time. He attempts to rescue her, his Christian faith telling him that it is his duty to protect the chaste and pure. However, she deceives him and eventually leads him to a mob that seeks to sacrifice him for the crops of the island. He learns that Morrison was a rouse the entire time, and thus his idea of the chaste female, and all the Christian connotations that comes with it, was a product of his imagination. The legend he created and propagated was the result of an inherently corrupt belief system, and in the final moments of his life he sees that he lived a life searching for a truth that never existed. As Howie is captured by the villagers, he begins to pray, asking God to save him from the inevitable fate of being burned alive as sacrifice.  As he is placed inside the Wicker Man, and as the flames begin to sear his flesh, he yells the words Oh God! It is at this moment that he stumbles upon his most feared revelation In his darkest hour, after years of subservience and chastity, Howie knows that God would not hear his screams. This is the existential ends, the very Nausea that Jean Paul Sartre spoke of; to stumble upon the tragic realization that one lives in a world without God. In the final seconds of the film, the camera lifts up from the burning visage of The Wicker Man and we see a setting sun. Nature's own ubiquity prevails over the spiritual. The absolutes of a physical world will always triumph over the epochs of our fallible beliefs and the cultures they create.A terrible movie?

Sure, it's an easy enough film to laugh at; from the hilariously out-of-place folk music at the begging of the film, to the wanton Tits-and-Ass segments which sprinkle the mise en scene in a pathetically-transparent-yet-trademarkingly-70's attempt to keep our attention focused to the story, to the absurd nude dancing sequence in which a trope blonde shimmies against a bedroom wall, this movie has all the right ingredients for a cinematic train wreck. However, unlike countless other films which deserve their place in the annals of B-moviedom for whatever ironic, cheesy, or perhaps politically dated elements that can be found under the lens of couch-potato analysis, there exists some primal element about The Wicker Man which fascinates me, and subsequently begs me to come back for viewing after viewing. I remain baffled each and every time I finish watching this film, unable to put my finger on exactly what it is about this movie that makes it so compelling. Finally, I think that I have a vague idea as to why. \t \tFirst, there is the notion that this film evades any form of categorical summation. The Wicker Man is not a horror film - or if it is, it certainly isn't done in the traditional vain of the genre. The film's climax is certainly horror-like, it is the unveiling of an underling 'horror' that has been hidden all along. The film's ending aside, not a single person dies throughout the unfolding of the plot. The Wicker Man is also not a comedy, although the purposefully silly dialogue at times (NO, I DOES NOT REFRESH ME!!) coupled with a hilarious classroom discussion of the use of phallic symbols in western culture is both smart and well-crafted satire. The Wicker Man is not a romance, although Sergeant Howie's subliminal want to disregard his religious faith and submit to his desires for Miss Rose becomes a pivotal element to the plot. The Wicker Man is not a musical, while the first bar room scene (The innkeeper's daughter?!), the aforementioned bedroom fantasy scene, and the May Day scenes would hint otherwise. In essence, The Wicker Man has all these things, but its totality is not an exemplification of any single part. It is the confluence and the concatenation of many individual themes and elements, making it a movie in a league of its own.  \t \tThe Wicker Man is a story of what it means to lose one's identity. It is an extremely postmodern film in that 1) as stated earlier, it evades a cinematic category, but is more a grouping of all those things, and 2) The film itself is a comment on how we as people are the collection of ideas and information that creates our cultures. The Wicker Man is the story of a man who is forced to question, and essentially abandon, both faith in culture and faith in a Christian God. Many would argue (yes, especially the post moderns) that they are one in the same.  \t \tSergeant Howie arrives at the island looking for Rowan Morrison, a missing girl who he believes to have been murdered. Throughout his search, he is fooled, lied to, and manipulated by the townsfolk in an attempt to dissuade him from furthering the investigation. Howie is disgusted by the island's Pagan leanings, and uses his Christian faith as a means of looking down upon them and reassuring himself of his superiority, all while using his status as a policeman to intimidate them into submission. Howie believes that Morrison is dead at this point, yet he remains tenacious as his search progresses, looking for a body and a motive behind her murder. At this point, we notice that Howie begins to eulogize the missing girl. He makes a wooden cross out of sticks when looking for her body in the graveyard, he scolds the girl's mother and teacher for their lack of Christian teachings, and her carries her photograph in his breast pocket at all times. In essence, Rowan Morrison becomes an extension of the Virgin Mary. She has been transformed into the Christian model of femininity Purity, chastity, and innocence. Rowan Morrison is now a legend, a myth, and a metaphor in Howe's mind.  He seeks to find her because it is his duty to defend the myth and the root of his beliefs. \t \tIn the end, Howie discovers that Morrison was alive the entire time. He attempts to rescue her, his Christian faith telling him that it is his duty to protect the chaste and pure. However, she deceives him and eventually leads him to a mob that seeks to sacrifice him for the crops of the island. He learns that Morrison was a rouse the entire time, and thus his idea of the chaste female, and all the Christian connotations that comes with it, was a product of his imagination. The legend he created and propagated was the result of an inherently corrupt belief system, and in the final moments of his life he sees that he lived a life searching for a truth that never existed. As Howie is captured by the villagers, he begins to pray, asking God to save him from the inevitable fate of being burned alive as sacrifice.  As he is placed inside the Wicker Man, and as the flames begin to sear his flesh, he yells the words Oh God! It is at this moment that he stumbles upon his most feared revelation In his darkest hour, after years of subservience and chastity, Howie knows that God would not hear his screams. This is the existential ends, the very Nausea that Jean Paul Sartre spoke of; to stumble upon the tragic realization that one lives in a world without God. In the final seconds of the film, the camera lifts up from the burning visage of The Wicker Man and we see a setting sun. Nature's own ubiquity prevails over the spiritual.

It really hit home with the family storyline. Because there are only 4 central characters, they are all extremely likeable and fleshed-out. The acting is superb, and you really feel a genuine family feeling (particularly at the dinnertable scene, which still makes me emotional). The children in this movie are great (the little girl steals the show whenever she speaks). Gibson is great... like Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense, this is probably the most mature role that he's had yet. Joaquin Phoenix is HILARIOUS, and he played well off of Gibson. I read a review on this site about how you can see microphones in almost every scene. Truthfully, I saw Signs in a real theatre and I did not see any microphones. However, when I came to college and saw it again when it was showing at the school theatre, I did see the microphones. I thought, Thank God they weren't in the real edition that I saw, because they really did ruin the movie, especially with everyone laughing at the mics popping up during very intense scenes. Just know that the real movie does not have the microphones (do you honestly think Shymalan-whose name I cannot spell-and the producers would let something like that slide?). There must be a really early, uncut, or maybe just off-center edition floating around. Anyway, I love this movie. As everyone else has said, the suspense is handled extremely well by a masterful director. For those who have been bitching about unrealistic plotlines, get over it; how the hell can anyone know how aliens would act in a completely new environment? And if I were a member of a desperate species on the brink of extinction, I sure as hell would get to the first planet that I could in order to get nourishment, regardless of any impending weather such as rain. The one thing that I will gripe about with this movie is that seeing the alien is not so much of a letdown, but more awkward than not. When you see the alien on the TV (both in the news AND at the end through the reflection), it is quite well-done and terrifying. However, I would have rather not seen the alien as clearly as they showed it during the climax, because the computer generated effects took a great deal away from the movie. But to the filmmakers' credit, from the amount of suspense that this movie builds up, it would have been impossible to lead to anything that will please everyone (especially in the way that the alien looks). Other than the alien, the story's main strength is the family. It's one of the best *family* films that I have ever seen, really. The message of faith, not so much (to me) in a higher power, but in your family and in love, was quite powerful. And to top it all off, it's funny as hell. I still laugh at every part that I originally laughed at. Watch Signs... you'll laugh, you'll cry... hell, you'll probably soil yourself too.

The town was dark, except for one little shop in town so Jiminy went inside. This was the home of clockmaker Gepetto. He was a master at wood working and make clocks, music boxes, and toys all out of wood. One project he was currently working on was a marionette. Gepetto's companions consisted of Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish. Before going to bed, Gepetto made a wish on the wishing star that the marionette, which he had named Pinocchio, would be a real boy. Then they all went to sleep and soon, in came the Blue Fairy. She gave Pinocchio the gift of life and told him that half of Gepetto's wish came true for Pinocchio was still made of wood but to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish and must learn right and wrong and temptation. Jiminy explains that a conscience explains those things so the Blue Fairy knights Jiminy Pinocchio's conscience then disappears. Gepetto is awakened and freaks out when he sees Pinocchio alive, but soon calms down and is overjoyed that his wish came true. They soon go to bed and the next day, Gepetto sends Pinocchio off to school.       Not too far away, a conniving fox named Honest John and his dopey cat assistant Giddy, were walking along. Honest John learned that evil gypsy Stromboli was back in town and he wanted to find an act for him. When he saw Pinocchio, he thought he'd be perfect so Honest John talks Pinocchio out of going to school and instead becoming an actor. So Honest John and Giddy coax Pinocchio away, telling him all the wonderful things that come with an actor's life a high silk hat and a silver cane, a watch of gold with a diamond chain. Jiminy Cricket arrives then and tries to talk Pinocchio out of doing this but Honest John talked him right back into it. Stromboli was thrilled with Pinocchio's performance that night but when Pinocchio wanted to go home, Stromboli locked him in a bird cage, said he was forbidden to go home and what's worse when Pinocchio got too old, that mean old Stromboli would chop him up for fire wood. Luckily, Jiminy arrived then to wish Pinocchio luck when he found out his situation and unsuccessfully tried to rescue him. The Blue Fairy arrived then and Pinocchio lied about his predicament which caused his nose to grow very long. Pinocchio and Jiminy promised they'd do good so Blue Fairy released them and returned Pinocchio's nose to normal length. Meanwhile, Gepetto went looking for Pinocchio; Honest John and Giddy met with their client, Coachman, who was gathering a group of troublemaking boys and taking them to Pleasure Island for his own evil purposes. Honest John would be paid handsomely if he brought Coachman some more boys.         En route home, Pinocchio ran into Honest John who told him that he was allergic and the only cure was a vacation to Pleasure Island so Pinocchio went with him once again. The boat sailed at midnight and soon they all arrive on Pleasure Island which was the ultimate amusement park. Not only was there rides and games, but they distributed cigars and alcohol to the kids. Coachman had an evil plot to let the boys have all the fun they could have, making jackasses of themselves. Literally! Some hours later, the park was deserted. Only Pinocchio and his new friend Lampwick, who were playing pool. Jiminy decided to leave Pinocchio and stumbled upon Coachman's diobolical scheme the boys had literally made jackasses of themselves and Coachman was selling them to salt mines. Lampwich had transformed into a donkey and Pinocchio had sprouted long ears and a tail. Luckily he and Jiminy escaped Pleasure Island in time and returned home to find it deserted. They then get word that Gepetto, Figaro and Cleo had been swallowed by a whale, Monstro. Pinocchio set out to rescue them. Jiminy went along. At the bottom of the sea, Jiminy and Pinocchio asked around for Monstro and all the fish swam away. Pinocchio and Jiminy soon run into Monstro, who swallows them. Pinocchio is reunited with Gepetto and they make their escape onto land. Gepetto survives fortunately but poor Pinocchio doesn't. At home, Gepetto, Figaro, Cleo and Jiminy are distraught. Suddenly, wooden Pinocchio transforms into a real boy and is alive again! Gepetto is overjoyed and they all live happily ever after.        Good Disney film. The second animated feature from Walt Disney. The first being Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs! This movie will make kids think twice about playing hooky from school because look what happens to the kids in this movie they turned into donkeys! That scene is somewhat terrifying, but that's what happens when kids have TOO MUCH fun. They just don't make animated features like this one anymore! Pinocchio had several movie versions, like a 1996 version which featured Martin Landau and Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the voice of a CGI Pinocchio and just recently, 2002, a Pinocchio movie came out. But nothing beats the Disney version, which is true for other fairy tale movies, so anyway, kids and adults alike will like Pinocchio, I recommend it!- ","genre":null},{"date":"22 January 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  CONTAINS SPOILERS       One night, Jiminy Cricket enters the town of Milano.

The town was dark, except for one little shop in town so Jiminy went inside. This was the home of clockmaker Gepetto. He was a master at wood working and make clocks, music boxes, and toys all out of wood. One project he was currently working on was a marionette. Gepetto's companions consisted of Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish. Before going to bed, Gepetto made a wish on the wishing star that the marionette, which he had named Pinocchio, would be a real boy. Then they all went to sleep and soon, in came the Blue Fairy. She gave Pinocchio the gift of life and told him that half of Gepetto's wish came true for Pinocchio was still made of wood but to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish and must learn right and wrong and temptation. Jiminy explains that a conscience explains those things so the Blue Fairy knights Jiminy Pinocchio's conscience then disappears. Gepetto is awakened and freaks out when he sees Pinocchio alive, but soon calms down and is overjoyed that his wish came true. They soon go to bed and the next day, Gepetto sends Pinocchio off to school.       Not too far away, a conniving fox named Honest John and his dopey cat assistant Giddy, were walking along. Honest John learned that evil gypsy Stromboli was back in town and he wanted to find an act for him. When he saw Pinocchio, he thought he'd be perfect so Honest John talks Pinocchio out of going to school and instead becoming an actor. So Honest John and Giddy coax Pinocchio away, telling him all the wonderful things that come with an actor's life a high silk hat and a silver cane, a watch of gold with a diamond chain. Jiminy Cricket arrives then and tries to talk Pinocchio out of doing this but Honest John talked him right back into it. Stromboli was thrilled with Pinocchio's performance that night but when Pinocchio wanted to go home, Stromboli locked him in a bird cage, said he was forbidden to go home and what's worse when Pinocchio got too old, that mean old Stromboli would chop him up for fire wood. Luckily, Jiminy arrived then to wish Pinocchio luck when he found out his situation and unsuccessfully tried to rescue him. The Blue Fairy arrived then and Pinocchio lied about his predicament which caused his nose to grow very long. Pinocchio and Jiminy promised they'd do good so Blue Fairy released them and returned Pinocchio's nose to normal length. Meanwhile, Gepetto went looking for Pinocchio; Honest John and Giddy met with their client, Coachman, who was gathering a group of troublemaking boys and taking them to Pleasure Island for his own evil purposes. Honest John would be paid handsomely if he brought Coachman some more boys.

This is my favorite film of all time. It ranks right up on my top ten. Every time i sit down and watch this movie, I lose track of time and I'm sucked into this fictional world. There are a million things that I love about this film. First there's the story structure. Tarantino loves to turn his movies upside down and inside out. He follows a non linear story telling structure. Some people dont like this form of storytelling. For me I think it's a good idea that I usually dont see that often in movies. The dialogue in pulp gets fresher and fresher after each viewing. The reason why i think it does this is because most movies i see have the same type of dialogue. So when i see a movie like this it still seems new to me. A conversation about fast food before the hitmen go to kill off some guys usually doesnt occur in movies. Tarantino knew this when he wrote it and is very original. Another thing I love is the camera. It seems like it is a character in and of itself. I also like the actors in this film. I just wish i could step into their shoes and experience the world through their eyes. My favorite of all of them is Sam the man Jackson. His character is very well developed. The dialogue that he is given becomes somewhat of an entity. Upon many viewings I caught different things I had not noticed from before. One example of this is in the opening sequence. When I saw it for the first time on dvd I caught john travoltas charcter walking to the bathroom while pumpkin and honey bunny are talking. That and many other scenes just get better and better each time i see it. By the end of the year I'll probably have had watched it for the trillionth time. When I have kids of my own I will show them this masterpiece. And by the time im old decrepped and in a retirement home I will have seen it to an eternity.

Although some performance and execution flaws might outweigh any uniqueness in the eyes of most viewers, for what it attempts to do -- in taking on the task of making a sequel that shouldn't have been made, defying many expectations along the way -- I give this box office flop a B--.In case you missed BW2, or don't you feel you have the stomach for it, not to worry Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, the creative team behind the first Blair Witch, are reportedly working on BW3 the attack of the prequels.

As a rule, sequels are not only inferior to the originals but oftentimes just plain bad, especially by the time we get around to a third film.  There are exceptions, however, and Exorcist III comes fairly close to the mark.The plot is based on William Peter Blatty's novel Legion, which was a semi-sequel to The Exorcist.  Those expecting a retread of the first film will mostly be disappointed, since the story is actually about the investigation of serial murders in Georgetown.  Additionally, the story benefits by not following the characers of Chris & Regan MacNeil, instead developing the characters of Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer.  Jason Miller also returns as Father Karras...well, sort of.Once again I'm inclined to grieve over what could have been instead of what was actually created.  For one, I was bothered by the replacement of Lee J. Cobb with George C. Scott.  Likewise, Ed Flanders replaces Rev. William O'Malley as Father Dyer.  Jason Miller as Karras is the only familiar face in the trio of returning characters, which is ironic since Father Karras is the last character you'd expect to see pop up in an Exorcist sequel (since he pretty much died at the end of the original story).The film also suffers from dialogue that I found to be confusing and pretentious.  The characters do not often interact with one another in any manner that reflects real life, and several dream sequences come off as laughable.  What's worse, the conclusion has very clearly been tampered with.  It appears that the producers decided that you couldn't have a movie called Exorcist III without an exorcism in it, so the character of Father Morning seems to have been added in post-production.And yet, Exorcist III remains effective in spite of its flaws.  William Peter Blatty does a great job in creating a series of visual references that come together as the plot concludes, giving us a series of bizarre events and behaviors that are later validated and explained.  Brad Dourif delivers a multifaceted performance in what could have been an embarassingly stilted role as the spiritual entity, managing to be both amusing and scary (sometimes within the same sentence).  Jason Miller's role is mostly thankless, but he does get to do some real acting that echoes his brilliant performance in the first film.The cinematography is also excellent, including one sequence that is played out in a long, nearly unbroken shot with the camera mostly stationary.  The effect is startling, although the use of a shameless musical stinger on the soundtrack has a lot to do with the jolt.If Blatty had been able to iron out the rough edges, this would have definitely been on par with the original.  As it stands, it's an unsettling film with a great sense of atmosphere and an intriguing plot, which is pretty admirable considering the producers decided to play this up as an Exorcist sequel.  It could stand on its own quite nicely without these elements.
