This had the potential to be Kevin Smith's best work in my opinion, but many factors held him back.  First of all the main goal of Universal was for this film was to be a hard R film with a teen audience in mind.  They were calling it a Smart Porkys, because it had that snappy humor, but it had tits in it to attract teenage males.  Director\/Writer Kevin Smith and Producer Scott Mosier wanted to make a studio film in hopes of making lots of money to fund more independent films.  Neither goal was really met, this film tanked at the box-office. It grossed only 3 million in total; meaning this film lost money with a total cost of 6 million.  This film had high hopes, all tests were good, but why was it such a dud?  Well I blame it on several factors, First of all Jim Jacks; the executive producer ruined this film.  Kevin Smith may not be the greatest director, but he is a great writer, the two set each other off making Kevin a solid filmmaker, but Jim Jacks was always holding him back by forcing Kevin to cut down on the vulgar dialog as well as graphic scenes. One scene was known as the cum in the hair joke that was later made famous in 'There's Something About Mary', but many people at universal including Jim Jacks were holding Kevin back from making the movie he wanted.  If you know Kevin's work, you will notice this is his only film where the word cock is never used.  It's just tossed around in Clerks' and common in his 3 other films.  It's that raw, real humor and language that many fans like about his writing.  Jim Jacks stressed that Potty Mouth (yes those were his words) be cut down.  Even though there is nudity, and they want that R rating, they still had to cut back on the f***s and other rude language, but that's not what really held this film back.  Gramercy Pictures, who were in charge of promoting this film, really did a poor job on making this movie known.  They used the tag line Starring Shannon Doherty and Jason Lee, someone you hate, and someone you've never even heard of. That really doesn't help promote the film in anyway.  Then they asked Kevin and Scott to think of a good poster, now Kevin and Scott didn't think of hey what would make people want to check out our movie? they wanted what would look cool on my wall?  The comic book cover poster is cool, but doesn't say much for the film, and it was the only poster made for the film. Some idiots were thrown off by it. Oh well. Also, the casting for this film was just okay, I was happy with Jason Lee as Brodie,  perfect job on that, but Jeremy London as T.S.?  Jeremy London is not that good of an actor, and just doesn't seem right for the part.  Then Claire Forlani as Brandy was okay, but I could hear that British accent coming out at times.  And then Shannon Doherty as Rene, first of all she really didn't seem thrilled to be in this movie, she never hung around the set, she would take off when she was done working.  Plus lots of people (the public) didn't like her at the time; she had a reputation as a wild one.  I think Kevin should have gone with his instinct and used Joey Lauren Adams.  I think she would have been perfect for that part.  They just barely got Jason Mewes to play Jay.  Universal didn't want jay to play jay, they wanted Seth Green or Breckin Meyer, but even they realized that Jay should be Jay, Jay is based on the way Jason Mewes really is.  I do think that Affleck was good as an asshole, but he probably could have played T.S. better than London.  Renee Humphrey as Trish was good, they almost cast Jennifer Love Hewitt instead, but she seems too cute and innocent to play that part.  Kevin Smith claims he could have made this film (probably better) with less money.  I mean look at how good 'Chasing Amy' is with a quarter million dollar budget.  Smith said that six million was just too much.  He hates losing money for people, if this movie was done with just a million dollars, it would have been just as good.  I agree.  Also, (now this is where I get a bit picky) the original opening of this film was cut, and for good reason, it sucked, it was not funny at all, nor was it even somewhat realistic.  If you watch closely, some dialog in this film is dubbed over and doesn't match the actor's mouth. This is because almost all references to that cut opening had to be cut, but it was too late to reshoot and in some instances, not possible to cut out of a scene.  This film was not a total disaster.  I believe it did pay for itself and probably profit when you include video rental where it was more popular than in theaters. Now when you take all of this into consideration, you see how great this film could have been.  Despite all of its flaws, Mallrats is still one of my favorite films, and definitely my favorite comedy.  I suggest you check it out if you liked Kevin's other work or even if you haven't, this one is probably the one that is most unlike his others.  I still give it a 10\/10, but it could have been an 11.P.S. Check out the commentary on the DVD if you know about Kevin Smith and View Askew well, it's very funny to an askewniverse fan.

(may contain spoilers) Psycho was released during the year of 1960. It was director Alfred Hitchcock's response to a frenzy created by the media's first publicized serial killer Ed Gein. Psycho brings back memories of a time when film was just as much about story as it was style. Hitchcock embodied that, a true storyteller at heart. He was an inventor, using misbegotten images and twisting them into something darkly erotic through voyeuristic tendencies presided inside of characters. Hitchcock didn't make films to scare the audience with what happens, he made films to scare the audience with what they shouldn't see but can't help but want to. I have always said that it is not hard to scare an audience if the initiative is there, but it takes a true mastermind to produce scares that will not take away from the films point, rather uphold it. Hitchcock was that mastermind. Who else could have made a murder scene in which we see a victim stabbed to death but never once actually witness the knife penetrate the flesh and still have it disturb audiences forty years later? The story to Psycho is simple, given the routine inspection. The idea, on the other hand is complex, twisting and turning around corners and bends, leading the audience to grasp onto central ideas and characterization only to turn it around and reinvent itself, as if to have never even implied any motives in the first place. That was Hitchcock's way. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane. We open to a scene of her with her secret lover. She has a headache and is going to work; they may never see each other again. Our interest has already flared. After arriving at work Marion asks for the rest of the day off after she takes an envelope filled with forty thousand dollars in cash to the bank (a client's payment on a new home). But instead of depositing the money she skips town without telling anyone and checks in at the Bates Motel. Here she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who ensures her that he has a vacancy, `in fact I have twelve. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.'  Normal takes a liking to the girl, he is lonely and has no one but his mother. He watches Marion through a hole in the wall of his parlour; he even invites her up to his hillside home for diner. His mother won't allow this, she is much to overbearing we learn, not from seeing her but understanding her through voiced assumption. Mystery begins to peak. This all seems minimal, it isn't. These opening scenes are a form of admission to the good ones, not to say they are any less enjoyable. They build up character, making us feel like we are part of something that we aren't through melding words of falsehoods. We see them as important to building story, they are really a distraction through explanation. Now comes the shower scene, one of the most famous scenes in film history. I should not be giving anything away by saying that Marion is killed off during this scene, that was  one of the many twists. When it was first released audiences could not understand why Hitchcock would be killing off his main character in a climatic occurrence a mere halfway into the film. There is a reason for it as far as I can see. A lot of people regard it as the pivotal scene in the film, it isn't. The scene on its own does not have enough constitution to regard an explanation for itself. The key scene occurs mere minutes before, in the parlour, a scene that coined the popular phrase `A boy&#145;s best friend is his mother.' It represented a breaking point in the life of Ed Gein that could explain the motives behind all actions to follow. It was speculated that Gein killed his brother after talking ill of his mother (Marion&#145;s murder), but there was never any proof found to support this logic (we never see the face of the killer). It is for that reason why the parlour scene is to be placed in such high regard. Listen closely to the dialogue in comparison to such a true-life event and then survey the shower scene as, not an action on its own, rather a physical reaction from an emotional exploit. The remainder of the film is almost of an entirely different ilk, as Marion's sister and lover search for an explanation as to why she has gone missing, and a deeper pursuit into the Mrs. Bates character. I won't get into it, for these scenes are so full of uncomfortable mystery and bitter intrigue that they almost need to vindicate themselves. But what I lastly wish to touch upon is the Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins reminds me of an old Vince Vaughn (who ironically played Bates in the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho). He delivers a chilling performance from his nervous paranoia, what he says doesn't scare us, but what we think he isn't saying gives reason to worry. Perkins gives a truly masterful performance. There is not a lot of stones left to be turned when talking about Psycho. It has been receiving critical praise for over forty years. And though Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980 he is still greatly missed and still considered one of the most influential and important directors of all time. Revisiting this film only reminds us that, even though he has been taken away from us, his vision will forever live on through his timeless classics.

But what I lastly wish to touch upon is the Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins reminds me of an old Vince Vaughn (who ironically played Bates in the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho). He delivers a chilling performance from his nervous paranoia, what he says doesn't scare us, but what we think he isn't saying gives reason to worry. Perkins gives a truly masterful performance. There is not a lot of stones left to be turned when talking about Psycho. It has been receiving critical praise for over forty years. And though Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980 he is still greatly missed and still considered one of the most influential and important directors of all time. Revisiting this film only reminds us that, even though he has been taken away from us, his vision will forever live on through his timeless classics.

Where to start. First off the whole orgy thing. The character says that a MAN wouldn't be judged on having sex with multiple female partners. Well that is a distortion because it wasn't a question of how many men she had slept with, it was a question of did she participate in an orgy. In my opinion. there IS a difference between having multiple partners over a lifetime as opposed to having multiple partners in one sitting! Not that I'm judging but I don't think I'm alone on this one. You can't tell me that if someone found pictures of George W. in some hot orgy that those pictures wouldn't have `found their way' to the internet. I also feel it would have effected how people think of him. Can we get over the fact that men are different than women! Why is that so hard!  As a man I will never know what it is like to carry a child inside me. Is it so wrong to say that most men and women define sex differently? (I did say most).. I guess, right or wrong, we do judge women differently because they pretty much say yes or no when it comes to having sex. Maybe it's in our nature or maybe because we (men) don't have to actually have a baby (big deterrent) that we just see the fun part and not the full consequence? Let's face it. If men got pregnant it would be a whole other world. That's probably the real underlying reason for the difference in judgment of women. Don't try to understand it. So our main character should be applauded because she is pro-choice? There is so much gray area there I don't think either side should be made to look evil. No one wants to revert back to `back alley abortions' but on the other hand, is abortion the only answer? Has it become too convenient? Instead of bringing that up, pro-life people are made to look evil in a typical one-sided black or white view. Again this was used in the Church Vs State part of the movie. It's sad and alarming the fact that she is appalled that her child was introduced in school to a man who preached things like `Love Your Enemy. Be Kind To Those That Hate You. Give To The Poor. kindness, love, fairness. amongst many other beautiful things. Yet she stands proudly with music swelling and professes her belief in this country and what it stands for! Considering this country was built on the near genocide of the American Indian. The fact that we still use slave and child labor (we've just moved it out of our country) and that we pretty much squash anyone who gets in our way. doesn't seem to bother her! Which belief is more of a `fairytale'?  Then she wants to take all the guns out of every house! Well even the liberal Michael Moore has shown that guns aren't the problem. Other countries that have just as many guns don't have near as high a death rate. Don't address the real problem. just get rid of all the guns! Okay Next subject.The fact that they had to change the appearance of Gary Oldman to make him look and sound like some smarmy conniving evil man going up against the good looking do good President and the poor patriotic vice presidential candidate is so transparently cartoonish good guy bad guy that it's laughable! Give me a break! Oh. another thing. The fact that this righteous woman stole her `good friend's' husband proves what. `That love can't be controlled'. That she is only human and we should forgive her. So by that standard I guess being paranoid and power hungry are also `only human' so we should forgive Nixon. The question is. if a person can lie to and cheat on a `good friend' what is to stop them from doing the same to perfect strangers. AKA - The American People.

When it comes to the justice system and political jousting, this is probably the best movie ever made. Jury deliberations are always held out of public view and it was interesting to see how they could possibly go. Granted that this movie is a work of fiction, I found it to be one of the most realistic films of all time as well.  This is a dramatic legal classic and I can see where Scott Turow and John Grisham got some inspiration for their respective career choices maybe.Here are my reasons (some spoilers may be revealed) (1) The performance of Henry Fonda anchored this rather extraordinary piece of celluloid. It was one of the first film roles that really preached political correctness and it was done with both levelheadedness and style. At the time, Fonda took on the underdog character in a completely new and different way and that made it the best performance in the movie. (2) This was a movie filled with a lot of excellent performances and the next best one goes to E. G. Marshall.  To me, he was the actual conservative of the movie (sorry Mr. Cobb).  His views were exactly opposite of Fonda but he kept a sound mind. He logically challenged Fonda at every turn but he never lost his cool.  While Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb played the conservative roles (more like fascist bigots in my opinion), Marshall kept his emotions in check and kept with the cold logic (much like Fonda) and that is why I found his performance to fit the bill of true conservative. (3) Another great performance was done by Joseph Sweeney. He proved that old men know their stuff. He reminded me of my maternal grandfather who is a very learned and observant man himself. Sweeney definitely stole a few scenes from both Fonda and Marshall. He definitely should have been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar. (4) Keeping with the same logic, I really liked George Voskovec. He provided the outside perspective in the movie. The tense scene he had with Jack Warden was the most emotional moment in the film next to Lee J. Cobb's breakdown before the end of the film. Granted the nationality of his character was unknown, it goes to show that people of all ethnicities share the liberal views on very tenuous issues. (5) The fifth best performance goes to the man who played Quincy for seven seasons on the show of the same name. What made him stand out was the fact that he didn't vote not guilty right away even though he was a slum survivor like the defendant in the murder trial. That is a point that those of the same background will always feel sorry for one another. That role was put into the movie to reinforce the sense of reality that the movie was trying to portray. (6) Even though I haven't seen a lot of his films, I found Sidney Lumet's direction of 12 Angry Men to be Oscar worthy. He definitely cared about this movie and it was maybe the best film he ever had the chance to helm. (7) This movie was spectacularly well-written. Some of the scenarios couldn't have come about without a great writer to do it. Reginald Rose did a great job in coming up with an excellent screenplay and an excellent set of circumstances to play around with. His talent is evident with the fact that the old man pointed out the last fact and the leader of the non-guilty side didn't. (8) The cinematography made me feel the heated claustrophobia that the jurors were suffering through. Throw in a few lighting switches and a small change in dramatic effects and you have an emotionally-charged picture. I was really intrigued by the close-ups on some of the actors. You could really sense the raw emotion all those men felt as they debated away on such a weighty decision. It was beyond words at some moments. (9) This truly was a summer movie. The heat coming into a confined space and the rain coming down at night signaled this thought. I am not a big fan of typical popcorn films and I believe this a needed reprieve from that. I watched this film during a summer thunderstorm and I had to smile at the poetry behind it. It will make anyone blink a couple of times. (10) Not only is this a summer film, it is a time capsule film. Nowadays, no one could get away with making a film about a jury filled with only white men. Men and women from all standings would have to be thrown into the mix to satiate the public and the hounds of political correctness (aka most of Hollywood anyway). I wasn't offended by this movie at all even though it lacked politcal correctness in terms of the times we currently live on. At that time, it was legally acceptable to do as such and the times eventually change. This film captures the late fifties' mentality on the legal system, political correctness, and class struggle perfectly. Ten reasons give this movie a score of ten.Overall, I found 12 Angry Men to be a classic that everyone from all walks of life should watch. Not only does hit hard on the times in which it took place, it makes a lot of good points on the unfairness of the legal system and fallability of mankind. All sorts of political opinions and logical paths were followed but it was easy to understand and it made 12 Angry Men all the better. It should not be missed! Here ends my rant!

It was one of the first film roles that really preached political correctness and it was done with both levelheadedness and style. At the time, Fonda took on the underdog character in a completely new and different way and that made it the best performance in the movie. (2) This was a movie filled with a lot of excellent performances and the next best one goes to E. G. Marshall.  To me, he was the actual conservative of the movie (sorry Mr. Cobb).  His views were exactly opposite of Fonda but he kept a sound mind. He logically challenged Fonda at every turn but he never lost his cool.  While Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb played the conservative roles (more like fascist bigots in my opinion), Marshall kept his emotions in check and kept with the cold logic (much like Fonda) and that is why I found his performance to fit the bill of true conservative. (3) Another great performance was done by Joseph Sweeney. He proved that old men know their stuff. He reminded me of my maternal grandfather who is a very learned and observant man himself. Sweeney definitely stole a few scenes from both Fonda and Marshall. He definitely should have been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar. (4) Keeping with the same logic, I really liked George Voskovec. He provided the outside perspective in the movie. The tense scene he had with Jack Warden was the most emotional moment in the film next to Lee J. Cobb's breakdown before the end of the film. Granted the nationality of his character was unknown, it goes to show that people of all ethnicities share the liberal views on very tenuous issues. (5) The fifth best performance goes to the man who played Quincy for seven seasons on the show of the same name. What made him stand out was the fact that he didn't vote not guilty right away even though he was a slum survivor like the defendant in the murder trial. That is a point that those of the same background will always feel sorry for one another. That role was put into the movie to reinforce the sense of reality that the movie was trying to portray. (6) Even though I haven't seen a lot of his films, I found Sidney Lumet's direction of 12 Angry Men to be Oscar worthy. He definitely cared about this movie and it was maybe the best film he ever had the chance to helm. (7) This movie was spectacularly well-written. Some of the scenarios couldn't have come about without a great writer to do it. Reginald Rose did a great job in coming up with an excellent screenplay and an excellent set of circumstances to play around with. His talent is evident with the fact that the old man pointed out the last fact and the leader of the non-guilty side didn't. (8) The cinematography made me feel the heated claustrophobia that the jurors were suffering through. Throw in a few lighting switches and a small change in dramatic effects and you have an emotionally-charged picture. I was really intrigued by the close-ups on some of the actors. You could really sense the raw emotion all those men felt as they debated away on such a weighty decision. It was beyond words at some moments. (9) This truly was a summer movie. The heat coming into a confined space and the rain coming down at night signaled this thought. I am not a big fan of typical popcorn films and I believe this a needed reprieve from that. I watched this film during a summer thunderstorm and I had to smile at the poetry behind it. It will make anyone blink a couple of times. (10) Not only is this a summer film, it is a time capsule film. Nowadays, no one could get away with making a film about a jury filled with only white men. Men and women from all standings would have to be thrown into the mix to satiate the public and the hounds of political correctness (aka most of Hollywood anyway). I wasn't offended by this movie at all even though it lacked politcal correctness in terms of the times we currently live on. At that time, it was legally acceptable to do as such and the times eventually change. This film captures the late fifties' mentality on the legal system, political correctness, and class struggle perfectly. Ten reasons give this movie a score of ten.Overall, I found 12 Angry Men to be a classic that everyone from all walks of life should watch. Not only does hit hard on the times in which it took place, it makes a lot of good points on the unfairness of the legal system and fallability of mankind. All sorts of political opinions and logical paths were followed but it was easy to understand and it made 12 Angry Men all the better. It should not be missed! Here ends my rant!

The best realised part is Drew being dragged away from her torturously close parents, trying to scream out to them, but not able to. It's actually quite touching. But it all goes downhill from there.Firstly, Scream isn't scary. It actually works a lot better as a comedy than it does a horror film, as writer Kevin Williamson has a much better affinity with one liners and comedic rants than he does actual horror- but it was right to pitch this film as genuine horror, as otherwise it would have been farcial. Essentially, there are only two death scenes- the opening and the stretched out finale- and so through the rest of the film we are left to concentrate on the characters. This is always risky for a horror film. Luckily, though, the protagonist is generally interesting, and played by a capable actress- Neve Campbell. Her character Sydney faces an interesting and indeed scarier inner conflict than a frankly clumsy killer in a cheesy mask what if her dead mother, enshrined in her memory, was in fact not the person Sydney would like to pretend she was?With this sort of pseudo-hip flick, cast is everything. Luckily it's not too bad. Courteney Cox is impressive and genuinely funny (in a very non-Monica way) as Satan in lime green heels, Gail Weathers. Rose McGowan plays Sydney's spunky best friend, and while personally I don't seem to enjoy her as an actress or as totty, she shines in this role(particularly in the exchange between her and Sydney just befoe the party, when McGowan's character is in the awkward position of trying to break something painful to a close friend- Sydney's mom was maybe a very unhappy woman). And at least she's a more interesting choice than some bland Sarah Michelle Hewitt flavour of the week.Skeet Ulrich is a little over the top in this, and is frankly just bad at the climax. When he screams the line Movies don't create psychos- they just make them more inventive you squirm, because he's not the sort of actor who can pull of incandescent. I was surprised to find I enjoyed Mathew Liliard's performance, as normally I can't stand him. He still has this mind numbingly irritating habit of sticking out his tongue like some inane drunken snake from time to time, but his manic, over the top persona suits the role perfectly, and gives personality to the most underwritten of the kids. Jamie Kennedy is excellent as the comedic heart of the film, and gets one of the most sympathetic characters, while David Arquette, as Deputy Dewey, is annoying for any time over a minute, but funny in small doses (Hello?...).The plot? Well, while usually in Hollywood teen fodder plot is minimal, there's lots of plot in this- it just doesn't make sense. At all. Why does Liliard's character pretend to kill Ulrich's? It's ridiculous to think the pair would wait a whole year between killings if they're this het up. And so on and so on. But hey, it's a popcorn horror film, no one cares.As for the idea of it being taboo busting or groundbreaking in any sense- I think not. It proclaims that it breaks the horror rules, but it never does. Sydney might technically loose her virginity, but she does so with integrity, love and trust shining in her heart. Figuratively, she's still The Virgin of the piece, so her survival, despite having had sex, isn't groundbreaking at all, and is utterly predictable. Indeed, Scream is a lot more conservative than most horror. All the bland\/sympathetic characters survive. Cox plays a bitch, but we see her sweet side, so she lives. McGowan's character was too spunky, cynical, and self assured to be guaranteed a sequel card. Keeping HER alive and killing off Randy or Dewey (or both) would have been truly original, but oh well.As for the famed pop culture references- I personally find them jarring. In other pieces of entertainment- for example Buffy- they work, because they used for comedy and not mere name dropping for the sake of it. When Sydney says that her town under curfew is like some other horror film, it's unnecessary and takes you out of the film. Some of the references are witty, though- the Tori Spelling line even got paid off in the sequel (which also has a frightening opening followed by an hour and a half of nothingness).Overall, a good cast, lots of good (and some bad- the constant use of pop-psychology is lazy and grating, and cheapens the only interesting issues) dialogue, and an intruiging protagonist, leads to a so-so film that doesn't entirely work (as either a comedy or horror), but is fairly enjoyable.

I was pretty surprised by the comments on this movie, everyone either LOVED it or HATED it!  I have to confess I fall somewhere in between.  I remember enjoying it when I first saw it at the now-gone Loew's Oriental, a nice old-fashioned theater perfect for such an old fashioned movie.  Although I found it not as impressive as Kenneth Branagh's Henry V, I still enjoyed it.  The acting for the most part seemed a bit over the top, but that seemed to be in keeping with the rather far-fetched story.  I didn't really try to second guess the story, so I didn't figure out the plot twists.  And what it lacked in suspense it made up for with imaginative story elements.  My biggest complaint was that it appeared that the screenwriter had watched Citizen Kane and Spellbound once too often. I have just watched my laser disc version tonight for probably the second time, and although I still enjoyed it, I noticed some rather nit-picky plot points.  Be warned--There may be some SPOILERS ahead!When Mike Church finally meets with Gray Baker, and receives a shocking revelation,  it occurred to me that strangely enough, no one bother to ask earlier whatever happened to the housekeeper and her son!  Also, Roman Strauss the composer finds his money running low, but he refuses to compose for movies, preferring to just write his opera.  I figured him for a smart man and smart enough to know movies are where the money is--couldn't he just write his opera on the side and compose for movies for the money?  It certainly would have put less strain on the marriage. I must confess I enjoyed the performances.   Mr. Branagh seemed to be having fun as both Church and Strauss, and it was refreshing to see a PI who was not a superman like the kind of characters Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger usually play.  My feeling is that after the intensity of Henry V, Branagh wanted to play (and direct) something lighter.  Emma Thompson as Margaret and Grace is both fetching and elegant as the former, and demure yet adorable as the latter.  One of the better scenes involves Mike taking Grace on a little date where nothing goes right.  It's one of the few scenes that's not played over the top and comes off rather charming.  I read in one comment that Derek Jacobi was considered for the part of Hannibal Lechter.  I would have loved to see him play that part!  His performance is bouncy and almost comic, yet in an instant he can become coldly sinister.  He certainly fooled me until the end (the first time, anyway).  I and liked how they worked in that little I, Claudius reference.I could have done without the guy from Seinfeld, but I can see how they needed such a character to give the audience story elements.  I did enjoy Robin Williams, whom I usually cannot stand, but here he departs from the kind of annoying I'm better and funnier than everyone else characters I usually see him play.  In keeping with the outlandishness of the rest of the movie, Andy Garcia's reporter does his best to stand out as a Hunter S. Thompson type reporter.  Too bad though we never see him at a typewriter.  His old man scene is another ripoff from Citizen Kane, and he looks too much like an old Henry Winkler than an old Andy Garcia, but his smoking scene is a nice creepy touch.On a technical level, the cinematography is a treat.  It's lush and elegant in the black and white scenes, and, well, light and airy and not too obtrusive in the contemporary scenes.  It's a little too dark and atmospheric in the antique shop, where the hypno-therapy sessions take place, but again it's in keeping with the fantasy element of the reincarnation theme.Also in keeping with the over the top feel of the film is Patrick Doyle's music, exciting at times while other times it sounds too powerful for minor scenes.  It does have a nice feel of excitement to it, and it would have been nice to see him work on the recent Bond films.  So overall, a fairly entertaining bit of fluff, which I at least didn't take too seriously.  I was hoping though that Branagh would move on to more substantial material, but alas, he instead did Peter's Friends and the atrocious Francis Ford Coppola's--I mean Mary Shelly's Frankenstein.

Mishaps galore when the gang head to beautiful sunny Miami Beach for the presentation of an award to the retiring Cmdnt. Lassard.

Danny Tamberelli's character and his sister were only in one movie.  The brothers are gone, Jesse in the first two and Terry only in the first.  The chunky kid and his dark-haired friend who always wore a hat were only in the first.  You know what, I'm wasting my time talking about this movie, because it sucks.  1\/10, only because I can't give a 0.

There are too many things in this one to comment on, but I'd like to go through a couple.  First of all, weren't they the Junior National Team in the second one?  And didn't they win the Junior Olympics?  They weren't even one of those regional JO teams people play on, they were supposedly the entire U.S.  So how come only one of them plays varsity?  It's like, you may have been in the olympics, but this is high school hockey, and we're varsity, we're better than olympics.  If the varsity guys are so good, why weren't they olympics?  Secondly, are they really freshmen?  If I remember correctly, at the end one of them is kissing an upperclassman cheerleader.  And there's no one some of them are freshmen.

Let them check this movie out.This is not propaganda against drugs... this is a fist right between your eyes, and it got R-E-A-L written on the knuckles.  There is no preaching, no silly sentence, only raw brutal consequence communicated in one of the most technically brilliant ways I've seen in a long, long time.I've never used drugs, and I hope I never will (hell no after seeing what it did to these people!), but of all movies I've seen depicting the drug-subject this one is the closest to reality.  Not only does it give you a feeling for what shooting up or snorting may actually feel like, it shows you what happens to your life...None of the characters are dumb.  I usually yell at stupid characters, thin reasons or incoherent reactions but this movie had me growling only once. Now afterwards I have to admit, a movie on drugs with no characters with risk behavior would just... turn out to nothing.These are people just like you and me, and just like you and me they are trying to fulfill their dream.  Dreaming is not bad.  But this movie shows us everything depends on what way we choose to pursue that dream, and as we all suspect, the short-cut turns out to be the long way home.I seriously recommend you to see this movie, at least if you are looking for something that will kick your mind and heart into motion.  Yes this movie is a bit like getting waked up by someone throwing a bucket of ice cold water into your face, but hey!  Waking up is a good thing!I give this move a 10 out of 10.
