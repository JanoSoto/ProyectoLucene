Opening with the crocodile gliding into the water and ending with the palm tree sprouting on the beach.  Other memorable images were the birdcages when Witt's mother died and when Witt talks with Welsh in the house. The orchid in front of the burning Japanese camp, the mother hen and her chicks, all interesting.There have been several criticisms of TRL 1) no character development, 2) no plot, 3) too long, and 4) trying to be too deep.Witt, Welsh, and Doll all developed during the movie.  Witt grows to realize that evil may be inherent in men (witness his return to the native villagers where they fight and have enemy skulls).  Welsh realizes there is more than making an island of oneself (his aiding of the gut-shot soldier).  Doll realizes the effect Witt has had on others in the final voice-over as the ship leaves the shore.The plot is there.  This is a complex and difficult film.  Careful attention must be paid to the voice-overs and the images to understand the plot.  It is essentially the same as the book the growth of men in combat with the spirituality of Witt thrown in.The only extraneous scenes were the cameos of Travolta and Clooney.  Even these scenes helped to develop the characters Col. Tall's ambition and the contrast between Clooney and Staros as father figures.  The acting of Travolta and Clooney fell short.  Even with these scenes removed, the movie would have been long.The movie (especially Witt) was spiritual.  This was an interesting difference from the book where Witt was a prejudiced boozer.  It was a little strange to hear Eastern philosophy about the interconnected nature of all things being voiced with an Kentucky accent but it was definitely not dime-store philosophy.If you don't like to think or if you are looking to be spoon-fed and manipulated, then this movie is definitely not for you.

As a matter of fact I went to see it twice (June and July 1996), just to make sure my judgement was honest and correct.Since debuting with Bad Boys in 1995, Bay has averaged about one movie every two years. But I think that it's quite sad and pathetic that in 16 years and nine movies he has not matured as a filmmaker in the slightest. If anything he's regressed.The Rock has characters with just a touch more depth than we're used to in Bay films. It's not necessarily a big story but he seems to stretch it out over two hours with heinously over-cut action scenes and extraneous sub-plotting.General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz with some poisonous gas rockets and aims them at San Francisco with the intention of vaporising everyone unless the families of each member of his dead team is paid $1,000,000. A nerdy and heavily bored FBI agent, named Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is called to San Francisco from Washington to observe and instruct the inevitable SEAL operation to overthrow the Marines on Alcatraz. But wait, there's more. Alcatraz is a maze of twisted metal and broken walls. They won't stand a chance without someone who has knowledge of how to break out. Or break in.And so enters the philosophizing and lanky-haired John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) at about 45 minutes into the movie. He's been in jail for 30 years and doesn't appear to be annoyed at having to work for the very people who have held him without trial for so long. There is an utterly pointless and indulgent car chase before he actually gets down to business.Once on the island, the SEALS, as predicted, are crap and get killed instantly. So, basically, Hummel wants to honor his fallen comrades by killing more American soldiers. How absurd, but not much in this film makes sense. Plus these SEALS have thoroughly extensive training and, in real life, there is NO WAY they'd end up being so useless.Goodspeed and Mason are not a great pairing. I don't know what the deal is with Nic Cage, when he's good he's great, but more often than not he's so unbelievably awful I wonder how he manages to get work. Goodspeed isn't very appealing. He's annoying, not funny, and little of his dialogue sounds natural coming from his mouth. When he tries to be tough, he just seems ridiculous. Mason is just an old James Bond. Hell, he's even a British Secret Agent. The role was written with Connery in mind, so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool.Coherent editing is not this movie's strength. In fact, coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock. There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into a epileptic blur. The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway, and it has sadly become the accepted norm for action movies.The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie that came out the month before its release. Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension. In 135 minutes, it wastes no time on sub-plotting, develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting.Exec Dec is played straight. The Rock is played to look cool and hip. It's not. And apart from Zimmer's entertaining score, there's not much to recommend. This rock could have skipped along the surface, but merely sinks to the bottom under its over-written, over-wrought, over-directed weight.Oh, and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been 19\/20-years-old when his character first crossed Mason.

He's annoying, not funny, and little of his dialogue sounds natural coming from his mouth. When he tries to be tough, he just seems ridiculous. Mason is just an old James Bond. Hell, he's even a British Secret Agent. The role was written with Connery in mind, so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool.Coherent editing is not this movie's strength. In fact, coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock. There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into a epileptic blur. The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway, and it has sadly become the accepted norm for action movies.The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie that came out the month before its release. Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension. In 135 minutes, it wastes no time on sub-plotting, develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting.Exec Dec is played straight. The Rock is played to look cool and hip. It's not. And apart from Zimmer's entertaining score, there's not much to recommend. This rock could have skipped along the surface, but merely sinks to the bottom under its over-written, over-wrought, over-directed weight.Oh, and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been 19\/20-years-old when his character first crossed Mason.

Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick's entire body of work as a serious filmmaker.  Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film's overall technique.In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon's Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique.  Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish.  If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is.  This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance's immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman's journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.It would take a book to examine and defend the film's strong points and drawbacks.  If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it's raining.

But Devil's Advocate is very enjoyable.  And although it's very scary at some times, this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and maybe learn from.  It reuses the idea from The Exorcist; the devil is going to take possession of someone, in order to lure and possess the ones most vulnerable to him.  However, The Exorcist was extremely serious and very tough to deal with after you finished watching it!  Devil's Advocate has a little change of heart.  It has the cool Al Pacino as the devil, and Keanu Reeves as his victim.   But instead of torturing him, Pacino simply showers him with gifts, money, and of course, women.  The women in this story weave a tapestry of irresistible temptation, which is why I think it had all the nudity in it.  And Al Pacino looks like he's having the time of his life. Pacino is usually serious in his films, but now, he's playing his role with guesto.  The only problem is, Keanu is taking this all too seriously.  He needs to lighten up a bit and attack Pacino with gusto right back.  His overacting makes him seem more vulnerable to Pacino, and to some, less likable.  But the real seriousness of the film is how Keanu proves the guilty not guilty.  It's horrifyingly true!  We live in a nation where rapists, suspected murderers, and other sickos can weasel their way out of conviction!  And worse yet, the people who are innocent are shafted and at a disadvantage, while the lawyers and criminals can get to the top of a mega-corporation.  We see it in insurance companies, where people go through drive-in health care, and the insurance managers are millionaires as a result.  It's sickening and morally wrong!  But in our country, we can get away with it!  And people like that, who is symbolized by the Keanu Reeves character, are going to come face to face with the devil in the future! That is my interpretation of it.  I highly recommend this film!  Though I warn you, there might be a few differences in the versions of the film you rent, and the versions of the film you decide to buy.  What I mean is, an ominous statue with people in it, which is seen in Pacino's penthouse, plays a key role in emphasizing the lustful temptation of Keanu.  But, the statue itself is an unauthorized reproduction of sculptor Frederick Hart's art! Hart sued, and in order to release the film on video, they released it as it was in the theatre, and eventually, re-edited the statue for the final video release.  I think that the impact of the statue wasn't as powerful, judging from the fact that the re-edited statue has no people in it!

But there was a time in the 90s when his name guaranteed you an hour and a half of broken bones, severed limbs, bad guys in agonizing pain and a showdown with a head villain who stands no chance against the awesome hurricane force that is Steven Seagal.I never really like the first Under Siege. I found it to be too low key and slow and after enjoying such brain-free fare as Marked for Death and Hard to Kill in my youth I had come to expect a tougher movie than the what we were given (though the tyrannical BBFC cut the film to shreds and denied me what I wanted to see). I was dismayed at the lousy 15-rating and not even Erika Eleniak's boobs could cheer me up (she's blonde-not my thing).Flash forward to July 1995 and the awesome poster for Under Siege 2 started showing up in cinema lobbies. It featured the impassive one clinging to the side of a burning train hurtling through the countryside and featured, quite frankly, the best subtitle of any sequel ever 'Dark Territory'. This time it was rated 18 which meant I could look forward to all the blood and gore that the first Under Siege lacked. Obviously I couldn't see this film in the cinema, being only 15 and all, so I had to wait until the video came out in early 1996. By that point the BBFC (those people from the dark-ages again) had censored every last bit of red stuff to the point where it could be shown on the friggin' Disney Channel if it weren't for the swearing.I would have to wait until 1999, when I bought the uncut US version on DVD, to see the film in it's entirety. And when I did it was like watching a brand new movie.Casey Ryback, now the head chef of the Mile High Cafe in Denver, had retired from the Navy but still works for the government doing the odd secret mission here and there. When his brother is killed in a plane crash he takes his niece Sarah (the lurvley Katherine Hiegl) on a trip to LA on the Grand Continental, but that particular train just so happens to be hijacked by crazed computer genius Travis Dane and his band of menacing mercenaries featuring dead-eyed Everett McGill and the sleazy Peter Greene. He has a beef with the government and is only too happy to use his skills to blow the Pentagon off the face of the Earth and collect a nice paycheck from the Saudis.Luckily for Ryback, he was momentarily absent when the hostages were rounded up as he nipped into the kitchen to bake a cake. He teams up with naive porter Bobby Zachs (Morris Chestnut, bringing life to an otherwise ordinary sidekick role) and begins his skulking, lurking mission through the shadows and voids of the train to pull the brake and free the hostages. Do these nasty people really think that they stand a chance against Ryback's awesome power and apparent invincibility? Sit back and watch them get annihilated with a variety of improvised mêlée weapons and other gruesome tools.The train is a better setting than the boat. This time instead of a plain black backdrop we've got lots of pretty scenery and the constant forward motion of the loco gives the movie a nice momentum. Basil Poledouris' score soars miles above Gary Chang's bland notes of the first one and it honestly ends up being one of the best scores ever and a perfect example of how action music ought to be. And don't worry about this one being slow as the first. Under Siege 2 is edited so quickly that coherence is almost lost. You have to pay quick attention and perhaps watch the film a few times just to catch everything.The comic-book nature of the plot, the cliffhanger feel of the ever-escalating mayhem and cartoonish villains might normally result in a campy movie but Under Siege 2 is as hardcore and sadistic and mean-spirited as the come. That's probably the reason the BBFC chose to cut it, claiming that it featured 'gloating and pervasive violence'. Well, I never found it to be that evil, just entertaining. Which is why I don't like narrow-minded institutions telling me what I can and cannot watch.No one could possibly have a bad time watching this film (unless it's the UK version) and if you've had enough of Shane Meadows doing pretentious black and white stuff or Keira Knightely in a frock to last you a lifetime then the brainless and breathtaking action of Under Siege 2 is just what you need.
