All of the new Unisols, which are faster and stronger than their predecessors, are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called SETH, a Self-Evolving Thought Helix. When SETH discovers that the Universal Soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts, he takes matters into his own hands to protect himself. Killing those who try to shut off his power, and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers, led by the musclebound Romeo, SETH spares Deveraux, only because Deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut SETH down in a matter of hours. With the help of a hacker named Squid, SETH takes human form. Not only must Luc contend with ambitious reporter Erin, who won't leave his side, but Luc also must contend with General Radford, who wants to take extreme measures to stop SETH. SETH has also kidnapped Luc's injured 13-year-old daughter Hillary, and is now holding her hostage. Luc is the only person who can rescue Hillary, because Luc knows firsthand how a UniSol thinks, feels, and fights. now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just-so-happened to be there and The soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when Vanne Damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when Luc is now human and Seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other Unisol and Luc can take a hit from him. with the final fight when Luc smashes him to pieces I was really surprised that the pieces didn't melt and reform him (Terminator 2). another thing that bugs me is how the hell does Vanne Damme get good actors to play relatives I mean in the case of Vanne Damme it's completely off the grid of how Science Fiction this movie is. The Music Score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well Universal Soldier 2 is like that. The good points are there's no Dolph (HOORAY) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many (I'm still haunted by the scenes in #1) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists (if you don't believe me look it up) ","genre":null},{"date":"4 March 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" OK I saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it's Unisol's best movie now plot Luc Devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner Maggie, who's been through countless hours of training and combat with him, to refine and perfect the UniSol program in an effort to make a new, stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated, intelligent, and agile.

A buddy of his named Riley Hale (Christian Slater) tries to stop him with the help of park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis).The plot is stupid. It's full of huge lapses in logic, loopholes and questionable sequences--according to this if a nuclear warhead is blown up 2000 feet underground it will NOT harm anyone aboveground. Please! Also there are far too many sequences with people getting shot at who magically escape getting harmed. Still, this is a fun movie. If you can ignore the dumb plot you'll have fun. The movie moves so quickly you don't have enough time to question it and has plenty of incredibly exciting (it totally illogical) action. The acting is good--Slater is OK, Travolta amusingly underplays his role and Mathis is a strong independent woman who doesn't back down in a fight or cower in a corner when the bad guys attack. I hated this back in 1996 (I thought about it too much) but like it in a non-think kind of way now. Recommended for the action alone.PLEASE don't shoot at the thermonuclear weapons.
