People can't really use their imagination anymore, which is a good thing to use when you are watching a silent movie. However, I try my best, and I really enjoyed this movie. It has a really creepy atmosphere, and even though it's more than 90 years old, it still had some creepy camera angles and shots. I can't imagine how creepy this movie was back in 1922, because it still is a little creepy now. Not scary, just creepy. I really liked the music that was playing throughout, because it really enhanced the movie. The whole time the music was playing I was enjoying the movie. Which means I enjoyed the whole movie. Max Schreck did such a good job at being creepy that I completely admire him, even though he's dead. Everyone else in this film did a wonderful job. Even the extras played a believable part. Also, I think the makeup artists did an absolutely wonderful job on the whole entire cast. Count Orlok (Max Schreck) looked really creepy and real. I even thought that was a real person's face until I took a good look at it, and realized that would be impossible for someone to have teeth like that. Also, the costumes are made so well that I believed they were real clothes and not just costumes. Now on to the general aspects of the movie. I really enjoyed the wonderful acting, well, wonderful for the time, and the effort put into playing a believable character really made me happy. The special effects were very rare, but when they did appear, they were very good. I have no idea how they could make things disappear and reappear with the so limited technology of the time. I could tell they used stop-action for some of the door opening effects, or maybe even string, but it was done in such a way that it was enjoyable. The story line was loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula, so it was really entertaining, and somewhat original because the makers shifted some stuff around. In fact, the only reason I don't give this a 10 is because it was kind of hard to follow. Now, that is probably because I took a break while I was watching it, but it might not be, so don't dislike this review because I said it was kind of hard to follow. OK. I was trying to figure out why some things happened and why some things did not, but I still understood the movie 100% by the time it was over. Don't judge! I still really loved this movie though, and it really irks me that some people don't take the time for silent movies. That's really all I have to say. So thanks for reading. See ya!

Director Roger Corman's second Poe adaption (he made 8 in all - although 1 was actually based on Lovecraft) is arguably the best of the whole bunch. Edgy, cunningly developed (there are 4 major twists in the plot alone, as well as some minor ones), well photographed and brilliantly directed, Pit builds up to its shocks carefully (these days they'd just throw blood at the screen) and the final sequence is a master-class in how to create cinematic suspense.All this, of course, comes from a story by Poe that runs less than 17 pages - I checked my Penguin edition! What perhaps often escapes viewers, is that the additions to the plot provided by writer Richard Matheson are basically taken from the French 1955 movie Les Diaboliques, which also has a great twist ending (the same twist, in fact!) Yet this movie has 3 more. Twist 1 - Elizabeth Medina really has been buried alive, making her doctor, who stakes his reputation that she wasn't, a bit crap! Twist 2. Aha, Elizabeth is not dead after all, but in league with the dastardly doctor and gunning for her hubby!. Twist 3. Nicholas, supposedly driven hopelessly insane, takes on the persona of his evil inquisitor father( or is he possessed?). Twist 4. Well, it's the final shot of the movie and I'll leave you to discover it for yourself.This is a film that is still frightening today, and of course, where would horror films be without Vincent Price? In truth this isn't one of his best showings, he's over the top in some scenes; but that moment, when Nicholas' comatose expression suddenly takes on an evil smile, is one of the most chilling moments in all movies, and confirms what a great actor Price really was.Pit is a great movie, one I never get tired of watching.

We have a grandiose visual story that is written for a man who leads men into the untried and untrue. Most cast were standouts and need no further immortalizing here. I enjoyed their clear approach to their characters. But while T.E. Lawrence was certainly not Moses, as was adeptly noted by his detractors, the role certainly was one of a leader, a defiant one, but still one whom men would follow into battle. How it was cast with Peter O'Toole, and effeminate English boy trying to be noble beyond country affiliation, seems to be a contradiction of that absolute requirement. I wouldn't follow him into a bar, no less the dessert. Who does he serve? Petulance, adventure, intuition and self-righteousness. A well-spoken scholar with ideas outside of the box makes for a great strategist, not a war general. Politics are also in the same realm of books read by Lawrence, yet he was so overcome with himself that the subject of oil could not be breached? Who could be so naive to think the English would leave Arabia to the Arabs once they had it in their hands. I watched the film as a boyish fantasy, and enjoyed it as the mis-cast adventures of T.E.

Well, its a message that a movie like 'Female Perversions' tries to communicate over and over and over until it exhausts it's own theme. I'm sure that it may be hard for some women to succeed in the business world but this movie goes about it in a self-piteous and irritating way.The movie concerns a young lawyer named Eve who is frustrated every minute of every day because she has to fit a certain mold, 'play ball' so to speak to compete in order to further her own career. She is in line for a judgeship so with every fiber of femininity she is overly frustrated. So competitive is Eve that when she sees another woman in the ladies room putting on the same color lipstick she throws hers in the trash.Eve seems to use sex as a punctuation mark, as affirmation that women like sex too. She has a strange affair with an executive (Clancy Brown) who likes to perform their sexual circus tricks in his office (he seems to get off on being caught). In an elevator one day she picks up a woman and begins a brief affair with her before being told 'I'm not ready for this kind of relationship'.Eve always seems to be cracking up and escapes into sexual fantasies involving bondage at the hands of lip smacking males. She fantasizes that she is being instructed by an older woman to express herself sexually and open up.Another problem Eve has a sister, Madelyn, who lives in the country and compulsively shoplifts. Madelyn's shoplifting is giving Eve fits because she's afraid that it will cause as scandal and this is not the kind of black eye her career needs. The contrast between Eve and Madelyn are so obvious that you can see it written on the page &#x96; Eve is a career woman, Madelyn is a student, Eve dresses in power suits while Madelyn dresses casually.Tilda Swinton whom I have adored in films like 'The Ballad of Little Jo' and 'Orlando' got on my nerves in the first half hour of the film. She's suppose to be strong willed and always fighting for what she wants but all I saw was a frustrated tinderbox, a pouty irritating woman who would be better off if she would just settle down and have a little decaf.

Even though Paul Sorvino as a shady figure is wasted in this, he'a actually a relief, after all the misery we tolerate here amidst all this bologne. Get this, Van Damne is a fashion designer who teams up with an agent (Schneider who at least throws some comedy into this mess) to counteract these terrorists who's used these sneakers as knock offs (detonators) where these two have to separate the good shoes from the bad ones, while protecting above all, mankind. The best thing to come out of this is it's title song, that conveniently plays over the end credits. What a film of absolute bull. Van Damme ought to be knocked off for makin' it. Trivia. Knock Off almost took a year to hit video. I wonder why.
