In Six Days, Seven Nights Anne Heche plays a business woman who is engaged to an overbearing guy named Frank, played by David Shwimmer. When they go away to a romantic island, they meet the laid back, drunken pilot, Harrison Ford. His character Quinn is not as Anne Heche quotes, one of those guys who you send out into the wilderness with a cutip and a pocket knife and they build you a shopping mall. His character is actually realistic unlike Indiana Jones or his president at kombat in Air Force One. The movie is also rather life like itself which you will see as they prepare to leave the island. Instead of a miracle appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the film, you actually see them building and working as you would have to if you were stranded on an island.From the moment Ford and Heche meet you feel the connection they have to each other. Rather than taking a liking to each other from the beginning of the film, they constantly bicker and argue over the funniest topics, one of them being Anne Heche's t**s! When it gets towards the end of the movie they obviously start falling for each other (just like every other typical romantic comedy), but this one I enjoyed imparticularly. Other than it starring two of my favorite actors, it was unpredictable. When they get off the island it looks as if they are going to go their own separate ways, which you would never suspect in a romantic comedy. Besides this, it also throws in some great action sequences including a chase scene with pirates. This is why this film is a perfect date movie, it has the romance for the woman and the action for the men!The acting is also superb. If you had never heard of Anne Heche you would mistake her as a heterosexual. She shows no signs of homosexuality the entire movie. And in my own opinion, it shouldn't matter if she is gay. It is a great film and she is a talented actress. Harrison Ford is also terrific in his first romantic comedy since Sabrina. I only hope that I can see Ford and Heche appear in another movie together sometime soon.

But her face is the last 30 minutes of the film is the most unnerving mask of terror I've every seen. It is like Munch's The Scream come to life.Remember that one of the directors who Kubrick emulated was Eisenstein, the master of type-casting. Though from comments I've read elsewhere I'm sure Kubrick wished that Duvall had bothered to learn her lines before the scenes, I think that Kubrick must have been satisfied with the shaky way Duvall lights her cigarette as she suspects she will have to cover for her bullying husband once again, with the way she stares at the larder door containing the raving madman who she knows will kill her, every nerve in her body straining to move forward and open it... it is certainly the best performance of hers I have ever seen.

Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from auteur critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut).  Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's?  No.  Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV.  The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else.  It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together.  Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY).  There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music.  Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable.  I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to).  No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop.  So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman.  Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.

There was absolutely no hint of mystery whatsoever. None of the characters made any interesting theories about who the killer could've been (like Randy from Scream; by the way, Damon was a crap Randy) apart from Paul and what's her name accusing a certain character of being the killer when they find a piece of too hard evidence pointing towards him. Aren't these mysteries much better when you are following a main character who is trying to solve the case at a 'professional' level? e.g. Se7en (a serious film).These Guesswhodunnits are getting a little bit boring now. 'I know what you did.....' was OK but this is too ordinary. Just another Scream rip-off to me. I thought Scream was superior to UL because it was much more clever. Also, it actually had a killer that ran (what what what?) so it looked more realistic, not like the maniac in the parka jacket in UL that walked at snails pace and still managed to catch and kill his\/her victims. Halloween and IKWYDLS are also guilty of this.Despite all of its faults it was still a pretty enjoyable film so I'll give it a reasonable 6 out of 10.

I could not imagine many of these actors in the same movie, but it is ingenious how their roles interact so carefully to avoid clashes on screen.  Each character has their own storyline which naturally plays together with the others.Some of the morals suggested by this story are made too obvious at times, but it has a strong message and is delivered in a very effective manner. Definitely see this movie!

I must have seen it at least once a week. What was appealing about it was the angst. I feared the same demise as the heroes. Why?Because despite the unreal quality of the movie when seen from a 1999 point of view, it was all very real. It tells of a time when, My Country right or wrong was the saying of a day, when many of America's youth were lost and trying to find their way. I know, because while I am not American, I had many friends who were and I visited the US several times, each time getting hassled about my long hair, by people on the street. My friends were living in Canada to avoid dying in a corrupt Police Action overseas.Unlike Bill Clinton, we and the characters in this movie did inhale, mostly to get away from the ugliness that was the political and international situation at the time, remember this was three years before the American Tiananmen Square, Kent State. So our two heroes, a Hippie and a Greaser went looking for America and found it..... Scary, eh?That was the appeal of this movie and still is, because not much has changed.Think I'll go out and buy a copy....
