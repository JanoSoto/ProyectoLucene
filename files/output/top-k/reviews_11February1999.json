[{"date":"11 February 1999","score":"","review":"  Larry Clark's version of Another Day in Paradise is very different from the book it was based on, and he did a lousy job directing and scripting his interpretation of the story, but it still is a powerful and distinctive film about the seamy side of drug abuse and crime.  None of the individuals, outside of the four main characters, are given more than cursory attention. They show up, fumble their way through a short sequence and disappear.  The scene where Rosie and Mel's nephew Danny help the injured Bobby appears to have been totally adlibbed.  Clark has said that he knew exactly what he wanted but that his cast did not.  Unfortunately, the lack of structure left a strong but incoherent final cut.There are so many laughable scenes that the strong performances by the principal actors are almost lost. The dialog appeared to be a pastiche of juvenile sex jokes, plot explanations thinly masked as conversation, and snippets from Eddie Little's book.  Mel is supposed to be a professional thief, but there is no evidence of this in the film.  The plot careens from one chaotic escapade to another interrupted by Mel blaming everyone else for his problems.  Nonetheless, Woods, Griffith, and Kartheiser provide emotionally intense and complex performances.  Natasha Wagner's version of Nadine in Drugstore Cowboy is more appealing than the original, but there is not much for her to work with.  James Woods takes over every scene he has with the other actors.  By default, the picture hangs on the quality and depth of his performance.  Melanie Griffith does a better job playing off him than Vincent Kartheiser, but both do an excellent job within the limitations of the script.Ultimately, Clark does succeed in providing a gritty drama about drug abuse and crime, because nothing is glamorized or hidden.  There is no grand denouement and no one comes through the film redeemed in any way.  The violence is real and unchoreographed,   the private cheap and vulgar actions of the characters are displayed,  and the only nobility present is fleeting and generally ineffectual.  Even with Clark's leering excesses, he still provides a more honest picture of this life than most of his contemporaries. There are certainly better films about addiction and abuse (Nil by Mouth for one) and Clark completely gutted a first-class book in order to tell his story rather than Eddie Little's, but the main performances and Clark's unsparing camera make Another Day in Paradise worth a trip to the theater.
