A dark vision of the future, with ultra-violent youth ruling the streets and people being afraid to leave their houses after dark. Alex, a leader of such a gang gets caught after committing an accidental murder, and after two years of prison sentence, he is chosen to be reformed by a new method called Ludovico's technique, which is claimed to turn bad people into good people.I think every director runs a risk when adapting a great novel, but the way Stanley Kubrick did it seems to be THE way. He kept the best scenes of the story, created a semi-dreamlike visual environment, added an terrific soundtrack, chose the suitable actors (nearly everybody who had more than two lines was memorable), and ran the whole thing with his usual precision. The only weaker point was the sex scene between Alex and the two devotchkas from the record store (but it would be a bit difficult to adopt the violent scene from the book with Alex of 15 and the girls like 10).I don't know which movie should I consider as Kubrick's best, but this one is definitely my favourite. The first time I saw it, I just couldn't believe the soundtrack. Though it owes much to the novel, it transcends to an audio\/visual experience only a movie can give you. I think Kubrick made the right decision which scenes to include. I'm glad he completely omitted the last chapter of the book. Also, this films features probably the most menacing last line in movie history.Finally, there seems to be a common misunderstanding many people seem to think that Ludovico's technique turned Alex into a good person, as promised. Wrong. Alex' body was conditioned to react to violence with sickness, but our humble narrator's personality hardly changed at all.

Since the cold war was the main theme of nearly every action film from 1950 to 1990, its refreshing to see that this one was an original. And it contains very few flaws. To start, its only Bond predecessor, Dr No was a masterpiece as well, but From Russia With Love has a much better plot, action, characters, and locations. And Goldfinger, which came afterwards, was a huge hit, but the series soon tapered off afterwards, with each new film being a tired rehashed blend of the first 3 (Theyre up to 19 already, I think thats a bit much).From Russia with Love features exotic European locales, from London to Istanbul to Zagreb and Trieste (via the elite Orient Express) and finally Venice. And don't forget the very curvy female costar, Daniella Bianchi. Robert Shaw is brilliant as the Iron assassin, Red Grant (who has been exhaustingly duplicated in every Bond film since) whose physical toughness and ragingly homicidal demeanor are still a difficult match for Sean Connery's wit. Lotte Lenya of course immortalizes herself as the dreaded Russian witchlike director, and her contempt for everything but The State is fearfully noticable in all her scenes.The only misplaced scene in this movie is the gypsy camp battle scene, where Bond is a Rambolike superhero who is everywhere at once and never gets hit by the barrage of bullets which surround him. This too has appeared in many other Bond films (Thunderball, The Spy who Loved Me, Tommorrow Never Dies) and should surely have been omitted. However, the rest of the film is nearly perfect. If you love action, adventure, tastefully gratuitous sex, anticommunism, and thrilling cities, then see this film.

Films like Deep Blue Sea and Lake Placid and this one use techniques that I think he developed. There really is something horrifying when a camera films legs thrashing about under water as it approaches them, and then just before you think the person is going to get eaten, the camera cuts away to a shot of them on the surface, then back underwater and then the final fatal shot of the victim getting eaten or in this case suffocated and squeezed to death.  Luis Llosa does an adequate job of creating tension, but the film really is a straight to video production.  It's not a bad film, it's just not that great either. However, the cast in here really is quite good.Jennifer Lopez is a terrific actress as she was sexy and tough in Out Of Sight.  Eric Stoltz has always been a dependable B actor that lends believability to any character that he plays, take The Prophecy and Pulp Fiction.  Jon Voight is an Oscar winner and he was very good in Varsity Blues and even Ice Cube has shown us that he can act as he was great in Boyz N The Hood.  And when I watched them in this film, my question was, what were they doing here?  It feels like the talent in here should have been used for a better more ambitious project.  I would honestly like to see this cast in a more serious film because I really feel that they have much more to offer than this average B horror film.Anaconda has some decent suspence in it and most of that is because of the water shots.  The acting, as I have mentioned, is quite good too.  But there is just something not quite right with this film.  The snake really looks fake in many shots and the movie feels cheap.  I wasn't really scared but I wasn't bored either.  What you end up with is an entertaining film that is worth getting for an evening if you don't mind shelling out $3.00 for a rental.  Simply put, this is a fun movie and it is not worth the sub 5 rating that imdb comments have given it, but it is not a classic horror film by any stretch.
