[{"date":"11 June 2002","score":"","review":" Mildly entertaining teen horror film is at least smart enough to come up with a good (if blatantly derivative) story, rather than resorting to senseless slasher violence. A group of at odds high school students live in a dreary, monotonous little Ohio town where nothing interesting ever seems to happen. They begin to notice peculiar behavior among their teachers and faculty members, but that's only the beginning as they soon realize that their town has fallen victim to an alien invasion. Well-directed, with a first-rate cast, good special effects, and some exciting moments, it's only brought down by thin, stereotypical characters and an excess of crummy dialogue. **½ ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2002","score":"","review":" Mildly entertaining teen horror film is at least smart enough to come up with a good (if blatantly derivative) story, rather than resorting to senseless slasher violence.

This film delivers. Big time.It was everything I enjoyed about the Spider-man comic and cartoon, Tobey maguire is awesome as Peter Parker\/Spider-Man totally nailing everything about the character. Kirsten Dunst was great as MJ, she kept getting to me, every time her and peter had a 'moment'. Wilem Dafoe relishes his role as the green goblin...He's over the top without being too hammy. But the real treasure..the man who makes the film, is J.K. Simmons, who plays peter's boss J.Jonah Jameson. I couldnt stop laughing everytime I heard his voice.Sam raimi's direction is spot on. He has truly bought this comic book to life. I never doubted that raimi's touch would lift this above a mere popcorn movie. Like the orignal Batman, he treats the character with respect.I also trusted David Koepp's writing. He's been behind some the biggest Blockbusters ever made (Jurrasic Park) and He know how to avoid making things corny.Overall there is nothing I didnt like about this film...it completely lives up to its hype. ***** 5 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2002","score":"","review":"  I have been itching to see Spider-Man after I only mildly enjoyed Attack of the clones. that film did not live up to its hype..so I was fairly scepticle when it came to this film... as the hype was even more than that of Star wars.With one exception.
