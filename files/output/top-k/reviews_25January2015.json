Often times, they go exploring in the woods behind their trailer, but on this particular day, they run into another person, a man intent on killing himself. When young Mark (Brad Renfro) interferes, the man takes him prisoner and before taking his own life, he opens up to the boy about some things he never should have told anyone. Mark calls the police and ultimately lies to them, the way any kid would, but they know it and when the FBI comes into the investigation, the smart twelve year old decides it's time for him to go out and find a lawyer. It took me a long time to watch this film because as a fan of John Grisham, I prefer to read his books before I see his films. As is the case in the Client, a lot of those films are directed by Joel Shumacher, who remains true to the story and produces a tremendous movie. After a nationwide search, Brad Renfro was selected to star in the first role of his brief, but brilliant career. Renfro unfortunately died of a drug overdose fourteen years later, but was well on his way to becoming a superstar. Even in his very first performance, you could see that this kid had what it takes to star in a film like this and really held his own with the all-star cast. Here he's paired with Susan Sarandon, who despite her reputation is often times someone I find unimpressive. She can be fantastic, but rarely seems to fit the roles she's cast in, but not here. As Mark's lawyer, Reggie Love, Sarandon portrays one of her most interesting characters to date and gives a flawless performance. The Client is a story written by one of America's favorite novelists, and what makes Grisham's stories so good is the fact that he is a lawyer, so everything is accurate as well as exciting. Together with a terrific cast, the Client had all the action, twists, and turns a fantastic court room drama should have. This story may have been a little more out there than some of Grisham's other films, nevertheless it is still a film that will hold your interest and keep you on the edge of your seat.

He is playing an old man in this movie and that was 26 years ago (from the time of this review)! Anyway, Driving Miss Daisy is a film centering on the relationship between an aging Jewish lady, played by Jessica Tandy, and her black driver, played by Morgan Freeman, appointed to her against her will when she can no longer drive herself.The movie is supposed to cover 25 years and the movie tries to be subtle about its time progression. It uses ways like the change of cars and makeup, and sometimes also spells out the year on a particular item, like a trophy. While this is an intelligent and praiseworthy attempt, it ultimately fails because Morgan Freeman does not look any older as the movie progresses and Jessica only looks older towards the 2nd half. You have to pay attention to the little things know where you are.That is just a minor complaint but it brings us to a larger one not much is going on in this movie in the 25 years it supposedly takes. Now, before the millions of you come yelling at me that this is not some action movie, I am well aware of that.Obviously, this movie is about the relationship between the two main characters, so the story is not as important, but there is a strange stagnation in both the relationship and the story surrounding it. In fact, Freeman's character actually says so out loud towards the end of the film. The chauffeur always stays outside of anywhere they drive to and these two people do not experience much together. They end at friendlier terms than the ones at which they started, but that is about it.Yes, it is commendable that the movie did not go the romantic way. It could have been easy for it to go the cheap way and show the two main characters fall obviously in love and it is good that the movie avoids this, as well as puts mental barriers in the path of their relationship, but again, in supposedly 25 years very little change shows in the behavior between these two or their situation (apart from getting weaker from age). The movie really is about driving Miss Daisy and is perhaps a little too subtle for its own good.Now, having said that, Morgan Freeman is awesome as the old southern black man. The acting and his accent are fun and his ability to portray this character with realism is praiseworthy. Jessica Tandy is also quite a brilliant actress considering how well she portrayed aging. The difference between her manner at the beginning of the movie and at the end is quite staggering. Their relationship together is interesting and has believability.The is realism overall is high. I do not know the exact nature of conversations and relationships from the period covered, but besides having some anti-racist undertones in its story (probably to try and offset the potential offense of the main premise), the movie is surprisingly raw when it comes to showing the people and their feelings. Freeman's character is polite but he still has his dignity and his own opinions. Tandy's character, although wants to be seen as progressive, is still an old lady with her own special ways.Driving Miss Daisy is a good well-acted film that can be taken seriously and leaves you with a good feeling, but one could desire that a little bit more happens with the relationships and events.

Therefore, I had the benefit of both the 08' financial crisis and ten thousand more films just like this one having been made (although most appeared on Lifetime)The plot is basically that of working single mother against the world. Thats right, Single mom makes good with Laura Linny as the single mother . She has all the brains and cleverness in the movie, while the male characters are basically there to serve her. Her boss, played by Broderick, is tentative and afraid, and has stupid business ideas as well. Her brother, played with good acting skill by Mark Rufflo, is a sad drifter who works construction. Although he is the one who does the most respectable work as a carpenter, neither him or his trade are given much respect in the film.

She gets her brother to sign his half of the house over to her, without any good explanation of why she deserves his half. Lastly, she dumps the man who wants to marry her , perhaps just to show how omnipotent and in control she is.The film never establishes why Linny's character deserves to get all the good fortune, unless by virtue of being a single mother she deserves it.

Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all gangster movies have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their adopted brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from innocent bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man) and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the throne, is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families.

After a while Patch begins to visit people in the hospital even though it's not allowed, cheers them up, fools people into thinking he's a three year student, practices medicine without a license, steals from hospitals to get medical supplies and somehow it all works out.Oh boy! The real Patch Adams is actually an interesting guy. He doesn't believe that people should pay for medical care like in the movie, yes but this simplifying of what his theories are... All I can ask is why? it would make for a much more interesting movie if they did stick to what happened (which is the biggest problem with the movie, stuff like almost the entire character of Carin was a falsity, Patch did meet his first wife in medical school but it was his best friend that was murdered).

This is a study of how we choose to explore our inner idiots and external social tensions that follow these choices.The film follows a group of young people living together and impersonating mentally retarded people as an attempt to find their inner idiots and thus achieving true happiness, they do so in public places and when they're home and around each other and there are moments that they do actually seem genuinely happy but new circumstances appear that confronts them and us as viewers to serious questions about the morality of their acts and weather they deserve happiness under these terms or not. The Idiots is really about something. It introduces characters that we get to know and it has them ask bold questions and make an effort to find out the answers, even if there turns out to be none. What Von Trier does not only in The idiots but in some of his other films as well is to create these well thought, harmonious sets in the first half of the film only to dismantle and fall them apart in the second half where reality shows up and hidden brutal layers of their respective worlds can't help to leak in. The movie starts as what we think is a satire of bourgeoisie and middle class values by a group of bohemians but it goes on to being a satire of both groups, although it shows more compassion towards the latter, no matter how unconventional their methods are to reach some sort of peace and happiness. Everything falls apart only when they try to apply to their group the same despicable middle class principles that they were escaping from in the first place, by trying to assign winners and losers, who is a good spasser and who is not, who is more serious about this and who isn't, basically by asking all the wrong questions. On the other hand, this is only Stoffer's and maybe partly Axel's part of the story and his point of view and his take on this experience, he is the one hating the bourgeoisie, we don't really hear about the other's motivations until nearly the end of the film. The artist is there because he thinks it will help him become a better artist, the doctor is there to experiment, Josephine is using as a substitute to her medications, other's might be just playing around and Karen as it turns out by hiding out in the idiots world is trying to cope with the harsh reality of her life, the loss of her child. I think this lack of consensus is crucial towards understanding this film and characters and their final separation. The film can also be viewed as a social critic on the society's hypocratic behavior towards the mentally retarded, well maybe not in a traditional sense. The idiots are always taken care of and never disrespected by the people. Denmark is a state that takes care of everyone and this is visible through the entire movie but there's one thing that is hard to ignore and that is this sense of awkwardness and discomfort and embarrassment that they cause for the normal society anywhere they go, even there are is someone coming and offering them money to move to somewhere else, the couple who come to buy the house is obviously distraught and wants to get out of the situation as fast as possible, so is everybody else, the only person that they encounter and shows them love and compassion and not just pity is Karen who goes with them and joins them.

Larry and his estranged father do not get along very well and it's quite the grim visit. Things take a turn for the better though when he notices the beautiful Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers). When Larry is attacked by a wolf, he manages to fight it off but the creature has made it's mark. Having sustained a bite from the beast, Larry soon begins transforming into a werewolf at night.The biggest problem with the movie is that it features numerous continuity and editing errors. There are scenes where doors are opened twice or objects moved twice, scenes Larry's clothing changes between him being a man and being fully transformed and the inexplicable biggie why is it that the first wolf man we see took on the appearance of a wolf but Larry turns into a wolf-man hybrid? One or two mistakes you can overlook as just simple gaffes but there are a lot of these and other strange inconsistencies in the film that are genuinely distracting. Because of everything that's actually really good in the movie these mistakes are particularly disappointing. It could have been a great film if the script had been polished up a bit and the editing had been better.This movie would have been forgotten as a film trying to ride on the coat tails of Dracula and Frankenstein if it hadn't been for the protagonist Larry and the aspect of the werewolf curse. He's a sympathetic character that comes to a strange place and is taken aback by the town's weird obsession with werewolf legends (a legend that prior to the film was not very well known to American audiences). He's a charmer and when he gets afflicted with the werewolf curse (more on that in a second) you really see and feel the internal conflict he's faced with. Our character is literally and figuratively afflicted with a curse. The town's people do not know that it is only a matter of time before he turns into a raging beast and attacks but they still ostracize Larry because of a tragedy that happened while he was out with a young woman on the night he was bitten. The girl's mother blames him for what happened. Her logic is that Larry had no business taking out a woman who is engaged to be married in the first place (She has a point) and that he is the reason her daughter was out that night. He's already shunned by the town, but it gets worse. Half the people that surround him think that Larry's gone mad. Once that wolf that attacked him died, it reverted back to its normal, human form. Larry isn't really blamed for the death, it's ruled as accidental, but still. During the scuffle, they assume, Larry and the man exchanged a few unintentional blows with themselves as well as with the animal. He may be cleared of any wrongdoing as far as the law is concerned, but this doesn't mean that the people around him don't suspect his mental instability, not only because of the accidental death but also because of the psychological effect that the death has on Larry.All of this is purely from a coincidental aspect because in reality, Larry is genuinely cursed. Not only does he turn into a monster by moonlight but he also knows ahead of time who he will attack next. On top of being responsible for the murders, Larry also has the added pain of wanting to warn his would-be victim(s) but is unable to do so because everyone thinks he's basically nuts. While I always look to the transformation sequences as the highlight of any werewolf film, this whodunit aspect is a terrific element I wish was more present in these stories because the beast is able to blend in with the rest of us during the day and this film takes that idea and puts a whole new twist on it.The film is very iconic. The design of the wolf man is still recognizable over sixty years after the film's release and looks pretty good too. The film has some nice special effects with the transformation (though because this one predates a lot of modern effects they are kept to a minimum) and I love the atmospheric setting of the action. It's set in these terrific woodland sets full of mist. Even the script has its share of good quotes. The best is easily the poem that is repeated multiple times by the people of Llanwelly Even a man who is pure in heart\/\/and says his prayers by night\/\/may become a wolf when the wolf bane blooms\/\/and the autumn moon is bright. That's some good stuff right there. It's interesting too to see a werewolf movie that SURPRISE! does away with all of that nonsense about the full moon. A full moon never appears during this movie, Larry just transforms at night time.For its historical importance and the interesting drama present, I do recommend you see The Wolf Man. The recommendation is stronger still if you are a fan of horror films and for lovers of the old Universal Monsters, it's an absolute must. Granted it has not aged as well as some of the other black-and-white horror films of the time and by today's film standards you're unlikely to get scared. It also has a lot of technical problems but there's a lot more good here than bad. You may believe you know all there is to know about this classic, but there's a lot more going on here than you think.

It also has a fictitious connection to Nazi Germany and the heinous medical experiments at concentration camps. All the cast are very good n their roles. Dustin Hoffman earns the grade, if for no other reason, all the running he did for this film. William Devane is the perfect cool and smiling secret service type that one can never trust. Roy Scheider is very good as the incognito operative who loves his younger brother (Hoffman). The years of his skulduggery work have taken their toll and he shows signs of his uncertainty and worry. But, the piece de resistance performance is this film is by Laurence Olivier as Christian Szell. His manners, his eyes, his cold stare and his mocking attitude exude the character he plays. Hard-boiled, no conscience, no feelings, no love for anyone. Cold and calculating, period. That's why a line he utters stands out so much. When Hoffman's Babe takes him at gunpoint into the waterworks tower, he throws a handful of diamonds at him &#x96; many fall into the water. This is madness. Mad, he says. It's madness to him for Babe to throw millions of dollars of diamonds away. But what he, Szell did to people in Nazi concentration camps wasn't madness. The drama of this man's warped mind is captured in a fantastic shot. Babe tells him he can have all the diamonds he can swallow. Szell puts one in his mouth and the camera pans to a close-up as his lips part to show the diamond clenched between his teeth and Szell looking with a steely-eyed glare of defiance. Wow! Horrible! But great acting by Sir Laurence. Marthe Keller was fine in her role, but she was part of the only really weak part of the film. That was her pick up and liaison with Babe. Neither of them carried that out believably. Perhaps a script change was needed. It just didn't seem very likely &#x96; way before we discover the set up. Still, this is an entertaining action thriller. Those with queasy stomachs may want to avoid it &#x96; or get up and go in the next room during the dental torture scenes.

Unfortunately, she does not believe his tale until it is too late for him, and she herself ends up being ensnared in Deneuve's web of intrigue.Ridiculous film would be laughable were it not for the fact that it takes itself so seriously, so it ends up merely being dull and pretentious. It was a flop at the time of release, but has developed a cult following. It is difficult to see why. The plot is of almost no consequence here and functions as little more than a shaky framework on which to attach the next sex scene or violent attack. The entire film plays like one over-stretched perfume commercial.Gads of ink were spilled regarding the lesbian sex scene between Deneuve and Sarandon at a time when such things were just not done by name actresses. The scene itself is tastefully handled and a few misguided critics overpraised it, while conveniently overlooking that the film which surrounds it is pure ultra-chic garbage.Director Scott films everything and directs his actors so poorly here that one waits for one of them to face the camera with a perfume bottle and start hawking it. The plot is fairly incoherent, especially as the film proceeds. Bowie manages some decent moments, but he leaves the film entirely too early.

He arrives at a cave where there is a coffin instead of a treasure. He opens a box with four pieces of a heart and revives the mother of all vampires Lilith (Angie Everhart) that kills his employees. Vincent uses a key artifact with blood to control and protect himself from Lilith.The punk Caleb Verdoux (Corey Feldman) has an argument with his sister Katherine Verdoux (Erika Eleniak ) and leaves their house to go to a bar to meet a friend. They learn that there is an amazing brothel at 325 Beaumont, a funeral home where they should ask for the Cunningham Wake. They are received by the mortician McCutcheon (Aubrey Morris) and soon they go to the brothel. However Lilith runs the place and the girls are vampires. Caleb's friend is killed by Lilith that that rips his heart out of his chest and then Caleb is attacked by her.Katherine goes to the precinct to report that her brother is missing but the police officer does not give much attention to her. The private investigator Rafe Guttman (Dennis Miller) overhears her conversation and offers his services to Katherine. The snoopy Rafe tracks Caleb's path and he discovers that the brothel seems to be a lair of vampires. But Katherine, who works with Reverend Current (Chris Sarandon) that has a business connection with Lilith, does not believe in his word. Now Rafe is seeking evidences to prove to Katherine that he is telling the truth. Bordello of Blood is an underrated gore comedy of vampires. The plot is funny, with beautiful and hot female vampires, and also with a great unexpected conclusion. The comedy is a funny parody of horror and crime genres with the sexy Angie Everhart and Erika Eleniak. But Dennis Miller steals the movie in the role of a sleazy but efficient private eye. Lilith's tongue reaching the heart of her victims is hilarious; however the funniest scene is when Rafe teams up with Reverend Current and they use squirt guns with holy water to defeat the female vampires, exploding them. When the viewer expects a happy ending, with the good guy and the good girl together, there is an unforeseen conclusion.

Directed by Tom Shadyac, it is based on the life story of Dr. Hunter Patch Adams and his book, Gesundheit Good Health is a Laughing Matter, by Adams and Maureen Mylander. Plot In A Paragraph In the 1970's medical student Hunter Patch Adams starts to illegally treat patients at a hospital using humour as a medicine. Williams is his usual self and he is well supported by the rest of the cast especially Gunton, Potter, London and the always brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman. However Michael Jeter who I love, is not given as much to do as one would hope. My only real problem with this movie seemed to be more of the same of Williams going in to a stuffy environment and shaking things up, and being looked down upon by his peers, but loved by those he helps. I wanted this to be as brilliant as Dead Poets Society and Awakenings and I love Robin Williams, but think he over shadowed the real Dr Hunter Patch Adams who I think deserved a better movie of his life achievements. It does have its moments, and is not without its laugh out loud funny and touching moments and of course Williams remains as watchable as always, but this just didn't hit the mark for me, despite the movies best intentions.

Yes the quality is there and I often enjoy the movie and its sequels. But for some reason, the whole indestructible Michael thing never pleased me so much. In the first movie it is not exactly a problem (you see it only in the end), but after the fact is known, then it becomes somewhat of a problem. He becomes too powerful maybe. But as far as entertainment value is concerned, you get plenty of that. And the sequels increase the violence quite a bit. The body count is unlimited as pretty much the whole town is involved. That means police stations being destroyed, gas station explosions, cutting off electricity to the whole town and other such actions. He is more powerful than all super-villains combined all because of the fact there is no superhero to counter him. And in this movie, there is only the little kid Jamie who is supposedly his target. My question though is, even if Jamie was his only target, why does he pretty much murder everyone in the town? In fact this question can be asked of all the Halloween sequels I guess. In any case, it is a lot of fun as the quiet atmosphere of the original is nowhere to be found and instead it is a Terminator style action film. When it does slow down, it is able to create a creepy atmosphere and it has some impressive scenes especially the ones inside the house. There is the unnecessary nudity which has no relation to the plot. What I did like was that the movie is more theatrical and over the top than earlier Halloween films. It has its own charm, you could say in terms of the fun factor. I have watched the movie before but I had some difficulty watching the movie again because of the kid character. I think I felt a little sad with all the victimization that was going on. I know it is just a cheesy horror sequel, still they could have had an adult in the role or something. I think it is very depressing to see the kid being chased. Her performance is flawless and it is the highlight of the movie.The soundtrack is interesting but I thought that was maybe a weak point since the earlier Halloween soundtracks were of high quality (Halloween 3 especially). The ending is quite stylish, depressing though. I liked it and I rate it the same as the first 2 Halloweens. Because honestly I enjoyed this movie a lot. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 January 2015","score":"","review":" Well as far as I can see, I am not a huge Halloween fan.
