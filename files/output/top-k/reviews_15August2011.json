[{"date":"15 August 2011","score":"","review":" This is one of the most fantastic yet emotional animated films I have ever seen. Warner Bros. did an amazing job with this the director Brad Bird who directed The Incredables he really knows what he is doing and the writer Tim McCanlies wow can he write a story. This is adapted from a book also called The Iron Giant to be honest no clue if this follows the book at all. So the story starts out with this little kid who is watching movies at night he hears a noise and well finds the Iron Giant and he saves him. This story is great because through out it this will show how the boy and the giant really care for one another.The Iron Giant only wants to be a super-hero like Superman but people in the 50's hell people now in days will freak out and the government will try and kill it and experiment on it. This brings a lot of heart to the story on one end it is a giant monster film yet on another end it is a story about an outcast who is just trying to figure out who he is.At the end of this movie you truly get to see how bad-ass the Iron Giant really is he could've been a unstoppable monster but since he has the boy he is the likable giant. This may not be everyone but this movie gets emotional at the end I teared up it has such a good ending beginning it is a must see. So if you haven't seen this movie because you think it is for kids you are wrong this is for everyone.

It's not made by a big name company but it is a good movie nonetheless.Danny is a cat who wants to make it big in Hollywood. He leaves his town of Kokomo, Indiana to head for big dreams. Once he gets to Hollywood he makes his debut in a film that mostly belongs to the cute but really evil Darla Dimple. Danny tests her patience by not saying his line but rather singing it. She is not happy and reminds him that he needs to know his place in the film as an animal.Danny is determined to make a name for himself and his friends Sawyer, Tilly, Cranston, Pudge and a few others. Sawyer a female cat tries to persuade him out of trying to have dreams because he is only an animal and they are treated differently and aren't given the bigger roles in films. After awhile he gets all his friends and the animals in Hollywood to realize that they are worth it. Darla doesn't like what she sees and decides that she is going to try and sabotage the animals from starring in any future films. She tells Danny that he needs to put on a show and make it big and loud. Danny however doesn't realize that it is a scam. Darla ruins their show and Danny and all the other animals get kicked out of the studios.Danny decides to head back home but after he is on a bus and sees Pudge being pushed around he comes up with a plan that helps his friends and the other animals to make it back into the filming industry. He makes it big for himself and wins back his support from his friends and ends up winning Sawyer's affection. Darla ends up being defeated and you see her having to put up movie posters at the very end of the credits. Cat's Don't Dance may not be big on special effects but it doesn't have to be.

Both mentioned movies are works of the same director; it's just that the latter was done 3 years prior. If one did take the time to watch I would believe there is a clear distinction in the improvement of direction and also choice of script as a director. Of course one may say that the director is hired by the producers, however the director does have freedom of choice. As clear as day Roman Polanski went from a good movie to a great one. I watched the good one!THE NINTH GATE is a movie engrossed in good choices. I reckon long hours of brain storming did go through at the higher ranks on the more intimate details of costuming, musical score and cast. Polanski has a method to his madness. Countless number of baby steps or else if I may say stepping stones. The introductory credits and the musical score set the ambiance and prepare you for something mysterious. I have to say it was not eerie but mystical. This mystical score continues quite well and rolls smoothly until it overflows at the end credits. The next wise creative decision would be the detailed books. They did for sure look like something that was dragged right out of an old vicarage. The base tones with the books were set in that instance. However I need to disagree with the high take library vault Balkan (Frank Langella) had made for himself. It somewhat compromised the authenticity of an antique book collector. Lastly Johnny Depps' costuming was simple and invigorating in terms of a book detective. With the long trench coat he was just as a normal detective with the only difference of specializing on books. Had he worn anything else, it would convince less.Apart from the obvious success story in the acting, which I will deliberately leave out, the fanciest selling point, the icing on top of the cake and the final cherry on top was the directorial approach. The movie although a thriller does not flow as fast as you would want it to. It's stretched; it's not dragged, it's stretched. When the actors tone down and stretch the suspense it keeps the viewer guessing. Is the puzzle in place or not? Do not misunderstand me there is flow; however the focus is not on the plot, but on all that leads to the event, instead of a long battle scene, we have long scenes of the soldiers getting into place and like a ten second battle.

Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), is an ex-army bank robber who's sent to New York City, which has been turned into a maximum security prison because of the startling rise in crime within the US. Once the President is captured within the walls of the facility, it is up to Snake to rescue him and return him to safety. As I said, the set-up is solid and intriguing. Unfortunately, I still have several problems with this movie. One major issue is that the acting doesn't nearly hold up to the potential of the premise. The actors don't convey true feelings of terror, even though they are faced with a dire situation. A major part of this problem is due to the god-awful script, which essentially consists of witty one-liners, cheesy emotion, and the attitude problem of a snarly teenager. I wasn't invested in the story because of this, nor did I have feelings for the characters, and didn't even care when anything happened to them . So the acting and script are unbearable. Another thing that really brings down the caliber of this movie is the special effects. Now I understand that this was a Summer Blockbuster in its time, and during the early 80's the amount of special effects in this movie must have been amazing. Even so, watching this movie about 30 years later is practically excruciating. The planes during the flight sequences are rarely shown, and when they are they truly look ridiculous. All of the explosions look just plain dumb in the dark and grainy way the film is shot, and don't bring any wow moments to the table. While I don't have much good to say about the film, I can say that John Carpenter's direction is as good as ever, and he really creates a spooky mood to go along with the sci-fi premise. He can also direct a good action sequence, and all the fighting that's done without the terrible special effects is good enough. Overall, this is a merely passable action classic, that ultimately fails due to the terrible script and performances, as well as FX that are laughable in this day and age. I honestly can't recommend it in the least, unless you're into low-quality special effects and stupid dialog, or you're just a child of the 80's looking for a good old sense of nostalgia.

Now, Voyager stars Bette Davis, Paul Henreid, and Claude Rains, in a dramatic picture that produced well deserved Oscar Nominations for both Bette Davis (leading role) and Gladys Cooper (supporting role). Although the film struggles slightly to grab the viewers attention at the beginning, or more so at the middle, the film definitely justifies that lapse as the film progresses. A truly wonderful film, including Max Steiner's musical notes, showing that everyone is absolutely beautiful in one way or another.As the picture opens, Bette Davis (Charlotte Vale) is under severe strain from her mother (played by Gladys Cooper), who controls everything she does, from what she reads, to what she wears. Ugly Charlotte keeps herself in solitude, and is at the point of a nervous breakdown when Dr. Jaquith (played by Claude Rains) is introduced to her by Lisa Vale (played by Ilka Chase). Dr. Jaquith insists on taking Charlotte to his sanitarium, where she undergoes dramatic change. She is completely transfigured from her shy, ugly self, into a beautiful, confident woman. She soon heads off to South America, where she meets and falls in love with already married Jerry Durance (played by Paul Henreid). The film starts to bog down slightly here, but soon picks up when Charlotte goes back home.Her mother soon dies from a heart attack during a slight argument with Charlotte, leaving Charlotte with the family's wealth. Charlotte, guilty that she caused her mother's death, goes back to Dr. Jaquith's sanitarium, where she meets Tina, Jerry's rejected daughter (Although Jerry loved Tina very much). The film continues, wonderfully ending with Bette Davis's memorable quoteOh, Jerry, don't let's ask for the moon. We have the stars. (Quote ranked #46 of all time by the AFI's 100 Years&#x85;100 Movie Quotes)I'll let you watch the film to see what happens with Charlotte and Jerry. ;)Although I can't say this is my favorite Bette Davis film (that goes to In This Our Life, I guess that's the suspense in me, which reminds me I haven't seen it in nearly 2 years) she most certainly gave an Oscar worthy performance. At the start of the film, her acting really shines as she plays the depressed Charlotte. Bette Davis probably deserves a lot more Oscars than she ever received. Paul Henreid's role may not have been as dramatic as Bette's, but carried out his acting in his usual, natural style.Claude Rains is, well Claude Rains. There is not one film that I can think of, that he didn't shine in. He played his role to perfection, being his usual joking, yet serious self. Definitely one of my favorite actors.Now, Voyager clearly has its placed among classic cinema. The only film I think of that is even slightly similar is Enchanted Cottage, which I was never quite able to get through. (oops, bad me). Now, Voyager is unique in its characterization of an ugly duckling turning into a swan, reminding us that everyone is gorgeous. I do recommend the film, especially for Bette fans.

I have seen better films than this. Namely, Midnight Express directed by Alan Parker.Maybe its just that Jack represents the ideal American Citizen, or he's just very, very lucky.Jack plays Randle Patrick McMurphy, a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Thus McMurphy, safe to say is truly deserving to be put in an asylum. Jack should've got a maximum of 15 years for this offense alone. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients. How on earth Fletcher won best Actress in Lead Role is beyond me. Her acting in this film is mediocre at best.McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; and Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent six-foot-seven Native American believed to be deaf and mute.DeVito looked so young back then, I hardly recognized him. The best of the pick is my favorite actor Christopher Lloyd. This guy is simply awesome in all the films he stars in.McMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat. He tells them You're not nuts, you're fishermen! and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination.Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely. Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone. During one of her group humiliation sessions, Cheswick's agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind up brawling with the orderlies. They are sent up to the shock shop for electroconvulsive therapy. While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs Thank you. McMurphy is delighted to find Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning illness, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the Etc only charged him up all the more and that the next woman to take him on will light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars.But the struggle with Ratched is taking its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night. They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers). McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and enjoys a bacchanalian rampage. At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls. McMurphy says goodbye to everyone, and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital&#x97;though he would like to date Candy in the future. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there, and Billy (and Candy) agree. They retire to a private room. The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.Nurse Ratched arrives the next morning and discovers the scene the ward completely upended and patients passed out all over the floor. She orders the attendants to lock the window, clean up, and conduct a head count. When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and, buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter. Nurse Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy's mother what he has done. Billy panics, his stutter returns, and he starts punching himself in the groin; locked in the doctor's office, he kills himself. McMurphy, enraged at Nurse Ratched, chokes her nearly to death until orderly Washington knocks him out.Some time later, the patients in the ward play cards and gamble for cigarettes as before, only now with Harding dealing and delivering a pale imitation of McMurphy's patter. Nurse Ratched, still recovering from the neck injury sustained during McMurphy's attack, wears a neck brace and speaks in a thin, reedy voice. The patients pass a whispered rumor that McMurphy dramatically escaped the hospital rather than being taken upstairs.Late that night, Chief Bromden sees McMurphy being escorted back to his bed, and initially believes that he has returned so they can escape together&#x97;which he is now ready to do since McMurphy has made him feel as big as a mountain. However, when he looks closely at McMurphy's unresponsive face, he is horrified to see lobotomy scars on his forehead. Unwilling to allow McMurphy to live in such a state&#x97;or be seen this way by the other patients&#x97;the Chief smothers McMurphy to death with his pillow. He then carries out McMurphy's escape plan by lifting the hydrotherapy console off the floor and hurling the massive fixture through a grated window, climbing through and running off into the distance.Verdict overall the novel is BETTER than the film. But for Jack Nicholson fans (like me) this is a must! I thought Jack's performance in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining was his best performance ever.

Billy panics, his stutter returns, and he starts punching himself in the groin; locked in the doctor's office, he kills himself.

However, when he looks closely at McMurphy's unresponsive face, he is horrified to see lobotomy scars on his forehead.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 August 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" How on earth this film won 5 academy awards is beyond me. I have seen better films than this. Namely, Midnight Express directed by Alan Parker.Maybe its just that Jack represents the ideal American Citizen, or he's just very, very lucky.Jack plays Randle Patrick McMurphy, a recidivist anti-authoritarian criminal serving a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl, is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation. Thus McMurphy, safe to say is truly deserving to be put in an asylum. Jack should've got a maximum of 15 years for this offense alone. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients. How on earth Fletcher won best Actress in Lead Role is beyond me. Her acting in this film is mediocre at best.McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader; his fellow patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, stuttering young man; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is belligerent and profane; and Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent six-foot-seven Native American believed to be deaf and mute.DeVito looked so young back then, I hardly recognized him. The best of the pick is my favorite actor Christopher Lloyd. This guy is simply awesome in all the films he stars in.McMurphy steals a hospital bus, herds his colleagues aboard, stops to pick up Candy (Marya Small), a party girl, and takes the group deep sea fishing on a commandeered boat. He tells them You're not nuts, you're fishermen! and they begin to feel faint stirrings of self-determination.Soon after, however, McMurphy learns that Ratched and the doctors have the power to keep him committed indefinitely. Sensing a rising tide of insurrection among the group, Ratched tightens her grip on everyone. During one of her group humiliation sessions, Cheswick's agitation boils over and he, McMurphy and the Chief wind up brawling with the orderlies. They are sent up to the shock shop for electroconvulsive therapy. While McMurphy and the Chief wait their turn, McMurphy offers Chief a piece of gum, and Chief murmurs Thank you. McMurphy is delighted to find Bromden is neither deaf nor mute, and stays silent to deflect attention. After the electroshock therapy, McMurphy shuffles back onto the ward feigning illness, before humorously animating his face and loudly greeting his fellow patients, assuring everyone that the Etc only charged him up all the more and that the next woman to take him on will light up like a pinball machine and pay off in silver dollars.But the struggle with Ratched is taking its toll, and with his release date no longer a certainty, McMurphy plans an escape. He phones Candy to bring her friend Rose (Louisa Moritz) and some booze to the hospital late one night. They enter through a window after McMurphy bribes the night orderly, Mr. Turkle (Scatman Crothers). McMurphy and Candy invite the patients into the day room for a party; the group breaks into the drug locker, puts on music, and enjoys a bacchanalian rampage. At the end of the night, McMurphy and Bromden prepare to climb out the window with the girls. McMurphy says goodbye to everyone, and invites an emotional Billy to escape with them; he declines, saying he is not yet ready to leave the hospital&#x97;though he would like to date Candy in the future. McMurphy insists Billy have sex with Candy right then and there, and Billy (and Candy) agree. They retire to a private room. The effects of the alcohol and pilfered medication take their toll on everyone, including McMurphy and the Chief, whose eyes slowly close in fatigue.Nurse Ratched arrives the next morning and discovers the scene the ward completely upended and patients passed out all over the floor. She orders the attendants to lock the window, clean up, and conduct a head count. When they find Billy and Candy, the other patients applaud and, buoyed, Billy speaks for the first time without a stutter. Nurse Ratched then announces that she will tell Billy's mother what he has done. Billy panics, his stutter returns, and he starts punching himself in the groin; locked in the doctor's office, he kills himself.

Before Sunrise is another one of Richard Linklater's experimental films where the dialogue and performances are the main focus and the usual filmic techniques (like multiple edits, shots and angles) are abandoned for a more free form and relaxing capture of what genuinely feels like a blossoming relationship.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are two strangers who meet on a eurorail heading towards Vienna. An argument between a German couple provides the excuse\/reason for Celine (Delpy) to sit adjacent to Jesse (Hawke). Jesse takes this opportunity to talk to Celine. They sit together and start a conversation where the spark of a budding relationship begins to form. When the train finally stops at Vienna, Jesse plans to get off whereas Celine is suppose to be heading on. Jesse decides to take a chance and invites Celine to spend a day in Vienna with him as he has no money for a hotel\/accommodation. They both feel like they could talk for hours and didn't want the conversation to stop so Celine gets off on the same stop and we follow them, getting to know one another on the streets of Vienna.For those of you expecting anything dramatic in terms of action or dialogue you are watching the wrong film. It's just goes on from one conversation to another. It's set at a very leisurely pace as the two of them walk the streets of Vienna where they discuss things that come to mind. One scene has them being tracked through the streets in one continual shot which is marvellous done as both leads talk so naturally it feels like we are listening in on a private conversation, though what they talk about is not at all pompous or overly intellectual but of amusing observations, anecdotes and quirky ideas (like reincarnation and monkeys!)There is one particular scene in the music store where they stand in a booth and listen to some music, quickly glancing at one another hoping for the other not to catch them looking. It's all too cute, touching and refreshingly genuine. A romantic tale where a boy meets girl and actually talk to one another from past experience, ideals and opinions on everything no matter how insignificant, or obscure. It's these little things that gives this film it's beauty and enjoyment. As their relationship unfolds it becomes more and more naturalistic and believable. Can two strangers meet and fall in love in one night? For those of you who hold some romantic notion\/ideal then the answer would be yes, but for those cynics out there, you will probably think this is all too convenient.Not a film which will be suited for those looking for something more than just two people discovering each others personality and a film where dialogue is the main driving force of the plot. The two leads are extremely likable and very easy on the eyes, with a completely believable and very genuine look at two people falling for one another and with the film finishing with both characters promising to come back and reconnect, the film is left for us to imagine whether their love can truly blossom such is the way of the spirit of the film, very invigorating, imaginative and joyful to watch.

It was well worth watching but a bit of a mixed bag for me. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"15 August 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Somehow, James L. Brooks manages to bring movies closer to the brink of reality than any other filmmaker without creating a total snooze fest on screen. Terms of Endearment tells a story of a mother-daughter relationship in strictly chronological fashion, but instead of a traditional plot arc, the plot ascends gradually up toward a conclusion with little spikes for memorable events along the way. What would surely be a pitfall for other writers and directors, Brooks maneuvers around deftly, drawing moving performances from his cast and painting complete and honest portraits of the main characters.The non-traditional plot structure gives Terms of Endearment a different sort of energy, one that relies less on a forward momentum and more on dissecting characters and relationships. Brooks lures us into drawing conclusions about the characters and then almost always proves us wrong. Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) comes out of the gate as an overbearing mother who manufactured a particular kind of relationship with her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger). Although she's hardly a wonderful woman, as the film progresses her other layers develop and suddenly we're looking at one of film's most impressively sculpted and dynamic characters, not the embodiment of the domineering matriarch as once expected. Equal credit belongs to MacLaine for selling it of course, which makes her Oscar win oh so worthy.Winger certainly deserves half that Oscar as was the sentiment of most at the 1984 Oscars. MacLaine's role has more sizzle, but the story mainly belongs to Emma. As a young woman who's always been emotionally responsible for her mother instead of the other way around, Emma has to be a bit psychologically imbalanced and Winger reflects that in her portrayal. She's sexually self-assured and fiercely self-sufficient, especially when it comes to taking care of her three children that pop up throughout the film's duration, but the negative impact shows in her relationship with her husband Flap (Jeff Daniels). She's prone to fits of jealous rage when she feels as if she's not the center of his universe.Both main characters find themselves in challenging situations with regards to love that make up a bulk of the conflict until things take a decidedly tough turn in the third act. Emma's doubts about her husbands fidelity lead her to stray from her marriage with a loan officer named Sam (John Lithgow). Her mother, on the other hand, has shut out men sexually for decades despite spurring their advances for want of attention, but she's intrigued by Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), the astronaut who lives next door and prefers younger women. Their unlikely relationship provides the comedy of the film, but it evolves into something meaningful by the end. Nicholson gives the type of performance he would later become famous for, but the novelty of it here understandably won him the Oscar.Terms of Endearment can't be called typical or easy; it hits you in the gut with an emotional reality check, one that's unannounced and maybe even unfair to the viewer. Rather than preach its outlook on life or take up other methods to soften the blow, it asks you embrace it without questions. Life can be (and often is) bad, maybe really bad, but there's a lot of good too; whether we accept it or not, hope floats.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"15 August 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Somehow, James L.

Beauty and the Beast is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, Beauty and the Beast is an animated Disney fairy tale, but it's an animated Disney fairy tale like no other. The film came out during a time that is often regarded in film history as the Disney Renaissance period, when the company was putting out top-of-the-line animated features that were of the highest degree of excellence after a nearly-30-year decline in quality, had stellar production values and animation, stellar star\/no-name voice talent, and the films were just of overall better quality than in times past. As a result, Disney was beginning to see critical acclaim and box office profits that at the time were unprecedented in the company's history, or animated-film history, for that matter.It supposedly began with The Little Mermaid (1989) and ended with Tarzan in 1999 (and I also don't want to forget about 1992's Aladdin or 1994's The Lion King; Beauty and the Beast is easily the best film from this time.Beauty and the Beast is of course an adaptation of the classic French fairy tale, and the animation screenplay here (ultimately penned by Linda Woolverton and co-directed by Gary Trousdale & Kirk Wise) is credited to no less than 11 writers. In the film, an unnamed and selfish young prince (Robby Benson) is transformed into a Beast by a beautiful young enchantress who had disguised herself as an old hag. This curse has not only transformed him into a monster closely resembling a humanoid lion, but it has affected his entire castle - turning it into a darkly ominous and Gothic house of horrors (that is obviously meant to match his inner turmoil, hatred, and contempt for the world) and turned his servants and everyone else in it into everyday household items like silverware, furniture, and other decorations.In the nearby town, Belle (Paige O'Hara), the town beauty who is regarded as somewhat of an oddball and a goof - due to her love of books and gaining knowledge (my kind of woman, personally!) - is growing tired of her assigned lot in life and wonders if there's anything better out there. Still, she is generally pleased with what she already has, living with her eccentric inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart). When Maurice leaves town to attend a nearby science exhibition, he gets lost and winds up at the Beast's castle. The angry Beast takes him prisoner, but agrees to let him go in exchange for letting Belle remain in his castle forever.Although Belle is initially repulsed by the Beast, not so much by his looks but by his violent temper, she gradually begins to warm up to him and his kindly staff who begin tending to her every need. Underneath his horrid exterior, she begins to see that he is indeed a kind and gentle soul, and a very lonely one at that, and predictably begins to fall in love with him and vice-versa. Meanwhile back in town, forces led by the town's ultra-vain hot-shot alpha-male, Gaston (Richard White), are conspiring to get Belle to marry him at any cost, while also masterminding the Beast's downfall.Beauty and the Beast is an extraordinary motion picture event, which had the distinction of being the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (that was until Pixar's Up in 2010). It was also one of the earliest pictures to make use of hand-drawn imagery that was seamless integrated with computer-generated special effects. To me, while I usually detest musicals and even though Beauty and the Beast has some musical numbers in it, by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, the songs don't slow the film down at all. In fact, they actually enhance the film by actually continuing to tell the story (and they are in fact pretty catchy, which is a rarity in films like this - I might actually go out and by the soundtrack pretty soon).Another aspect of the film that makes it so extraordinary is how dark it is, and also worth mentioning is the fleeting violence of the film's climax (which does include a slapstick showdown at the Beast's castle between the household staff and Gaston's goons, but I'm specifically referring to the climatic fight between the Beast and Gaston on the roof of his castle). And the Beast himself is actually quite scary, especially in the film's earliest moments. I'm quite surprised that Beauty and the Beast didn't receive at least a PG rating considering how dark this picture is, both in its subject matter and presentation. Notice how ugly and how drenched in darkness the Beast's castle is when the story begins. But the story is also about beauty, specifically the love of inner beauty. The film and Beast's castle begin to brighten up and come back to life once Belle arrives and begins falling for the Beast.It may be rated G, but it's still a mature-minded animated feature that doesn't play dumb to its audience and spoon-feed them crappy, sugar-coated moralistic messages about the true ugliness that is sometimes referred to as life.Beauty and the Beast is very easily one of my favorite Disney animated films, very easily one of my favorite animated films of all time, for sure.

If they dumb it down and keep it within the stereotypes maybe they think it's easier to go break even, who knows?

But anyway during the after texts i felt relief. 1.45 h of submarine command language can take its toll and be pretty indigestible.The only thing that prevents me from putting a solid 8 out of 10 for this effort from Tony Scott are the totally unnecessary racial remarks made by Hackmans character captain Ramsey at the end of the movie.

It turns out that Sullivan's Travels provided the inspiration for the Coen Brothers to produce their little gem, stating that their film is the one John L. Sullivan would have made after his series of misadventures came to an end.Besides having my personal Top Ten Best and Worst Movie Lists, I also have one I call 'Best Movies No One's Ever Heard Of. I think this one qualifies. I wound up searching it out after seeing it on the AFI list of Top 100 Movies from 2007. It starts out in the tradition of some of your best slapstick comedies, and in the final third takes a complete three sixty to thrust it's main character, portrayed by Joel McCRae, into a horribly untenable situation due to a case of mistaken identity.What I'm glad the picture stayed away from was taking it's two principal players and involving them in a romantic situation just because they were Joel McCrae and Veronica Lake. Even though there was some playful interplay between the two, I never got the impression that Sullivan was ever trying to take advantage of 'The Girl's' youth and inexperience. I would add naiveté as well, but Lake's character never really came across as naive, having been around the block in her quest to become an actress. This was an interesting role for Lake, a screen siren of the era who's better remembered for roles like Cora Smith in The Postman Always Rings Twice. I thought she cut the cutest tomboy figure dressed as a hobo, at the same time drawing viewer attention to the significant difference in height between herself and McCrae as they navigated the hobo jungles.Sullivan's 'come to Jesus' moment comes in a 'come to Jesus' setting when as a prisoner on a chain gang, he gets to watch a Disney cartoon at a Baptist revival gathering. The setting itself is a jarring juxtaposition of humanity, a poor black congregation offering their hospitality to a group of convicts whose only relief from brutal incarceration is the infrequent attendance at a local 'picture show'. Sullivan's observation and analysis brings him full circle to the quandary he was faced with at the start of the film, and is led to the conclusion that in difficult times, it's better to make people laugh. I don't know that I'd always agree with that, but for the purpose of this picture's message, it works pretty well.If you're intrigued by the hobo life as depicted in the middle part of this picture, I would direct you to the 1933 film Wild Boys of the Road. It's a grittier film that ST, while blending some hefty doses of grim reality with spirit and humanity. And don't forget to catch the real 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' I mentioned earlier, capturing the essence of what Sully Sullivan might have had in mind had he ever gotten around to it.

They just don't make them like this anymore.This is a true Gothic horror movie, the first of it's kind to come along in years and the last of it's kind for years to come afterward.Sleepy Hollow is a spooky and atmospheric Gothic horror story in the vein of Hammer Horror. The use of color and shadow with the bombastic and heavily haunting scoring of Danny Elfman certainly give it the feel of a Hammer horror period piece like Horror of Dracula or Frankenstein Created Woman. It's both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. Every scene is full of sublime, surreal visuals.This is a wonderful film that is part supernatural thriller and part murder mystery. It has a complexity to be appreciated. Unlike most recent horror films it does not condescend to the audience or make the viewer feel like a child or a half-wit. I was seventeen-years-old when Sleepy Hollow came out and I saw it in the theatre twice.A part of the story involving the ancient symbol of the pentacle caught me by surprise. Originally It seems the symbol is being used for evil. This bothered me because the symbol is, in reality, a symbol of ancient faith and protection representing the five elements of nature. Earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. Later though our protagonist is made to realize that the symbol was being used as a protection ward and this greatly relieved me and my fear of misuse of the symbol.Though this is not a faithful adaptation of Washington Irving's short story (which would be difficult to make into a full length feature) I actually feel this story is an improvement on the original incarnation. Ichabod Crane is a lot more relatable and likable in this version of the story. He is shy, geeky, awkward, and faints at least three times during the course of the movie. He is like a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Roddy McDowall's character from Hell House. Our nerdish hero is masterfully played by Johnny Depp. And the ending of the film is very satisfying.I strongly recommend this for anyone who loves Gothic Horror.
