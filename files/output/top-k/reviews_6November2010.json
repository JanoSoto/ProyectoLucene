Bringing Down the House for Martin and Norbit for Murphy) but they have also done some treasures(ie. Planes Trains and Automobiles and Beverly Hills Cop respectively). Bowfinger is one of the treasures, it is a truly wonderful and spot-on satire. And it does sadden me how underrated Bowfinger is. I personally felt it could have done with being longer, if that is a minor offering of a complaint, but everything else works. The dialogue constantly sparkles, it is funny and witty, and the story never fails to engage. The film looks great too, and the chemistry between the actors sizzles as does Frank Oz's direction. Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy both give wonderful performances(both men actually give a performance that is among their better ones) and are immensely engaging together while Heather Graham is also surprisingly good. In conclusion, wonderful and I think underrated. It is for me very funny and is effortlessly performed. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I will say right now, I do like Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, both have done some stinkers(ie.

It was not without sentiment and it was hardly original, but it was still beautifully filmed, well acted, charming and funny. This sequel is not as good as the first I agree, but I still quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, and there are some so-so parts in the script. Eugene Levy, who I do like by the way, is okay here but his character felt somewhat unnecessary and felt like he was there as an additional character and to give the film a longer length. And I also would have liked to have seen more of Kimberley Williams, she is so beautiful and quite a good actress, but I actually do agree that a little too much time is spent between Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. However, it is beautifully filmed, has a nice soundtrack, decent pacing and good direction. And the acting is fine too, Steve Martin and Diane Keaton are still very likable, and while as I've said I would have liked to have seen more of her Kimberley Williams was lovely. And I loved Martin Short here too, he was one of the main merits of the first film, so to see him in his wonderfully fluffy turn again was a very nice surprise.

The setting is an unidentified city and it takes place in modern day which is 1931 at the time of the film's release.The film starts out with Dr. Frankenstein (Clive) and his hunchback assistant Fritz at a cemetery. The two of them dig up a recently deceased corpse for Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, which is to create a man in the image of himself. If Frankenstein does this then he will be able to feel like God himself. Frankenstein and his assistant realize that the brain and the head of the stolen body are badly damaged so they are forced to steal a brain from Frankenstein's old teacher. When Fritz goes to steal the brain he breaks the jar containing normal brain so he takes the one that says abnormal instead. Then Dr. Frankenstein uses a machine he built that utilized a mysterious ray he discovered so the monster (Karloff) became alive...The screenplay for this film is one of the best of the horror genre. With a running time just short of seventy minutes I was doubtful the story would be strong enough for me to enjoy the film. I was pleasantly surprised though. Garrett Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh wrote the screenplay adapted from Mary Shelley's novel. Dr. Frankenstein and the monster were both very strong characters, I liked how savage and animal like the monster was and Frankenstein's obsession. All the supporting cast were pretty one dimensional though, but it did not stop the film from being great. The quote from Dr. Frankenstein It's alive will always be embedded in my brain now.James Whale's direction was superb which really surprised me. I find for most older films that the direction is always rather simple, but this had many complex shots. The one that comes to my mind first is the father entering town holding his daughter. The camera dollies with him and the audience is able to see everyone in the city looking at him. It was just a beautiful shot. The whole entire scene where the monster comes alive is excellent as well. As the unborn corpse rises to the sky and stays at the top for a few seconds then slowly comes down just kept me on the edge of my seat. And then when the monster's hand twitches slightly, just wonderful. The final scene that I loved was when the monster is playing with the little girl. It was so simple, and that is what made the scene so effective because the monster was so simple.Whale got a couple of great performances from his actors as well. Colin Clive gave a very effective performance as the obsessed Dr. Frankenstein. I could feel his passion and desire to create something so he too could feel like God. He absolutely shined in the scene where the monster came alive, if he did a poor job there the film may not be as legendarily well known as it is today. Mae Clarke did not do anything spectacular in her role as Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé. She basically just kept on telling Frankenstein to stop being crazy and come back home, she had a one layered character which is not her part. The thing with her performance though is I do not even remember her in the film that well because unlike Clive she did not put any passion into her performance. Now Boris Karloff made the film and character iconic. He played the role as the monster and played it perfectly, there was no way he or anyone else could have done it. The scene where he acts the best is the scene with the little girl, because he is trying to play with her, not be a monster and kill her. Just magnificent performance. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job, but no one really stood out or added much to the film.This film is a classic and will always be remembered as one of the greatest monster films ever. You won't scream or jump in your seat while watching this because even though it is horror it is more like an intriguing story about a killer monster which has to go in the genre of horror. It is just a fantastic film of obsession that leads to a new creature, that does not know right from wrong. The monster is just like a wild animal, it is just trying to protect itself.

The setting is an unidentified city and it takes place in modern day which is 1931 at the time of the film's release.The film starts out with Dr. Frankenstein (Clive) and his hunchback assistant Fritz at a cemetery. The two of them dig up a recently deceased corpse for Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, which is to create a man in the image of himself. If Frankenstein does this then he will be able to feel like God himself. Frankenstein and his assistant realize that the brain and the head of the stolen body are badly damaged so they are forced to steal a brain from Frankenstein's old teacher. When Fritz goes to steal the brain he breaks the jar containing normal brain so he takes the one that says abnormal instead. Then Dr. Frankenstein uses a machine he built that utilized a mysterious ray he discovered so the monster (Karloff) became alive...The screenplay for this film is one of the best of the horror genre. With a running time just short of seventy minutes I was doubtful the story would be strong enough for me to enjoy the film. I was pleasantly surprised though. Garrett Fort and Francis Edward Faragoh wrote the screenplay adapted from Mary Shelley's novel. Dr. Frankenstein and the monster were both very strong characters, I liked how savage and animal like the monster was and Frankenstein's obsession. All the supporting cast were pretty one dimensional though, but it did not stop the film from being great. The quote from Dr. Frankenstein It's alive will always be embedded in my brain now.James Whale's direction was superb which really surprised me. I find for most older films that the direction is always rather simple, but this had many complex shots. The one that comes to my mind first is the father entering town holding his daughter. The camera dollies with him and the audience is able to see everyone in the city looking at him. It was just a beautiful shot. The whole entire scene where the monster comes alive is excellent as well. As the unborn corpse rises to the sky and stays at the top for a few seconds then slowly comes down just kept me on the edge of my seat. And then when the monster's hand twitches slightly, just wonderful. The final scene that I loved was when the monster is playing with the little girl. It was so simple, and that is what made the scene so effective because the monster was so simple.Whale got a couple of great performances from his actors as well. Colin Clive gave a very effective performance as the obsessed Dr. Frankenstein. I could feel his passion and desire to create something so he too could feel like God. He absolutely shined in the scene where the monster came alive, if he did a poor job there the film may not be as legendarily well known as it is today. Mae Clarke did not do anything spectacular in her role as Dr. Frankenstein's fiancé. She basically just kept on telling Frankenstein to stop being crazy and come back home, she had a one layered character which is not her part. The thing with her performance though is I do not even remember her in the film that well because unlike Clive she did not put any passion into her performance. Now Boris Karloff made the film and character iconic. He played the role as the monster and played it perfectly, there was no way he or anyone else could have done it. The scene where he acts the best is the scene with the little girl, because he is trying to play with her, not be a monster and kill her. Just magnificent performance. The rest of the supporting cast did a fine job, but no one really stood out or added much to the film.This film is a classic and will always be remembered as one of the greatest monster films ever. You won't scream or jump in your seat while watching this because even though it is horror it is more like an intriguing story about a killer monster which has to go in the genre of horror. It is just a fantastic film of obsession that leads to a new creature, that does not know right from wrong. The monster is just like a wild animal, it is just trying to protect itself.

One of them is Kids and the other is Bully. The former is a haunting work of art; the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man, Larry Clark. I saw Bully first about a year ago and I was blown out of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.Then I happened to see the Siskel & Ebert review for his first movie Kids and after much deliberation, decided to give this controversial filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.In many respects, Kids and Bully are much the same movie. They're both frighteningly brutal, appalling in their explicit content and vulgar dialogue, and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger generations of today, especially in urban cities where parental control (or control of any kind) seems all but present. So why is Kids a great movie and Bully an awful one? Because while Bully only pretended to have a purpose, Kids *has* a purpose and it never once dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture, but it's also somewhat of a wake-up call. And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer and film-goer, I can forgive Mr. Clark.Kids is set in the drug-riddled streets of New York. We see very little of parents, or adults for that matter, and focus on a group of rambunctious, vulgarity-spitting, lecherous teenagers who are devoted to getting drunk, abusing drugs, and giving away their virginity. The most sickening of them is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick). Not because he can charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them, but because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV virus. One of his victims (Chloe Sevigny) discovers she has AIDS because of her one-night stand with him and as she slowly suffers, searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile, Telly is trying to seduce his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine, the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any apparent flow or structure, as if the behavior of his characters are not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable, as they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up with an obligating-style ending, but to choose a really haunting, crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong, visual-focused documentary approach with long takes from his camera swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays good attention to their surroundings, showing the conditions and lack of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp (Bully did not) his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly pornographic shots have a purpose as well.The content is oftentimes appalling, but it also has a purpose. This time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and sex in Bully, here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of underage sex are jaw-dropping. They do not turn on the audience; they appall. Furthermore, he does not flood the screen with images of naked teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with professional craftsmanship.Kids is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy, but I must confess that it is, to my mind, a truly great film. As I sat there watching it, I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted, but at the same time, I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick, a very young Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevingy, and the late Justin Pierce whose brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to avoid their paths of life and now looking at Kids, I am even more thankful that I did.

And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer and film-goer, I can forgive Mr. Clark.Kids is set in the drug-riddled streets of New York. We see very little of parents, or adults for that matter, and focus on a group of rambunctious, vulgarity-spitting, lecherous teenagers who are devoted to getting drunk, abusing drugs, and giving away their virginity. The most sickening of them is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick). Not because he can charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them, but because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV virus. One of his victims (Chloe Sevigny) discovers she has AIDS because of her one-night stand with him and as she slowly suffers, searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile, Telly is trying to seduce his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine, the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any apparent flow or structure, as if the behavior of his characters are not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable, as they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up with an obligating-style ending, but to choose a really haunting, crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong, visual-focused documentary approach with long takes from his camera swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays good attention to their surroundings, showing the conditions and lack of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp (Bully did not) his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly pornographic shots have a purpose as well.The content is oftentimes appalling, but it also has a purpose. This time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and sex in Bully, here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of underage sex are jaw-dropping. They do not turn on the audience; they appall. Furthermore, he does not flood the screen with images of naked teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with professional craftsmanship.Kids is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy, but I must confess that it is, to my mind, a truly great film. As I sat there watching it, I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted, but at the same time, I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick, a very young Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevingy, and the late Justin Pierce whose brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to avoid their paths of life and now looking at Kids, I am even more thankful that I did.

One of them is Kids and the other is Bully. The former is a haunting work of art; the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man, Larry Clark. I saw Bully first about a year ago and I was blown out of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.Then I happened to see the Siskel & Ebert review for his first movie Kids and after much deliberation, decided to give this controversial filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.In many respects, Kids and Bully are much the same movie. They're both frighteningly brutal, appalling in their explicit content and vulgar dialogue, and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger generations of today, especially in urban cities where parental control (or control of any kind) seems all but present. So why is Kids a great movie and Bully an awful one? Because while Bully only pretended to have a purpose, Kids *has* a purpose and it never once dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture, but it's also somewhat of a wake-up call.

Most also show widespread destruction or other horrors of war. The Sand Pebbles is somewhat like that. And, it is also like a few other great war genre movies in that it focuses deeply on the characters &#x96; the men and women who are the subjects of the film &#x96; and their relationships. At one point in the film, Frenchy (Richard Attenborough) tells Jake (Steve McQueen) that the men who serve on their gunboat are called the sand pebbles. The boat is not the title of the movie, but is the vehicle for the film. The San Pablo (Saint Paul), is a prize of the Spanish-American war a few years earlier, and is now one of the U.S. Navy patrol boats in Chinese waters. They are there to protect American commercial interests in China. One barroom brawl scene had an American civilian involved, but that was the only visual reference in the film as to why the San Pablo was in China in the first place. But, The Sand Pebbles is much more than a war movie. It fits in many other genres as well. It is a historical look at a time of great social change emerging in China &#x96; a land far away from the west that the world was just beginning to learn about (Some of the first photos of China were from National Geographic Magazine in the 1910s and 1920s). It is a look at a land with opposing political forces arising, with growing distrust and dislike of foreign exploiters. Its people are humble, respectful yet proud, and willing and able to learn new jobs of modern technology &#x96; like running the engines of a boat. The movie takes place at a time of relative peace between wars, when military life, especially in distant lands, seemed much more relaxed. And, the military itself, in its remoteness from home, took on a culture all its own. So, The Sand Pebbles is a film about men in the Navy during a time of uneasiness in a land far away from America. Some of this film is disconcerting and unpleasant in its portrayal of servicemen. A whole boat crew wanting to give up one of its own men to a riotous crowd, rather than fight to defend him and their boat. A feverish mob spurred on by communist zealots that gruesomely tortures and carves a man to near-death. A distraught sailor (McQueen) who shoots a young Chinese boy he had befriended and taught, to end his torture. A poorly disciplined Navy crew who were lax in their duties. A bunch of sailors, most of whom seemed to live for bawdy shore leaves, with little apparent care or kindness for others. The performances in this film are outstanding by all, especially Steve McQueen and Richard Crenna. In several scenes, we see drama in the faces of the two men, as though we could almost read their minds. In spite of the disagreements we hear in the dialog, we can see much more in their expressions. Neither likes the other person, but each has respect for the other. In a pinch, they can trust one another, perhaps more than anyone else on the boat. The film has wonderful scenes of the Far East (filmed in Taiwan and Hong Kong). I sailed on the Yangtze River in 2001, and the film's river scenes look much like places on the lower Yangtze yet today. The action and battle scenes late in the film are excellent and look so very real. There is more still &#x96; McQueen and the missionaries, and his slow transformation. And, of course, the tragedy of the ending. All in all, this is a solid, outstanding movie about a group of people, at a time in history, in a place far away, with a heart-wrenching story.

My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say I like\\don't like this movie but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

Newbies and those that forgot are updated, and we know who edited the film and other miscellaneous stuff that no-one pays attention to.We catch up with Blade in a 6 minute scene that effectively shows us everything that is cool about Blade, (and why he deserves better films than BladeTrinity).- Cool weapons and toys, including a muscle car. - Heavily stylised movements, violence and stunts. - Cheesy jokes and dry dialogue. - Cool karate moves and a no mercy approach to killing vamps. - The man wears his sunglasses at night! COME ON!At the end of the scene Blade saves Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who I would never picked as the guy who would say Like hammered sh*t and make it sound cool.So we're 10 minutes in, we know the primary guys and their background, now we can go into the Blade 2 plot. Mmmmmm, that's good movie-making.After a momentary digression to meet Josh, Blade's new assistant who calls himself Scud and called Blade B for some reason, Blade announces that he is giving Whistler some&#x85; stuff.Then the vampires drop by for a visit to tell Blade and crew about the latest threat to mankind, called Reapers. (But not before it is clearly evident by some very dodgy CGI work that not all the budget went to special effects.)After a brief chat the Blade posse hitch a ride to Vampire HQ for the exposition part of the film, where the next 90 minutes are nicely mapped out for us, allowing Blade to get to the serious business of killing various things.Blade is told all about the Reapers by head vampire Damaskinos - which in short are a threat to both vampire and human - he is introduced to his soldiers for the mission. They are called the Blood Pack and include the usual Gen X crew of tattooed, pierced muscle bound freaks, including the underrated Ron Perlman and the horribly under-utilised (in this film) Donnie Yen. There are three BIG scenes in the film. The first is the stakeout and search of the House of Pain, a vampire club. Coincidentally the best bit of Blade by far was also the scene in the vampire club, at least Blade 2 has several other scenes which are almost as good, which the original did not.I know I'm getting older now, but I still would think it a bit odd when 8 odd heavily armed and shirtless guys walk into a club unchecked, and no-one even bats (pun not intended) an eye.The scene is given time to play out, we witness all the kinks and quirks of the vampires in their natural habitat, and the tension builds once it is evident that Blade will face the Reapers for the first time.And when the Pack finally do meet the Reapers in the flesh, it still gives me tingles when the Woah moment arrives.In the first showdown between Blade and Nomak it appears that they are quite evenly matched, and that Nomak has had some karate lessons on the sly, we are given a taste of what might come, but ultimately it is left for later.The second BIG scene occurs when the Blood Pack and Blade venture into the tunnels to take on the Reapers in their home turf, even though it contains much of the action and killing in the movie it is simply a prelude for the even BIG-ger finale to come.The final BIG scene is the showdown that occurs at vampire HQ, and it has everything that a grown boy needs from his vampire flick torture, stylised violence, faceless henchmen that are really only fodder between boss fights, WWE Smackdown moves, blood-baths and of course SUNGLASSES!If you were underwhelmed by Blade, or can't be bothered with most comic book adaptations I would still urge you to check this out. Blade 2 isn't just Del Toro cutting his teeth, it is a really solid movie when considered on its merits. It stands head and shoulders above Blade and (especially) BladeTrinity, neither of which I own.The movie is violent, of course it is. But once you are able to get your head around the fact that Blade is simply butchering vampires and reapers, (none of which exist guys), all thoughts of how gratuitous it all is should vanish. This is the same with zombies really; vampires and zombies don't exist, and if they do they're already dead anyway, so killing them is perhaps a little redundant and therefore warranted.This movie is so stylised that I argued one day that it should almost be the first movie shot entirely in slo-mo, that honour eventually went to Zack Snyder's 300, which turned 80 minutes of action into a 2 hour flashy crawl.All in all I strongly recommend Blade 2, it obviously has good production values, with set design, costumes and even music that complements the action, and Del Toro knows when to build up to something, and then how to stage a big set piece.Final rating &#x96; 8.5 \/ 10. Up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best comic adaptations going. I've watched this 4 or 5 times now and it never gets old.
