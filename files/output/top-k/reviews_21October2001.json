Could they have moved at least SOMETHING in a passably convincing fashion?The answer is a deafening no.  The animation is even worse than the cleverly edited trailer let on.  The king's subjects move like mannequins with performers standing behind them, jerking the limbs - which may be fair enough, given PDI's evident shortage of skilled character animators, but when one of the central characters (Princess Fiona) moves in the same fashion, it's time to throw up one's hands in despair.  (Shrek and the Donkey are the best animated of the lot, but even they twitch their facial muscles like people pulling expressions out of a catalogue, even they gesture as though they're posing for photographs, and even they run as though they're trying not to get anywhere.)So how DID this come to be mistaken for good animation?  I think - but this is just a guess - that the public looks for two things in an animated film glossiness, and frame-by-frame detail.  All the surfaces in Shrek are finely detailed (in an ugly, repetitive, phoney kind of way), and the garishly clashing colours have all been brightly polished and coated with a hideously artificial plastic varnish ... and this, thinks the man in the street, must be what good animation is.  Rubbish.  Good animation involves convincing, expressive MOVEMENT, which makes Shrek the most thoroughly shoddy of the six (or seven, depending on how you count) computer-animated films that have so far been released.  Even apart from the poor animation the art direction is terrible.  Surfaces clash, colours clash, designs and styles and backgrounds clash.  Comic and dramatic timing is off.  And as if all this weren't bad enough, every single thing the animators have placed before our eyes is just god-damned UGLY.  It hurts to look at.  It really hurts.Not that the best art direction in the world could rescue this childish, spiteful, self-consciously flippant story.  Ten years ago the unexpected animated success of the year was Beauty and the Beast; the animated smash hit ten years later is but a shallow mockery of Beauty-and-the-Beast folktales, complete with fart jokes, and the kind of plot complications one normally sees in Sherwood Schwartz sitcoms.

I feel as though I've just been harangued by a comedian who thinks his jokes will become funny if he shouts them loud enough.  In reality I was haranged by two such comedians.  One is Mike Myers, who almost manages to pull off the gruff Scottish accent he's trying for; the other is Eddie Murphy, who seems to be under the delusion that the vocal performance he gave in Mulan will be just as funny a second time.  It was only funny the first time because Disney's animators were able to supply the humour.  The PDI animators aren't.The sad thing is we've voted for this kind of loud, vulgar rubbish with our wallets, and now we're going to get more and still more of it until one of us, and it will probably be me, goes insane.

But to enjoy Spielberg's masterful work it is best not to go and see it with any preconceived ideas. Its best to go with an open mind as this movie does not fit into a nice neat little box. It is not your average date movie or family movie. Its not how the trailers portray it either. It also does not come with much marketing hype although that is perhaps difficult to avoid when what you have  is a Steven Spielberg film on your hands. Nevertheless the marketing has been rather low key which is rather a pity because I am very afraid that this movie will disappear before alot of people get to see it where it should be seen and that is on the big screen and not on the smaller television one.The best way to describe this movie is with a whole list of adjectives. This film is awesome, magnificent, ahead of its time, chilling, detached, sad, disturbing, beautiful, unpredictable, wonderful, creepy, strange, hypnotic, dreamy, ambiguous and so you could go on. I must warn you I do not think its a movie to watch if you are lonely. David's epic journey in this film is a sad and lonely one. In fact the whole theme of loneliness is emphasised throughout the movie. The ending is both happy and sad and sort of leaves you with an empty feeling. Nor is it a movie to take the kids along to see. Even though the main character is a small boy this is not ET or any children's movie. It is very much a futuristic adult fairytale.When I went to see this movie the reaction from this movie was complete silence. This was the case even when people were walking out of the cinema. This is because its very hard to actually describe this movie which in no way must detract from the fact that it is a brilliant piece of moviemaking. I do not believe that this film will be justifiably appreciated right now but in 20 years time it will be the only film remembered from the year 2001. It deserves a whole host of oscar nominations.

Do his parents have a responsibility to nurture it, with or without the child's will, or should they just leave him alone?  In this case the genius is in chess; it could have easily been about math or music, and been as good a movie.  The point of the movie isn't about chess itself, but about promise and potential at an early age. The direction and script, however, smother the movie in grave solemnity; if you watch The Greatest Story Ever Told, about Christ's life, the characters do not speak with the grave tones and hushed solemness that they do when they speak of the boy's gift for chess.  The mother is especially annoying; every word she utters about her son, about anything, in fact, is delivered with a stone-faced stolidness and a Clint Eastwood whisper that would put even Dirty Harry to shame.  One wonders how she let her hair down long enough to conceive their child in the first place.

It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful. Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice', going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&P just before being cast in this role.Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem. She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role. Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.  When he finally gets a chance to interact he is very good in a stuffy sort of way that is right for his character.This is a delightfully wacky comedy with a fabulous performance by Rene Zellweger.

Because I loved the film so much, I didn't think either of its sequels could surpass it. However, I was wrong. The Godfather Part II contains some of the finest acting, direction, screenwriting and design that has ever been seen in film. To call this film spectacular is an understatement of near criminal proportions. This is a masterwork, and however varied Coppola's career has been since, II will always redeem him.Enough people have described the plot, so I won't go into that. Instead, I'll focus on the performances. De Niro is wonderful as young Vito Corleone. De Niro uses more facial communication than speech in the film, like Brando in I. In De Niro, we see a hungry young man who comes the the U.S. with anger and a desire for vengeance, and watch him evolve into a man who obtains the power to achieve it. Additionally, his character's arc provides the perfect contrast to Michael's. Young Vito is a man who builds ties with others, has good professional and personal relationships, and would never lose his family. The last shot of his character is a tender moment between father and son.As good as De Niro is, Pacino outshines him (and everyone else) in his part as Michael. In the last film, we saw a young man who gradually became caught in an undesired life. Here, we see him grow into that life, and what he does with the power he's attained. Pacino is brutal in this film. He commands the screen whenever on it, and his character's destruction of the family and enterprise his father worked hard to create is devastating. You feel for Michael, a man who is despicable and has lost the honor he had at the beginning of the first film, but who has also been caught in a world that he never could have avoided, much as he might have tried. As Michael becomes colder, harder and continues drawing his family's organization away from what it originally was, Pacino's character continues to become more sympathetic. Even his eyes communicate the change this character has gone through from the beginning of I to the end of II. It's a brilliantly played part, and it isn't surprising that Pacino hasn't been able to surpass it.

In De Niro, we see a hungry young man who comes the the U.S. with anger and a desire for vengeance, and watch him evolve into a man who obtains the power to achieve it. Additionally, his character's arc provides the perfect contrast to Michael's. Young Vito is a man who builds ties with others, has good professional and personal relationships, and would never lose his family. The last shot of his character is a tender moment between father and son.As good as De Niro is, Pacino outshines him (and everyone else) in his part as Michael. In the last film, we saw a young man who gradually became caught in an undesired life. Here, we see him grow into that life, and what he does with the power he's attained. Pacino is brutal in this film. He commands the screen whenever on it, and his character's destruction of the family and enterprise his father worked hard to create is devastating. You feel for Michael, a man who is despicable and has lost the honor he had at the beginning of the first film, but who has also been caught in a world that he never could have avoided, much as he might have tried.

But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be ridiculous.Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.

He was extremely well versed in literature and poetry, and this is itself, as well as its contribution to Doors' lyrics, should have been presented, and it clearly could have been done so effectively.  (Doors fans out there, you know about Jim's well-known to people like us challenge to pick up any literary book on his shelf and test him.)  And I certainly would not care if the result were a longer movie, rather than cuts in other scenes; I would remain riveted from start to finish to a 30-hour movie about the Doors.  Jim as the jerk is no-holds-barred throughout the film, but it is said that he could be intelligent and sensitive when he was not drunk, so why not make all this a first-half (or first-third) focus followed by a second-half degeneration?But a film's role is to entertain, and The Doors does not fall short, starting with a beyond-excellent acting performance by Val Kilmer as Jim.  There certainly was accuracy in what one SAW of Jim, if not a fully balanced character portrayal.  Looks, mannerisms, physiognomy, voice and inflection, lip syncing and singing, anything relevant to being convincing--they were all here and on an Oscar level, altho the film world would never have let that be.  Meg Ryan was more convincing in her role as Pam than she was in any other movie in which I have seen her.

Indeed I'm sure many of these people will be nominated for Oscars. And so they should be. However the plaudits should end there.Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it customary for a fictional film drama (whether musical or otherwise) to have a story and\/or some characters? MOULIN ROUGE's lame excuse for a story is in fact revealed in a Ewan McGregor voice-over in the first reel of the film. There are no twists, no surprises, no sub-plots...in short it is feebly, depressingly, almost mind-numbingly predictable from first minute to last. Characterization fares no better, with no hint of personality detectable in any of the protagonists (the Duke comes closest by at least being a caricature - MacGregor, Kidman, etc don't even get that).

It could not have chosen grander themes, and could not have made a more pitiful attempt at exploring them. In fact the film is so wretchedly written that at absolutely no point does it ever, even once, make a sincere effort to engage the audience on an emotional or intellectual level. Of course the renditions of 'Your Song' might have brought a tear to the eye to some, but if so then the credit is due entirely to Elton John, and no more due to Baz Luhrmann than it is to a radio DJ who plays it on Heart FM or whatever. The great musicals, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, TOP HAT and so on did actually bother with an involving and emotive screenplay between numbers. CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG had more of a script than this.MOULIN ROUGE is the product of someone being given a lot of money to make a big crowd-pleasing movie, and him making it without actually having anything whatsoever to say. To me a great cinematic spectacle comes from having an idea and building a film around it; not from hiring some big stars, spending the GDP of a small country on SFX, and then rather grudgingly putting a story and some characters in it as an afterthought.If you are attuned to its humour then I can see how this could be a fun movie to watch, but if you expect something more than an extended MTV video for your time and money, it's a wearying and ultimately rather insulting film. MOULIN ROUGE isn't - even for one second - about truth, beauty, freedom, or love. It's about making as much money as possible for the people behind it.

Visually it is certainly fantastic, and - assuming your taste is very much in the mainstream - it must have value in purely musical terms. But it is also a soulless and in my mind rather cynical film, and one that demonstrates contempt for many fundamentals of good cinema.The cinematographer, choreographer, special effects team and so on should all be congratulated for some dazzling work. Indeed I'm sure many of these people will be nominated for Oscars. And so they should be. However the plaudits should end there.Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't it customary for a fictional film drama (whether musical or otherwise) to have a story and\/or some characters? MOULIN ROUGE's lame excuse for a story is in fact revealed in a Ewan McGregor voice-over in the first reel of the film. There are no twists, no surprises, no sub-plots...in short it is feebly, depressingly, almost mind-numbingly predictable from first minute to last. Characterization fares no better, with no hint of personality detectable in any of the protagonists (the Duke comes closest by at least being a caricature - MacGregor, Kidman, etc don't even get that). This is truly one of the most lazily written films I have ever seen.Of course it could be quite reasonably argued that the very same criticism could be leveled at all sorts of films, and that is true enough. However MOULIN ROUGE has the breathtaking temerity to purport to be about truth, beauty, freedom, love. It could not have chosen grander themes, and could not have made a more pitiful attempt at exploring them. In fact the film is so wretchedly written that at absolutely no point does it ever, even once, make a sincere effort to engage the audience on an emotional or intellectual level.

And this is the thing that left me craving the most, since I think Luhrmann's nuts were really too big when he grabbed music from the 80's and put them in 1900. There are too many musical highlights, but if I could choose one that really touched me more than the others, it's gotta be the powerful Tango de Roxanne, which is as achieved as any masterpiece song we ever heard, and works also as a summit to all the movie.
