Jump forward 'Four Years Later' & Alexander has built a time machine which he uses to travel back to the night Emma was killed in order to save her but she is still killed, only a different way this time. Alexander realises whatever he does, however many times he goes back Emma will always end up dead one way or another & he yearns to know the answer why so he travels far into the future to discover the truth. However after having destroyed the moon two new races have evolved on Earth, the human like Eloi & the monstrous Morlock's that eat the Eloi. Alexander decides to stick around & save the Eloi.Directed by Simon Wells who is actually the great grandson of author H.G. Wells who wrote the original The Time Machine book on which the original The Time Machine (1960) film was based & it is in fact the 1960 film that producer John Logan's script is based upon here rather than Wells original literally source. While all three share the same basic story & ideas this remake adds the subplot about Alexander's fiancé Emma being killed & that's the reason he invents a time machine rather than just because he is clever & he can. The script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure & drama none of which really grabbed me or engaged me that much, sure there are a few pretty special effects, a few nice action scenes & the moment when Alexander's question is answered regarding why he can't save Emma is actually quite intelligent & makes sense it never really captured my imagination & I was never really moved by it either. The time travel aspects of The Time Machine feel very similar to Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1992) in the sense you can't change the past but at the same time the future is not set only The Time Machine isn't anywhere near as good a film as Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The character's are alright although I thought Guy Pearce just looked too young to be a brainy scientist capable of inventing a time machine & there's never any real explanation behind it's mechanics either as it's like one moment there's no time machine the next he has invented & made one & it works perfectly. I reckon the Back to the Future trilogy offer far more thrills, laughs, excitement & general entertainment value than The Time Machine ever does & while I will stop short of calling it a bad film since it moves along at a decent pace, tells a reasonable story & has it's moments I wouldn't call it brilliant or even particularly good. There is also a cheeky little reference to the book & original film which are both name-checked here.The benefit this modern version has over the original is the development of special effects & in particular CGI which leads to scenes of time rapidly passing around Alexander in his time machine complete with huge buildings being built, new ridges, canyons & mountains being formed & a elaborate pan back which ends up in space as we see passenger rockets orbiting the moon. The effects work is good, there are one or two moments that look a little below par but generally speaking the effects are good. I saw The Time Machine on telly & the station playing it badly pan and scanned it so the left & right edges of the frame were cut off the screen thus cutting off part of the year on Alexander's time machine dial so I actually didn't know what year he went to. Apparently director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming as Wells was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion' while the IMDb says that the time machine itself was the biggest & most expensive prop ever built for a film at that point which I find hard to believe & Guy Pearce broke a rib during a fight scene but like a trooper carried on.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 the production values are high with a lovingly recreated period New York & good effects work although amazingly The Time Machine was nominated for an Oscar for best make-up but lost out to Frida (2002). The acting is mixed, Jermey Irons puts in a good performance in a terrible make-up job that has him looking like a reject from a Lord of the Rings film while singer Samantha Mumba makes her big screen debut here & is simply terrible although Guy Pearce is quite good & fairly likable.The Time Machine isn't a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, just a somewhat unremarkable one that is watchable & passes an hour and a half but not much else.

Except a few art house films, In the Mood for Love was the first attempt. In romantic comedies, the stories are always the same, almost. Similar sense of humor, similar situations, similar tricks and a mediocre cinematography (and style) Remember, Definitely May be, Music and Lyrics, Made of Honor, Ghost Girlfriends from the Past, The Proposal etc. However, most audiences want to see such kind of movies and they find the movies like In the Mood for love dull and they don't enjoy also. Now, a lot of people go and see romantic comedies and they don't complain about anything. By the way, I haven^t seen any of the movies I wrote above, I just watched their trailers (I had to), but even this was torture to me which is another story. People accept that they are not artistic, but to me, they are not entertaining either, because the only purpose of these movies to make their audiences glad and not to make them say I want my money back. In romantic comedies, there are almost three kind of stories, just cast and director are different The first story is that there are two lovers. They argue each other because of something and they break up. Will they come together again? At the end, after some bad events, they realize that they love each other, so they get married or continue to live together. The second story is that there is a woman. She meets a man. At first, they do not like each other or she has a boyfriend even if love at first sight is the matter. However, they encounter a few times and start to fall in love with each other. At the end of the movie, they get married or live happily together. The third story is that two people meet because of their job or hobby, for example both are interested in sport or music. At the beginnings, they hate each other, because they dissent from many things. However, they don't know that they are made for each other. And there might be one more story. A man and a woman have to pretend to be lovers or husband and wife, but later it turns into reality, they fall in love with each other. In the world of these romantic comedies, people fall in love too easily. Almost all friendships turn into love. Wow! To me, this means to fool us, because it is absolutely unrealistic. That's why I love In the Mood for Love (but this is not only reason). It is a revolution in the romance genre. Two people meet, but they don't fall in love with each other. They start to like each other. At first, it is a platonic love, the man starts to fall in love with the woman, but the woman is not exactly. It seems that the script writers of romantic comedies hate this and I can guess the reason, they want more audience. In the film, these two people just talk each other or go out for dinner, never make love or even kiss. See? This is revolution. Mrs. Chan is not one of the women who always think about sex or shopping (The Sex and The City) Mr. Chow is different from the characters in the romantic comedies by far too, so very realistic. The rehearsal scene was one of the most touching and sad romantic scenes of all time. As said, this is quintessential cinema, especially music, one of the best musics and editing. For example, in the dinner scene, Mrs. Chan speaks and the camera shows her, Mr. Chow speaks, the camera shows him by sliding. And the final. It makes me petrified, extremely sad and touching. You don't want to look at the screen not to see Mr. Chow's situation. What a bad ending for the people who value typical romantic comedies that always conclude with marriage.

It was just a cool movie featuring swords, a cool boomerang, tigers dyed black, strange dudes who hug you to death and a very attractive Tonya Roberts. This movie is about a strange cult that sacrifices children and such to a god of some sort. The king of this land has been taken prisoner by this mad cult leader. Well the one that can put a stop to him is a man who has the ability to control animals with his thoughts, a man who befriends an eagle, a dyed tiger (I am guessing panthers are a bit to hard to tame), and a couple of stinky ferrets. He has a few adventures during this quest as he comes into contact with many others on the quest to save the king. The action is rather good for a movie of this type and the movie does not end in typical fashion as the cult leader is killed and there is still more movie left, usually the scene where the villain dies is the finale, but not here.

Rebecca and Suspicion were both set in Britain and starred British actors in the leading roles. Foreign Correspondent has an American star but deals with the war in Europe; it is essentially a wake-up call to Americans, urging them to abandon isolationism and join Britain in the fight against Nazism. Mr & Mrs Smith is an atypical romantic comedy, and Saboteur, a patriotic warning against Fifth Columnists, is very minor-league stuff.Shadow of a Doubt is set in Santa Rosa, California, here portrayed as the archetypal American small town where nothing ever happens. (One of the scriptwriters was Thornton Wilder of Our Town fame). It was something of a Hollywood convention to portray outwardly tranquil small towns as inwardly seething with hidden hatreds and passions, as in Kings Row made the previous year. Here, however, evil is something that comes into the town from outside. Charlie Oakley, a thirty-something bachelor, arrives in the town to stay with his married sister Emma Newton and her family. Unknown to them, however, Charlie is under suspicion of being the serial killer known as the Merry Widow Murderer who has killed several wealthy widows in the East, and two detectives have trailed him to California to keep him under surveillance.This is one of the minority of Hitchcock films which have a female protagonist and where the main male character is a villain. In this respect it has something in common with Hitchcock's later British film Stage Fright. In both films, also, a romance develops between the heroine and the detective investigating the villain's crimes. In Shadow of a Doubt the heroine is Charlie's teenage niece, Charlotte. (She was named after her uncle and is sometimes referred to by the family as  Charlie , but to avoid confusion I will refer to her by her full name). One of detectives informs Charlotte privately that her uncle is a suspect in the Merry Widow case; at first she cannot believe consider that her beloved uncle could be a murderer, but his increasingly odd behaviour begins to arouse her suspicion.Hitchcock counted this as one of his best films, but for me it never quite reaches the highest level. It is considerably better than the likes of Saboteur or Stage Fright, but would not rate it as highly as some of Hitchcock's British films such as The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes or American ones such as Rebecca or Strangers on a Train. The main reason is that there always seems to be a major plot hole at its centre. It is never satisfactorily explained why, after Uncle Charlie admits to Charlotte that he is indeed the killer, she agrees to help him by keeping his secret. The explanation that she gives is that she does not want to distress her mother, who idolises her brother, but it must surely have occurred to an intelligent young woman like Charlotte that if she keeps quiet and gives him time to escape there will always be a risk that he will kill again. (How distressed would Emma be if she were to discover not only that her brother is a murderer but also that her daughter could have prevented one of his crimes but failed to do so?) It is also not explained why the truth about Charlie does not come out after his death- he dies trying to push Charlotte from a moving train- or who the mysterious second suspect is whom the police are chasing in Maine. The romantic subplot between Charlotte and Detective Jack Graham always seems rather unnecessary. Yet there are compensations, especially a very fine performance from Joseph Cotten as Charlie, by turns either jovial or sinister. Yet even when he is at his most affable there is always a hidden undercurrent of menace; when Charlie reveals himself as the killer we have, in a sense, been prepared for this revelation. Charlie's crimes are motivated by a dark, pessimistic philosophy; he believes the world to be a cruel and brutal place and that this justifies his behaving in a cruel and brutal manner. The women he killed were, in his view, fat animals deserving of slaughter. (There are no direct references to the war in the film, but Charlie's contempt for human life recalls that of the Nazis, who often referred to Jews as animals or vermin).Indeed, there is a dark thread running throughout the film, which is why some have seen it as one of Hitchcock's films noirs, even though the Pleasantville-type small town is different to the normal urban noir setting. Like many Hitchcock thrillers it contains elements of humour, although often of a dark, unsettling kind. Charlotte's father Joe and his friend Herbert are keen crime buffs, eagerly discussing detective novels, unsolved murder cases or the best way to commit the perfect murder, all the time comically unaware of the real murder mystery unfolding under their noses.Strangest of all is the relationship between Charlotte and Charlie, who before Charlie reveals his secret are unusually close for uncle and niece, perhaps too close for comfort. Some have even seen hints of incest in this relationship. Hitchcock may have been suggesting hidden, deeper reasons for Charlotte's reluctance to inform the police about her uncle. Shadow of a Doubt is not Hitchcock's greatest film, but it is certainly one of his most disturbing. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2009","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Although it was the sixth film which Alfred Hitchcock made after his move to Hollywood, Shadow of a Doubt is his first major American thriller.

It is not a movie which takes side with men or takes side with women. In addition, White expresses that men make strong friendships together, women make strong relationships together, but it is a little bit trouble to make an unproblematic relationship with the opposite sex. Thank you Kieslowski. Even if there is love, men can be good husbands and women can be good wives, but understanding each other is more easy when it comes the same gender. White is not a film which focuses on just the story and the characters. The music was one of the most great and touching musics, one of the best film musics of all time. It tells many things such as revenge, desire, regret, being rid of loneliness, liven up or refresh and distraction. Remember the scene that Karol takes a gun, the thing he does is meaningless, at least for him. Lastly, also White has one of the most sad finals ever, I rewinded and watch it again and rewinded again to see a gleam of hope.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"11 December 2009","score":"18 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" The mafia-comedy hardly seems like a new idea in 2009, we've seen it done well (The Sopranos), done alright (Married to the Mob or Analyze This) and done badly (any number of films, The Godson for example) and it practically seems quite an established film subject, even a cliché one at this point. However, to fully understand Prizzi's Honor if you've seen some of the latter day mafia-comedies that followed it, you have to understand that at one point it was a novel idea to make a movie where mafia dons and hit men were comedic fodder.If you approach Prizzi's Honor expecting it to pick up where its successors left off, you're bound to be disappointed and will likely find it slow and its jokes stale. It's important to remember that this was the first major production to take the subject matter of The Godfather (high-level mafia families) and satirize it. It therefore must have seemed quite clever and groundbreaking in 1985 to lampoon the bizarre behaviors and concepts of honor that The Godfather and all its imitators had presented to us as reality. You really can't hold Prizzi's Honor accountable because so many others realized there was a satirical goldmine here and exploited it until the mafia-comedy film was as cliché as the mafia film, so when approaching this movie, I tried to remember nothing like this had really been done before.Prizzi's Honor opens with a wedding scene, which is probably a nod to The Godfather, but it is a very weak and plodding scene by any definition and especially in comparison to the masterpiece it emulates. From there it's mostly uphill though, as Nicholson's tremendous acting is just enough to suspend disbelief as his character, the son of a high ranking mafioso, has a wacky whirlwind romance with a dashing woman he meets at the wedding, only to discover she is mixed up in scamming his own mafia family and she's actually a hired killer just as he is, but that his love for her is so strong that her background doesn't matter. Dating the enemy becomes more and more of a tightrope walk and increasingly their genuine wedded bliss seems to be interrupted by their real world jobs, which would suggest they should see each other as a threat, and both of them typically deal with threats by homicide, leading to a quite funny problem that recurs throughout the film.The film is very quirky, since it's basically making up a new style of film there's a lot of imagination and the plot itself doesn't fall into any clichés.

It is a shocking look at the effects drugs can have on people and the same time it poses some interesting questions about the world we live in and the youth. It has a very original screenplay and one of the most stylish directions I have ever seen. It is a energetic, imaginative, and vibrant film and at the time it came out, it must have felt very unique. I really enjoyed it but had I seen this film in 1996 ( I was too young but I'm talking hypothetically ) this film would have made a much bigger impact in me (specially the visual aspect of it) and the reason why is because the director Danny Boyle, uses certain filming techniques, and certain effects that are truly mind-blowing and make for great scenes but, as of 2009, this techniques are now fairly common and have been used by several directors. And again, I think Trainspotting is great but had I not seen such films as Requiem For A Dream(2000) and Garden State(2004) just to name a few, I would definitely think more of this one. Anyway, the film balances extremely well, humorous moments with the more disturbing scenes, and always staying truth to itself. At times, the narrative isn't as focused as it should be but this is a minor flaw. Of all the actors two deserve being mentioned, first, Robert Carlyle who plays Begbie, one of the so called mates of Mark Renton, a very unlikable character but extremely well played by the actor, and second, Ewan Mcgregor who's terrific as the lead character, Renton, and delivers probably, the best performance of his career so far. The soundtrack is great as well and fits perfectly with the crazy and chaotic scenes of the film.

Not long after that, I saw the short animated Disney adaptation of the story. I remember both hearing the audio book and watching the Disney cartoon several times as a kid, it must have been in the early 90's, so I had been familiar with the story for years by the time this adaptation from Tim Burton was released in 1999. However, for some reason, it took me ten years to get around to watching the whole film (I saw just a bit of it years ago), even though I've seen every other Tim Burton film with Johnny Depp. I was expecting Sleepy Hollow to be a good movie, and my expectations may have been slightly surpassed! In 1799, there has recently been more than one mysterious murder in the American town of Sleepy Hollow, and the bodies of the victims have all been found with their heads missing! A police constable named Ichabod Crane is sent from New York City to investigate, and soon after arriving in Sleepy Hollow, he is told of the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian mercenary sent during the American Revolutionary War who was caught and beheaded with his own sword! It is believed that he is the one responsible for these murders, but Ichabod doesn't believe this, and begins his investigation believing the murderer is a man of flesh and blood. The constable is boarded in the home of the wealthy Van Tassels, and quickly falls in love with the family's daughter, Katrina. As he continues to investigate, he eventually sees the Headless Horseman himself, and learns that the story is true! One of the things that make this film great is Burton's dark visual style, added to the scenery, full of leafless trees. These visuals are amazing and really fit the haunting atmosphere of this horror movie! The acting here also helps the quality of the film, as Depp puts on a noteworthy performance in the lead role of Ichabod Crane, and the performances from a number of supporting cast members stand out as well, including Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster, who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow, and Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. For the vast majority of the film, there's a lot of tension, which makes most of it consistently entertaining and really keeps the adrenaline pumping! The haunting musical score adds to this. The first romance scene with Ichabod and Katrina is probably the weakest part, but after that, the scenes involving the relationship between those two characters aren't so bad, and don't hurt the film.I know this has obviously been said many times in the past ten years, but Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow does take liberties with the story. Long before sitting down to watch the whole movie, I knew they changed Ichabod's profession from schoolmaster to police constable, and now that I've watched it, I realize there are more differences than that, from what I remember about the story (which certainly isn't everything). However, I'm not complaining. Since the movie is so entertaining, I really don't think it matters how much it follows the source material! Now, unlike some versions of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, this one is not for kids, which I'm sure one would assume with the R rating. But for adult viewers who like horror movies and admire creative filmmakers like Burton, watching this 1999 box office hit could easily be a hauntingly entertaining experience, and not likely a film one could easily forget!

Oddly enough, my top ten favourites do not include a single Tarantino-directed movie - I honestly wonder if all his writing would be this good with a competent director, like Scott, or if the uncredited Avary's influence was what made this particular movie stand out for me.The story is nothing new or original. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. S*** happens. It's almost a traditional yarn, but so lovingly spun that it deserves to be a classic. It's not life-changing genius. It's not world-shaping art. It's never going to be the subject of a classical literature degree... but it *is* engrossing, entertaining, enjoyable, and honestly, utterly, undeniably romantic.The cast is brilliant, and expertly placed to shine in their respective roles. Almost every line is quotable and no scene is wasted. Sure, the dialogue is recognisably Tarantino, but it's just not the same winding monotony that taints the interplay in his own directing ventures - it flows well and doesn't get in the way of real acting.

The most harrowing moments in this movie involve the least gun-play, deriving their impact from strong performances and believable pain or sacrifice. Despite some tried-and-true Hollywood-style action too, there is an appreciable element of reality and plausibility that makes suspension of disbelief an effortless endeavour.This movie has compelling characterisation, perfect pace, well-directed dialogue, an appropriate measure of action, and characters you can really root-for... not to mention that this cynical critic can't watch it without almost (not quite, but almost) getting all weepy.If you're a Tarantino fan and you haven't watched this, you may be neglecting his best work.

I watched this film for the first time when I was a single digit in age, and now I'm 19 and can still clearly remember how much it inspired me, and still does inspire me.FernGully is a children's movie - with a very real, very serious issue not at all portrayed subtly. And I think that's what makes this movie so brilliant. As a child, I watched this film and then thought about it once it had finished. And then I thought some more. No matter that Krysta and Pips and the other fairy folk didn't actually exist, I came to realise that there really were rainforest's being destroyed in my world. That Hexus was portraying very real threats to nature and wildlife - the song he sings during the course of the film mentions some of this - oil, cyanide, poisons and toxic fumes. Towards the end of the film, he's almost frightening - a burning skeleton of smoke and fire, looking very hellish and evil. But it's essential. The fact that Hexus never actually dies sends a clear message - there is no ending. 'Hexus' (toxic waste and the like) could still destroy our planet. His role makes you appreciate that the threat he stands for is so normal for us, and yet spells the end for the world we don't really think about - the deepest rainforest's.Of course, this film also includes many laughs that will keep kids entertained. The character of Batty Koda, voiced by Robin Williams (always a hoot), was a fantastic addition. I laughed when I was a kid, and I even laugh now. Yet, even Batty has a darker side to his character. I've read some comments here stating that Batty 'had rabies or something'. This isn't the case at all. Batty is how he is because of Humans. The Batty Song - youtube it. It's the craziest part of the film, yet probably one of the most serious. Batty was a subject of science experiments, so he's totally messed up. He's a lovable character, and it's the humans he's scared of, the humans who damaged him. At the start of the film, the fairy's see 'the Humans' as this wonderful race who assisted them in the growth and protection of their home - yet they come to see that wasn't the case at all. Humans have lost touch with nature, and Zach, our hero of the story, goes through the process of realising what his race has become.I'm aware I've rambled a lot here, but this was a movie that really touched me, and I just hope that children nowadays can overlook the dated cartoon style and really see the messages behind the story.

I watched this film for the first time when I was a single digit in age, and now I'm 19 and can still clearly remember how much it inspired me, and still does inspire me.FernGully is a children's movie - with a very real, very serious issue not at all portrayed subtly. And I think that's what makes this movie so brilliant. As a child, I watched this film and then thought about it once it had finished. And then I thought some more. No matter that Krysta and Pips and the other fairy folk didn't actually exist, I came to realise that there really were rainforest's being destroyed in my world. That Hexus was portraying very real threats to nature and wildlife - the song he sings during the course of the film mentions some of this - oil, cyanide, poisons and toxic fumes. Towards the end of the film, he's almost frightening - a burning skeleton of smoke and fire, looking very hellish and evil. But it's essential. The fact that Hexus never actually dies sends a clear message - there is no ending. 'Hexus' (toxic waste and the like) could still destroy our planet. His role makes you appreciate that the threat he stands for is so normal for us, and yet spells the end for the world we don't really think about - the deepest rainforest's.Of course, this film also includes many laughs that will keep kids entertained. The character of Batty Koda, voiced by Robin Williams (always a hoot), was a fantastic addition. I laughed when I was a kid, and I even laugh now. Yet, even Batty has a darker side to his character. I've read some comments here stating that Batty 'had rabies or something'. This isn't the case at all. Batty is how he is because of Humans. The Batty Song - youtube it. It's the craziest part of the film, yet probably one of the most serious. Batty was a subject of science experiments, so he's totally messed up. He's a lovable character, and it's the humans he's scared of, the humans who damaged him. At the start of the film, the fairy's see 'the Humans' as this wonderful race who assisted them in the growth and protection of their home - yet they come to see that wasn't the case at all. Humans have lost touch with nature, and Zach, our hero of the story, goes through the process of realising what his race has become.I'm aware I've rambled a lot here, but this was a movie that really touched me, and I just hope that children nowadays can overlook the dated cartoon style and really see the messages behind the story.

I feel this was more of an experiment than anything else, sort of saying let's see what we can do, almost like Fantasia was in 1940. It is still a visual treat for the eyes and I can't wait to see it in Bluray. The movie has an eerie look and feel to it and though most of it is just overlays of humans on a backdrop it still works in it's sharp coldness. The live action parts are pretty straight forward fare, the acting is good with Tron himself being the best part. Cindy Morgan (who was delicious in Caddyshack) is just lovely here but this is sadly her last film lead.All in all a fun time.

Reviewers made frequent reference to his status as a silent film great, but I paid no mind. To me, silent films were Chaplin, and Chaplin leaves me cold. And thus, in my mind, silent film buffs were arty snots who feigned interest in quaint old things to show how sophisticated they were. Nobody, I thought, could really like that stuff.But I joined Netflix, and their little recommendation system suggested The General. The picture of Buster Keaton atop a locomotive promised some action. The guy had been funny in Forum. I could stream it, effectively for free, as a bonus while awaiting my next DVD. What did I have to lose?Aside from my preconceptions, that is.Within fifteen seconds I totally forgot that I was watching one of those classic silent films. I was totally engrossed in letting Buster tell me a story. And as the film progressed, I moved from rapt interest to amusement to amazement to -- well, to something akin to falling in love. I would never see silent film -- or, of course, silent film buffs -- the same way again.Keaton's Johnnie Gray is an earnest, conscientious, courteous little fellow who gets undeservedly emasculated He's rejected by the Confederate army (because he's more valuable on the railroad), and by his girl and her family. And it is in Johnie's low moment that we first see how Keaton handles his films a death-defying stunt, in which Buster rides the connecting rod of an antique narrow-gauge locomotive -- isn't played as a stunt. It's played as subtle, poignant humor, with Johnnie's beloved General comforting him by rocking him gently like a mother rocking her baby.A year later, a sad and forsaken Johnnie still tends his train. His girl, Annabelle Lee, is about to board, heading off to tend to her wounded father. She still loves Johnnie -- else why would she go to the trouble of taunting him with her brother's war ribbons while pretending to ignore him? Johnnie, silent and subdued, watches with his haunted eyes.But Union spies steal Johnny's beloved General -- with Annabelle Lee aboard. Johnnie takes off in pursuit, undaunted by any obstacle. He wins our admiration and sympathy not because he's asking for them; he's too busy recovering his train, his girl, and his honor. He wins us over because he's who he is brave, resourceful, and dogged in pursuit of his goal.The things he does in that pursuit take your breath away. Suffice it to say he gets hold of another train, and does things aboard as it speeds along, as nonchalantly as you might reach for a light switch. A moment that stands out for me -- neglected by other commentators -- finds Buster casually riding along on the cowcatcher, picking splinters out of his hands, until he notices an uncoupled boxcar hindering his progress. How he deals with the recalcitrant boxcar has to be seen to be appreciated. And there are countless such moments throughout this gem of a film.As the chase transitions, with Union officers chasing Johnnie as he heads home with his prizes, we begin to see why Johnnie loves Annabelle Lee. She's out of her element, but proves brave and resourceful and eager to help, for all her foolish moments. She never apologizes to Johnnie for misjudging him, but he never asks her to. She simply recognizes him at last for who he was all along, and shares his joy when the Confederate Army does the same.If you've never seen a silent film, or seen others but wondered what all the fuss is about, take a chance on Keaton. And you can't do better than The General. You may find yourself becoming one of the inexplicable silent film buffs.

Plus, Jack and Joan make the decision to seek out the priceless stone, using is as a bargaining chip(..or so they plan, but of course other factors prevent this from going as smoothly as they'd like).Essentially, the movie is about two people falling hard for each other as they move through Columbian jungles, fleeing gunfire and certain death.

Romancing the Stone is popcorn fodder that goes down nicely and doesn't hurt. This was a wonderful period for Kathleen Turner, she was sexy and had a presence many actresses could die for.

My friend immediately suggested this movie, which I had never heard of. All of our other classmates immediately picked AnchormanThe Legend of Ron Burgundy. After watching this movie, Ron Burgundy needs to bow before Howard Beale, The Original Anchorman. Even though this movie was made 33 years ago, its relevance to today's cutthroat broadcasting system is really eerie.Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar-winning screenplay was seeing the future with the most disturbing clarity. The acting was superb by all of the cast(even though I did note the abnormal shouting matches throughout the movie, ha), it was riveting to see a network and its reporters go mad with ratings and lose their humanity in order to be the #1 show on television, even if it meant killing off one of their own.Howard Beale (Peter Finch) is an aging TV anchorman for UBS who is fired, effective in two weeks, after his ratings have been steadily deteriorating. He reacts to this by sensationally announcing on live television his intent to commit suicide on air. In doing so, Beale becomes a major TV icon and one of the most valuable assets to the Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the company that is gradually taking control of UBS. As a result he is given his own show as 'the mad prophet of the air-waves'. He appears live on television every week-day evening to tell the real truth to the people of America. The program is a huge success but Beale uses his power to make startling revelations about CCA, leaving the company executives with a serious problem. Beale ultimately ends up going too far with his tirades upon discovering that the conglomerate that owns UBS will be bought out by an even larger Saudi Arabian conglomerate. Beale launches an on-screen tirade against the two corporations, encouraging the audience to telegram the White House with the message, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this any more! in the hopes of stopping the merger. This throws the network into a state of panic due to the company's various debts making the merger necessary in order for it to survive. The execs want Beale off the air in order to salvage what the network, but the chairman of UBS wants to keep him on. The execs realize that the only way that they can get of Beale is by assassinating him on the air.Wow, what a movie. The acting and directing of this film definitely made my Mass Communications project a memorable one. Not to mention I now know what AFI's #19 Most Memorable Quote is now from.

This agile, amusing oater about two notorious outlaws who roamed the great Northwest robbing banks and trains is not your ordinary, conventional horse opera. Scenarist William Goldman and director George Roy Hill changed all the rules. For example, unlike most outlaw sagas, the eponymous heroes are never shown dying on screen because there is some dispute about where they died. Instead, the film ends on a freeze-frame of them charging into the open with their revolvers drawn. Mind you, this 1969 Oscar nominee for Best Picture is still a status quo western because our affable heroes are still punished for their misdeeds, but Butch and Sundance were not murderous felons prone to blowing the heads off their adversaries. In fact, Butch does not shoot anybody until the duo wind up in Bolivia. There is neither a bad scene nor a bad performance in this post-modern exercise in frontier banditry. Paul Newman and Robert Redford generated so much chemistry here that the played grifter buddies in another epic The Sting, and it did will Best Picture. Ace lenser Conrad Hall who photographed The Professionals and Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here makes the old west look truly nostalgic. The bickering banter between our two heroes is absolutely hilarious in this comedy\/adventure epic.The action opens as Butch (Paul Newman of The Left-Handed Gun) is scouting a bank to rob and learns that they have installed new, state-of-the-art equipment to protect the bank from outlaws. That is a small price to pay for beauty, Butch remarks and heads back over to the saloon where his sidekick, Sundance (Robert Redford of The Way We Were)is playing poker. He wins another hand and the dealer accuses him of cheating. Butch urges Sundance to leave things as they are because he--Sundance--is getting over the hill. Quietly, Sundance refuses, and the dealer challenges him to a shoot-out. The dealer (none other than Sam Elliot) overhears Butch tell his partner, I cannot help you now, Sundance. The dealer suddenly changes his mind. However, before Sundance is willing to leave, he compels the dealer to ask them to stick around. Why don't you stick around, the frightened dealer asks. Nah, we gotta go, Butch replies. Before Sundance exits the saloon, he whirls and blows the gunbelt off the dealer and fires more bullets that send the gun belt skidding across the floor.Our heroes ride back to their remote hang-out, Hole-in-the-Wall, where they learn the Harvey (Ted Lynch of the original Adams Family) has decided to take over the gang since Butch is rarely around. Butch defends himself by noting that he has to do research to rob banks and trains. The gang informs him that they intend to hit the train both coming and going, but Harvey challenges Butch for leadership of the gang in a knife fight. What about the rules, Harvey? Harvey blinks at Butch, Rules?! In a knife-fight? Butch kicks Harvey in the genitals and cold-cocks him with a blow to the head. Actually, Butch likes the plan and they hit the railroad both times. The second time that they strike, they have to festoon the safe with more dynamite that necessary. The explosion destroys the boxcar, shatters the safe, and sends dollar bills floating like confetti. About that time, a second train arrives and a posse of sharpshooting gunmen descend on them. They wipe out the entire gang and chase our heroes to an isolated cliff and Butch and Sundance have to take a high plunge into a river.After this fiasco, Butch learns from schoolmarm Etta Place (Katherine Ross of The Graduate) that Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad has launched a manhunt to bring them in dead. Our heroes decide to relocate to South America where the pickings are easier. They have several musical interludes and we hear B.J. Thomas sing the immortal song Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head while Butch rides a bicycle--the symbol of a new age--and narrowly escapes being gored by a bull. In South America, they prosper until the army comes after them. Eventually, they go straight and work as bodyguards for a mine owner (Strother Martin), but Bolivian bandits rob them and our heroes shoot it out with them.This is an immensely enjoyable western that even women should love.
